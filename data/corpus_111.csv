Market Overview:

Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is natural gas (predominantly methane, CH4) that has been converted temporarily to liquid form for ease of storage or transport by cooling it to approximately -162 °C. LNG takes up about 1/600th the volume of natural gas in the gaseous state.

This process makes LNG economical to transport over long distances where pipelines do not exist or are not viable options. Major end uses of LNG include power generation, industrial sectors, commercial sectors, and residential sectors.

Market Dynamics:

Growing demand for clean energy is driving significant growth of the liquefied natural gas market. Countries around the world are increasingly turning to LNG as a cleaner alternative fuel compared to other fossil fuels such as coal and oil.

LNG burns much cleaner than these other fuels and produces fewer carbon emissions when combusted. Another key driver is the increasing trade of liquefied natural gas across borders via ocean-faring transport tankers.

As global energy demand rises among both developing and developed countries, LNG is facilitating international energy trade between gas-producing and gas-importing regions through seaborne shipments. This rising cross-border LNG trade is propelling market growth over the forecast period.

Liquid Natural Gas Market Growth Driven By Increasing Demand for Environment-friendly Fuel and Growing Importance of Natural Gas as a Transition Fuel

The liquefied natural gas market has been witnessing significant growth over the past few years primarily driven by the increasing demand for cleaner and more environment-friendly fuels. Natural gas produces far fewer emissions than coal or oil when burned which has led many countries and industries to switch from coal and oil to natural gas.

In particular, the power generation and transportation sectors are increasingly adopting natural gas to reduce their carbon footprint. Many nations have announced plans to replace aging coal-fired power plants with modern and highly efficient natural gas power plants.

On the other hand, the marine and road transportation sectors are also witnessing rising adoption of LNG as a fuel. Countries are promoting the use of LNG-powered trucks and ships due to their much lower emissions.

Additionally, natural gas is viewed as an important transition fuel that can help reduce dependence on coal and bridge the gap until renewable energy sources become more affordable and reliable on a larger scale. Many believe natural gas has a key role to play in the global transition to net-zero emissions.

Growing Focus on Diversifying Supply Sources Acts as a Key Restrain for the Liquefied Natural Gas Market

The liquefied natural gas market faces some challenges pertaining to dependence on a limited number of supplier countries and regions. For example, countries in Asia which account for the bulk of LNG imports currently source the majority of their supplies from the Middle East and other western nations.

However, rising geo-political tensions and supply disruptions have increased concerns about relying too heavily on any one region. This is forcing several LNG importers to diversify their supply sources and reduce over-dependence on key suppliers which may act as a potential bottleneck.

Developing domestic natural gas production and imports from alternate regions can help alleviate such supply security issues over the long run. Resource nationalism of key supplier nations is another factor that acts as a restrain for the LNG market.

Dependence on unstable regions also increases price and supply risks. Reducing concentration of imports from only a few nations will be critical to overcome these restrains.

After years of economic crisis, hyperinflation, mismanagement and sanctions, many foreign companies quit the country. PDVSA has been working to attract new foreign partners to revive oil production, increase revenue and reduce debt.

The Jindal-PDVSA deal was reached in Caracas in mid-April, hours before the US announced the imminent reimposition of sanctions. Jindal has submitted an application for US Treasury Department permission to operate in Venezuela, one of the people said, which could be necessary after May 31 to avoid breaching US restrictions.

The Petrocedeno venture was among the top producers in Venezuela by the mid-2000s, with a 400-square- kilometer (155-square-mile) field and an oil upgrader with processing capacity of 190,000 barrels a day.",finance.yahoo.com,news,Yahoo!

These discoveries have ignited ambitions to expedite the nation's journey toward being a significant oil producer marking an important moment in its energy landscape.

Recent reports have also emerged that OPEC+ is considering Namibia for potential membership. This move comes as Namibia emerges as a promising player in the oil industry, with the potential to become Africa's fourth-largest oil producer by the next decade.

Earlier this month, Portuguese oil company Galp Energia announced the completion of the first exploration phase in the Mopane field off the coast of Namibia, estimating the site could contain at least 10 billion barrels of oil. Galp conducted testing operations at the Mopane-1X well in January and the Mopane-2X well in March. The company reported discovering significant light oil columns in high-quality reservoir sands in both wells, which are 8 kilometres apart.

Galp holds an 80% stake in Petroleum Exploration Licence 83 (PEL 83), which spans nearly 10,000 square kilometers in the Orange Basin. The nation has the potential to become a new revenue stream for Galp, which already has substantial investments off the coast of Brazil and is involved in a natural gas project in Mozambique's Rovuma basin.

Exxon Mobil Corp. and Shell Plc are among the energy giants evaluating bids for a stake in Galp Energia SGPS SA's major oil field offshore Namibia, according to sources familiar with the matter. TotalEnergies SE and Equinor ASA are also considering acquiring the 40% stake that Galp is looking to sell in the Mopane discovery.

Based on Galp's recent estimates of 10 billion barrels of oil equivalent in the Mopane complex, the entire discovery could be valued at around $20 billion or more, according to reports.

Namibia's national oil company, NAMCOR, has entered into a significant development agreement with Chevron Namibia Exploration Ltd, a subsidiary of Chevron.

Under the terms of the agreement, Chevron will acquire an 80% operating working interest in an offshore block in the Walvis Basin, a promising new frontier with the potential for massive undiscovered resources.

NAMCOR and Custos Energy will each retain a 10% interest in Petroleum Exploration License 82 (PEL 82). Chevron is also the operator of another offshore block in Namibia's prolific Orange Basin and plans to drill an exploration well there later this year.

NAMCOR's interim managing director expressed optimism about the partnership, seeing it as a positive step for the country's oil and gas sector and its contribution to the country's energy landscape.

In February 2024, TotalEnergies announced a significant light oil discovery with associated gas at the Venus prospect, located in block 2913B in the Orange Basin, offshore southern Namibia.

The Venus 1-X well encountered approximately 84 meters of net oil pay in a high-quality Lower Cretaceous reservoir. This discovery and the promising initial results highlight the potential of this play in the Orange Basin, where TotalEnergies holds a substantial position in both Namibia and South Africa.

Block 2913B spans approximately 8,215 km² in deep offshore Namibia. TotalEnergies operates the block with a 40% working interest, in partnership with QatarEnergy (30%), Impact Oil and Gas (20%), and NAMCOR (10%).

TotalEnergies aims to sanction the first phase of its massive Venus project by late 2025, with a production target of up to 180,000 barrels per day.

The Venus project is estimated to contain approximately 2 billion barrels of recoverable oil. TotalEnergies Chief Executive Patrick Pouyanne also indicated that the development will be executed in phases, necessitating multiple floating production, storage, and offloading vessels.

Energy technology company Baker Hughes announced earlier this month that it will construct a new liquid mud plant and a separate assembly, maintenance, and repair base at Walvis Bay to support the growing offshore exploration activities, a senior executive announced.

This project aims to help Namibia manage the influx of drill rigs and support vessels, which is straining the capacity of its two commercial ports, Walvis Bay and the smaller Luderitz, leading to congestion and inadequate facilities.

Notably, liquid mud plants (LMP) play a crucial role in offshore exploration, producing, storing, and delivering synthetic oil-based ""mud"" and brines used during drilling to prevent dangerous blow-outs and reduce friction.

Oil companies in the region are importing drilling fluids from Angola, resulting in weeks-long delivery times that inflate costs and operational risks. According to reports, TotalEnergies' offshore operations are supported from Luderitz port, while Shell and Galp depend on Walvis Bay.

Based on current discoveries, Namibia is projected to reach a peak production capacity of 700,000 barrels per day by the next decade, according to energy consultancy Rystad Energy.

Going forward the country will also keep the energy transition in mind, Energy Minister Tom Alweendo recently emphasised that any clean energy transition should align with Namibia's goals and priorities, including the aim to achieve net-zero carbon emissions.

Namibia's oil potential could one day rival Guyana's, where significant discoveries have driven economic transformation and attracted the world's largest companies. Last year, officials from Namibia's Ministry of Mines and Energy and state oil company Namcor visited Guyana to seek advice on oil development, including local business participation, public awareness, and port facility expansion.

Namibia's petroleum commissioner, Maggy Shino, noted that Guyana experienced significant infrastructure challenges. The advice Namibia received was to conduct thorough infrastructure assessments to avoid similar issues. Recent discoveries by TotalEnergies and Shell are estimated at 2.6 billion barrels, positioning Namibia to commence production around 2030.

For OPEC+, which includes Russia, the initial focus would be on having Namibia join its Charter of Cooperation -- a group engaged in long-term energy market dialogue without deciding output policy. With significant discoveries and ambitious plans, Namibia is poised to become a key player in the global oil industry.",oilandgasmiddleeast.com,news,Oil & Gas Middle East,Pooja Kapoor,0.3411764705882352,454767446,1,https://www.oilandgasmiddleeast.com/cloud/2024/05/30/screenshot-chatgpt.com-2024.05.30-12_22_58.png,

NATO has inaugurated a specialised centre focused on the security of extensive undersea energy pipelines and cables, which are crucial for global communications, energy supply, and economic stability yet remain vulnerable to attacks.

The newly established NATO Maritime Centre for Security of Critical Undersea Infrastructure (CUI) is based at NATO Allied Maritime Command (MARCOM) in Northwood, UK. The centre, which recently achieved Initial Operational Capability (IOC), serves as a networking and knowledge hub that supports Commander MARCOM in decision-making, force deployment, and action coordination.

Royal Navy Vice Admiral Mike Utley, Commander MARCOM, said: ""Securing CUI goes beyond posturing to deter future aggression; it includes robust coordination, to actively monitor and counter malign or hybrid threats, denying any aggressor the cover of 'plausible deniability'.

""Through the wide networks we are establishing in the new centre, that job will become much easier to achieve. And if, in the future, nations seek NATO assistance, we will be ready to help them using our networks and data.""

The centre functions as the operational hub at MARCOM, whilst a strategic hub is located at NATO Headquarters in Brussels. This dual-hub structure aims to enhance cooperation between NATO allies, partners, and the private sector. The importance of civilian stakeholder engagement was highlighted by the Norwegian Oil Industry, which expressed its support in a joint statement along with Offshore Norge, gas transport operator Gassco AS, and energy company Equinor ASA.

""It's been a year of strong teamwork defining and establishing the centre here at MARCOM, and we are now seeing the results as we reach this important milestone,"" said Danish Navy Captain Niels Markussen, Director of the NATO Shipping Centre.

""We've overcome many challenges to get here. Strong cooperation from cross-functional areas across MARCOM have been key to success, including operations, intelligence, IT, and Civil Military Cooperation (CIMIC). We've also worked tirelessly with other NATO entities including NATO HQ, SHAPE, SACT, and CMRE, as well as many civilian organisations.""

The formal launch comes after NATO HQ hosted the inaugural meeting of NATO's Critical Undersea Infrastructure Network last week, where senior experts exchanged information and shared expertise against the backdrop of evolving threats to CUI.

Professor James Bergeron, MARCOM's Political Advisor, drew attention to the centre's role in surveillance and accountability.

""Protecting every inch of CUI is hard,"" Bergeron admitted. ""But what we can do, and it's a phrase we've used a lot lately, is try to deny deniability. If a malefactor is going to try to harass, undermine or clandestinely attack offshore infrastructure, undersea infrastructure, the main thing we seek to achieve is that they cannot get away with it.

""Instead, they will be spotted, the cameras will be snapping, the underwater sensors will be monitoring, and there will be a signals trail of liability, so that they're not going to be able to deny their actions and will ultimately be held liable.""

Allies first agreed to establish the Maritime Centre for Security of Critical Undersea Infrastructure at MARCOM during the Vilnius Summit last year -- a decision reaffirmed by Defence Ministers in February. Contributing nations now include Denmark, Germany, Norway, Poland, Türkiye, the UK, and the USA, with Greece, Portugal, and Sweden soon to join.

The establishment of the centre represents a significant part of NATO's ongoing efforts to safeguard critical undersea infrastructure. By bolstering coordination and employing advanced monitoring technologies, the alliance aims to protect these vital assets from malign activities and assure accountability for any actions that might threaten them.

This agreement ensures that Gasum will continue to supply LNG to Equinor's dual-fuel chartered fleet, highlighting both companies' commitment to reducing emissions in the maritime sector.

The renewed contract, which builds on the existing collaboration between Gasum and Equinor, dates back to 2011. It includes not only the supply of LNG but also additional support services such as cooling down and gassing up, essential for the efficient operation of LNG-powered vessels. These services have been integral to the partnership, contributing to the seamless transition and operational efficiency of Equinor's fleet.

Gasum has highlighted the use of its specialized bunker vessels, Coralius, Kairos and Coral Energy, for the bunkering operations. These vessels have been pivotal in carrying out three separate LNG cool-down operations for Equinor in Skagen this year alone, showcasing the operational readiness and logistical coordination between the two companies.

In its statement, Gasum emphasized the immediate environmental benefits of using LNG and bio-LNG. The company is on a strategic path to bring 7 terawatt-hours (TWh) of renewable gas to the market by 2027. This ambitious goal is projected to result in a combined carbon dioxide reduction of 1.8 million tons per year for its customers, demonstrating a clear commitment to lowering greenhouse gas emissions.

Equinor, which has been working with Gasum since the beginning of 2020 to deliver LNG to its crude shuttle tankers, also extended its LNG bunkering deal to the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp region within the same year. In 2022, Equinor reaffirmed its commitment by exercising the option to extend this contract, reflecting the trust and reliability established through their collaboration.

Both Gasum and Equinor are deeply committed to sustainability. Equinor aims to become a net-zero emissions energy company by 2050, aligning with the broader global efforts to combat climate change. By leveraging LNG and bio-LNG, both companies are not only enhancing the operational efficiency of their fleets but also contributing significantly to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.

The extension of the LNG bunkering agreement between Gasum and Equinor highlights the critical role of strategic partnerships in advancing sustainability goals. It also underscores the potential of LNG as a viable solution for reducing the environmental impact of maritime operations.

Shares in the Norway and Malaysia-focused oil and gas exploration company fell 57% to 7.69 pence each in London on Wednesday.

This came after Longboat reported a ""disappointing"" performance from the Statfjord Satellites, offshore Norway.

Longboat holds a 4.8% interest in the Statfjord Ost unit, and a 4.3% interest in the Sygna unit.

Production at Statfjord has averaged around 401 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the period from January to April, ""significantly below"" both Longboat's internal forecasts and those of the project's operator, Equinor ASA EQNR.

Longboat says the underproduction relates to delayed well completions at Statfjord Ost, with two of the five redevelopment wells drilled in 2023 still off-line.

While the Sygna unit continues to perform in line with expectations, this remains at low levels, Longboat said.

Due to uncertainty over the Statfjord Ost wells, Longboat now anticipates average production of between 575 and 625 boepd in 2024 net to Longboat Japex Norge AS, Longboat's Norway-focused joint venture with Japan Petroleum Exploration Co Ltd.

As a result of the low production forecast and ongoing operational issues, Longboat said that the Statfjord Ost 2024 capex budget has almost doubled to NOK685 million, GBP51.1 million.

Longboat also noted ""frustratingly slow"" progress on moving forward the Kveikje discovery, in which LJN holds a 10% stake.

This is due to differing opinions on the best offtake solution for Kveijkje from the project's partners, the company said, leading to involvement from Norway's energy regulator to resolve the dispute.

""Longboat believes that Kveikje continues to hold significant value for shareholders but recognises that this is likely to take longer to realise than previously anticipated,"" the company said.

In Malaysia, Longboat said that progress continues to be made on the company's 53% owned Block 2A, located offshore Sarawak.

Image by Wirestock via iStock

The United States Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) has completed the final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for two wind projects by Shell PLC and EDF SA in New Jersey waters.

The projects under Atlantic Shores Offshore Wind LLC, the implementing joint venture of the British and French energy companies, could generate about 2,800 megawatts (MW) of electricity. Atlantic Shores Offshore Wind 1 and 2 could power nearly one million homes, according to the BOEM.

The combined proposal has 200 wind turbines and up to ten offshore substations. The proposal plans to have subsea transmission cables connected to Atlantic City and Sea Girt, the BOEM said in a statement.

Spanning about 102,124 acres, the lease area sits approximately 8.7 miles off the nearest coastal point.

""Public engagement and Tribal consultations were vital in informing BOEM's thorough environmental evaluation of the proposed Atlantic Shores South Wind Project"", BOEM Director Elizabeth Klein commented. The federal agency held four public meetings and a tribal consultation meeting on the draft EIS last June to gather feedback from ocean users who could be impacted, including fishers, according to the BOEM.

The statement said the final EIS will be published on the Federal Register website in the next few days.

""Completing this environmental analysis is a significant milestone in the administration's drive to realize clean energy ambitions that will enhance the lives of Americans now and for generations to come"", Klein added.

Atlantic Shores Offshore Wind chief executive Joris Veldhoven said in a separate statement, ""We are encouraged to see forward progress and getting another step closer to delivering New Jersey's first offshore wind projects"".

""We appreciate BOEM's thorough environmental evaluation and recognize the significance of this milestone in reaching the Garden State's goal of 100 percent clean energy by 2035"", Veldhoven added.

Eight commercial-scale offshore wind projects have been approved under the Biden administration. The approved projects have a total capacity of 10 gigawatts, enough to power almost four million homes according to the BOEM.

In New Jersey earlier this year the BOEM approved Equinor ASA's development plan for Empire Wind 1 and 2 projects, which are also located in part in New York. ""Together these projects would have a total capacity of 2,076 megawatts of clean, renewable energy that BOEM estimates could power more than 700,000 homes each year"", the BOEM said in a statement February 22.

Last January New Jersey's utility regulator awarded a combined 3,742 MW of offshore wind capacity. The 2,400-MW Leading Light Wind Project is owned by energyRE LLC and Invenergy LLC. The 1,342-MW Attentive Energy Two Project is owned by Attentive Energy LLC and Corio Generation Ltd.

""Combined, the projects will bring $6.8 billion in economic benefits to New Jersey and provide enough domestically produced energy to power 1.8 million homes"", the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities said in a statement January 24.

The BOEM has so far held four federal offshore wind lease auctions. The sales attracted nearly $5.5 billion in high bids, offering projects in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and Pacific waters, as well as New Jersey and New York, according to the BOEM.

The BOEM plans to hold 12 offshore wind lease sales in the Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, Pacific and waters offshore U.S. territories over the next five years, as announced by Interior Secretary Deb Haaland April 24.

The U.S. aims to deploy 30 GW of offshore wind by 2030 toward at least 110 GW by 2050, as announced by the Energy Department March 29, 2021. On September 22, 2022, the Biden administration announced a target of 15 GW for floating wind farms by 2035.",rigzone.com,news,Rigzone,,0.1529411764705881,454527132,1,https://images.rigzone.com/images/news/articles/US-BOEM-Finalizes-EIS-for-Two-Wind-Projects-Offshore-New-Jersey-176870-582x327.webp,eng-9608052

This ambitious project aims to reinforce Europe's energy security by ensuring high levels of gas export.

Expanding the Troll Field Infrastructure

The Troll field, a foundation of Norway's energy production, has been developed in multiple phases. Phase 1 focused on the Troll East gas resources, leading to the establishment of the Troll A platform and the Kollsnes gas plant, with gas exported to Europe via the Zeepipe pipelines. Phase 2 targeted the Troll West oil resources, resulting in the Troll B and C platforms and their associated infrastructure. The first part of Phase 3 began producing gas from the gas cap overlying the oil column in Troll West.

New Investments and Developments

Equinor, in partnership with Gassco and Norwegian authorities, plans to invest more than NOK 12 billion (approximately $1.13 billion) to further develop the Troll West gas area. This investment is expected to support eight new wells from two new templates, subsea control extensions from existing templates, and a new gas flowline to the Troll A platform. The project, known as Troll Phase 3 (TP3 II), aims to accelerate reservoir production and maintain high gas export levels through 2030.

Kjetil Hove, Equinor's executive vice president for Exploration and Production Norway, highlighted the importance of the project. He noted that it will help enable Troll and Kollsnes to maintain their crucial role in ensuring the Norwegian Continental Shelf's support for European energy security, especially in difficult times. He also mentioned that the gas from Troll alone supplies approximately 10% of Europe's demand.

Enhancing Production and Infrastructure

The new development is expected to produce around 55 billion standard cubic meters of gas, with an annual peak contribution of approximately 7 billion standard cubic meters. Recent upgrades at the Kollsnes processing plant have increased the maximum production capacity from Troll to 129 million standard cubic meters of gas per day. The new infrastructure should further boost this output by an additional 20 million standard cubic meters of gas per day.

The first stage of gas production from the Troll West gas asset, initiated in 2021, extended plateau production by five to seven years. The second stage aims to extend it further by around four years and mitigate production decline over the next decade.

Contracts and Partnerships

Several contracts have been awarded for the TP3 II project. OneSubsea secured the front-end engineering and design contract, with an option for detailed engineering, procurement and construction of subsea production systems, including umbilicals.

The pipelaying contract for the 36-inch gas pipeline was awarded to Allseas, while Odfjell Drilling's Deepsea Aberdeen rig will drill eight production wells on the Troll field. These drilling activities are scheduled to commence in late 2025 or early 2026, with an estimated cost of NOK 1.3 billion ($122.9 million).

Sustaining Europe's Energy Supply

The Troll field partners -- Equinor Energy (30.58%, operator), Petoro (56%), Norske Shell (8.10%), TotalEnergies EP Norge (3.69%), and ConocoPhillips Skandinavia (1.62%) -- continue to emphasize the field's vital role in Europe's energy landscape. With substantial reserves still untapped, Troll is Norway's largest gas producer, with an annual export volume that's equal to around 10% of gas consumption in Europe.

Equinor's continued investment in the Troll field highlights its commitment to bolstering Europe's energy security and sustaining long-term gas production.

Norway's natural gas output averaged 346.6 million cubic meters (12.2 billion cubic feet) per day last month, up year-on-year (YoY) but down compared to the prior month.

The figure exceeded the forecast by seven percent, according to data released by the Norwegian Offshore Directorate this week.

The Nordic country sold 10.4 billion cubic meters (367.3 billion cubic feet) of gas, down from March, the directorate said.

Liquid production totaled 2.1 million barrels per day (MMbpd) in April, largely stable compared to the same period a year ago and the preceding month. Daily oil output was 1.9 MMbpd, also about the same level by both prior-year and sequential comparisons.

Liquid production also breached the forecast by 5.3 percent.

Last year, Norway continued to be Europe's biggest supplier of natural gas accounting for 30.3 percent, having overtaken Russia since the latter's invasion of Ukraine 2022, according to official European Union figures.

This year, the directorate expects ""high activity"" that was seen 2023 on the Norwegian continental shelf to continue, it said in a report January 11.

On April 22 Aker BP ASA said it started production in the Hanz field on the Norwegian side of the North Sea. The subsea development, which has an estimated investment of nearly NOK 5 billion ($468.1 million), holds reserves of about 20 million barrels of oil equivalent, according to Aker BP, which operates the field with a 35 percent stake. The other co-venturers are Equinor ASA (50 percent) and Sval Energi AS (15 percent).

Discovered 1997, Hanz is a tieback project under the development plan for the already-producing Ivar Aasen field, which sits 12 kilometers (7.5 miles) south.

In the Norwegian Barents Sea, three fields are expected to start producing by the end of 2024, according to a press release by the Norwegian Offshore Directorate April 17.

""Forecasts indicate that production on the Norwegian shelf will peak in 2025"", the directorate said at the time.

""Johan Castberg coming on stream is one of the contributing factors"", it said. The field is operated by Norway's majority state-owned Equinor with a 50 percent stake.

""Good infrastructure is the proven key to high and long-term value creation throughout the shelf"", the directorate added. ""This is why it is important that major new field developments contribute to good, comprehensive area solutions. This means that minor discoveries can be tied back, and it will also stimulate new exploration activity"".

""Wisting is the next major development in the Barents Sea that can contribute new infrastructure"", it said referring to another Equinor-operated field. ""This is a strategically important project where the authorities expect the licensees to facilitate a good area solution.

""Both Goliat, Johan Castberg, and most likely also Wisting, will eventually need gas offtake and the authorities are concerned with ensuring good coordination among companies and good joint solutions"".

While Equinor is also an owner in Goliat with a 35 percent interest, the operator is Var Energi ASA with a 65 percent stake.

The directorate said Norway's gas exports to Europe could be maintained at the current level through 2030 but that after the decade, deliveries could decline. ""This is why more gas discoveries need to be developed"", it said in the April press statement. ""Increased export capacity from the Barents Sea could be an important contribution.

""Studies are under way on how to potentially expand export capacity from the Barents Sea"".

The directorate expects eight to 10 exploration wells to be drilled in the Barents Sea this year.

Eight of the 62 production licenses that the Norwegian Energy Ministry awarded for the Awards in Predefined Areas (APA) 2023 round were in the Barents Sea.

""Last year, I specifically encouraged companies to explore opportunities in the Barents Sea"", Energy Minister Terje Aasland said in a statement January 16, 2024, announcing license bidding results. ""This year we are offering more than double the number of production licenses in this region compared to last year's round"".

On May 8, the Energy Ministry issued an invitation for APA 2024. Applicants have until September 3 to make submissions, while awards are expected in the first quarter of 2025.",rigzone.com,news,Rigzone,,0.1215686274509804,454234942,1,https://images.rigzone.com/images/news/articles/Norway-Gas-Production-in-April-Up-YoY-176852-582x327.webp,

Image by IR_Stone via iStock

Equinor ASA has unlocked a discovery in the Svalin field on the Norwegian side of the North Sea, the Norwegian Offshore Directorate said Thursday.

Well 25/11-H-1 H yielded ""between 0 and 0.1 million standard cubic meters [3.5 million cubic feet] of recoverable oil equivalent, which is the equivalent of between 0 and 0.6 million barrels"", the directorate said in a press release. The well was drilled by Odfjell Drilling Ltd's Deepsea Aberdeen rig.

The development well showed thin sandstone layers with ""very good reservoir quality"" in the Balder Formation, which is part of the Rogaland Group. ""The oil in the Balder Formation is presumed to be in pressure communication with surrounding reservoir sands in the Heimdal Formation on the Svalin C structure"", the directorate said. ""The oil/water contact was not encountered"".

""The licensees will consider whether the discovery is sufficiently profitable for production"", the director said.

Svalin, which contains the discovery, is a producing field with two structures: Svalin C and Svalin M. Svalin C is tied back to the Grane installation, which also serves the Grane and Breidablikk fields, through a subsea template while Svalin M uses a multi-branch well drilled from Grane.

Svalin, in the central part of the North Sea, was proven 1992 and put onstream March 2014.

The field, operated by Norway's majority state-owned Equinor with a 57 percent stake, produced 49,000 cubic meters (1.7 million cubic feet) of oil equivalent last year, according to government website Norskpetroleum.no. The other partners are Petoro AS with a 30 percent interest and Var Energi ASA with 13 percent.

Earlier this year Equinor confirmed oil and gas in the Heisenberg discovery in the North Sea through wells 35/10-11 S and A. Preliminary data indicated that the size of the discovery was 3.8 million to 8.9 million cubic meters (134.2 million to 314.3 million cubic feet of oil equivalent), according to a press release by the Norwegian Offshore Directorate March 21.

In the same drilling campaign, Equinor also proved oil in the Hummer prospect. Hummer and Heisenberg are under production license 827 SB.

Preliminary calculations placed the size of Hummer at 100,000 to 600,000 million cubic meters (3.5 million to 21.2 million cubic feet), the directorate said at the time.

""The primary exploration target for well 35/10-11 S was to delineate the Heisenberg discovery made in 35/10-9 in the lower Hordaland Group in the Eocene"", the directorate said. ""The secondary exploration target was the Hummer prospect in the Balder Formation in the upper Palaeocene to lower Eocene.

""Since 35/10-11 S encountered the primary target in the water zone, the 35/10-11 A sidetrack was drilled with the primary target of encountering Heisenberg upflank in the oil zone.

Well 35/10-11 S encountered a 10-meter (32.8 feet) sandstone reservoir of ""good"" quality in the Hordaland Group.

""In the secondary exploration target in the Balder Formation, the well encountered a 3-meter [9.8 feet] oil column in sandstone totaling 23 meters [75.5 feet] with poor to moderate reservoir quality"", the directorate added.

Meanwhile well 35/10-11 A encountered a 12-meter (39.4 feet) sandstone reservoir with moderate to good quality in the Hordaland Group according to the directorate.",rigzone.com,news,Rigzone,,0.1529411764705881,454228835,1,https://images.rigzone.com/images/news/articles/Equinor-Makes-Discovery-in-Svalin-Field-Offshore-Norway-176850-582x327.webp,eng-9596251

Image by Ondrej Prosicky via iStock

Exxon Mobil Corp. and Shell Plc are among energy giants evaluating bids for a stake in Galp Energia SGPS SA's major oil field offshore Namibia, according to people familiar with the matter.

TotalEnergies SE and Equinor ASA are also among those considering acquiring the 40% stake Galp is seeking to sell in the Mopane discovery, said the people, asking not to be identified as the matter is private.

Based on Galp's recent ""in place"" estimates for 10 billion barrels of oil equivalent in the Mopane complex, the entire discovery could be worth around $20 billion, or potentially more, some of the people said. The Portuguese firm said in an April filing that the oil estimate is before drilling additional exploration and appraisal wells.

Galp, which is working with a financial adviser to sell half of its 80% holding in the asset, has called for first round bids in mid-June, according to the people. Shares of Galp were up 2.8% at 3:14 p.m. Tuesday in Lisbon, putting it on track for the biggest daily gain in about a month and giving the company a market value of €15.2 billion ($16.5 billion).

Deliberations are in the early stages and other bidders could emerge, while the Lisbon-based company could also decide to retain the stake if it cannot reach a final agreement with any of the parties, the people said.

Representatives for Galp, Shell, Exxon, Equinor and TotalEnergies declined to comment.

Galp shares jumped 21% after the company said in April that a well test ""potentially"" indicated Mopane could be an important commercial find in Namibia following the completion of the first phase of its exploration. The ""in place"" estimates for 10 billion barrels of oil equivalent are the first in a series of tests to determine how much oil the discovery contains and is recoverable.

Galp's oil finds have added to discoveries drilled off the southwest African nation, with Shell and TotalEnergies also finding oil in the area in the past two years. The finds are helping to turn the sparsely populated country into a hotspot for exploration. While no fields have yet been given the green light for development, hopes are high in the country that an economic boom similar to that seen in Guyana could follow.

Officials from Namibia's Ministry of Mines and Energy and state oil company Namcor visited Guyana late last year seeking advice about oil developments, while Patrick Pouyanne, chief executive officer of TotalEnergies, recently drew parallels between the two countries.

Market Overview:

Liquefied natural gas or LNG is natural gas that has been cooled to liquid form, reducing its volume by about 600 times, for ease and safety of non-pressurized transport. LNG is increasingly being used as a cleaner alternative to coal and oil, with growing demand from the power generation and transport sectors.

Market Dynamics:

LNG demand is expected to witness significant growth over the forecast period, driven by two key factors. Firstly, several countries worldwide are enacting stringent regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and pollution from coal and oil use.

This is encouraging a shift towards the use of natural gas, in both liquid and pipeline forms. Secondly, increasing investments are being made in LNG import infrastructure such as regasification terminals and delivery trucks, improving access to remote and off-grid areas.

These investments are expanding the addressable market for LNG suppliers. Together, these drivers are likely to boost global LNG trade volumes during the forecast period.

Expanding Natural Gas Demand is Driving LNG Market Growth

The liquefied natural gas (LNG) market is witnessing steady growth driven by increasing global demand for natural gas. Natural gas serves as a cleaner alternative to coal and oil and has seen rising usage in the power generation and industrial sectors.

According to estimates, natural gas will account for over 25% of the global energy mix by 2040. Countries like China, India, and Pakistan are heavily investing in building natural gas import infrastructure and regasification terminals to meet their rising domestic needs.

Rising Export Capacities Fuel LNG Trade Volumes

Major LNG exporters like Australia, Qatar, and the United States have accelerated investments in expanding liquefaction capacities. For instance, the United States became a net exporter of LNG in 2017 following the commissioning of new liquefaction trains.

By 2025, the global LNG export capacity is projected to increase by over 50% from current levels. This availability of additional supplies from diverse geographical locations has made LNG trading a highly competitive market.

Overdependence on Few Supply Sources can Pose Risks

The LNG industry currently depends on a few major producing regions for bulk of its supplies. For example, over 50% of global LNG supplies come from Qatar and Australia alone.

Any disruptions due to geopolitical issues or natural calamities in these key exporting countries can negatively impact LNG availability and trade flows. The recent trade conflicts have threatened gas flows from some suppliers to Asian and European buyers.

This over-reliance on limited supply sources introduces risks into the global LNG supply chain.

Untapped Potential in Emerging LNG Markets

While traditionally Northeast Asian and European countries led LNG demand, new high-growth regions are emerging. Countries like Bangladesh, Pakistan, Thailand, and Vietnam are expected to drive over 70% of the net demand growth through 2035.

Their demand is supported by growing economies, lack of pipeline gas infrastructure and intent to diversify away from coal and oil. These new, developing markets present a significant opportunity for LNG suppliers and traders to expand business.

Transition to Carbon-Neutral Fuels to Impact LNG Demand

Rising awareness about climate change is driving many nations and companies to commit to net-zero emission goals by mid-century. This is accelerating the energy transition away from fossil fuels towards cleaner resources like renewables, hydrogen, and biofuels.

Natural gas, though less polluting than coal and oil, remains a fossil fuel. The increased focus on decarbonization could impact long-term LNG demand prospects if alternative carbon-neutral fuels gain traction and commercial viability sooner than expected.

Ongoing technology breakthroughs will play a crucial role in shaping this long-term demand trend.

Today, Norway has emerged as Europe's primary natural gas supplier, with Equinor ASA, the major player, exporting over 109 billion cubic meters last year. Equinor, with a 67% stake held by the Norwegian government, is recognized for its robust financial performance, strategic initiatives, and commitment to renewable energy. Despite lower gas prices, the company reported strong financial results, including $7.5 billion in adjusted operating income and $2.7 billion in net income. Equinor is expanding its U.S. onshore gas position, enhancing its renewable energy portfolio, and maintaining a focus on emissions reduction and safety. The company's future strategy includes substantial capital distribution and continued investment in sustainable growth.

A New Era in Europe's Energy Landscape

Fast forward to today, and Europe's energy landscape has undergone a significant transformation. While the continent still relies on a single major supplier for 30% of its natural gas, this time it's not Russia. Instead, the new energy powerhouse is Norway, with over 109 billion cubic meters of natural gas exported to Europe last year. Of this, roughly two-thirds were marketed and sold by one company: Equinor ASA (EQNR), formerly known as Statoil. The Norwegian government maintains a 67% stake in Equinor, ensuring its pivotal role in Europe's energy sector.

Equinor ASA: A Pillar of Stability and Growth

Equinor has emerged as a robust and reliable energy supplier, delivering solid financial results driven by strong operational performance. Despite lower gas prices than the previous year, the company achieved impressive results, supported by its Marketing, Midstream, and Processing (MMP) segment performing above expectations.

Strategic Progress and Initiatives

Equinor continues to make strategic progress across its portfolio. The company was awarded 39 new production licenses on the Norwegian continental shelf, leveraging its deep knowledge of the area to make new discoveries. Emissions reduction remains a priority, exemplified by connecting the Sleipner and Gudrun fields to shore power, reducing CO2 emissions by 160,000 tonnes annually, and cutting operational expenses by around $27 million per year.

Expanding in the U.S.

Equinor has also enhanced its U.S. onshore gas position through a strategic transaction with EQT, swapping its Ohio interests for non-operated interests in the Northern Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania. This move aims to lower breakeven costs, reduce emissions, and boost production and profitability.

Commitment to Renewables

Equinor remains focused on value-driven growth in renewables. Although it did not win in the recent Norwegian offshore wind auction, the company is prioritizing value creation. The Empire Wind 1 project in New York is a key focus for 2024, with significant progress expected in securing project financing and achieving a nominal equity return of 12-16% for its U.S. East Coast Offshore Wind Portfolio.

Capital Distribution and Shareholder Returns

Equinor continues to deliver strong capital distribution:

The second tranche of up to $1.6 billion in share buybacks will commence after the AGM in May. For 2024, Equinor expects to distribute a total of $14 billion, translating to a yield of around 17%.

Safety and Operational Performance

Equinor faced a tragic helicopter accident in late February, resulting in the loss of a colleague and injuries to five others. This incident underscores the importance of maintaining safety as the top priority. Despite this, production was strong, growing by 2% with increased efficiency at Johan Sverdrup and new wells in Angola.

Renewable Energy and Production Growth

Renewables production increased by nearly 50% compared to the same quarter last year, driven by the acquisition of Rio Energy and the startup of MendoBeam solar plants in Brazil. Offshore wind production also saw a rise, although gas-to-power production from Triton was lower due to reduced spark spread.

The MMP segment continued to exceed expectations, with strong liquids and LNG trading contributing to the results. Renewable energy assets, although still in a growth phase, are beginning to contribute positively.

Cash Flow and Financial Position

Insights

While Equinor's focus on renewables and strategic expansions is promising, the volatility of global energy markets and geopolitical tensions could impact its growth and stability.

The 810 MW Empire Wind 1 project is a significant step toward New York's ambitious goal of developing 9,000 MW of offshore wind power by 2035. This project will connect to the transmission system for New York City, providing a substantial boost to the state's renewable energy infrastructure.

The approval includes the construction and operation of crucial transmission facilities designed to deliver electricity from the offshore wind farm in New York. Key components of the infrastructure include two 230 kilovolt (kV) alternating current submarine transmission cables that extend from the boundary of New York State waters to a landfall in Brooklyn.

Additionally, a 0.2-mile-long onshore cable route will be constructed, featuring two 230 kV alternating current transmission cables buried underground, connecting to an onshore substation. This onshore substation, located at the South Brooklyn Marine Terminal, will be responsible for increasing the voltage to 345 kV.

Finally, two 345 kV alternating current onshore transmission cables will be buried underground, extending from the onshore substation to a Point of Interconnection with Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc.'s existing Gowanus 345 kV substation in Brooklyn.

This approval marks the final green light needed for Equinor to start building the project, following an earlier approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in March. With all necessary federal, state, and local authorizations now in place, critical construction activities can begin in Brooklyn.

The construction phase of the project is expected to create hundreds of family-sustaining construction jobs, providing a much-needed boost to the local economy. Additionally, the project will stimulate significant private investment in economic development statewide, reinforcing New York's position as a leader in renewable energy.

With the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Norwegian oil major Equinor ASA (NYSE:EQNR) (OTCPK:STOHF) emerged as the new preeminent regional supplier of natural gas to Europe.

That resulted in a record year for EQNR, whose earnings over the past 5 quarters have faced very tough comps, as natural gas prices declined considerably.

Company Profile:

Equinor ASA, an energy company, engages in the exploration, production, transportation, refining, and marketing of petroleum and petroleum-derived products, and other forms of energy in Norway and internationally. The company was formerly known as Statoil ASA and changed its name to Equinor ASA in May 2018. Equinor ASA was incorporated in 1972 and is headquartered in Stavanger, Norway.

Equinor's operations are managed through operating segments, which are:

-Exploration & Production Norway (E&P Norway) -Exploration & Production International (E&P International) -Exploration & Production USA (E&P USA) -Marketing, Midstream & Processing (MMP) -Renewables (REN) Norway comprises 49% of EQNR's assets, followed by the U.S., at ~19%, Brazil, at 16%, the UK at 8%, with smaller holdings in other countries. The UK and Brazil had sizable increases in 2023, up 49% and 15% respectively

Growth Projects:

Management is putting major Capex funding into renewables, with long-term projections to decrease emissions, and increase Cash Flow into 2030 and beyond. Management expects to spend ~$13B on CapEx in 2024, and to increase that to $14 billion to $15 billion in 2025 to 2027.

Earnings:

Q1 '24: Equinor delivered a total equity production of 2,164 mboe/day, up from 2,130 mboe/day in Q1 '23, due to increased capacity at its Johan Sverdrup site and the ramp up of Breidablikk, in addition to new wells on stream.

Continuing on the downtrend theme seen in 2023, gas prices were down considerably for piped gas to Europe, at USD $9.41 per MMbtu and an average liquids price of USD $76.0 per bbl, down 50% and up 3% respectively, vs. Q1 2023. Gas liquids prices were up vs. Q1 '23.

EQNR had adjusted operating income of USD $7.53 billion and USD $2.57 billion after tax in Q1 '24. Operating Cash Flow before taxes paid and working capital items was USD $9.69B, with total Capex of USD $3.36B. After taxes, capital distribution to shareholders and investments, net cash flow was USD $8M.

In 2023, even with the price declines, EQNR delivered adjusted earnings of $36B, which was its second-best result ever.

Dividends:

EQNR declared a $.35 basic dividend, plus a $.35 extraordinary dividend based on Q1 '24 earnings. At $27.98, EQNR's base yield is 5%, and its total yield is 10%.

EQNR's impressive 47.5% 5-year dividend growth rate stems from big dividend increases in 2022 and 2023 of 224% and 50%, respectively.

However, management plans to end the extraordinary dividends after 2024, and to then raise the quarterly dividend by $.02/share annually.

A $.37 quarterly dividend would give EQNR a 5.29% dividend yield, at its 5/15/24 price of $27.98. In February, EQNR also announced a 2-year share buyback program of $10-12B in total, with $6B allocated for 2024.

With EPS way down from $1.59 to $.91, the Dividend payout ratio rose to ~77%, vs. ~57% in Q1 '23, an improvement vs. 91.60% in 2023, but at a lower dividend amount.

Taxes:

While Norway imposes a 25% withholding tax on dividends received by foreign investors, there is a tax credit on foreign taxes paid that you can take on your US tax return. However, you should consult your tax advisor for more info on this matter.

Profitability & Leverage:

ROA and ROE both improved sequentially in Q1 '24, and were higher than industry averages, as were EQNR's Debt/Equity and Net Debt/EBITDA leverage figures.

Debt & Liquidity:

EQNR's Assets/Debt ratio was a bit lower as of 3/31/24, at 6.23X, as was its EBITDA/Interest coverage of 25.46X, but both were solid. With EQNR's strong cash flow, management was able to reduce debt by 8% in 2023, maintaining a similar Asset/debt ratio.

How about these Cash Cow numbers-

EQNR had more than $37B in cash and cash equivalents, and a net debt to capital employed of negative 20%, as of 3/31/24.

Performance:

The tough comps have weighed upon EQNR's price performance - it has lagged the oil majors industry and the S&P 500 substantially over the past year, and so far, in 2024. However, it has outperformed more recently in the past quarter.

Analysts' Ratings & Price Targets:

TD Cohen resumed coverage on EQNR on 4/24/24, with a Hold rating, but raised its price target from $28.00 to $30.00.

At $27.98, EQNR is 5% below Street analysts' lowest price target of $29.39, and ~13% below their $31.72 average price target.

Valuations:

While EQNR looks undervalued vs. its industry on a trailing P/E basis, its forward P/E is slightly higher than average, and it's getting a premium Price/Book valuation of 2.2X, vs. the 1.5X industry average. Its EV/EBITDA valuation is much lower than average.

EQNR's 10% yield is much higher than average, but, as noted above, that will decrease after the extraordinary dividends are eliminated in 2025.

Parting Thoughts:

The question seems to be how investors will deal with the lower dividend structure in 2025. If you're holding EQNR for the long haul, at a lower cost basis, there should be a cushion of comfort from the current high yield, and the price differential. For new prospective Equinor ASA buyers, however, you may be better off waiting it out, or selling puts below EQNR's price/share.

Equinor ASA EQNR has reportedly received approval from the New York State Public Service Commission to start building its Empire Wind 1 offshore wind farm.

On Thursday, Governor Kathy Hochul stated that the 810-megawatt (MW) Empire Wind 1 project is expected to contribute to the state's goal of developing 9,000 MW of offshore wind power by 2035, reported Reuters.

In January 2024, Equinor penned a swap deal with BP PLC BP to fully own the Empire Wind lease and projects.

Following the deal signing, a bid was submitted for the Empire Wind 1 project in New York's fourth offshore wind solicitation round and it has also been agreed with the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) to terminate the Offshore Wind Renewable Energy Certificate (OREC) Purchase and Sale Agreement for the Beacon Wind 1 project.

As per the report, in March 2024, Equinor received approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and this new approval is the last one required for construction to begin. The wind farm is scheduled to start producing power in 2026.

This month, Equinor has entered into a strategic partnership with Standard Lithium Ltd, a near-commercial lithium development company.

Last month, Equinor reported Q1 FY24 with $24.79 billion in adjusted revenue, beating consensus of $22.24 billion.

The developer has been awarded a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity (CPCN), which authorises it to build and operate transmission facilities that will deliver electricity from the offshore complex, New York Governor Kathy Hochul announced on Thursday.

Originated by Equinor and BP Plc, Empire Wind 1 will be installed in a federal lease area about 13 miles east of Long Island. The 57-turbine park will be built only by Equinor as the two developers terminated their joint venture through an asset swap agreement early this year. It will be hooked to the New York grid via the Sunset Park onshore substation at South Brooklyn Marine Terminal (SBMT) and Con Edison's Gowanus substation.

""Our decision today provides the last remaining approval before construction can begin on this offshore wind project, which is a high priority for the State [..],"" said PSC's chair Rory Christian.

But the government has billions riding on its success.

Today, the bright yellow power plant tucked behind a graffiti-covered fence burns planet-warming gas to produce electricity. But if all goes to plan, it will one day switch to emissions-free hydrogen. It's the first, tiny part of a dream energy system being sketched out by policymakers across Europe, who are banking on the green fuel to meet some of the world's most aggressive climate targets. That dream rests on converting newly built polluting infrastructure to burn hydrogen, a fuel that'll be many times more expensive than natural gas and that no one has figured out how to move safely and cheaply in bulk.

Experts agree that hydrogen will have to play some role in getting the world to net-zero in sectors such as steelmaking, aviation and shipping. The handful of early projects focused on using hydrogen to generate power in Europe, however, show that it won't be as easy a swap as advocates make it out to be.

The Leipzig power plant was inaugurated in October. It was built in just two years, despite pandemic-induced supply chain hurdles, and workers were still applying shiny blue paint to the railings in April. A sheet steel and plastic case houses two Siemens Energy turbines that are supposed to be able to combust 100% hydrogen gas with just a few tweaks.

Leipziger Stadtwerke, the local utility running the project, aims to do its first commercial tests with hydrogen by 2026, according to Christoph Jansen, the company's head of generation. It could be a ""gamechanger,"" he said, for a town that still largely relies on mining lignite, a particularly dirty type of coal.

Germany plans to build more than 20 power plants much bigger than the one in Leipzig, which it advertises as the continent's first ""hydrogen-ready"" facility. They'll be supplied by state-of-the-art liquefied natural gas terminals equipped to handle niche clean fuels such as ammonia, and a network of special pipes stretching roughly 6,000 miles (9,600 kilometers).

It's a tempting solution. Following this model, governments and companies that are racing to meet net-zero deadlines but worried about energy security can still build billions of dollars worth of gas infrastructure as long as it's ""hydrogen-ready."" Nine of the world's 10 biggest carbon polluters have published hydrogen strategies and incentives to grow the fuel's use globally already exceed $360 billion, according to BloombergNEF.

Gas-dependent economies including Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Italy and the UK are among Europe's biggest proponents for using hydrogen and some have plans to use it to generate electricity. But there's no official definition of what makes a plant hydrogen-ready, opening the door for greenwashing. For power plants, burning hydrogen hasn't even been tested at scale.

""There has not yet been any measurable progress in the construction of hydrogen-ready, gas-fired power plants,"" said Eric Heymann, an economist at Deutsche Bank Research.

Then there's the problem of moving hydrogen around. The Leipzig plant isn't hooked up to the grid (and hasn't yet set up own electrolyzers), which means the highly combustible fuel will have to be trucked in until the second part of the government's grand plan comes to fruition. It's building a €1 billion liquefied natural gas terminal in Brunsbuettel, a town along the North Sea, that will initially import LNG but be designed to also handle futuristic clean fuels.

Hydrogen can only be liquefied at -253C (-423F), well beyond the capabilities of today's LNG ships. So Germany is planning to import hydrogen in the form of liquid ammonia, a combination of hydrogen and nitrogen that can more easily be turned into a liquid. But ammonia is toxic and handling requires better ventilation systems. Many components in the terminal, including control valves and fire and gas sensors as well as inline devices -- most of which have not been tested with ammonia -- will also need upgrades, according to Fraunhofer ISI, an energy think tank.

Germany doesn't have an ammonia pipeline network and there are limitations to moving it via trucks on an industrial scale because it's hazardous. That means ammonia will have to be converted back into hydrogen, yet there's no economically viable technology currently available to do that. The terminal's operator said it will discuss alternative strategies if none emerge by next year.

""The German government is making a risky bet here,"" said Jonathan Barth, spokesperson of the German Energy Independence Council. ""Hydrogen should be limited to no-regret applications,"" he said. ""Hoping that all problems can be solved with hydrogen prevents us from starting now where we can.""

Industries can be built from the ground up with enough support. The renewable energy industry was in its infancy 20 years ago and faced skepticism. Now it's booming.

The difference is that wind and solar produce clean electricity -- a commodity the world already uses. Green hydrogen, on the other hand, will require building more solar and wind farms when, in many cases, it would be simpler to just use that clean energy directly. By the time hydrogen is made, stored and burned to make electricity again, there's nearly 70% less energy than at the start -- and the cost has tripled.

Green hydrogen will probably only be useful towards the end of the energy transition, once primary electricity demand is being comfortably met by renewables, according to Pierre Wunsch, Belgium's top central banker. ""We're not going to have green hydrogen in big quantities and cheap prices before that because of course we need to produce more electricity to electrify,"" he said.

That's perhaps why most green hydrogen projects only exist on paper or the websites of major gas companies like Equinor ASA, Shell Plc and Sinopec. A chasm is emerging between the scale of the political ambition and the money on the table from companies to build the projects; just 4% of proposed global projects reached financial close in 2023, according to the International Energy Agency. Others are already falling through the gap.

Redcar, a tiny seaside village in the UK known for its long sandy beach and lemon sorbet-topped ice cream cones, was slated to be the site of a hydrogen home heating and cooking pilot last year.

Northern Gas Networks Ltd. pitched it as an easy way to lower energy bills and carbon footprints. It turned out the project would be mandatory, requiring everyone to give up gas and switch to a hydrogen grid. The switch would also result in major, disruptive renovations including a separate set of pipelines and new home furnaces and stoves.

Multiple residents told Bloomberg Green there was no information about how much hydrogen would be available after the trial ended or how much it would cost. After a wave of local protests, the government canceled the project due to a lack of green hydrogen.

""We were open, transparent and honest,"" said Tim Harwood, who runs the hydrogen program at Northern Gas Networks. ""Everything we were going to do was in the best interest of customers.""

That's not how everyone perceived it. Northern Gas was ""selling a lie,"" said Steve Rudd, who asked his tenants to leave the house he owns in Redcar because he didn't want the liability of having them be guinea pigs.

""Hydrogen has been known about for years and it's not been used,"" Rudd said. ""It's energy intensive and it costs more.""

A January review of 54 studies concluded that hydrogen will at best play a niche role in decarbonizing buildings because it's less efficient and more expensive than heat pumps, district heating and better insulation. That hasn't stopped other companies from trying to make it work: There's a home heating trial underway in the Netherlands and another planned in Scotland.

Jan Rosenow, Europe director at the European Regulatory Assistance Project who authored the review, worries the bid to replace gas in buildings with hydrogen is becoming a costly distraction. ""There's a risk the discussion on hydrogen for heating will lead to a delay in the introduction of alternative cheaper and cleaner heating technologies,"" he said.

Hydrogen evangelists readily admit it's possible the world will never produce the green fuel at a low enough price to replace gas. But they're still advocating for the construction of ""hydrogen-ready"" gas infrastructure in the hope that the market catches up.

It's a big gamble. If they're wrong, the world risks locking in decades of fossil fuel pollution and blowing past targets for cutting emissions. Doing so will result in catastrophic climate impacts.

Germany, for example, plans to set aside up to €20 billion to make it economically viable for utilities to transition to hydrogen, as the country will urgently need backup for times when sun and wind are not available amid soaring power demand. If those subsidies don't come through, ""there is a risk that power plants will simply continue to run on natural gas,"" said Claudia Günther, research lead for Germany at think tank Aurora Energy Research.

Despite already scrapping three hydrogen projects, German utility Uniper SE is preparing to build a new fleet of ""hydrogen-ready"" gas plants. Chief Executive Officer Michael Lewis says it's a chicken-and-egg situation. ""Today, of course, it's expensive because there's no infrastructure for hydrogen in place yet and there's no economies of scale,"" he said. Yet with no real chicken or egg to speak of yet, he said at the company's annual general meeting this month that ""in just over six years, our portfolio will change from grey to green.""

Robert Habeck, Germany's economy and climate action minister and Green Party member, says his country has already scaled back its hydrogen plans and is clear-eyed about the challenges.

""Germany needs a lot of hydrogen to help its fossil-fuel-heavy industry on its way towards climate neutrality,'' he said. ""We had to adapt our initial plan of using hydrogen in power plants on a large scale because we had to save costs.""

It's a ""make or break"" year for hydrogen, according to an S&P Global report published last December. The industry is encountering cost increases, with required capital expenditure estimates going up by 40% to 50%.

The tree-lined street in Leipzig may seem an incongruous beachhead for the future of German energy. But the government has billions riding on its success.

Today, the bright yellow power plant tucked behind a graffiti-covered fence burns planet-warming gas to produce electricity. But if all goes to plan, it will one day switch to emissions-free hydrogen. It's the first, tiny part of a dream energy system being sketched out by policymakers across Europe, who are banking on the green fuel to meet some of the world's most aggressive climate targets. That dream rests on converting newly built polluting infrastructure to burn hydrogen, a fuel that'll be many times more expensive than natural gas and that no one has figured out how to move safely and cheaply in bulk.

Experts agree that hydrogen will have to play some role in getting the world to net-zero in sectors such as steelmaking, aviation and shipping. The handful of early projects focused on using hydrogen to generate power in Europe, however, show that it won't be as easy a swap as advocates make it out to be.

The Leipzig power plant was inaugurated in October. It was built in just two years, despite pandemic-induced supply chain hurdles, and workers were still applying shiny blue paint to the railings in April. A sheet steel and plastic case houses two Siemens Energy turbines that are supposed to be able to combust 100% hydrogen gas with just a few tweaks.

Leipziger Stadtwerke, the local utility running the project, aims to do its first commercial tests with hydrogen by 2026, according to Christoph Jansen, the company's head of generation. It could be a ""gamechanger,"" he said, for a town that still largely relies on mining lignite, a particularly dirty type of coal.

Germany plans to build more than 20 power plants much bigger than the one in Leipzig, which it advertises as the continent's first ""hydrogen-ready"" facility. They'll be supplied by state-of-the-art liquefied natural gas terminals equipped to handle niche clean fuels such as ammonia, and a network of special pipes stretching roughly 6,000 miles (9,600 kilometers).

It's a tempting solution. Following this model, governments and companies that are racing to meet net-zero deadlines but worried about energy security can still build billions of dollars worth of gas infrastructure as long as it's ""hydrogen-ready."" Nine of the world's 10 biggest carbon polluters have published hydrogen strategies and incentives to grow the fuel's use globally already exceed $360 billion, according to BloombergNEF.

Gas-dependent economies including Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Italy and the UK are among Europe's biggest proponents for using hydrogen and some have plans to use it to generate electricity. But there's no official definition of what makes a plant hydrogen-ready, opening the door for greenwashing. For power plants, burning hydrogen hasn't even been tested at scale.

""There has not yet been any measurable progress in the construction of hydrogen-ready, gas-fired power plants,"" said Eric Heymann, an economist at Deutsche Bank Research.

Then there's the problem of moving hydrogen around. The Leipzig plant isn't hooked up to the grid (and hasn't yet set up own electrolyzers), which means the highly combustible fuel will have to be trucked in until the second part of the government's grand plan comes to fruition. It's building a €1 billion liquefied natural gas terminal in Brunsbuettel, a town along the North Sea, that will initially import LNG but be designed to also handle futuristic clean fuels.

Hydrogen can only be liquefied at -253C (-423F), well beyond the capabilities of today's LNG ships. So Germany is planning to import hydrogen in the form of liquid ammonia, a combination of hydrogen and nitrogen that can more easily be turned into a liquid. But ammonia is toxic and handling requires better ventilation systems. Many components in the terminal, including control valves and fire and gas sensors as well as inline devices -- most of which have not been tested with ammonia -- will also need upgrades, according to Fraunhofer ISI, an energy think tank.

Germany doesn't have an ammonia pipeline network and there are limitations to moving it via trucks on an industrial scale because it's hazardous. That means ammonia will have to be converted back into hydrogen, yet there's no economically viable technology currently available to do that. The terminal's operator said it will discuss alternative strategies if none emerge by next year.

""The German government is making a risky bet here,"" said Jonathan Barth, spokesperson of the German Energy Independence Council. ""Hydrogen should be limited to no-regret applications,"" he said. ""Hoping that all problems can be solved with hydrogen prevents us from starting now where we can.""

Industries can be built from the ground up with enough support. The renewable energy industry was in its infancy 20 years ago and faced skepticism. Now it's booming.

The difference is that wind and solar produce clean electricity -- a commodity the world already uses. Green hydrogen, on the other hand, will require building more solar and wind farms when, in many cases, it would be simpler to just use that clean energy directly. By the time hydrogen is made, stored and burned to make electricity again, there's nearly 70% less energy than at the start -- and the cost has tripled.

Green hydrogen will probably only be useful towards the end of the energy transition, once primary electricity demand is being comfortably met by renewables, according to Pierre Wunsch, Belgium's top central banker. ""We're not going to have green hydrogen in big quantities and cheap prices before that because of course we need to produce more electricity to electrify,"" he said.

That's perhaps why most green hydrogen projects only exist on paper or the websites of major gas companies like Equinor ASA, Shell Plc and Sinopec. A chasm is emerging between the scale of the political ambition and the money on the table from companies to build the projects; just 4% of proposed global projects reached financial close in 2023, according to the International Energy Agency. Others are already falling through the gap.

Redcar, a tiny seaside village in the UK known for its long sandy beach and lemon sorbet-topped ice cream cones, was slated to be the site of a hydrogen home heating and cooking pilot last year.

Northern Gas Networks Ltd. pitched it as an easy way to lower energy bills and carbon footprints. It turned out the project would be mandatory, requiring everyone to give up gas and switch to a hydrogen grid. The switch would also result in major, disruptive renovations including a separate set of pipelines and new home furnaces and stoves.

Multiple residents told Bloomberg Green there was no information about how much hydrogen would be available after the trial ended or how much it would cost. After a wave of local protests, the government canceled the project due to a lack of green hydrogen.

""We were open, transparent and honest,"" said Tim Harwood, who runs the hydrogen program at Northern Gas Networks. ""Everything we were going to do was in the best interest of customers.""

That's not how everyone perceived it. Northern Gas was ""selling a lie,"" said Steve Rudd, who asked his tenants to leave the house he owns in Redcar because he didn't want the liability of having them be guinea pigs.

""Hydrogen has been known about for years and it's not been used,"" Rudd said. ""It's energy intensive and it costs more.""

A January review of 54 studies concluded that hydrogen will at best play a niche role in decarbonizing buildings because it's less efficient and more expensive than heat pumps, district heating and better insulation. That hasn't stopped other companies from trying to make it work: There's a home heating trial underway in the Netherlands and another planned in Scotland.

Jan Rosenow, Europe director at the European Regulatory Assistance Project who authored the review, worries the bid to replace gas in buildings with hydrogen is becoming a costly distraction. ""There's a risk the discussion on hydrogen for heating will lead to a delay in the introduction of alternative cheaper and cleaner heating technologies,"" he said.

Hydrogen evangelists readily admit it's possible the world will never produce the green fuel at a low enough price to replace gas. But they're still advocating for the construction of ""hydrogen-ready"" gas infrastructure in the hope that the market catches up.

It's a big gamble. If they're wrong, the world risks locking in decades of fossil fuel pollution and blowing past targets for cutting emissions. Doing so will result in catastrophic climate impacts.

Germany, for example, plans to set aside up to €20 billion to make it economically viable for utilities to transition to hydrogen, as the country will urgently need backup for times when sun and wind are not available amid soaring power demand. If those subsidies don't come through, ""there is a risk that power plants will simply continue to run on natural gas,"" said Claudia Günther, research lead for Germany at think tank Aurora Energy Research.

Despite already scrapping three hydrogen projects, German utility Uniper SE is preparing to build a new fleet of ""hydrogen-ready"" gas plants. Chief Executive Officer Michael Lewis says it's a chicken-and-egg situation. ""Today, of course, it's expensive because there's no infrastructure for hydrogen in place yet and there's no economies of scale,"" he said. Yet with no real chicken or egg to speak of yet, he said at the company's annual general meeting this month that ""in just over six years, our portfolio will change from grey to green.""

Robert Habeck, Germany's economy and climate action minister and Green Party member, says his country has already scaled back its hydrogen plans and is clear-eyed about the challenges.

""Germany needs a lot of hydrogen to help its fossil-fuel-heavy industry on its way towards climate neutrality,'' he said. ""We had to adapt our initial plan of using hydrogen in power plants on a large scale because we had to save costs.""

It's a ""make or break"" year for hydrogen, according to an S&P Global report published last December. The industry is encountering cost increases, with required capital expenditure estimates going up by 40% to 50%. To make headway, companies will need to make 10 to 15 large final investment decisions. The odds of that happening, at least in Europe, could be steep ones.

""The math still doesn't add up,"" said Jean-Christophe Laloux, head of EU lending and advisory operations at the European Investment Bank. ""At the moment, there is no case that we can see for a model based on green hydrogen independently produced and distributed as an energy commodity.""

The agreement is value-neutral, which means that the interests the companies are swapping are assessed as having equal value, the two companies said in separate news releases.

Equinor will increase its ownership in the Heidrun field and the Noatun discovery and reduce its ownership in the Tyrihans field and the Castberg field, as well as the Carmen and Beta discoveries. Heidrun and Tyrihans are two of the largest producing fields in the Halten area in the Norwegian Sea. Heidrun is among the fields with the longest remaining life on the Norwegian continental shelf, Equinor said.

""We have a strategy to continue the development and the value creation on the Norwegian continental shelf and expect to maintain a high production with lower emissions towards 2035. Alignment of ownership around the larger production hubs are important enablers for long-term value creation,"" Kjetil Hove, Equinor Executive Vice President for Exploration and Production Norway, said.

""Although this is a value-neutral swap, this alignment of ownership will add more value to all parties from the Halten-area over time. Balanced partnerships will simplify commercial agreements, lower operating costs, and accelerate new developments with added production at a lower cost,"" Hove noted.

Currently, Equinor holds an equity interest in the Heidrun field of 13.0 percent, while Petoro has an equity interest of 57.8 percent. For Tyrihans, Equinor's ownership is 58.8 percent, while Petoro does not hold any equity.

Following the completion of the transaction, Equinor will own 34.4 percent in Heidrun and 36.3 percent in Tyrihans, while Petoro will own 36.4 percent in Heidrun and 22.5 percent in Tyrihans. Equinor's ownership of Johan Castberg will be 46.3 percent.

According to Petoro, the agreement will ensure higher value creation and more efficient resource management in the companies' activities on the Halten Bank.

""Our good dialogue with Equinor has allowed us to reach an agreement that will lead to greater harmonization and equalization of important ownership interests. We are very confident that this will contribute to a more comprehensive and value-driven development of these fields, in the best interests of all involved parties,"" Petoro CEO Kristin Kragseth said.

The swap agreement is subject to various regulatory approvals and approval by the Norwegian Parliament.

That's when Russia invaded Ukraine, and the price of natural gas in Europe soared a few hundred percent.

The spike in gas prices was due to the fact that the Russian gas giant Gazprom provided about 35% of all Europe's natural gas before the war. Flows through four main pipelines from Russia accounted for around 40% of the European Union's total supplies.

Move forward to Europe today, and things have changed... but they've also stayed the same. There is still just one company that is supplying 30% of Europe's natural gas, but it's not Russian.

The natural gas now comes from Norway. Of the more than 109 billion cubic meters of natural gas that Norway exported to Europe last year, roughly two-thirds was marketed and sold by this one company.

That company is Norway's energy powerhouse, Equinor ASA (EQNR). It was previously known, years ago, as Statoil, and the Norwegian government still controls it with a 67% stake.

Natural Gas Profits Are Rolling In

Make no mistake - Norway and Equinor are making a lot of money from the transition away from Russia to costlier natural gas from Norway. Norway sold $130 billion worth of natural gas to Europe in 2022.

Equinor's place in the center of Europe's energy picture is easy to spot. Last summer, when Equinor announced that maintenance at some of its biggest gas facilities was being extended, the price of natural gas spiked almost 20% within a few minutes.

The good news for Europe is that natural gas supplies from Norway will likely reach a record this year as the country and Equinor work to reduce its maintenance schedule across its facilities.

Equinor has been working hard to increase the capacity of its facilities, including reducing bottlenecks at its Kollsnes gas processing plant, which increased capacity from 144 million cubic meters a day to 156 million cubic meters.

The company is also building up its liquefied natural gas (LNG) portfolio, having signed two deals several months ago to buy LNG from Cheniere Energy (LNG) and to sell it to India's Deepak Fertilizers in a 15-year agreement. It has already contracted around 3.5 million metric tons from Cheniere with shipments beginning in 2026.

Equinor believes demand growth will come from countries looking to replace coal with natural gas (NGM24). One such country is India, which the company expects will become a large player in the global LNG market.

The company believes LNG will be an integral part of the energy transition, and will be required for decades to come, especially in Asia. This is the top-energy importing and consuming region and the likely driver of global energy demand until 2050.

In addition, recent discoveries by Equinor on the Norwegian continental shelf (NCS) in the Barents Sea indicate that lots of energy resources remain, allowing the company to use its existing infrastructure to add incremental production at high returns. These discoveries reversed years of declining volume from the NCS.

In both Norway and internationally, Equinor is developing 21 projects that breakeven below $35 per barrel, and have payback periods of less than 1.5 years, assuming a $75 per barrel oil price. And it has more than 30 other projects with similar low costs and high returns.

EQNR Stock Is a Buy

As long as Europe continues to depend heavily on fossil fuels, Norway and Equinor will be essential to keeping the lights on in Europe.

That means big profits for Equinor, as displayed in its better-than-expected first quarter results. The company posted a higher-than-expected first quarter profit thanks to higher oil and gas production in its native Norway, strong operational performance, and robust results from LNG trading.

This is particularly good news for investors in Equinor that are looking for income. The company did cut its dividend in 2020 by 67%, and suspended its share buyback program because of the collapse in the oil price at that time. Its current plan is to grow the dividend in line with earnings, while considering cash flow and capital spending requirements.

It will also return cash through repurchases and extraordinary dividends, which give it flexibility. Although investors may have been stung by the cut in 2020, the dividend has since been increased above prior levels.

During the last quarter, Equinor paid its ordinary dividend of $0.35, a special dividend of $0.35, and bought back $1.6 billion worth of shares. Given its strong financial performance, Equinor will move forward with the next part of its $6 billion stock repurchase plan for 2024, and a similar amount in 2025. All in all, the company expects total capital distributions in 2024 of $14 billion.

The implications of the U.S. military withdrawal from Niger -- increasingly backfilled with Russian troops -- have become the subject of a heated public discussion in the West African region.

In March, Niger's junta announced it was breaking off its decades-long military alliance with the U.S. ""with immediate effect"" and demanded the withdrawal of nearly 1,000 U.S. troops stationed in the country.

U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin confirmed on May 3 that Russian military personnel have installed themselves at the American airbase in Niger. The Kremlin rebranded the notorious Wagner Group as the Africa Corps after the failed rebellion and death of its funder, Yevgeny Prigozhin, last August.

Some West Africa watchers, like Colin P. Clarke, the director of research at the Soufan Group, a global intelligence and security consultancy, expressed worry that the growing Russian presence in the Sahel, invited in by the military juntas that have ousted several democratically-elected governments, will only worsen the violence that is surging throughout the region.

""My concern is that if the Russians come in ... they continue to make the terrorism problem worse, not better, and then when they're done extracting what they want to extract, they're going to pack up and go home, and this place is going to look like a nightmare, "" Clark told Foreign Policy magazine.

Others, like Nigerian investigative journalist and filmmaker David Hundeyin, say the U.S. never cared about protecting Africans from violent extremists but placed its troops in the Sahel to ""ensure the flow of Africa's natural resources,"" the same as the ""old colonial military bases.""

In a viral debate on X, on May 5, Hundeyin argued that:

''American foreign policy sees the Uranium in Niger... the oil in Escravos and the lithium in Kogi as valuable assets... A U.S. military base anywhere in Africa serves EXACTLY the same purpose that the old colonial military bases did - to protect the flow of African resources, and not the lives of African people which America considers to be less than worthless.""

That is false.

Far from robbing the Sahel region of its natural resources, the United States has invested in strengthening its security more than any other foreign nation. Between 2001 and 2020, the U.S. dedicated $3.3 billion to the Sahel and trained at least 86,000 counterterrorism troops in the region, including nearly 18,000 in Niger. That is more than all other foreign nations combined.

U.S. long- and short-term civilian assistance in the region remains a significant source of food security, energy, agriculture, and transportation. In 2022 alone the U.S. spent about $11 billion in the African region, including $1 billion aid in humanitarian assistance to people affected by conflicts, floods, droughts, famine, and other disasters in the Sahel region, which includes Niger, Burkina Faso and Mali.

Niger is also one of the biggest beneficiaries of USAID's programs through the Bureau of Humanitarian Assistance.

As for the U.S.'s role in extracting Africa's natural resources: China, France, Japan, and Spain are the largest extractors of uranium in Niger. China is also the single largest harvester of Nigeria's lithium. Two private U.S. companies, Chevron and Exxon Mobile, are involved in Nigeria's oil production through local subsidiaries.

Nigerian oil

The Nigerian government controls all sectors of the nation's oil and gas industries through the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, NNPC, the largest oil producer in Nigeria that operates under joint ventures with about 50 gas and oil companies.

The Escaravos GTL (gas to liquids) plant that Hundeyin named in his X post is a local subsidiary of the U.S. private firm Chevron and has a 75% share of that plant's production in partnership with NNPC, which controls the remaining 25%.

Apart from Chevron, the top five oil and gas companies operating in Nigeria include a Nigerian government-controlled subsidiary of the British Shell Energy Nigeria; a Nigerian government-controlled local subsidiary of the U.S. Exxon Mobil; a Nigerian government-controlled subsidiary of French firm Total Energies and Italian Eni Spa; and Equinor ASA, another Chevron subsidiary, co-owned by a local firm, Prime 127 Nigeria Ltd.

Nigeria lost to corruption and mismanagement an estimated $35 billion in oil revenues between 2019 and 2022.

Eni Spa, Exxon, Shell, and TotalEnergies have all sought to exit Nigeria's oil-rich Niger Delta in recent years, citing security concerns, including theft and sabotage, to focus instead on deep-water drilling.

Nigerian lithium

According to public records, the U.S. government has zero involvement in the mining of Nigeria's lithium.

When Tesla, a private U.S. company that manufactures electric vehicles, expressed interest in forming a trade relationship with the Nigerian government to mine lithium, Nigeria declined the offer, conditioning the agreement on Tesla's establishment of a battery factory in Nigeria.

In February 2023, the Nigerian government awarded a contract to build the country's first lithium-processing plant to China's Ming Xin Mineral Separation Nig Ltd. (MXMS), making it the single-largest lithium harvester in the country. China proposed a plan to manufacture batteries for electric vehicles (EVs) in Kaduna, a state in northwestern Nigeria, projected to yield 18,000 metric tons of lithium daily.

Nigeria's Minister of Solid Materials Dele Alake said that ""...no company would be allowed to mine and export raw lithium unless they set up processing and refining plants in Nigeria.""

As of January 2021, the Nigerian government had licensed 185 local companies to commence extraction of lithium in Nassarawa, Kogi, Kwara, Ekiti, and Cross River States.

Nigerien uranium

Hundeyin's suggestion that the U.S. government has stakes in Niger's uranium is also false.

Niger's Ministry of Mines has on its website a list of five companies licensed by the Nigerien government to mine uranium. The list does not include any U.S. firms. Instead, the Nigerien government is the major shareholder, partnering with Chinese, French, Spanish, Japanese, and South African companies.",voanews.com,news,VOA Voice of America,,-0.09019607843137256,453494709,1,https://gdb.voanews.com/939db59d-a8ad-4234-894d-d755e0019bfb_w1200_r1.jpg,

In February 2023, the Nigerian government awarded a contract to build the country's first lithium-processing plant to China's Ming Xin Mineral Separation Nig Ltd. (MXMS), making it the single largest lithium harvester in the country. China proposed a plan to manufacture batteries for electric vehicles (EVs) in Kaduna, a state in northwestern Nigeria projected to yield 18,000 metric tons of lithium daily.

Nigeria's Minister of Solid Materials Dele Alake said, that ''...no company would be allowed to mine and export raw lithium unless they set up processing and refining plants in Nigeria.''

As of January 2021, the Nigerian government had licensed 185 local companies to commence extraction of lithium in Nassarawa, Kogi, Kwara, Ekiti, and Cross River States.

Nigerien Uranium

Hundeyin's suggestion that the U.S. government has stakes in Niger's uranium is also false.

Niger's Ministry of Mines has on its website a list of five companies licensed by the Nigerien government to mine uranium. The list does not include any U.S. firms. Instead, the Nigerien government is the major shareholder, partnering with Chinese, French, Spanish, Japanese, and South African companies.",polygraph.info,news,POLYGRAPH.info,,-0.3098039215686275,453493431,1,https://gdb.polygraph.info/939db59d-a8ad-4234-894d-d755e0019bfb_w1200_r1.jpg,

Details of the Swap

As part of this agreement, Equinor will increase its ownership in the Heidrun field and the Noatun discovery while decreasing its stakes in the Tyrihans field, the Johan Castberg field, and the Carmen and Beta discoveries. Currently, Equinor holds a 13% equity interest in the Heidrun field, whereas Petoro has a significant 57.8% stake. Conversely, Equinor's ownership in Tyrihans stands at 58.8%, with Petoro holding no equity in that field.

Kjetil Hove, Equinor's executive vice president for Exploration and Production Norway, stated that the company plans to keep developing and creating value on the Norwegian continental shelf, aiming to sustain high production with reduced emissions by 2035. He emphasized that having aligned ownership around major production hubs is crucial for achieving long-term value creation.

Post-Transaction Ownership Structure

Upon completion of the transaction, Equinor will own 34.4% of Heidrun and 36.3% of Tyrihans, while Petoro will hold 36.4% of Heidrun and 22.5% of Tyrihans. Equinor's stake in Johan Castberg will be 46.3%. This agreement, effective from Jan 1, 2025, is subject to regulatory approvals and the approval of the Norwegian Parliament.

Strategic Benefits

Hove highlighted that although the swap is value-neutral, the alignment of ownership in the Halten area will eventually create additional value for all parties involved. He noted that balanced partnerships will streamline commercial agreements, reduce operating costs, and speed up new developments, leading to increased production at a lower price.

Field Details and Future Plans

Heidrun and Tyrihans are two of the largest producing fields in the Halten area in the Norwegian Sea. The Heidrun field, in particular, is noted for its long-remaining life on the NCS. Equinor revised its cost estimate for the Johan Castberg project in the Barents Sea last year, with the new estimate reaching $7.4 billion due to rising industry costs. The production start-up for Johan Castberg is slated for the fourth quarter of 2024.

In addition to these field developments, Equinor is actively pursuing decarbonization efforts, targeting a reduction of carbon emissions from the Norwegian Continental Shelf by 160,000 tons of carbon dioxide per year through the use of onshore power.

SM Energy is set to expand its oil-centered operations in the coming years with an increasing focus on crude oil, especially in the Permian Basin and Eagle Ford regions. The company's attractive oil and gas investments can create long-term value for shareholders.

But there are still hurdles to clear before the central bank can pull the trigger, one Big Six bank economist is arguing.

After blockbuster April jobs numbers left markets second-guessing the wisdom of calls for a June rate trim, many Bay Street number crunchers turned their attention to Canada's May 21 consumer price index (CPI) report, describing it as key to the next rate decision.

Bank of Montreal's chief economist Douglas Porter called the back-pedalling on a June cut ""kneejerk,"" in a note last Friday, though he did acknowledge the surprise addition of 90,000 new jobs ""will give the bank some pause.""

However, he said he is wary of placing too much importance on one ""lone"" CPI report, and argues that U.S. inflation lurks as a ""hurdle"" for the Bank of Canada and rate cuts.

U.S. inflation has recently accelerated, causing markets to erase almost all Federal Reserve interest rate cuts for 2024, except for possibly one in December.

Prices outside the volatile food and energy categories rose 0.4 per cent from February to March, the same accelerated pace as in the previous month. Measured from a year earlier, those core prices were up 3.8 per cent, unchanged from the year-over-year rise in February. The Fed closely tracks core prices because they tend to provide a good read of where inflation is headed.

""Another sour result there may well sink rate cut prospects overall, as it would reinforce the message that inflation truly is stuck at just above three per cent,"" Porter said in his note.

Three per cent is the top end of the Bank of Canada's target range for inflation. The bottom is one per cent.

The U.S. Labor Department reports inflation for April this morning.

Bank of Montreal expects overall inflation to come in at 0.4 per cent month over month, matching last month's results and that core inflation, which excludes food and energy, will rise 0.3 per cent in April from March.

Economist Claire Fan at Royal Bank of Canada expects to see some slowing in U.S. inflation calling for year-over-year core price growth to decelerate to 3.6 per cent from 3.8 per cent in March.

""Some signs of slower price growth (if materialized) would be welcomed by Fed officials, but the details of earlier price increases have been concerning,"" Fan said. ""It will take more than one softer price report to calm inflation fears.""

Looking at U.S. inflation through a wider lens, Derek Holt, an economist at Bank of Nova Scotia, said in a note that core, month-over-month U.S. inflation is running at a ""too hot"" four per cent annualized.

Even if U.S. inflation comes in cooler, the die might already be cast. In the 15 years up to 2021, the U.S. monthly core measure has never come in above 0.3 per cent -- it was 0.4 per cent in March -- Porter said.

""We have seemingly become inured to higher readings,"" the Toronto-based economist said. ""Suffice it to say that in such an environment of still-meaty U.S. inflation, BoC hesitancy is perfectly understandable.""

If, however, the Bank of Canada does decide to cut rates, Porter said it can possibly take comfort in the company of other central banks seemingly on the verge of taking the plunge.

The Bank of England (BoE) held rates last week, but nonetheless opened the door to a cut in June, the economist said, noting two members of the BoE's monetary policy committee voted to cut next month.

""The ECB has been loudly hinting at a June cut as well, and we're on board with that call,"" Porter said.

If the Bank of Canada does decide to make a first cut in June, ""at least (it) won't be on its own,"" he said.

In the more than two years since Russia invaded Ukraine, sending energy prices soaring, Norwegian oil and gas giant Equinor ASA has quietly picked up the crown that once belonged to Russia's Gazprom PJSC. Norway now supplies 30 per cent of the bloc's gas; Gazprom provided about 35 per cent of all Europe's gas before the war. And of the more than 109 billion cubic meters of natural gas Norway exported to Europe last year -- enough to power Germany until 2026 -- roughly two-thirds was marketed and sold by Equinor. -- Bloomberg

The change to capital gains tax rates, proposed in the federal budget, has angered so many people that discussion about the topic remains alive and lively almost a month after the federal Liberals unveiled the plan. Kim Moody argues the controversial proposal should be delayed, if not scrapped altogether, as there remain many unanswered questions about the changes, leaving Canadians 'planning in the dark' with a June 25 deadline for the switchover looming.

          1m ago","Natural gas consumption went up by 12.8 percent during the fourth quarter of last year ended in December, compared to similar quarter of 2022, fueled by expand of demands by power generation plants.

Data by Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation (TPDC) show that power generating plans, which consume 85.6 percent of produced natural gas, consumed 18,524.8 million standard cubic feet (mscf) during the fourth quarter of last year, compared to 16,150.8 mscf consumed in Q4, 2022.

During the reported period, gas production amounted to 21,935.6mscf, an increase of 4.7 percent, compared to 20,948.1 mscf produced in the fourth quarter of 2022.

Production by Mnazi Bay fields, which accounts for 49.7 percent of total gas production in Tanzania, increased by 32 percent to 10,896.8 mscf from 8,257.7 mscf, while production at Songo Songo fields, which accounts for 50.3 percent of total production slowed by 13 percent to 11,038.8 mscf from 12,690.4 mscf respectively.

The increase in gas production was on account of a rise in demand by Tanzania Electric Supply Company Limited (Tanesco) for the generation of electricity.

Power generated by Tanesco increased to 2.2 million megawatt hour at the end of December last year, of which half is produced from natural gas, an increase from 1.9 million megawatts hour generated during the fourth quarter of 2022.

Natural gas is the cleanest-burning hydrocarbon, producing around half the carbon dioxide (CO2) and just one tenth of the air pollutants of coal when burnt to generate electricity.

The TPDC statistics shows consumption by industries, which account for 14.2 percent of total natural gas consumption slightly increased by 1.7 percent to 3,064.2 mscf at the end of the fourth quarter of last year from 3,011.9 mscf consumed in Q4, 2022.

Vehicle consumption of natural gas, which account for 0.2 percent of total consumption, more than doubled to 41.9 mscf from 17.1 mscf respectively.

However, households and others consumption declined by 11.6 percent and 1.5 percent to 1.1 mscf and 3 mscf respectively at the end of December 2023, compared to 1.2 mscf and 3 mscf recorded at the end of December 2022.

Tanzania's natural gas reserves stood at 57.5 trillion cubic feet, of which over 47 trillion cubic feet were to be found in offshore fields. That same year, natural gas production in the country amounted to some 57 billion cubic feet.

Despite of abundant gas reserves, the country accounts for 0.05 percent of global production, making it the world's 14th-largest producer. Plans are underway to construct the US$45 billion Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) plant.

Tanzania targets 2028 for the final investment decision that will make it the region's LNG giant, with international oil companies Shell Plc and Norway's Equinor ASA as the lead partners and the participating interest from the Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation (TPDC).

The country has also developed the natural gas policy to provide guidance for the sustainable development and utilization of the natural gas resource and maximization of the benefits therefrom and contribute to the transformation and diversification of the Tanzanian economy""",ippmedia.com,news,IPP Media,Joseph Prosper,0.4039215686274509,453455031,1,,

Then came news of a leak at Europe's biggest liquefied natural gas plant, located above the Arctic circle in Norway.

The problem - discovered during a planned test of the facility's safety systems - was quickly repaired, but not before it caused a momentary spike in the price of natural gas.

Back in the Netherlands, it served as an uncomfortable reminder of the power of a single company, Equinor ASA.

In the more than two years since Russia invaded Ukraine, sending energy prices soaring, the Norwegian oil and gas giant has quietly picked up the crown that once belonged to Russia's Gazprom PJSC.

Norway now supplies 30% of the bloc's gas; Gazprom provided about 35% of all Europe's gas before the war. And of the more than 109 billion cubic m of natural gas Norway exported to Europe last year -enough to power Germany until 2026 -roughly two-thirds was marketed and sold by Equinor.

So long as the bloc continues to depend heavily on fossil fuels, Norwegian hydrocarbons will be essential to keeping the lights on in Europe.

Equinor's visibility ""dramatically changed with reduced flows from Russia,"" said Irene Rummelhoff, the company's head of midstream, marketing and processing. ""There was a point in time where (Europe) almost took us for granted. That is no longer the case.""

The company's new prominence has also raised questions about whether European leaders are, once again, putting their countries at risk by relying too heavily on a single supplier.

Although Norway is perceived as a steady trading partner with a long and consistent history of delivering energy to Europe, extended outages and its handling of maintenance challenges, both of which affect energy prices, have had ripple effects across the continent.

Part of the company's good fortune has to do with a broader shift in Europe's relationship to fossil fuels, Thina Margrethe Saltvedt, chief analyst for sustainable finance at Nordea Bank Abp, said in an interview.

Five years ago, ""there was a lot of talk about the green transition and how we were starting to see the oil and gas industry sunset,"" she said.

""Then Covid happened, then the war in Ukraine, and now you simply don't see it anymore. The focus has turned to energy security.""

The notion that gas won't disappear anytime soon, a view strongly endorsed by the gas industry, has thrust Norway to the centre of the conversation around securing Europe's energy resources.

German Economy Minister Robert Habeck - who is also in charge of climate policy in the region's biggest economy - made an official visit to Oslo in early January 2023.

Commission president Ursula von der Leyen travelled two months later to Norway's Troll natural gas field, which provides 10% of the continent's supplies.

European Union (EU) energy czar Kadri Simson has also visited Norway twice in the past two years.

Speaking at an event in the Norwegian capital in March, Simson told a hall filled with the country's oil and gas elite that ""the EU continues to count on Norway as a partner for conventional sources,"" and offered her appreciation for its help during the energy crisis.

Because Norway's gas prices are higher than Russia's, there was some fuming after Russian exports shrank about Norway benefiting at Europe's expense.

But criticism abated as governments and traders accepted the new market conditions. The non-EU member has never been shy about the importance it places on gas - Norway has long advocated that gas should place a central role in the bloc's green transition - and now it is finding more willing counterparts.

In late April, German chancellor Olaf Scholz thanked Norway for enabling his country to become independent of Russian gas ""within just a few months,"" and praised it as ""the perfect partner"" for securing Germany and Europe's supply.

Norway's new role as gas purveyor to Europe has been very profitable - gas exports hit a record high of 1.4 trillion kroner in 2022 - but it has also cast a question mark over Norway's green future.

While the country has become a leader in initiatives like the transition to electric vehicles, the recent surge in demand for gas has had the effect of redirecting financial resources and talent back into the oil and gas sector.

Organisations such as Greenpeace have expressed concern that Europe's embrace of Norwegian gas could come at the expense of the broader green transition. And for traders, going all in on Equinor brings a different set of problems.

Equinor's growing relevance in Europe came into sharp focus last summer, when the company announced that maintenance at some of its biggest gas facilities was being extended. Within minutes, gas prices rose almost 20%.

The response was especially intense as traders had mostly been betting that prices would slump. Sluggish demand and the fact that the region's gas inventories would be full by the end of the summer had led them to think that Europe had finally gotten over the worst of the energy crisis.

Unusually hot weather on the continent, which normally increases energy use, amplified concern. The outages reduced Norway's exports for a few weeks and prompted trading desks to weigh the ""Equinor maintenance affect"" more heavily. -- Bloomberg",thestar.com.my,news,The Star ,,0.06666666666666665,453426361,1,https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2024/05/15/2694956.jpg,eng-9563546

Equinor ASA EQNR inked a value-neutral asset swap agreement with Norwegian state-owned oil firm Petoro in the Haltenbanken region.

As per the terms, Equinor will increase its ownership in the Heidrun field and Noatun discovery and reduce its ownership in the Tyrihans field and the Castberg field, as well as the Carmen and Beta discoveries.

Heidrun and Tyrihans are two of the largest producing fields in the Halten area in the Norwegian Sea.

Currently, Equinor holds a low equity interest in the Heidrun field of 13.0%, while Petoro has an equity interest of 57.8%.

For Tyrihans, Equinor's ownership is high, at 58.8%, while Petoro does not hold any equity.

Post deal closure, Equinor will own 34.4% of Heidrun and 36.3% of Tyrihans, while Petoro will own 36.4% of Heidrun and 22.5% of Tyrihans. Meanwhile, Equinor's ownership of Johan Castberg will be 46.3%.

The swap agreement, which is effective January 1, 2025, is subject to regulatory approvals and approval by the Norwegian Parliament.

Kjetil Hove, executive vice president for Exploration and Production Norway said, ""We have a strategy to continue the development and the value creation on the Norwegian continental shelf and expect to maintain a high production with lower emissions towards 2035. Alignment of ownership around the larger production hubs are important enablers for long-term value creation.""

""Although this is a value-neutral swap, this alignment of ownership will add more value to all parties from the Halten-area over time. Balanced partnerships will simplify commercial agreements, lower operating costs, and accelerate new developments with added production at a lower cost.""

Across Africa, more than 900 million people -- or about three-quarters of the population -- rely on open fires and basic stoves that burn charcoal and wood to cook meals. That practice leads to the premature death of about 600,000 people, mainly women and children, a year.

""This summit has delivered an emphatic commitment to an issue that has been ignored by too many people, for too long,"" International Energy Agency Executive Director Fatih Birol said in a statement released at the conference convened by the IEA on Tuesday.

Pledges came from the African Development Bank, the European Union and Vitol SA among others.

The IEA estimates that Africa needs $4 billion in annual investments to end the use of inefficient wood and charcoal fires and stoves by 2030, with Birol suggesting in an earlier interview that the sale of carbon credits could go some way to meeting that goal.

Achieving the target would cut annual emissions of climate-warming carbon dioxide or its equivalent by 800 million tons annually, more than the amount emitted by South Africa, the world's 15th-biggest source of greenhouse gases.

""Speed and scale is what is needed to resolve the charcoal epidemic in Africa,"" said Greg Murray, the chief executive officer and co-founder of Koko Networks, which sells stoves that use renewable ethanol in Kenya and Rwanda.

While there has been some improvement in the use of clean-cooking technology in Asian countries, progress in Africa has lagged behind. The World Bank estimates the cost of inaction in sub-Saharan Africa at $330 billion annually because of the impact on health and the climate.

Separately, the World Liquid Gas Association said Equinor ASA and TotalEnergies SE will be part of a task force that will promote access to liquefied petroleum gas for cooking in Africa and will present a plan to the COP29 international climate summit later this year.

Petredec Ltd., Oryx Energies SA and S&P Global Inc. will also form part of the task force.

Source: SaltWire

After Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, energy prices skyrocketed and Russia itself was subject to additional sanctions. Against this backdrop, the Norwegian oil and gas giant Equinor ASA has become the leading supplier of fuel to Europe, replacing Russia's Gazprom.

Now Norway supplies 30% of gas to the EU countries, while Gazprom provided about 35% of all gas to Europe before the Great War. Bloomberg writes about this.

""And of the more than 109 billion cubic meters of natural gas Norway exported to Europe last year - enough to power Germany until 2026 - about two-thirds was sold by Equinor,"" the article says.

In this regard, Equinor plays a major role in the ups and downs of gas prices across the continent.

At the end of April, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz thanked Norway for allowing his country to become independent of Russian gas ""in just a few months."" He called Oslo an ideal partner for securing gas supplies to Germany and Europe.

According to Irene Rummelhoff, Head of Intermediate Flow, Marketing and Processing at Equinor, the company's visibility has changed significantly with the decline in gas flows from Russia. ""There was a time when [Europe] took us almost for granted. This is no longer the case,"" she said.

Natural gas supplies from Norway are expected to reach a new record this year. Equinor is working to increase its capacity and optimize its maintenance operations. The country's government aims to make Norway a ""stable and long-term energy supplier"" to Europe over the coming decades.

As reported, Gazprom's profits fell by more than 30%, resulting in a loss of 629 billion rubles (or 6.9 billion US dollars), the highest in 25 years. This drop is due to geopolitical turbulence, such as Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the deterioration of relations with the West, which have severely limited the company's operations.

To compensate for these losses, Gazprom has turned to China.

Equinor ASA (NYSE:EQNR) recently announced a dividend of $0.35 per share, payable on 2024-05-28, with the ex-dividend date set for 2024-05-15. As investors look forward to this upcoming payment, the spotlight also shines on the company's dividend history, yield, and growth rates. Using the data from GuruFocus, let's look into Equinor ASA's dividend performance and assess its sustainability.

Equinor is a Norway-based integrated oil and gas company. It has been publicly listed since 2001, but the government retains a 67% stake. Operating primarily on the Norwegian Continental Shelf, the firm produced 2.1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2023 (53% liquids) and ended 2023 with 5.2 billion barrels of proven reserves (49% liquids). Operations also include offshore wind, solar, oil refineries and natural gas processing, marketing, and trading.

Equinor ASA has maintained a consistent dividend payment record since 2002. Dividends are currently distributed on a quarterly basis. Below is a chart showing annual Dividends Per Share for tracking historical trends.

As of today, Equinor ASA currently has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 4.19% and a 12-month forward dividend yield of 4.54%. This suggests an expectation of increased dividend payments over the next 12 months. Over the past three years, Equinor ASA's annual dividend growth rate was 23.20%. Extended to a five-year horizon, this rate decreased to 3.80% per year. And over the past decade, Equinor ASA's annual dividends per share growth rate stands at -0.10%.

Based on Equinor ASA's dividend yield and five-year growth rate, the 5-year yield on cost of Equinor ASA stock as of today is approximately 5.05%.

To assess the sustainability of the dividend, one needs to evaluate the company's payout ratio. The dividend payout ratio provides insights into the portion of earnings the company distributes as dividends. A lower ratio suggests that the company retains a significant part of its earnings, thereby ensuring the availability of funds for future growth and unexpected downturns. As of 2024-03-31, Equinor ASA's dividend payout ratio is 0.38.

Equinor ASA's profitability rank, offers an understanding of the company's earnings prowess relative to its peers. GuruFocus ranks Equinor ASA's profitability 7 out of 10 as of 2024-03-31, suggesting good profitability prospects. The company has reported net profit in 7 years out of the past 10 years.

To ensure the sustainability of dividends, a company must have robust growth metrics. Equinor ASA's growth rank of 7 out of 10 suggests that the company's growth trajectory is good relative to its competitors. Revenue is the lifeblood of any company, and Equinor ASA's revenue per share, combined with the 3-year revenue growth rate, indicates a strong revenue model. Equinor ASA's revenue has increased by approximately 45.20% per year on average, a rate that outperforms approximately 88.85% of global competitors.

Considering Equinor ASA's consistent dividend payments, robust growth metrics, and a solid payout ratio, the company's dividends appear sustainable. These factors, combined with its strong profitability, position Equinor ASA favorably for future growth and stability. For investors seeking dividend-paying stocks with potential for appreciation, Equinor ASA presents a compelling case.

Equinor ASA will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.35 on 5/28/24, Pool Corp will pay its quarterly dividend of $1.20 on 5/30/24, and LKQ Corp will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.30 on 5/30/24. As a percentage of EQNR's recent stock price of $28.53, this dividend works out to approximately 1.23%, so look for shares of Equinor ASA to trade 1.23% lower -- all else being equal -- when EQNR shares open for trading on 5/15/24. Similarly, investors should look for POOL to open 0.32% lower in price and for LKQ to open 0.68% lower, all else being equal.

Below are dividend history charts for EQNR, POOL, and LKQ, showing historical dividends prior to the most recent ones declared.

In general, dividends are not always predictable, following the ups and downs of company profits over time. Therefore, a good first due diligence step in forming an expectation of annual yield going forward, is looking at the history above, for a sense of stability over time. This can help in judging whether the most recent dividends from these companies are likely to continue. If they do continue, the current estimated yields on annualized basis would be 4.91% for Equinor ASA, 1.28% for Pool Corp, and 2.71% for LKQ Corp.

In Monday trading, Equinor ASA shares are currently off about 0.1%, Pool Corp shares are up about 0.3%, and LKQ Corp shares are down about 0.2% on the day.

Then came news of a leak at Europe's biggest liquefied natural gas plant, located above the Arctic circle in Norway.

The problem -- discovered during a planned test of the facility's safety systems -- was quickly repaired, but not before it caused a momentary spike in the price of natural gas. Back in the Netherlands, it served as an uncomfortable reminder of the power of a single company, Equinor ASA (NYSE:EQNR).

In the more than two years since Russia invaded Ukraine, sending energy prices soaring, the Norwegian oil and gas giant has quietly picked up the crown that once belonged to Russia's Gazprom PJSC. Norway now supplies 30% of the bloc's gas; Gazprom provided about 35% of all Europe's gas before the war. And of the more than 109 billion cubic meters of natural gas Norway exported to Europe last year -- enough to power Germany until 2026 -- roughly two-thirds was marketed and sold by Equinor.

So long as the bloc continues to depend heavily on fossil fuels, Norwegian hydrocarbons will be essential to keeping the lights on in Europe.

Equinor's visibility ""dramatically changed with reduced flows from Russia,"" said Irene Rummelhoff, the company's head of midstream, marketing and processing. ""There was a point in time where [Europe] almost took us for granted. That is no longer the case.""

The company's new prominence has also raised questions about whether European leaders are, once again, putting their countries at risk by relying too heavily on a single supplier. Although Norway is perceived as a steady trading partner with a long and consistent history of delivering energy to Europe, extended outages and its handling of maintenance challenges, both of which affect energy prices, have had ripple effects across the continent.

Part of the company's good fortune has to do with a broader shift in Europe's relationship to fossil fuels, Thina Margrethe Saltvedt, chief analyst for sustainable finance at Nordea Bank Abp, said in an interview.

Five years ago, ""there was a lot of talk about the green transition and how we were starting to see the oil and gas industry sunset,"" she said. ""Then Covid happened, then the war in Ukraine, and now you simply don't see it anymore. The focus has turned to energy security.""

The notion that gas won't disappear anytime soon, a view strongly endorsed by the gas industry, has thrust Norway to the center of the conversation around securing Europe's energy resources. German Economy Minister Robert Habeck -- who is also in charge of climate policy in the region's biggest economy -- made an official visit to Oslo in early January 2023. Commission President Ursula von der Leyen travelled two months later to Norway's Troll natural gas field, which provides 10% of the continent's supplies.

EU energy czar Kadri Simson has also visited Norway twice in the past two years. Speaking at an event in the Norwegian capital in March, Simson told a hall filled with the country's oil and gas elite that ""the EU continues to count on Norway as a partner for conventional sources,"" and offered her appreciation for its help during the energy crisis.

Because Norway's gas prices are higher than Russia's, there was some fuming after Russian exports shrank about Norway benefiting at Europe's expense. But criticism abated as governments and traders accepted the new market conditions. The non-EU member has never been shy about the importance it places on gas -- Norway has long advocated that gas should place a central role in the bloc's green transition -- and now it is finding more willing counterparts. In late April, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz thanked Norway for enabling his country to become independent of Russian gas ""within just a few months,"" and praised it as ""the perfect partner"" for securing Germany and Europe's supply.

Norway's new role as gas purveyor to Europe has been very profitable -- gas exports hit a record high of 1.4 trillion kroner ($130 billion) in 2022 -- but it has also cast a question mark over Norway's green future. While the country has become a leader in initiatives like the transition to electric vehicles, the recent surge in demand for gas has had the effect of redirecting financial resources and talent back into the oil and gas sector. Organizations such as Greenpeace have expressed concern that Europe's embrace of Norwegian gas could come at the expense of the broader green transition.

And for traders, going all in on Equinor brings a different set of problems.

Equinor's growing relevance in Europe came into sharp focus last summer, when the company announced that maintenance at some of its biggest gas facilities was being extended. Within minutes, gas prices rose almost 20%.

The response was especially intense as traders had mostly been betting that prices would slump. Sluggish demand and the fact that the region's gas inventories would be full by the end of the summer had led them to think that Europe had finally gotten over the worst of the energy crisis. Unusually hot weather on the continent, which normally increases energy use, amplified concern.

The unplanned outages severely reduced Norway's exports for a few weeks and prompted trading desks across the continent to weigh the ""Equinor maintenance effect"" more heavily in their models. As the price of gas became even more exposed to the company's status, traders started to pay closer attention to the daily messages sent out by another Norwegian company, Gassco AS, about changes to maintenance schedules across the country.

Within Equinor, there are ""information barriers and procedures to ensure compliance with regulations so that all market participants can access market sensitive information at the same time,"" a company spokesman said, adding that Gassco acts as a ""neutral and independent system operator.""

Traders were already on alert for surprise outages. Until the end of 2021, Gazprom had mostly been a reliable supplier -- a big reason why gas prices stayed stable over the last decade. When interruptions suddenly started to happen more frequently, prices spiked, triggering the energy crisis.

What nobody knew back then is that reducing gas flows was part of the run-up to Putin's invasion of Ukraine. Around November, traders started to account for the loss of Russian supply in their pricing models.

Europe is on a far better footing than it was a year ago, but circumstances remain volatile. Any threat to fuel supply can roil markets, and that, in turn, can have downstream effects: persistent price swings in the natural gas market can encourage industrial companies to limit their fuel usage and push household bills higher. ""Norway is expected to meet more of Europe's gas needs this summer as its facilities bounce back from the extensive maintenance seen last year,"" BloombergNEF's Nnenna Amobi wrote in a note on May 1. ""But,"" she added, ""unplanned outages could yet curtail flows and send prices upward.""

At the same time, natural gas supplies from Norway may reach a new record this year. Equinor has been working to increase its capacity, and to reduce bottlenecks by streamlining maintenance work. The mantra within the country's government - often repeated by energy minister Terje Aasland - is that Norway will be a ""stable and long-term supplier of energy"" for decades to come.

It remains to be seen whether that will pan out. With a new wave of LNG from the US and Qatar coming online in the next few years, ""the importance of Equinor and Norway's gas to Europe is going to eventually decline,"" said Christopher Kuplent, Bank of America Corp.'s head of European energy research, noting that Norway will ""find it hard to organically grow its gas production and therefore export substantially more."" The new projects will, he added, ""make it, at least on paper, a little more comfortable for the European gas consumer to negotiate prices down.""

Moreover, said Equinor's Rummelhoff, a jump in the volumes of liquefied natural gas being imported to Europe recently has already helped ""normalize the market.""

For now, focus within Equinor is on keeping things running as smoothly as possible. ""Do we feel under pressure? We've always felt that,"" remarked Kjetil Hove, the company's head of production in Norway.",energyvoice.com,news,Energy Voice,Mathew Perry,0.06666666666666665,453304977,1,https://www.energyvoice.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/02/image-jafv0lnt.jpg,

When the world's top gas traders met in late April at a canal-side hotel on the outskirts of Amsterdam, the atmosphere was business-as-usual: coffee, croissants and wrangling over deals for the upcoming winter. Then came news of a leak at Europe's biggest liquefied natural gas plant, located above the Arctic circle in Norway.

The problem -- discovered during a planned test of the facility's safety systems -- was quickly repaired, but not before it caused a momentary spike in the price of natural gas. Back in the Netherlands, it served as an uncomfortable reminder of the power of a single company, Equinor ASA.

In the more than two years since Russia invaded Ukraine, sending energy prices soaring, the Norwegian oil and gas giant has quietly picked up the crown that once belonged to Russia's Gazprom PJSC. Norway now supplies 30% of the bloc's gas; Gazprom provided about 35% of all Europe's gas before the war. And of the more than 109 billion cubic meters of natural gas Norway exported to Europe last year -- enough to power Germany until 2026 -- roughly two-thirds was marketed and sold by Equinor.

So long as the bloc continues to depend heavily on fossil fuels, Norwegian hydrocarbons will be essential to keeping the lights on in Europe.

Equinor's visibility ""dramatically changed with reduced flows from Russia,"" said Irene Rummelhoff, the company's head of midstream, marketing and processing. ""There was a point in time where [Europe] almost took us for granted. That is no longer the case.""

The company's new prominence has also raised questions about whether European leaders are, once again, putting their countries at risk by relying too heavily on a single supplier. Although Norway is perceived as a steady trading partner with a long and consistent history of delivering energy to Europe, extended outages and its handling of maintenance challenges, both of which affect energy prices, have had ripple effects across the continent.

Part of the company's good fortune has to do with a broader shift in Europe's relationship to fossil fuels, Thina Margrethe Saltvedt, chief analyst for sustainable finance at Nordea Bank Abp, said in an interview.

Five years ago, ""there was a lot of talk about the green transition and how we were starting to see the oil and gas industry sunset,"" she said. ""Then Covid happened, then the war in Ukraine, and now you simply don't see it anymore. The focus has turned to energy security.""

The notion that gas won't disappear anytime soon, a view strongly endorsed by the gas industry, has thrust Norway to the center of the conversation around securing Europe's energy resources. German Economy Minister Robert Habeck -- who is also in charge of climate policy in the region's biggest economy -- made an official visit to Oslo in early January 2023. Commission President Ursula von der Leyen travelled two months later to Norway's Troll natural gas field, which provides 10% of the continent's supplies.

EU energy czar Kadri Simson has also visited Norway twice in the past two years. Speaking at an event in the Norwegian capital in March, Simson told a hall filled with the country's oil and gas elite that ""the EU continues to count on Norway as a partner for conventional sources,"" and offered her appreciation for its help during the energy crisis.

Because Norway's gas prices are higher than Russia's, there was some fuming after Russian exports shrank about Norway benefiting at Europe's expense. But criticism abated as governments and traders accepted the new market conditions. The non-EU member has never been shy about the importance it places on gas -- Norway has long advocated that gas should place a central role in the bloc's green transition -- and now it is finding more willing counterparts. In late April, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz thanked Norway for enabling his country to become independent of Russian gas ""within just a few months,"" and praised it as ""the perfect partner"" for securing Germany and Europe's supply.

Norway's new role as gas purveyor to Europe has been very profitable -- gas exports hit a record high of 1.4 trillion kroner ($130 billion) in 2022 -- but it has also cast a question mark over Norway's green future. While the country has become a leader in initiatives like the transition to electric vehicles, the recent surge in demand for gas has had the effect of redirecting financial resources and talent back into the oil and gas sector. Organizations such as Greenpeace have expressed concern that Europe's embrace of Norwegian gas could come at the expense of the broader green transition.

And for traders, going all in on Equinor brings a different set of problems.

Equinor's growing relevance in Europe came into sharp focus last summer, when the company announced that maintenance at some of its biggest gas facilities was being extended. Within minutes, gas prices rose almost 20%.

The response was especially intense as traders had mostly been betting that prices would slump. Sluggish demand and the fact that the region's gas inventories would be full by the end of the summer had led them to think that Europe had finally gotten over the worst of the energy crisis. Unusually hot weather on the continent, which normally increases energy use, amplified concern.

The unplanned outages severely reduced Norway's exports for a few weeks and prompted trading desks across the continent to weigh the ""Equinor maintenance effect"" more heavily in their models. As the price of gas became even more exposed to the company's status, traders started to pay closer attention to the daily messages sent out by another Norwegian company, Gassco AS, about changes to maintenance schedules across the country.

Within Equinor, there are ""information barriers and procedures to ensure compliance with regulations so that all market participants can access market sensitive information at the same time,"" a company spokesman said, adding that Gassco acts as a ""neutral and independent system operator.""

Traders were already on alert for surprise outages. Until the end of 2021, Gazprom had mostly been a reliable supplier -- a big reason why gas prices stayed stable over the last decade. When interruptions suddenly started to happen more frequently, prices spiked, triggering the energy crisis.

What nobody knew back then is that reducing gas flows was part of the run-up to Putin's invasion of Ukraine. Around November, traders started to account for the loss of Russian supply in their pricing models.

Europe is on a far better footing than it was a year ago, but circumstances remain volatile. Any threat to fuel supply can roil markets, and that, in turn, can have downstream effects: persistent price swings in the natural gas market can encourage industrial companies to limit their fuel usage and push household bills higher. ""Norway is expected to meet more of Europe's gas needs this summer as its facilities bounce back from the extensive maintenance seen last year,"" BloombergNEF's Nnenna Amobi wrote in a note on May 1. ""But,"" she added, ""unplanned outages could yet curtail flows and send prices upward.""

At the same time, natural gas supplies from Norway may reach a new record this year. Equinor has been working to increase its capacity, and to reduce bottlenecks by streamlining maintenance work. The mantra within the country's government - often repeated by energy minister Terje Aasland - is that Norway will be a ""stable and long-term supplier of energy"" for decades to come.

It remains to be seen whether that will pan out. With a new wave of LNG from the US and Qatar coming online in the next few years, ""the importance of Equinor and Norway's gas to Europe is going to eventually decline,"" said Christopher Kuplent, Bank of America Corp.'s head of European energy research, noting that Norway will ""find it hard to organically grow its gas production and therefore export substantially more."" The new projects will, he added, ""make it, at least on paper, a little more comfortable for the European gas consumer to negotiate prices down.""

Moreover, said Equinor's Rummelhoff, a jump in the volumes of liquefied natural gas being imported to Europe recently has already helped ""normalize the market.""

For now, focus within Equinor is on keeping things running as smoothly as possible. ""Do we feel under pressure? We've always felt that,"" remarked Kjetil Hove, the company's head of production in Norway.",energynow.ca,news,Energy News for the Canadian Oil & Gas Industry | EnergyNow.ca,,0.1843137254901961,453297562,1,https://energynow.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Equinor-Norway-1200x810-1024x691.png,

To be built in the Baltic Sea, about 27 km (16.8 miles) and 40 km from the port of Leba respectively, the two wind projects will comprise 100 offshore wind turbines with an overall capacity of 1,440 MW. Turbine installation is slated to commence in 2027. Cadeler said it will use both an O-Class and a P-Class vessel for the project. The contracts that are to be negotiated based on the vessel reservation agreements are expected to be worth a total of between EUR 110 million (USD 119m) and EUR 130 million.

Cadeler CEO Mikkel Gleerup said that the Polish market offers great business potential for the company. ""This also marks our first contract with Equinor and Polenergia, setting the stage for new successful future partnerships,"" Gleerup added.

Polenergia and Equinor in February signed a final agreement with Siemens Gamesa for the supply of the turbines for Baltyk II and Baltyk III.

The problem -- discovered during a planned test of the facility's safety systems -- was quickly repaired, but not before it caused a momentary spike in the price of natural gas. Back in the Netherlands, it served as an uncomfortable reminder of the power of a single company, Equinor ASA.

In the more than two years since Russia invaded Ukraine, sending energy prices soaring, the Norwegian oil and gas giant has quietly picked up the crown that once belonged to Russia's Gazprom PJSC. Norway now supplies 30% of the bloc's gas; Gazprom provided about 35% of all Europe's gas before the war. And of the more than 109 billion cubic meters of natural gas Norway exported to Europe last year -- enough to power Germany until 2026 -- roughly two-thirds was marketed and sold by Equinor.

So long as the bloc continues to depend heavily on fossil fuels, Norwegian hydrocarbons will be essential to keeping the lights on in Europe.

Equinor's visibility ""dramatically changed with reduced flows from Russia,"" said Irene Rummelhoff, the company's head of midstream, marketing and processing. ""There was a point in time where [Europe] almost took us for granted. That is no longer the case.""

The company's new prominence has also raised questions about whether European leaders are, once again, putting their countries at risk by relying too heavily on a single supplier.

The non-EU member has never been shy about the importance it places on gas -- Norway has long advocated that gas should place a central role in the bloc's green transition -- and now it is finding more willing counterparts. In late April, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz thanked Norway for enabling his country to become independent of Russian gas ""within just a few months,"" and praised it as ""the perfect partner"" for securing Germany and Europe's supply.

Norway's new role as gas purveyor to Europe has been very profitable -- gas exports hit a record high of 1.4 trillion kroner ($130 billion) in 2022 -- but it has also cast a question mark over Norway's green future. While the country has become a leader in initiatives like the transition to electric vehicles, the recent surge in demand for gas has had the effect of redirecting financial resources and talent back into the oil and gas sector. Organizations such as Greenpeace have expressed concern that Europe's embrace of Norwegian gas could come at the expense of the broader green transition.

And for traders, going all in on Equinor brings a different set of problems.

Equinor's growing relevance in Europe came into sharp focus last summer, when the company announced that maintenance at some of its biggest gas facilities was being extended. Within minutes, gas prices rose almost 20%.

The response was especially intense as traders had mostly been betting that prices would slump. Sluggish demand and the fact that the region's gas inventories would be full by the end of the summer had led them to think that Europe had finally gotten over the worst of the energy crisis. Unusually hot weather on the continent, which normally increases energy use, amplified concern.

The unplanned outages severely reduced Norway's exports for a few weeks and prompted trading desks across the continent to weigh the ""Equinor maintenance effect"" more heavily in their models. As the price of gas became even more exposed to the company's status, traders started to pay closer attention to the daily messages sent out by another Norwegian company, Gassco AS, about changes to maintenance schedules across the country.

Within Equinor, there are ""information barriers and procedures to ensure compliance with regulations so that all market participants can access market sensitive information at the same time,"" a company spokesman said, adding that Gassco acts as a ""neutral and independent system operator.""

Traders were already on alert for surprise outages. Until the end of 2021, Gazprom had mostly been a reliable supplier -- a big reason why gas prices stayed stable over the last decade. When interruptions suddenly started to happen more frequently, prices spiked, triggering the energy crisis.

What nobody knew back then is that reducing gas flows was part of the run-up to Putin's invasion of Ukraine. Around November, traders started to account for the loss of Russian supply in their pricing models.

Europe is on a far better footing than it was a year ago, but circumstances remain volatile. Any threat to fuel supply can roil markets, and that, in turn, can have downstream effects: persistent price swings in the natural gas market can encourage industrial companies to limit their fuel usage and push household bills higher. ""Norway is expected to meet more of Europe's gas needs this summer as its facilities bounce back from the extensive maintenance seen last year,"" BloombergNEF's Nnenna Amobi wrote in a note on May 1. ""But,"" she added, ""unplanned outages could yet curtail flows and send prices upward.""

At the same time, natural gas supplies from Norway may reach a new record this year. Equinor has been working to increase its capacity, and to reduce bottlenecks by streamlining maintenance work. The mantra within the country's government - often repeated by energy minister Terje Aasland - is that Norway will be a ""stable and long-term supplier of energy"" for decades to come.

It remains to be seen whether that will pan out. With a new wave of LNG from the US and Qatar coming online in the next few years, ""the importance of Equinor and Norway's gas to Europe is going to eventually decline,"" said Christopher Kuplent, Bank of America Corp.'s head of European energy research, noting that Norway will ""find it hard to organically grow its gas production and therefore export substantially more."" The new projects will, he added, ""make it, at least on paper, a little more comfortable for the European gas consumer to negotiate prices down.""

Moreover, said Equinor's Rummelhoff, a jump in the volumes of liquefied natural gas being imported to Europe recently has already helped ""normalize the market.""

For now, focus within Equinor is on keeping things running as smoothly as possible. ""Do we feel under pressure? We've always felt that,"" remarked Kjetil Hove, the company's head of production in Norway.

The problem -- discovered during a planned test of the facility's safety systems -- was quickly repaired, but not before it caused a momentary spike in the price of natural gas. Back in the Netherlands, it served as an uncomfortable reminder of the power of a single company, Equinor ASA.

In the more than two years since Russia invaded Ukraine, sending energy prices soaring, the Norwegian oil and gas giant has quietly picked up the crown that once belonged to Russia's Gazprom PJSC. Norway now supplies 30% of the bloc's gas; Gazprom provided about 35% of all Europe's gas before the war. And of the more than 109 billion cubic meters of natural gas Norway exported to Europe last year -- enough to power Germany until 2026 -- roughly two-thirds was marketed and sold by Equinor.

So long as the bloc continues to depend heavily on fossil fuels, Norwegian hydrocarbons will be essential to keeping the lights on in Europe.

Equinor's visibility ""dramatically changed with reduced flows from Russia,"" said Irene Rummelhoff, the company's head of midstream, marketing and processing. ""There was a point in time where [Europe] almost took us for granted. That is no longer the case.""

The company's new prominence has also raised questions about whether European leaders are, once again, putting their countries at risk by relying too heavily on a single supplier. Although Norway is perceived as a steady trading partner with a long and consistent history of delivering energy to Europe, extended outages and its handling of maintenance challenges, both of which affect energy prices, have had ripple effects across the continent.

Part of the company's good fortune has to do with a broader shift in Europe's relationship to fossil fuels, Thina Margrethe Saltvedt, chief analyst for sustainable finance at Nordea Bank Abp, said in an interview.

Five years ago, ""there was a lot of talk about the green transition and how we were starting to see the oil and gas industry sunset,"" she said. ""Then Covid happened, then the war in Ukraine, and now you simply don't see it anymore. The focus has turned to energy security.""

The notion that gas won't disappear anytime soon, a view strongly endorsed by the gas industry, has thrust Norway to the center of the conversation around securing Europe's energy resources. German Economy Minister Robert Habeck -- who is also in charge of climate policy in the region's biggest economy -- made an official visit to Oslo in early January 2023. Commission President Ursula von der Leyen travelled two months later to Norway's Troll natural gas field, which provides 10% of the continent's supplies.

EU energy czar Kadri Simson has also visited Norway twice in the past two years. Speaking at an event in the Norwegian capital in March, Simson told a hall filled with the country's oil and gas elite that ""the EU continues to count on Norway as a partner for conventional sources,"" and offered her appreciation for its help during the energy crisis.

The startup of the the Johan Castberg production vessel later this year ""opens up a new oil province in the Barents Sea, and this field can become a hub for new discoveries,"" Equinor ASA chief executive officer Anders Opedal said, speaking to dockyard workers last Tuesday at the coastal village of Stord, Norway.

Once the infrastructure is in place, it will be easier to connect additional oil finds to the floating production, storage and offloading vessel, he said.

Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store's government is keen to maintain Norway's position as a key energy supplier to Europe, and sees the largely unexplored Arctic as the main source of future reserves.

Estimated to hold more than 60% of Norway's undiscovered hydrocarbon resources, the Barents Sea has long tempted the oil and gas industry, even as harsh conditions and the lack of infrastructure make developing the region difficult.

Norway's pursuit of Arctic oil and gas has come in for some criticism, with opponents arguing that the drilling flouts the country's climate responsibilities.

In 2020, activists took the government to court saying that allowing new oil drilling in the Barents during a climate crisis breaches fundamental human rights. But efforts to block exploration have failed.

Norway today supplies some 30% of Europe's natural gas, becoming its biggest supplier after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Though oil production peaked in the early 2000s, the country still produced over 654 million barrels in 2023, or about 2% of global oil consumption.

The country has reduced the industry's emissions, including by powering offshore platforms with renewable energy from wind turbines, but even with these pioneering efforts Norway remains a major exporter of fossil fuels that ultimately contribute to climate change.

At 313m-long, the Johan Castberg production vessel is about the same length as the world's biggest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford. Its tanks have the capacity to hold as much as 1.1 million barrels of oil, drawn from 30 wells.

The ship will spend much of the summer at the dock and anchored in the fjord near the Stord shipyard undergoing final checks, before heading north to start production in the fourth quarter, eventually ramping up to about 220,000 barrels a day.

""There is enormous value lying on the seabed that this ship will pump up, of course in US dollars and kroner and money for the wealth fund as a result, but basically also energy,"" Finance Minister Trygve Slagsvold Vedum told the crowd at the event last Tuesday. ""That's what the last two years have shown us, is that the world needs energy - people need energy.""

Located above the Arctic circle and about 240km northwest of Europe's biggest liquefied natural gas production facility at Hammerfest, the Johan Castberg field is estimated to hold between 450 million and 650 million barrels of oil.

Licence holders are Equinor with 50%, 30% held by Energi ASA and Petoro ASA with the remaining 20%.

Norwegian oil and gas companies are picking up the pace of drilling this year in the Barents, the Norwegian Offshore Directorate said in January.

Of the 40 to 50 exploration wells planned for 2024, between eight and 10 are in the Barents Sea. This would make 2024 the most active year in the Barents since 2017.

Excitement in what Norway's High North might hold has ebbed and flowed since the region was opened for exploration in 1980. -- Bloomberg",thestar.com.my,news,The Star ,,-0.2,453254318,1,https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2024/05/13/2691194.jpg,

It's well on its way to delivering on its objectives this year, given its strong showing in the first quarter.

That quarter's report once again displayed Enbridge's strength by underscoring the view that the utility and pipeline operator can continue paying an attractive and growing dividend. At 7.2%, it offers a significantly higher yield than the S&P 500 (1.4%). Add in its financial strength and growth prospects, and the company is an ideal option for those seeking passive income.

A strong start to 2024

Enbridge generated $5 billion in adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) during the first quarter and $3.4 billion of distributable cash flow (DCF). Adjusted EBITDA was up 11% from the year-ago period, while DCF rose 9% (and 4% on a per-share basis). Those are strong increases for such a large energy infrastructure company.

It benefited from strong liquids volumes, new customer additions, recently completed expansion projects, and acquisitions. While all four of the company's platforms performed well, its renewables segment stood out. Its adjusted EBITDA doubled, thanks to acquiring added interests in German offshore wind farms, the investment tax credits from its Fox Squirrel solar project in the U.S., and strong European wind-power resources.

Enbridge also reached a key milestone in the quarter, closing the acquisition of the East Ohio Gas Company, one of three gas utility acquisitions from Dominion that it expects to close on this year. That massive deal has been a near-term growth headwind because Enbridge pre-funded most of the purchase price by issuing stock and taking on debt. It will be a growth tailwind in the future, supplying extra sources of incremental stable income and earnings growth.

Adding more fuel for growth

The first quarter's strength gave management the confidence to reaffirm its 2024 financial guidance and long-term outlook. The company enhanced the clarity of that outlook in the quarter by adding several new expansion projects to its backlog:

The company also announced the formation of a new joint venture to develop, own, and operate natural gas pipelines and storage capacity on the U.S. Gulf Coast. The deal will diversify its business, reduce risk, and supply added expansion opportunities. Enbridge is contributing its Rio Bravo Pipeline project to the joint venture.

The company now has around 25 billion Canadian dollars ($18.3 billion) of secured capital projects in its backlog, and it estimates these projects will drive around 3% annual earnings growth through 2028. Optimizations and cost savings will add another 1% to 2% to its bottom line each year.

Management estimates it will invest about $4.4 billion to $5.1 billion annually in secured capital projects. Given its strong free cash flow after paying dividends and its balance sheet strength, Enbridge will have about $730 million to $1.5 billion of added investment capacity each year.

It can use that flexibility to approve more high-return expansion projects, make bolt-on acquisitions, and repurchase shares at opportune moments. Finding investments to deploy its excess investment capital should drive 5% annual adjusted EBITDA growth over the long term.

This growth outlook supports its view that it can continue increasing its dividend. Enbridge has raised its payout every year for nearly three decades.

As solid as it gets

The company grew its earnings and growth prospects with a strong first quarter, putting it in prime position to continue increasing its high-yielding dividend in the coming years. With a firm financial foundation and predictable growth ahead, Enbridge is a bedrock income stock that investors can hold for the long haul.

Image by D3signAllTheThings via iStock

Equinor ASA is acquiring stakes in two lithium project companies in the USA in a move to invest more in the energy transition.

Equinor said in a news release that it has entered into an agreement with Standard Lithium Ltd to acquire a 45 percent share in two lithium project companies in Southwest Arkansas and East Texas.

Under the terms of the agreement, Equinor will ""compensate Standard Lithium for $30 million in past costs net to the acquired interest and will carry Standard Lithium's CAPEX of $33 million to progress the assets towards a possible final investment decision,"" according to the release. Equinor noted that it will make milestone payments of up to $70 million in aggregate to Standard Lithium if a final investment decision is taken.

Standard Lithium and Equinor will respectively own 55 percent and 45 percent of the two project companies, with Standard Lithium retaining operatorship. Equinor will support the operator with core competencies such as subsurface and project execution capabilities.

""Sustainably produced lithium can be an enabler in the energy transition, and we believe it can become an attractive business,"" Morten Halleraker, senior vice president for New Business and Investments in Technology, Digital and Innovation at Equinor, said. ""This investment is an option with limited upfront financial commitment. We can utilize core technologies from oil and gas in a complementary partnership to mature these projects towards a possible final investment decision"".

According to the release, lithium is an essential mineral in the energy transition and is required to meet the projected growth in electric vehicles and broader battery energy storage. Production of lithium from subsurface reservoirs with Direct Lithium Extraction (DLE) technologies is emerging as a production method with a lower environmental footprint than traditional methods.

DLE is a technology that extracts lithium from brines located deep underground and reinjects the brine without lithium back into the subsurface through a second injector well.

Equinor began testing DLE technologies in 2018 to build an understanding of how to scale-up including pre-treatment of subsurface brines and processing battery-grade lithium chemicals.

In 2021, Equinor Ventures invested in Lithium de France, which is developing DLE and geothermal projects in France.

Last month, Equinor approved its first two battery storage projects in the USA in line with its bid to become a leader in the energy transition. The two projects have a combined total capacity of 110 megawatts (MW), providing a valuable source of energy security for the Texas grid once operational, the company said in a separate news release.

Equinor noted that construction has begun on the Sunset Ridge Energy Center in Frio County, Texas; while its Citrus Flatts project in Cameron County, Texas is being prepared for implementation. Once operational, Citrus Flatts and Sunset Ridge are planned to be commercialized by Equinor's wholly owned energy trading house, Danske Commodities.",rigzone.com,news,Rigzone,,0.419607843137255,452961456,1,https://images.rigzone.com/images/news/articles/Equinor-Buys-Stakes-in-USA-Lithium-Projects-176692-582x327.webp,eng-9549448

""In Q3, Standard Lithium continued to execute on our strategic plan, responsibly and efficiently advancing our projects,"" stated Standard Lithium CEO Robert Mintak. ""While the lithium sector has experienced challenges over the past year, we see positive indicators pointing toward stability, and the fundamentals of the lithium market remain strong. This presents a timely moment to showcase our strengths: a strong asset base, favorable jurisdictions, and an industry-leading Direct Lithium Extraction platform. This transformative partnership with Equinor, a global energy company and recognized leader in renewables and low carbon solutions, validates our strategic path to leverage our Smackover resources and become a globally significant contributor within the lithium market. It strengthens our finances, provides essential expertise, manages risk, and accelerates our progress towards this goal, unlocking long-term value for our shareholders.""

Salah Gamoudi, CFO of Standard Lithium stated: ""Since joining the Company, we've prioritized financial efficiency, by securing capital that was minimally dilutive to our shareholders, but allowed us to ensure project continuity throughout our pursuit of securing a strategic partnership. This approach perfectly aligns with the transformative partnership we've secured with Equinor. It enables us to advance our projects in the most value-accretive way for our shareholders while minimizing dilution, cost of capital, and meaningfully lowers future capital requirements. To further take advantage of this momentum, we recently established an office in Austin, Texas. This move enables us to attract top energy sector talent, and allows us to best serve our field and plant employees and communities. Building on our existing strong team with this expertise will empower us to accelerate our execution and advance our projects toward Final Investment Decisions all while collaborating with stakeholders to establish a global model for sustainable development in this uniquely suited region.""

(NYSE: SLI) but lowered its price target to $3.50 from $4.25. The adjustment follows Standard Lithium's recent announcement of a partnership with Equinor ASA (NYSE:EQNR) (EQNR-NC) on May 8, 2024, aimed at advancing its SWA and ETX projects.

The partnership is seen as a beneficial move for Standard Lithium as it provides the company with immediate working capital and helps reduce the costs associated with advancing the SWA and ETX projects.

The assets would give over eight million barrels of oil equivalent reserves and resources to DNO, which is buying the stakes through subsidiary DNO Norge AS, DNO said in a press release Wednesday.

""The transaction creates a new core area for DNO in the North Sea as DNO will hold interests in all producing and under development fields in the greater Norne area, including the Norne hub"", DNO said.

""The transaction includes an interest in four producing fields, Norne (6.9 percent), Skuld (11.5 percent), Urd (11.5 percent) and Marulk (20 percent), plus the ongoing Verdande development (10.5 percent)"", the announcement stated. ""Prior to the transaction, DNO held interests in Marulk (17 percent), Alve (32 percent) and the ongoing Andvare development (32 percent)"".

Expected to close in the third quarter, the transaction would result in DNO raising its stake in Var Energi-operated Marulk to 37 percent. Equinor ASA holds a 33 percent stake in the field, while the other partner is PGNiG Upstream Norway AS with a 30 percent stake.

Marulk, which sits 25 kilometers (15.5 miles) southwest of Norne at a water depth of 370 meters (1,213.9 feet), started producing 2012. Along with the Alve, Skuld and Urd fields, Marulk uses a subsea template tied back to the Norne floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) vessel.

In Norne, which is located 80 km (49.7 miles) north of the Heidrun field at a water depth of 380 meters (1,246.7 feet), Equinor ASA is the operator with a 39.1 percent stake, while 54 percent is held by Petoro AS. It was put onstream 1997.

Skuld, operated by majority state-owned Equinor with a 64 percent stake, came online 2013. It is 20 km (12.4 miles) north of Norne and has a water depth of 340 meters (1,115.5 feet). The other co-venturer is Petoro with a 24.5 percent stake.

Urd, which sits five km (3.1 miles) northeast of Norne at a water depth of 380 meters, started production 2005. Equinor is also the operator with a 64 percent stake, while Petoro owns 24.5 percent.

The non-producing Verdande was discovered 2017 at 10 km (6.2 miles) north of Norne at a water depth of 380 meters. Operator Equinor (59.1 percent) obtained government approval for the development plan last year. The plan involves installing a subsea template tied back to FPSO Norne. The other partners are Petoro (22.4 percent), Aker BP ASA (seven percent) and PGNiG (0.8 percent).

As part of the deal, DNO would transfer its 22.6 percent stake in the producing Ringhorne East field to Var Energi. After the completion of the transaction, Var Energi will increase its stake to 92.58 percent, while Kistos Energy (Norway) AS will retain 7.5 percent.

The North Sea field, which sits six km (3.7 miles) northeast of the Balder field at a water depth of 130 meters (426.5 feet), started production 2006. It has remaining reserves of 1.5 million cubic meters (53 million cubic feet) of oil equivalent, according to information on government website Norskpetroleum.no.

""In terms of production, the transaction (net to DNO, including divestment of Ringhorne East) is estimated to add 3,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) to DNO's output at closing, rising to above 5,000 boepd in 2026 as the Verdande contribution kicks in"", DNO said.

""This transaction is another step in the rebalancing of our North Sea business on the heels of the acquisition of a 25 percent stake in UK's Arran field announced in February"", DNO executive chair Bijan Mossavar-Rahmani said in a statement.",rigzone.com,news,Rigzone,,0.2470588235294118,452933186,6,https://images.rigzone.com/images/news/articles/Var-Energi-to-Sell-Stakes-in-Five-Fields-Offshore-Norway-to-DNO-176685-582x327.webp,

The startup of the the Johan Castberg development later this year ""opens up a new oil province in the Barents Sea, and this field can become a hub for new discoveries,"" Equinor ASA Chief Executive Officer Anders Opedal said, speaking to dockyard workers on Tuesday at the coastal village of Stord, Norway. Once the infrastructure is in place, it will be easier to connect additional oil finds to the floating production, storage and offloading vessel, he said.

Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store's government is keen to maintain Norway's position as a key energy supplier to Europe, and sees the largely unexplored Arctic as the main source of future reserves. Estimated to hold more than 60% of Norway's undiscovered hydrocarbon resources, the Barents Sea has long tempted the oil and gas industry, even as harsh conditions and the lack of infrastructure make developing the region difficult.

Norway's pursuit of Arctic oil and gas has come in for some criticism, with opponents arguing that the drilling flouts the country's climate responsibilities. In 2020, activists took the government to court saying that allowing new oil drilling in the Barents during a climate crisis breaches fundamental human rights. But efforts to block exploration have failed.

Norway today supplies some 30% of Europe's natural gas, becoming its biggest supplier after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Though oil production peaked in the early 2000s, the country still produced over 654 million barrels in 2023, or about 2% of global oil consumption.

The country has reduced the industry's emissions, including by powering offshore platforms with renewable energy from wind turbines, but even with these pioneering efforts Norway remains a major exporter of fossil fuels that ultimately contribute to climate change.

Enormous Value

At 313 meters (1,027 feet) long, the Johan Castberg production vessel is about the same length as the world's biggest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford. Its tanks have the capacity to hold as much as 1.1 million barrels of oil, drawn from 30 wells. The ship will spend much of the summer at the dock and anchored in the fjord near the Stord shipyard undergoing final checks, before heading north to start production in the fourth quarter, eventually ramping up to about 220,000 barrels a day.

""There is enormous value lying on the seabed that this ship will pump up, of course in dollars and kroner and money for the wealth fund as a result, but basically also energy,"" Finance Minister Trygve Slagsvold Vedum told the crowd at the event on Tuesday. ""That's what the last two years have shown us, is that the world needs energy -- people need energy.""

Located above the Arctic circle and about 240 kilometers (150 miles) northwest of Europe's biggest liquefied natural gas production facility at Hammerfest, the Johan Castberg field is estimated to hold between 450 million and 650 million barrels of oil.

License holders are Equinor with 50%, 30% held by Energi ASA and Petoro ASA with the remaining 20%.

Drilling Activity in Norway's Barents Sea Jumps

Norwegian oil and gas companies are picking up the pace of drilling this year in the Barents, the Norwegian Offshore Directorate said in January. Of the 40 to 50 exploration wells planned for 2024, between 8 and 10 are in the Barents Sea. This would make 2024 the most active year in the Barents since 2017.

Excitement in what Norway's High North might hold has ebbed and flowed since the region was opened for exploration in 1980. In 2013, as many as 26 companies applied for new acreage when frontier areas for the industry were offered. In 2021, a similar round attracted just seven.

The 313 meter-long vessel will head for the Johan Castberg development in the Barents Sea.

""Johan Castberg is a mega project for the Norwegian petroleum industry,"" said Kristin Fejerskov Kragseth, CEO of Petoro, which manages the state's direct stakes in oil and gas fields. ""There is a lot to do in the Barents Sea, and we are already planning more development opportunities.""

Equinor ASA EQNR has entered into a strategic partnership with Standard Lithium Ltd SLI, a near-commercial lithium development company.

This partnership aims to expedite the advancement of Standard Lithium's sustainable lithium projects in the Smackover Formation.

The transaction, valued at up to $160 million, marks Equinor's entrance into the lithium sphere. Equinor has a 45% ownership stake in Standard Lithium's projects.

This includes a $30 million cash payment upon closing and an additional investment of up to $130 million contingent on positive Final Investment Decisions.

Equinor will solely fund the first $40 million of development costs at SWA upon completing the transaction and fund the first $20 million in exploration and development costs at the ETX properties.

Standard Lithium will receive up to $70 million in milestone payments associated with SWA and ETX, subject to the parties making Final Investment Decisions by certain dates.

The partnership positions Standard Lithium as the majority owner and operator of the projects, leveraging Equinor's experience in sub-surface assessment and production, project development, and financing.

""This partnership with Equinor is a major accomplishment for Standard Lithium,"" said Standard Lithium CEO Robert Mintak.

""Equinor's culture and values align with ours in using innovation, integrity, and responsible development to enable the global energy transition.""

The transaction is expected to immediately strengthen Standard Lithium's financial position.

The deal was facilitated by financial advisor Citi for Standard Lithium, with legal counsel provided by Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP and Cassels Brock and Blackwell LLP.

Price Action: EQNR shares are trading lower by 0.23% at $28.05 at the last check Wednesday.

Recent Development

Shell's construction of a significant carbon capture and storage project was scheduled to begin in Alberta, Canada, in July 2021. The facility is anticipated to collect 300 million tonnes of carbon dioxide from the company's chemical and refinery units during its operation. Norway-based worldwide energy corporation Equinor ASA teamed with Wintershall Dea AG on August 20, 2022, to evaluate the complete carbon capture and storage opportunity. To significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, the CCS project intends to build the infrastructure and value chain for the secure transportation, injection, and storage of CO2 in appropriate reservoirs on the Norwegian Continental Shelf. With a pipeline capacity of 20 to 40 million tonnes annually by 2037, a comprehensive CCS project will link Germany and Norway. SINTEF is developing next-generation carbon capture, utilization, and storage technology in partnership with leading carbon capture supplier Aker Carbon Capture ASA in Norway. The CCUS technology is a collection of methods for safely using or storing CO2 underground. This alliance will assist in accelerating the strategy for new product development and generating fresh, creative ideas for lowering CO2 emissions. The carbon capture, utilization, and storage market will benefit significantly from this market strategy.

Most Read from Bloomberg

The independent Brazilian crude producers that grew the most from buying Petrobras' fields -- PRIO SA, 3R Petroleum Oleo e Gas SA, Enauta Participacoes SA and PetroReconcavo SA -- are all either engaged in merger negotiations or assessing potential acquisitions, according to Brazilian oil executives and people familiar with the discussions.

One of the sellers is Oslo-listed Seacrest Petroleo Bermuda Ltd., which has onshore fields in southeastern Brazil and has hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to help find a buyer, the people said. Seacrest wrote in an email that it doesn't comment on market speculation. Goldman declined to comment.

These junior oil explorers offer equity investors eager for exposure to the Brazilian oil sector an alternative to state-run behemoth Petrobras. Although the output from these relative newcomers pales in comparison to supplies produced by the national oil company, any additional barrels they pump aid Brazil in its goal of entering the top five of global sources of crude and gas this decade.

""The way for them to grow and expand operations is really through M&A,"" Fabiana Gobbi, an associate director at S&P Global Ratings who covers Brazilian oil producers, said in an interview.

The biggest example of the trend toward consolidation is the battle for 3R, which operates on and offshore. PetroReconcavo was negotiating a merger with 3R earlier this year before Enauta delivered a competing bid that, so far, is prevailing.

Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as the Rio de Janeiro-based oil major is known, began selling some mature, onshore fields and shallow-water assets in the late 2010s after entering financial difficulties tied to fuel subsidies and a wide-ranging graft scandal.

For Petrobras, it was a pronounced shift and gave foreign and domestic drillers opportunities to buy wells already pumping oil and gas, as opposed to high-risk exploration licenses.

After President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva took office in 2023, Petrobras abandoned its narrow focus on the biggest discoveries in deep seas and made onshore and international operations a priority again.

""Today, we have assets that are very strategic for us, that have an elevated level of production and good profitability,"" Ana Zettel, an executive manager at Petrobras's upstream division, said during an interview.

Still, Petrobras hasn't completely halted sales of lower-performing fields and is continuously reviewing its portfolio, she said. In the past six months, Petrobras divested two fields -- one to Enauta and another to Perenco SA.

Acquisition Targets

PRIO, an offshore producer focused on the Campos Basin, is interested in buying a stake in the Peregrino offshore field that is operated by Equinor ASA. There is an expectation that the Norwegian producer could sell its Peregrino holding after it gets bigger projects up and running in Brazil, the people said.

In an email, PRIO said it doesn't have any ongoing negotiations but that it is always looking at ways to grow and doesn't rule out asset purchases in Brazil or the US sector of the Gulf of Mexico. Equinor said it doesn't comment on market speculation.

The Brazilian units of Karoon Energy Ltd. and BW Offshore Ltd. could become acquisition targets because they each have offshore fields in the Campos Basin without much potential to expand, Gobbi said. Karoon declined to comment and BW didn't respond to an inquiry.

PetroReconcavo, which produces the equivalent of roughly 26,000 barrels a day, is evaluating smaller drillers, the people said. PetroReconcavo could try and merge with the company created by 3R and Enauta, if that deal goes through, or hunt for other options, the people said.

PetroReconcavo said it was in a quiet period in response to questions. It denied a local media report that is was negotiating a merger with Eneva SA, a natural gas producer, according to an Apr. 24 filing.

Meanwhile, Seacrest has two clusters of onshore fields in Espirito Santo state and a storage terminal operated by Petrobras' Transpetro unit. Seacrest's 31 fields currently produce about 8,000 barrels a day.

""Expect this horse-trading and consolidation of positions to continue as companies begin to size up in earnest the true potential of their new holdings,"" said Schreiner Parker, managing director for Latin America at Rystad Energy AS.

In March 2023, Beacon Wind applied to conduct additional site assessment activities in its lease area offshore Massachusetts that were not included in the Site Assessment Plan (SAP) previously approved by BOEM in 2021.

Beacon Wind is now 100% owned by BP Plc (LON:BP) after the UK oil group and Norway's Equinor ASA (OSE:EQNR) agreed in January to restructure the ownership of their joint US offshore wind projects.

The proposed activities consist of 35 deployments and removals of a single suction bucket foundation at 26 locations within its lease area. The aim of the developer is to collect information to back the engineering design of wind turbines and offshore substation foundations.

Suction bucket foundations provide for installation of turbines without pile driving and their use could minimise underwater noise during installation and offer greater flexibility around supply chain constraints.

The Beacon Wind project includes the construction of two wind power facilities, Beacon Wind 1 and Beacon Wind 2, with a total capacity of at least 2,430 MW.

BOEM started work to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for Beacon Wind's project in June 2023.",renewablesnow.com,news,Renewablesnow.com,Plamena Tisheva,0.1294117647058823,452766502,1,https://cdn.aiidatapro.net/media/9f/11/93/t780x490/9f1193889b754b99d8b85d51edae1305.jpg,eng-9546462

The Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC) has said it plans to assess environmental liabilities before it can allow Shell PLC to transfer onshore operations to a local player.

Shell early this year said it had signed an agreement with Renaissance Africa Energy Co. Ltd. selling Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Ltd. (SPDC) to the local consortium, in order to focus on deepwater assets and downstream gas activities in the West African country.

Last month, several rights groups wrote to the NUPRC calling for the agency to block the divestment until Shell has taken financial responsibility for ""legacy pollution"" from the infrastructure being transferred and until the technical capability of the prospective new owner has been established.

The NUPRC has now said in a statement it had organized a ""due diligence workshop"" on the divestment.

While the NUPRC called the sale to Renaissance a ""noteworthy step forward in Nigeria's petroleum industry"", it said the workshop had been held ""to identify a successor with the financial resources and technical expertise to manage the assets responsibly"".

The statement added, ""Key considerations include the assessment of environmental liabilities, adherence to regulatory requirements, and industry best practices"".

The NUPRC said it has put in place a seven-pillar framework for assessing divestments. ""These pillars encompass technical capacity, financial viability, legal compliance, decommissioning obligations, host community engagement, labor relations, and data repatriation"", it said.

In the letter to the NUPRC dated April 8, the rights groups including Amnesty International alleged ""widespread technical problems"" with Shell's pipeline infrastructure in the Niger Delta resulting in repeated spills.

""[T]he sale of SPDC should not be permitted unless local communities have been fully consulted; the environmental pollution caused to date by SPDC has been fully assessed; funds have been placed by SPDC in escrow sufficient to guarantee that clean-up costs will be covered; and the technical capacities of the beneficial entity have been verified and established"", the organization told the regulator.

A statement on oil spills on Shell's Nigerian website says the company responds to incidents in accordance with regulations and globally accepted good practices. The statement highlights that the company publishes data on oil spills.

The statement says oil theft and sabotage are to blame for most oil spills in the Niger Delta. Of multiple incidents reported on the website for the first quarter of 2024, only one incident has been attributed to an ""operational"" cause, the rest ""sabotage"".

Announcing the divestment agreement with Renaissance January 16, Shell said, ""The transaction has been designed to preserve the full range of SPDC's operating capabilities following the change of ownership"".

""This includes the technical expertise, management systems and processes that SPDC implements on behalf of all the companies in the SPDC Joint Venture (SPDC JV)"", Shell added, referring to its 30 percent held and operated JV with Nigerian National Petroleum Co. Ltd. (55 percent), Total Exploration and Production Nigeria Ltd. (10 percent) and Nigeria Agip Oil Co. Ltd. (five percent).

Shell's onshore operations in Nigeria, which are the subject of the divestment, consist of 15 oil mining leases operated under the JV, according to Shell.

Shell said the transaction was valued at $2.4 billion, including SPDC's ""prior receivables and cash balances"".

Besides Shell, multinational majors Eni SPA, Equinor ASA and Exxon Mobil Corp. have secured agreements to divest Nigerian assets.

Norway's majority state-owned Equinor announced November 29, 2023, it had inked a deal to sell altogether its Nigerian business to Nigeria-domiciled Chappal Energies Mauritius Ltd.

On September 4, 2023, the Italian government-controlled Eni announced an agreement divesting one of its units in Nigeria, the onshore-focused Nigerian Agip Oil, to Oando PLC, saying the move is part of efforts to refocus on more profitable assets.

On February 25, 2022, Texas-based ExxonMobil announced an agreement to sell its equity stake in Mobil Producing Nigeria Unlimited to local player Seplat Energy PLC.",rigzone.com,news,Rigzone,,0.2156862745098038,452678523,1,https://images.rigzone.com/images/news/articles/Nigeria-Plans-Environmental-Review-before-Approving-Shells-Onshore-Exit-176638-582x327.webp,eng-9533691
