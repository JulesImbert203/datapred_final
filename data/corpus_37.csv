TOP OF THE NEWSLIST

DIANE'S DAY: Diane Abbott is free to stand as a Labour candidate after all -- following a mega U-turn from Keir Starmer this afternoon.

Ferret, reversed: ""The whip has obviously been restored to her now, and she is free to go forward as a Labour candidate,"" Starmer told the BBC this afternoon. A senior Labour official confirmed to Playbook PM this means Abbott will be the Labour candidate, and won't be blocked.

And will she stand? An ally of Abbott said that she would ""definitely stand"" if endorsed by the NEC next week, while Abbott herself told the BBC she won't be making any comment until next week. If she does stand, Abbott would, given the stonking Labour majority in Hackney North and Stoke Newington, remain a Labour MP for at least another few years. Playbook did not expect to be writing that a few days ago.

Declaring victory: ""You come at the queen, you better not miss,"" a Momentum spokesperson said.

Raised eyebrow: Labour's official position up to now had been that this was a matter for the NEC meeting next week -- a position Starmer effectively torched this afternoon (though he said it was ""formally"" still a matter for the NEC). But as POLITICO's Dan Bloom wrote in our live blog this afternoon, that NEC meeting is typically a rubber-stamping of candidates rather than a decision making process. ""Do they have any processes or honesty at the moment? Or do they just make it up as they go along?"" former Corbyn aide Andrew Fisher, asking the rhetorical questions, told Playbook PM.

HOW THE SAGA PLAYED OUT: POLITICO's Noah Keate pulled together this snap timeline of how the last few days played out in Labour land.

Hackneyed response: The Times reported Tuesday Abbott would not be allowed to stand for Labour ... A person close to Abbott told Wednesday's Playbook she had offered to ""stand down with dignity"" before the Times briefing ... Abbott tweeted she was ""very dismayed"" by reports she'd been barred ... Starmer said ""No decision has been taken to bar her going forward"" ... Abbott said she is going to be ""your MP for as long as I allowed to"" in a speech outside Hackney Town Hall Wednesday night ... Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury Darren Jones said Thursday morning he didn't ""think she is being forced out"" ... Starmer said Thursday lunchtime he simply wants ""the highest quality candidates"" to stand for Labour and called Abbott a ""trailblazer"" who ""overcame incredible challenges"" ...

And then: Deputy Labour Leader Angela Rayner, in a series of interviews, said Abbott should be allowed to stand if she wishes ... One member of Labour's campaign team told the Times Rayner's remarks were ""deeply unhelpful"" ... Starmer repeated the line about no decision being taken to bar her from standing in interviews this morning ... Shadow Science Secretary Peter Kyle said the NEC would be ""making sure that our party is fit for the future"" ... and then Starmer said this afternoon Abbott is free to stand as a Labour candidate.

More Abbott: She told LBC just before PM hit inboxes that she won't be the official candidate ""until I am endorsed by the Labour National Executive at its meeting on Tuesday."" Which implies she doesn't quite trust Labour not to block her after all.

On the attack: The Tories are making the point that Labour's position changed after Deputy Leader Angela Rayner spoke out yesterday -- with a CCHQ spokesperson arguing that Rayner is ""pushing Keir Starmer around"" and that he's lost control of his party.

Stay tuned: Rishi Sunak will likely jump on that bandwagon when he speaks to regional media and broadcasters in the North West shortly, with a clip -- where he'll be asked about Abbott -- set to run any minute now. Otherwise the PM -- who's been petting lambs this afternoon in Cheshire -- will be talking up his plans to crack down on fly-tippers.

Alternative view: ITV's Anushka Asthana hears from Labour sources close to the process around Abbott that Rayner might not have been ""going rogue"" with her intervention -- and could instead have been laying the ground for Labour to let Abbott stand after all.

Either way: Labour have wasted a week of the election campaign talking about Diane Abbott and taking lots of flak for not committing to letting her stand ... before then confirming she was free to do so after all Friday. The saga has allowed the Tories to go under the radar for a week and let Labour fight amongst itself.

What Labour had actually wanted to talk about today: Starmer was in Inverclyde with Rayner and Scottish Labour boss Anas Sarwar earlier to offer some GB Energy details and try to give the SNP a kicking.

So what on Earth is GB energy? Pitching the plan on Radio Scotland, Starmer was asked whether GB Energy would generate its own publicly-owned electricity. No, he said, it would be an ""investment vehicle"" and ""not an energy company"" -- sparking derision from SNP and Tory officials arguing Labour wants to set up an energy company that won't produce any energy. Labour was quick off the mark to try to clear up any confusion caused by Starmer's mixed messaging.

Here goes: Shadow Climate Change and Net Zero Secretary Ed Miliband tweeted a thread saying the company would indeed ""generate energy in its own right."" Meanwhile, a Labour briefing paper shared with POLITICO confirmed GB Energy would invest in tech such as wind and solar to speed up their roll out. It would ""develop, own and operate assets,"" by funding local projects or taking stakes in others through co-investment with the private sector, the doc explained -- while describing GB Energy as a ""company that will generate energy in its own right.""

Take Nat: As he takes a keen interest in the battle for Scotland -- many more trips up north are planned, is the word in Labour circles -- Starmer also argued in his Inverclyde speech that the ""parallels with the Tories and SNP are very striking now,"" pointing to ""chaos and division"" with both the lads.

Not taking Nat: SNP boss John Swinney, speaking at his own event in Glasgow, said Labour is signed up to ""austerity on steroids."" The SNP's other gambit today is to call on Labour to commit to an emergency budget ""very swiftly"" if it wins the election.

Oh, and: Starmer got to Scotland via private jet, the Express' Christian Calgie reported. Asked about this later, Starmer said it was the best way to get there in a busy election campaign -- and that he has offset the carbon emissions.

SELECTIONS ROUND-UP

SELECTION BOXES: The news of Abbott's green light to stand again came amid more rapidly dropping candidate selection news, as the parties hurry along efforts to secure seats for their best prospects (and pals) ahead of upcoming deadlines.

First up -- Dale bails: Broadcaster Iain Dale ditched his short-lived plans to become the Tory MP for Tunbridge Wells this morning. He blamed the digging up of his disparaging comments about disliking the area he wanted to stand in.

Life comes at you fast: Tuesday: Dale reveals on his LBC show that he's leaving broadcasting to run for election in Tunbridge Wells ... Wednesday: Byline Times unearths Dale's 2022 comments about Tunbridge Wells (he ""never liked the place"" and ""would happily live somewhere else"") ... Friday: Dale reveals, on LBC obvs, that he isn't standing anymore.

Selections round-up: Think tanker and ex-Miliband aide Torsten Bell is standing for Labour in Swansea West ... Alex Barros-Curtis, a Starmer ally (obvs!) who presided over Labour's response to the EHRC antisemitism report, is being lined up for Cardiff West according to selections guru Michael Crick ... and 2019er Tory Aaron Bell -- a quiz show fan who won Â£25,000 on Deal or No Deal in 2006 and the Only Connect show in 2010, POLITICO sage Noah Keate texts over -- announced he's stepping down.

Plus: Former Tory MP Julian Knight confirmed he plans to stand as an independent in Solihull. A police investigation into Knight was dropped earlier this year, but that was separate to allegations of sexual harassment made to my POLITICO colleagues and reported here.

More noise to come: The de-selected Labour candidate in Chingford Faiza Shaheen is holding a rally this evening with her supporters. The Labour left remain very unhappy about her plight -- don't expect them to go quietly just because Abbott is being allowed to stand after all.

DRIVETIME DEBRIEF

NOTHING TO DO WITH US, LADS: Asked by the BBC about Donald Trump's conviction -- all the latest on the POLITICO U.S. website here -- Rishi Sunak dodged the diplomatic tangle and said he wouldn't comment on ""another country's domestic politics or judicial processes.""

But a bit more interestingly: Keir Starmer, in his morning round, confirmed that his party would ""work with whoever"" Americans choose as their next president -- but that his party is keeping a an eye on the ""unprecedented situation"" stateside. POLITICO's Matt Honeycombe-Foster has a write-up of his comments here.

WHILE IN TRUMP TOWER: Donald Trump repeated his claims the prosecution was politically orchestrated, in remarks on Fifth Avenue this afternoon, claiming if: ""they can do this to me, they can do this to anyone."" The former U.S. president also argued his witnesses were ""literally crucified"" and, while he would have liked to testify, his lawyers advised against it. All in all, the full Trump verbal bingo card.

On the net: MAGA supporters have flooded pro-Trump websites with calls for rioting, revolution and violent retribution -- Reuters has the deets. There are 158 days until America decides on November 5.

Here's a take: In his weekly Mail column, Boris Johnson writes that Trump has been the subject of a ""machine-gun mob-style hit job,"" saying he sympathizes with Trump's supporters and reckons his fellow blondie is now more likely to win in November. CCHQ might find that a little less helpful than Johnson's hit job column on Starmer last week. The column will land here shortly.

NEXT WEEK'S FUN: The first TV debates of the election season kick off next week -- with Julie Etchingham hosting an ITV head-to-head between Rishi Sunak on Tuesday evening. Thankfully ...

We've got a pod for that: This morning's Westminster Insider by Aggie Chambre looks at the history and role of the TV election debate in the U.K., with a cast of involved hacks, flacks and politicians, including Etchingham. Reform boss-but-not-really-honest Nigel Farage told Aggie that the moments before a debate are like preparing for an ""FA Cup Final.""

An alternative historical view: Former Green Leader Natalie Bennett, who took part in a couple of the debates in 2015 with Farage and co, told Playbook PM that Farage turned up for the first debate in 2015 at the ""absolute last minute,"" panicking all of the network people. Plus, Bennett said Farage had ""clearly been to the pub and had a couple of pints"" before he finally showed. ""I suppose there was a kind of careful preparation in a Nigel Farage kind of way going on there,"" she added. Farage didn't deny this when reached by Playbook PM this afternoon.

On that big debate moment: In the second TV debate back in 2015, Bennett took part in the famous group hug with Nicola Sturgeon and Plaid Leader Leanne Wood, which became one of the images of the campaign. ""You know, that wasn't actually planned -- but there was a little bit of pre-preparation where we sort of agreed we were going to make sure Nicola wasn't left isolated with Nigel,"" Bennett revealed.

More debate fun: ITV has just announced plans to host a multi-party debate on June 13, with senior figures from seven largest parties from the Tories down to Plaid Cymru.

GREENS ON GAZA: Following the Greens' campaign launch in Bristol, party co-leader Carla Denyer told my POLITICO colleague Abby Wallace the environmentalists would be putting more pressure on Labour over its stance on Israel's assault on Gaza. Denyer said the incoming government would need to ""take seriously their responsibilities on the international stage."" Read the piece here.

POLLS POLLS POLLS: A Whitestone Insight poll conducted for the Daily Mirror found a 20 point lead for Labour -- with little movement in the polls -- while a Savanta Scotland poll found another Scottish Labour lead over the SNP.

Plus: There are unconfirmed rumors the first MRP of the campaign may drop tonight.

POST-ELECTION WHISPERS: Tom Newton-Dunn -- who's writing a weekly column in the Evening Standard these days -- hears that Chancellor Jeremy Hunt fancies a post-election gig as a Classic FM presenter.

BOWLED OVER: London Mayor Sadiq Khan wants the Super Bowl, the NFL's flagship fixture, to take place in the U.K.'s capital as a way of solidifying its status as the ""sporting capital of the world,"" telling the Athletic it's ""really important to us."" The usual 6.30 p.m. Eastern Time start and four-hour duration would mean fans leaving the stadium at, erm, 3.30 a.m. -- full deets here via POLITICO's Noah Keate.

MIDDLE EAST UPDATE: The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) pulled out of Jabalia in northern Gaza after a three week offensive which saw tens of thousands of civilians flee the area. ""Hundreds of terrorists [were] eliminated"" and six miles of tunnels destroyed during the operation, the IDF said -- via the BBC.

UKRAINE UPDATE: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said U.S. President Joe Biden's delay in sanctioning the use of Western weapons against targets in Russia left the Kremlin's forces laughing at Ukraine and able to ""hunt"" its people, in an exclusive interview with the Guardian.

View from Russia: Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said America's decision to allow Ukraine to strike inside Russia using U.S. weapons meant ""no one can rule out"" when Russian tensions with the West escalate to its ""last stage"" -- Sky has a live blog.

IN SLOVAKIA: Slovakia's populist Prime Minister Robert Fico was released from hospital to his home in the capital Bratislava following an assassination attempt earlier this month, as he continues to recover from multiple gunshot wounds -- AP News has more.

IN YEMEN: Houthi militants said the U.S. and U.K. killed at least 16 people with air strikes on Yemen in the deadliest assault on the group since the start of the campaign in January to stop its attacks on ships around the Red Sea -- Bloomberg has a writeup.

SUMMATIME: Tomorrow is June 1. Thankfully we got an election to distract us from the whole ""summer"" thing.

WEEKEND CAMPAIGNING WE KNOW ABOUT: No news yet on Tory movements ... Labour is launching some form of motorized election vehicle from London ... Lib Dem MP Sarah Olney is leading Lib Dem campaigning in a south coast 'blue wall' seat ... and the SNP's John Swinney will be campaigning in Tory-held seats in the north east of Scotland Saturday, followed by a campaign launch event in Glasgow on Sunday with SNP Westminster boss Stephen Flynn.

Between 6-9 June, around 360 million people across the EU will vote for representatives from national parties to sit in the European Parliament.

The grouping or coalition with the most seats will help to shape the leadership of the next European Commission. The overall composition of parliament will also influence the bloc's priorities between 2024-2029.

Climate change and energy once again feature prominently in the manifestos of the major parties, with mounting pressure to secure energy supplies in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine drawing particular focus.

Core to this is a transition to decarbonised domestic energy. Carbon Brief's analysis shows that the relatively small nations of Portugal, Latvia and Finland have led the way since the last EU election, with the largest percentage drop in power-sector emissions between 2019 and 2023.

Malta and the Netherlands have led in increasing their renewables shares, with the Netherlands also seeing the largest absolute increase in renewable generation.

Meanwhile, fossil-fuel generation fell in all but three countries when comparing 2019 and 2023.

Other key findings from the analysis include:

In this analysis, Carbon Brief looks at how the electricity sector has changed since the last election.

Every national power system across the EU has become cleaner since the last European Parliamentary election in 2019, Carbon Brief analysis shows.

Finland led the way in terms of reducing grid intensity - the measure of how clean the electricity within national grids is - halving its intensity between 2019 and 2023 to become the third cleanest in the EU, behind France and Sweden.

In absolute terms, Greece reduced its grid intensity the most since 2019, Carbon Brief shows. The country hit a new record high level of clean energy generation, with power grid operator IPTO announcing that renewables and hydroelectric plants accounted for 57% of the country' energy in 2023.

Germany saw the largest fall in power-sector emissions in absolute terms - namely, the overall volume of CO2 emissions produced. Like Greece, the country had a ""landmark"" 2023 for renewable generation, according to thinktank Ember.

Carbon Brief analysis shows that power-sector emissions in Germany fell by 43.23m tonnes of carbon dioxide (MtCO2), or 18.4%, of 2019 values by 2023.

Despite this significant drop, the country's power sector is still the most polluting of all EU countries, responsible for 29.3% of EU power-sector emissions. This places it far ahead of Poland, the second largest polluter, which is responsible for 17% of emissions.

Germany has one of the largest populations in Europe and its energy demand sits at 514TWh (19% of EU total). When looking at per-capita emissions (as shown below), the country sits fourth in the EU for emissions, seeing a reduction of 0.51tCO2 in 2023 compared with 2019.

Portugal, Latvia and Finland decarbonised their power sectors the most relative to 2019, analysis shows.

Portugal saw renewables supply 61% of its electricity consumption in 2023, according to the country's grid operator Redes EnergÃ©ticas Nacionais. This totaled 31.2TWh - the most it has ever recorded. This included a period in November where the country ran on just renewables for six days in a row.

Carbon Brief's analysis of Ember data placed the 2023 figure even high, with 73% of electricity from renewable sources.

As shown in the chart below, there were just three EU countries where power-sector emissions have increased since 2019 - Malta, Croatia and Lithuania. These countries are some of the smallest in Europe, collectively accounting for less than 1% of total EU power generation in 2023.

Malta increased its power-sector emissions by 0.11MtCO2, or 10.3%, of 2019 emissions. As an island nation, Malta's energy system is still heavily dominated by imported oil and gas, making up nearly 90% of power generation. (Malta has some of the lowest per-capita emissions in Europe, with 5.3 tonnes CO2 equivalent (tCO2e) per inhabitant in 2019, well below the EU average of 8.4tCO2e.)

Croatia, where emissions increased by 0.4MtCO2 or 13%, is similarly reliant on fossil fuels, with coal still dominating its power sector. While power demand has remained stable in recent years, net imports of electricity have dropped likely due to higher electricity prices in neighbouring countries.

Although renewable generation offset most of this, it did lead to a small jump in fossil fuel use of ~1TWh.

Lithuania saw emissions increase by 0.32MtCO2, from 0.57MtCO2 in 2019 to 0.89MtCO2 in 2023, Carbon Brief analysis shows. The country is currently heavily reliant on electricity imports, after the closure of its only nuclear power plant in 2010 changed it from a net exporter to a net importer.

Chris Rosslowe, senior energy and climate data analyst at Ember, tells Carbon Brief:

""Trends in generation in Lithuania don't tell you as much as in other countries as it imports most of its electricity since shutting down nuclear power in 2010. Import dependence is slowly lowering though - from ~75% in 2019 to ~55% in 2023 - and, like Croatia, renewables are growing faster than fossils.""

It is undergoing a particularly key period of transition. Lithuania's electricity grid currently operates synchronously with the Russia-Belarus power system, but it is planning to de-synch by 2025 and instead run with the continental Europe grid.

Additionally, it is among the countries that are seeing the fastest expansion of wind generation. It is also targeting halving its imports and generating 70% of its electricity from domestic sources by 2030, as it pushes for increased energy sovereignty and security.

Rosselowe notes that Malta, Croatia and Lithuania are all expected to reduce their dependence on fossil fuels in the coming years, offset in large part by growing renewables.

Overall, the Czech Republic remains the biggest per-capita emitter in the EU, as shown in the chart below. Between 2019 and 2023, emissions in the country did drop from 4tCO2 to 3.2tCO2, but it still sits 0.9tCO2 above the second highest per-capita emitter Cyprus (3.1tCO2).

The three countries that saw an increase in per-capita emissions match those where there was an increase in fossil fuel generation - Malta, Croatia and Lithuania.

Between 2019 and 2023, the share of renewable generation in the EU increased in all by one country, according to Carbon Brief analysis.

Italy saw renewable generation fall from 115.83 terawatt hours (TWh) in 2019 to 114.8TWh in 2023. This was broadly due to the impact of droughts in the country affecting hydropower generation, which hit in 2022, but had a continued impact in 2023.

This was a wider dynamic seen globally, which kept the world from hitting peak electricity generation emissions in 2023.

Slovakia, meanwhile, was the only country to see a dip in its share of renewable energy when comparing 2019 and 2023. This was minor, falling just 0.65% from 23.57% to 22.92%. The country has one of the smallest energy demands in Europe and, like Italy, saw a drop in hydro driven by droughts in 2022.

Malta and the Netherlands saw their share of renewables increase by more than 150% in 2023 relative to 2019, Carbon Brief analysis shows.

The Netherlands increased its absolute share of renewable generation by close to 30% since 2019, as shown in the chart below. The country seeing the largest absolute increase in renewable generation, closely followed by Spain.

Nearly half the electricity produced in the Netherlands is now renewable, according to the Dutch Central Bureau for Statistics.

This was predominantly wind generation, with the country adding more wind power than any other country in the EU between 2019 and 2023, both relatively and in absolute terms. Overall, the Netherlands increased its wind generation by 152% and Finland followed closely behind with a 143% rise.

Latvia, similarly, saw significant growth, with the share of renewables jumping from 49.5% in 2019 to 76.6% in 2023. This 27.1% increase is particularly key for the country, as it continues to target reducing its dependence on energy imports from Russia.

Spain added more solar generation in absolute terms over the four-year period than any other country in the EU, tripling its overall renewable generation.

Poland increased its solar generation by more than 1,500%, increasing generation by 12TWh albeit from a low starting point of just 0.71TWh in 2019. Renewables generated a record 26% of electricity in the country in 2023. However, coal still produces most of the country's electricity and continues to have a powerful impact on policy due to powerful lobbies.

Hungary has increased its solar share of generation the most since 2019, with an increase of 14%. It was followed closely by the Netherlands, with a 12.8% increase. Luxembourg increased wind power share of generation by more than the Netherlands - 17%.

Overall, just three EU countries - Malta, Croatia and Lithuania - saw an increase in the share of fossil fuel generation in 2023 relative to 2019, according to Carbon Brief analysis.

Over the same period, Luxembourg and Finland reduced fossil generation by more than 60%.

The Netherlands has reduced its fossil fuel share in the electricity system the most since 2019, falling by close to 30%. As shown in the chart below, this fall was mirrored by a significant increase in renewable energy generation.

In comparison with 2019, Ireland saw an increase in coal generation in 2023 making it the only EU nation to do so. In 2019, coal generation was at a record low in the country (0.51TWh) before jumping to 2.72TWh in 2022 due to a drop in wind generation.

However, since that point coal power generation has been continuing to fall again, in line with the wider trend seen over the past few decades.

Ireland has seen total electricity demand increase by more than 60% since 2019, Carbon Brief analysis shows. The country's energy demand has been particularly driven by the growth of data centres, which accounted for 18% of energy demand in 2022, for example.

Despite the blip in coal generation, the share of fossil fuels fell by 2.5% between 2019 and 2023.

Portugal reduced its use of coal the most, relative to 2019, while Germany reduced the most in absolute terms. As discussed above, this was supported by surging renewable generation in both countries.

Pieter de Pous, programme lead in E3G's fossil fuel transition programme, tells Carbon Brief:

""Europe's phaseout of coal has been one of its biggest, most historical, monumental success stories of the last couple of years when you think about it. We've dropped consumption since 2016 by 50%, right? It's really enormous and it's a story that's rarely told.""

The last European Parliament elections saw a ""green wave"" of climate-focused politicians winning seats across the continent. In the years that followed, the EU approved a European Green Deal, including goals to cut emissions by 55% from 1990 levels by 2030 and reach net-zero by 2050.

European member states now have a ""critical role"" to play in implementing what has been agreed, notes Rosslowe. He adds:",carbonbrief.org,news,Carbon Brief,,0.1764705882352942,454852151,46,https://www.carbonbrief.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2RA0468.jpg,

These countries -- Armenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Moldova, and Serbia -- find themselves in what we have termed an ""arc of instability"" between Russia and the European Union.

This paper, a collaboration between two scholars from Carnegie Europe and one from Carnegie's Russia Eurasia Center in Berlin, is the first of four looking at the issues facing these in-between states. It examines how Russia seeks to maintain influence and leverage in them, the weaknesses it seeks to exploit, and the changing narratives it uses to win the loyalty of swing voters and deter the West. The three subsequent publications will look in more detail at the situation in Armenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Moldova.

All of these in-between states are outside of the European Union and NATO, but are building stronger ties with the EU: several are prospective members of the union. They also maintain many connections with Russia, and are home to pro-Russian political forces and business interests. Many still buy Russian gas. Armenia is a member of two Russian-led institutions -- the Eurasian Economic Union and (for now, at least) the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) -- but is in the process of reevaluating the utility of membership in these organizations.

Since 2022, the EU and the United States have deployed substantial new political and economic resources to support these in-between states. The EU has relaunched its enlargement process, which had been stalled since 2013, and given candidate status to Moldova, Ukraine, and (more conditionally) Georgia -- something that would have been unthinkable a little more than two years ago. It has set up the European Union Mission in Armenia (EUMA) to monitor the border, the first such mission in a country that is a member of the Russia-led CSTO. Moldova is being weaned off of its dependence on Russian gas.

Still, it would be complacent to assume that the European trajectory of these in-between countries is a given. The enlargement process still has a long way to go before the candidate countries achieve actual membership, leaving skeptical EU governments with many opportunities to exercise vetoes. Public opinion in the in-between countries is growing more pro-European, but societies are still divided. In all these countries, a large section of the population says they want good relations with both Russia and the countries of the European Union. In Serbia, for example, 51 percent of people want to be on good terms with both Russia and the EU (13 percent are pro-Western but want to maintain ties with Moscow, while 38 percent want Russia and the West to be given equal treatment), according to a 2022 poll by the International Republican Institute (IRI).

What path these countries take will be largely determined by developments beyond their control -- in particular, the course of the war in Ukraine and complex intra-EU discussions about the future of the European project. If Russia is even partly successful in its war of aggression in Ukraine, destabilization or military action against its other neighbors cannot be ruled out. Conversely, Ukrainian military success against Russia and an accelerated path toward EU accession for Ukraine increases the European prospects of other states.

Geography matters. The states of the Western Balkans are surrounded by EU countries, which necessarily limits Russia's political ambitions there -- even as disillusionment with the EU over the slow pace of enlargement gives Russia leverage. The same cannot be said for Moldova, less still for Georgia and Armenia. Georgia's border with Russia and three-decade-long conflicts over Abkhazia and South Ossetia, recognized as independent by Moscow in 2008, make it vulnerable to any shifts in Russia's war with Ukraine. It is likely this sense of vulnerability that drives the Georgian Dream government's soft rapprochement with Russia on many issues since 2022.

When it comes to Armenia and Moldova, geography is nothing less than critical. There are many similarities in their political profiles: both countries are small and poor by European standards, and both currently have pro-European governments and large societal constituencies that are still close to Russia. Armenia, however, is far from the EU, sandwiched between Azerbaijan, Georgia, Iran, and TÃ¼rkiye (and has no diplomatic relations with Azerbaijan and TÃ¼rkiye). Russia is still by default its main security and energy provider -- a dependence that the Armenian government is signaling it wants to begin to break. Moldova's two neighbors, by contrast, are Romania -- a friendly EU country -- and Ukraine, a fellow candidate for joining the union. The support of both neighbors has allowed Moldova to make the EU rather than Russia its main gas supplier since 2022, and to begin accession negotiations with Brussels without suffering (so far) a major backlash from Russia.

Workers from both Armenia and Moldova go abroad to seek employment and send home remittances. Again, there is a sharp contrast in their choices. Moldovan passport holders (including in the breakaway territory of Transnistria) enjoy visa-free travel to the EU, and many Moldovans now have Romanian passports as well, meaning that they can find employment in Europe, which in turn exacerbates the country's brain drain. By contrast, as many as 300,000 Armenians still work in Russia, although many have returned home since 2022.

In addition to the war in Ukraine, for which 2024 will be a critical year, the medium-term future of Armenia, Georgia, and Moldova will be determined by three other geopolitical factors in which the EU and Russia will play a role: the countries' domestic security concerns,the choices and decisions made by political leaders, and how successfully and rapidly the EU's revamped enlargement policy proceeds.

The most public manifestation of the confrontation between Russia and the West in the in-between countries is in the realm of ideas. Since 2022, Moscow has changed its messaging. Today's weakened Russia puts less emphasis on its role as security patron and energy provider and more on an ideological message: that it provides an alternative pole to the West and in particular to the ""global hegemon"" of the United States, which is portrayed as the puppet master of unwilling European countries.

To that end, Russian President Vladimir Putin has appropriated Western vocabulary about ""values,"" ""choice,"" and especially ""sovereignty"" to boost Russia's alternative vision. In a speech to the World Russian People's Council on November 28, 2023, Putin said:

We are now fighting not just for Russia's freedom, but for the freedom of the whole world. We can frankly say that the dictatorship of one hegemon is becoming decrepit. We see it, and everyone sees it now. It is getting out of control and is simply dangerous for others. This is now clear to the global majority. But again, it is our country that is now at the forefront of building a fairer world order. And I would like to stress this: without a sovereign and strong Russia, no lasting and stable international system is possible.

In the fight for the hearts and minds of people in Eastern Europe, the Russian leadership rarely claims that it is more prosperous than the West. Rather, it concentrates on criticizing two key aspects of the West. The first is Western countries' alleged double standards and inability to live up to their lofty rhetoric; the second is their moral decadence.

A stress on ""traditional values"" and on gender and LGBTQ issues in particular is designed to enlist the support of conservative constituencies in Eastern Europe for Russia. The traditionalist agenda requires zero effort from its supporters, but allows them to consider themselves morally superior simply because they do not belong to the LGBTQ community.

The Russian Orthodox Church (ROC), which has strongly supported Russia's war in Ukraine, is a key ally in propagating this message. Several Orthodox churches in Eastern Europe are either directly affiliated with or have close relations with the ROC, allowing Moscow to bypass governments and local media to spread a pro-Russia message in hundreds of parishes.

In Moldova, for example, despite the government's pro-Western stance, around 90 percent of Orthodox believers belong to the Moldovan Orthodox Church, which is in communion with the ROC. Even though dozens of priests have switched their allegiance since 2022 to the Romanian-language Metropolis of Bessarabia, which is part of the Romanian Orthodox Church, the Moldovan Orthodox Church leadership has been equivocal about the war in Ukraine and many of its leading priests are strongly pro-Russian.

The Georgian Orthodox Church is also closer to Russia than much of the general public and has taken a relatively soft position on the war, trying to maintain relations with both the Moscow Patriarchate and the Ecumenical Patriarch in Istanbul. By contrast, Armenia's national church, the Armenian Apostolic Church, is an Oriental Orthodox Church not affiliated with either the Russian or Ukrainian churches. It shares an agenda of ""traditional values,"" but not Russia's geopolitical agenda regarding Ukraine.

Russia and the EU are courting both core constituencies in the in-between states and those who might be called swing voters: the many people who are not firmly committed to either a Western or an Eastern trajectory for their country. In all these countries, the political situation is highly volatile. Moscow clearly believes that even in countries that have made a formal commitment to EU membership, the game is not lost.

This means that Russia will work hard to support political forces with a pro-Moscow orientation in elections, such as the upcoming presidential and parliamentary votes in Moldova. Despite the official ban on Russian state media broadcasting there, Moscow still manages to reach a wide audience by using the local networks of the pro-Russian Gagauzia autonomous region, as well as social media. In its propaganda, the Kremlin portrays Moldova's integration with the EU as a smokescreen for the country's absorption by Romania and promotes anti-LGBTQ narratives presented as ""traditional values."" The latter resonate with the public especially well because they are supported by the Moldovan Orthodox Church and pander to deep-seated prejudices in Moldovan society: in opinion polls, over 70 percent of Moldovans say they would not accept an LGBTQ person as their neighbor.

In Serbia, a hybrid authoritarian-democratic government professes that EU membership is its strategic goal but declines to align with Western sanctions against Russia. It still courts Russian diplomatic support in fighting Kosovo's independence while routinely voting against Moscow at the UN General Assembly. A similar situation is unfolding in Georgia, where the ruling Georgian Dream party has formally promoted EU accession while expanding various forms of cooperation with Russia. In the weak democracies of Moldova and Armenia, pro-European governing parties contend with opposition parties that want to tilt the country back toward Russia.

In Bosnia and Herzegovina, the geopolitical orientation division runs along ethnic lines. Bosnian Serb leader of the Republika Srpska (RS) province Milorad Dodik's policies vis-Ã -vis Russia -- such as refusing to join in sanctioning Russia and maintaining close relations with the country -- enjoy support among his constituents. According to an IRI survey from 2022, 89 percent of Serbs in Bosnia have a favorable view of Russia, compared to only 27 percent of Bosniaks (Bosnian Muslims) and 39 percent of Bosnian Croats. According to a National Democratic Institute poll from 2021, 82 percent of Bosnian Serbs (mostly living in Serb-dominated RS) are against NATO membership, while 90 percent of Bosniaks and 92 percent of Bosnian Croats are in favor.

Public opinion in Moldova lags far behind the pace of international developments. According to a 2023 IRI poll, over half of Moldovans (52 percent) still believe Russia to be Moldova's most important economic partner. In a question on this issue, for which respondents could choose more than one answer, the EU got only slightly more: 68 percent. In reality, the EU overtook Russia in Moldova's foreign trade over two decades ago, and now trades over five times more with the country than Russia does.

This reality has prevented a major realignment in the country's domestic politics. Even though pro-EU President Maia Sandu is the most popular and most trusted politician in Moldova by a wide margin, with a positive rating of over 40 percent among decided voters, populist pro-Russian parties still fare quite well, with their combined support hovering around 40 percent.

In Armenia, meanwhile, public opinion has turned away from Russia -- the country's traditional main ally -- following Moscow's failure to act during Azerbaijan's seizure of the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh from Armenia last fall. In an IRI opinion poll conducted in December 2023, when asked for their assessment of international partners, 89 percent of Armenians named the country's relationship with the United States as ""good"" or ""very good,"" and 87 percent said the same of the European Union. In contrast, only 31 percent had the same opinion of relations with Moscow, while 66 percent said the relationship with Russia was ""bad."" This marks a calamitous decline from October 2019, when 93 percent of respondents said the relationship with Russia was ""good"" and just 6 percent said it was ""bad.""

Still, 48 percent of Armenians said that Russia was the country's most important economic partner (it is indeed its biggest trading partner), and 31 percent said it was the country's most important security partner: a higher figure than for the EU, but lower than for the United States. In other words, Russia remains for many a patron of convenience and necessity, if not necessarily of choice.

In this context, it is important for Russia to broadcast the message that the West and Ukraine will not prevail in the war -- and that nonaligned European countries should be careful about investing fully in alliances with the EU and NATO.

Since 2022, the consensus among political elites and experts in the West has been that Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine has strengthened Western solidarity and the two main Western alliances, the EU and NATO. The proof of this is the unanimous adoption and renewal of EU sanctions packages against Russia and the fact that EU enlargement has been relaunched -- something that was a very distant prospect prior to 2022. The Western narrative also holds that NATO has become more powerful after two previously neutral countries, Finland and Sweden, joined the alliance.

The Russian narrative is that this is an illusion. NATO is painted as an American hegemonic project imposed on unwilling Europeans, while the EU, also under American influence, allegedly works against the interests of its own population by opposing Russia. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has described U.S.-EU relations as ""the relationship of a suzerain and his vassals.""

The Kremlin constantly points to any evidence of cracks in the two Western alliances as evidence that the in-between countries should be careful about joining them. Hungary and Slovakia, for example, are portrayed as harbingers of change in the EU. In his December press conference, Putin praised Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor OrbÃ¡n for his stand against other EU leaders over Ukraine, along with the recently elected prime minister of Slovakia, the populist Euroskeptic Robert Fico. These two leaders, Putin said, ""are defending their countries' interests. But there are too few politicians like this; I do not know why they do not exist. Maybe this has to do with Europe's excessive dependence on the Big Brother -- the United States.""

Russian officials frequently forecast disaster for the European Union. In December 2023, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov predicted that ""the EU will collapse"" under the burden of Ukraine's accession. Mikhail Sheremet, a parliamentarian from annexed Crimea, said that EU sanctions against Russia would destroy Europeans' prosperity and eventually the union itself. He said: ""With each package of sanctions, the leaders of European countries not only lose face and respect in front of the international community, but elicit annoyance and growing discontent in their own countries, leading the EU to its death.""

In the Western Balkans, a Euroskeptic message will always find its target. Russia tells these countries that they should be allowed to freely choose their international alignments (in contrast to Ukraine, which, according to Moscow, has no such choice). Russia accuses the EU and NATO of using empty promises of Euro-Atlantic integration to subdue the region's Orthodox nations and settle Balkan conflicts at their expense. The EU, Moscow insists, will make Serbia recognize Kosovo without granting any reciprocal concessions, and will turn North Macedonia into a semi-Albanian state. NATO membership is said to be wrong for Bosnia and Herzegovina as it will jeopardize peace. The EU is portrayed as weak and insincere in its promise to accept the Western Balkans into its ranks. And even if they were to join, Russia says the countries would be treated unfairly.

In May 2022, for example, Russia's ambassador to Sarajevo, Igor Kalabukhov, argued in a piece for Glas Srpske, an RS-published daily, that Bosnia and Herzegovina's membership in the ""institutionally and morally"" decadent EU would bring it no benefits and entail the loss of its sovereignty. His colleague Alexander Botsan-Kharchenko, ambassador to Serbia, accused EU and U.S. mediators between Prishtina and Belgrade of a lack of fairness. He also condemned Western pressure on Serbian President Aleksandar VuÄiÄ. Most recently, Russia accused the West of destabilizing Serbia by inciting the protests that followed the country's controversial December 17 parliamentary elections.

The region's security architecture (or lack thereof) is still shaped by the legacy of the 1990s wars in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, and Kosovo. Almost all of the Balkan countries have now joined NATO, with the significant exceptions of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, and Serbia. In Serbia, the memory of NATO's bombardment of Belgrade and other towns in 1999 and its role in facilitating Kosovo's independence also prevent the country from joining NATO, even though Belgrade has engaged in security cooperation with the United States.

The same legacy also fuels continuing pro-Russian sentiment among the Bosnian Serbs. Thanks to the ethno-federal structure sanctioned by the Dayton Accords that ended the Bosnian War, Bosnia and Herzegovina is one of the countries where Russian influence is at its strongest in the region. The leadership in RS -- the Serb-majority entity that, alongside the Bosniak- and Croat-dominated Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBiH), makes up the country -- makes no secret of its close links to the Kremlin. Bosnia and Herzegovina has had a NATO membership action plan since 2018 but will struggle to join the alliance, as it could reignite the conflict with RS. The commitment to speeding up integration into NATO was dropped from the agenda of Bosnia and Herzegovina's state-level cabinet, which includes Dodik's Alliance of Independent Social Democrats, the principal Serbian party.

With RS holding wide-ranging powers within the loose federation (powers that are constantly expanding, thanks to Dodik's brinkmanship), the entity can act as a quasi-state, pursuing its own external policies. In September 2022, Dodik met Putin in Moscow ahead of the Bosnian elections. Because of the RS veto, Bosnia and Herzegovina has not joined Western sanctions against Russia in response to the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. In addition, RS and its representatives can block decisions in central institutions such as the cabinet and the federal parliament.

Internally, Dodik has been playing an increasingly disruptive role. He has upgraded the RS police force with weaponry supplied by Russia, raising fears that an RS force separate from Bosnia and Herzegovina's integrated army could reconstitute itself. Dodik has repeatedly threatened to withdraw RS from state-level institutions, including the judiciary, the tax authority, and the military. Russia typically backs Dodik through the Peace Implementation Council. In addition, Russia has called for the abolition of the Office of the High Representative (OHR), which has historically contained Serbs' secessionist ambitions, notably through the so-called Bonn powers that allow the head of the OHR (who comes from an EU member state) to sack officials and impose legislation. Dodik has furthermore openly defied decisions by OHR head Christian Schmidt, and is now a defendant in a trial that he has dismissed as a political witch hunt. Although Russia is a key ally in these domestic squabbles, the Serb leader has other patrons, too -- notably Hungary, which has vetoed the imposition of EU sanctions.

Despite all this, the European Union maintains a gravitational pull. In December 2023, the European Council reconfirmed its commitment to authorize membership talks with Sarajevo, should certain conditions be met. Russia, however, is exploiting cynicism about the EU and resentment against the West (chiefly the United States) by focusing on the bitter legacy of the 1990s, on alleged Western double standards, and on the extremely slow pace of EU enlargement.

There are plenty of local grievances and conflicts to exploit. In 2018-2019, pro-Russian actors took key part in the demonstrations against the Prespa Agreement that resolved the decades-old name dispute between (North) Macedonia and Greece. In Serbia, the main anti-Western argument upon which Russia relies is the West's sponsorship of Kosovo's independence. The message is that the West works against national sovereignty. The Kosovo leadership, including Prime Minister Albin Kurti and President Vjosa Osmani, has repeatedly accused Russia of fomenting tension in the Serb-populated north, which has seen an uptick of violence over the past year. Following the shoot-out between Serb militants and the Kosovar police at the Banjska Monastery in September 2023, authorities in Prishtina said they were investigating a possible Russian connection.

Moscow's agenda is aimed at obstructing EU and U.S. efforts to integrate the region into the West, not at establishing Russia as a political, diplomatic, and economic hegemon, a feat that even the Soviet Union failed to accomplish in the early Cold War period. Russia therefore acts as a spoiler, seeing the Western Balkans as yet another arena in the competition with the United States and its allies.

Moldova is constitutionally neutral with no commitment to join NATO, unlike its two neighbors, NATO member Romania and aspirant NATO candidate Ukraine. Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, however, Moldova has found itself in a completely new international and security environment. Moscow's indiscriminate use of force just across the border and public statements that it intended to conquer vast territories -- and potentially attack Moldova as well -- changed the mood overnight.

The West's renewed interest in the region and the EU's eagerness to overcome its enlargement fatigue worked to the advantage of Moldova's governing party, the pro-European Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS). In less than two years, Moldova -- together with Ukraine -- managed to acquire EU candidate status and start formal talks on accession. These are achievements that in prewar times would likely have taken decades to complete at best. Moldova has also intensified its security cooperation with NATO, breaking a long-standing taboo based on fear of a Russian backlash.

Opinion polls suggest that the Moldovan public lags behind the government in perspectives on the war next door.Two years after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, as many as 30 percent of Moldovans said that Russia posed no threat to their country. Even many of those who opposed the Kremlin's intervention are in favor of accommodating Russia. In terms of national security, 58 percent of Moldovans believe that neutrality still offers the best protection for the country, while support for NATO accession has increased only marginally to 30 percent up from 20-25 percent in the prewar years. Support for EU membership is much stronger at around 60 percent, though the fear of provoking Russia is also tangible, with only 19 percent favoring the idea of quitting the Commonwealth of Independent States (the organization of former Soviet countries).

Even though the war has come dangerously close to Moldova's borders, so far it has failed to bring security issues to the forefront of public attention. In an August 2023 IRI poll, only 5 percent of Moldovans named war and conflict among their key concerns. The leading concerns were high prices (43 percent), corruption (27 percent), and low incomes (24 percent). Frustrated and disoriented by the socioeconomic difficulties exacerbated by the war, Moldovans are looking for easy explanations and solutions. According to a WatchDog.MD poll done in February 2023, over 40 percent of Moldovans deemed Russia a fascist state, while over 30 percent considered Ukraine to be run by fascists. Only around one third declared their readiness to defend their country in the event of a Russian invasion, and upward of 67 percent believed that President Maia Sandu should go to Moscow to negotiate a new gas contract. These findings suggest that economic problems largely eclipse security concerns for the majority of Moldovan society.

Russia is eager to take advantage of this confusion, and the war has made Moscow even less scrupulous in its methods. Over the past two years, the United States and EU have sanctioned a number of Russia-linked individuals for attempts to undermine Moldova's sovereignty, while Chisinau has expelled dozens of Russian diplomats for hostile actions. There is ample evidence that Moscow and its local proxies, led by the fugitive oligarch Ilan Shor, have been buying votes, staging anti-government protests, running disinformation campaigns, and spawning a plethora of new political parties to promote a pro-Russian agenda and sow confusion in the run-up to the autumn presidential election. Moscow views the upcoming vote as an opportunity to thwart Moldova's EU ambitions and bring pro-Russian forces back to power. The latter, despite being mired in numerous corruption scandals, still enjoy high support in Moldovan society, deftly capitalizing on socioeconomic difficulties.

Outside Ukraine itself, the most dramatic change in posture toward Russia in a post-Soviet country since 2022 has been in Armenia. For the past thirty years, Armenia's security concerns have centered on Azerbaijan and the future of the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh and its Armenian population. A military alliance with Russia first struck in 1996 and then renewed and extended in 2010 was seen as the best guarantee of Armenia's security and also of the status quo around Karabakh, which had been in Armenia's favor since the ceasefire of 1994.

Azerbaijan's victorious military campaign of 2020, followed by the war in Ukraine, put a strain on the Armenian-Russian alliance. Following an Azerbaijani military incursion into Armenian territory in September 2022, Armenia tried to trigger the security provisions of the Russia-led CSTO. Neither Russia, which also has a strong relationship with Azerbaijan, nor any other CSTO members came to Armenia's aid. Since then, Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan has publicly questioned the utility of Armenia's CSTO membership, and his officials have stopped attending CSTO meetings.

Anti-Russian sentiment in Armenia deepened further after Russian peacekeepers in Nagorno-Karabakh stood aside and allowed Azerbaijani forces to take the disputed region by force in its entirety in September 2023. Despite a forced exodus of the local Armenian population, Moscow did not criticize Azerbaijan for the takeover of Karabakh and instead lashed out at Pashinyan's government.

This is the context in which Armenian-Russian relations have soured rapidly and the Pashinyan government is looking to the West. Armenia is now turning to other partners beyond Russia to ensure its security. This means procuring weapons from France and India; accepting the EU civilian border-monitoring mission, EUMA, in southern Armenia against the objections of Azerbaijan; and hosting a (largely symbolic) U.S. military training exercise in September 2023. At the same time, Armenia seeks to strengthen its relationship with Georgia as a way of getting closer to the EU and increasing trade via the Black Sea with EU countries.

The EU can lay claim to being one of the most successful economic projects in history. Almost all countries that have joined it have become more prosperous, and this economic pull continues to attract neighboring states to aspire to join the union. This leaves Russia at a disadvantage and means that its pitch to its neighbors does not focus primarily on money. Russian foreign direct investment in all of these countries is minimal compared to the sums the EU and other countries such as China and TÃ¼rkiye spend on major industrial and infrastructure projects.

Moscow's strategy is a different one. Having learned from the failure of Soviet propaganda, modern-day Russia rarely challenges the fact that people in the West enjoy higher living standards. It does, however, successfully cast doubt on the West's ability to extend its own prosperity to the societies of Eastern Europe. Russia revels in showcasing discrepancies between generous Western promises and the gloomy realities of Eastern Europe. These exposures are usually followed by offers of a bird in the hand instead of two in the bush.

Putin's own rhetoric about the impact of the Moldova-EU Association Agreement is a case in point. According to the Russian leader, ""Moldovan goods have almost lost their traditional place in Russia and have not gained a foothold in other markets."" Putin's claim that the deal has led to a decrease in bilateral trade between Moldova and the EU was false, but it helps illustrate the way Moscow frames its message to neighboring countries: the benefits of cooperation with Russia may appear more basic, but they are easier to grasp. Be it Moldova's fruit, Armenia's cognac, or Georgia's tourism industry,Russia's neighbors would do better to stick with less affluent but less choosy Russian customers, because they have no chance of succeeding in the EU. Essentially, Moscow tries to persuade the societies of Eastern Europe that they are not good enough to achieve affluence in the Western system.

Discounted gas has long been an instrument Russia has used to wield influence. As of 2021, Moldova was 100 percent reliant on Russian gas. The country suffered an energy crisis in 2022 after Russia drastically cut supplies and Ukraine also reduced its exports of electricity. Today Moldova has fully weaned itself off of Russian gas and is increasing electricity imports from its European neighbors to the west.

In December 2023, Putin openly lobbied Moldovans, claiming that their choice to receive gas from the West was political and would hurt consumers. He said:

Moldova is one of Europe's poorest countries. Only recently, it was the poorest of them all. Today, Ukraine holds this title. But if one of Europe's poorest countries, which has been buying our energy resources at a price that was quite low, wants to follow in Germany's footsteps, go ahead. Today, Germany buys its energy resources from the United States and pays 30 percent more compared to what it imported from the Russian Federation. So, if they have some extra money to spend over in Moldova, let them go down this road.

The same message is being sent to Armenia, which currently pays Russia $165 per thousand cubic meters of gas, well below the market price in Europe.

A paradox of the Ukraine war is that even as Armenia's political and security relationship with Russia has deteriorated sharply, Armenia's economy has benefited from an influx of Russian migrants and Russia's need for trading partners. In 2023, Armenia-Russia trade volumes were worth more than $7.3 billion: a record number.

Russia uses sticks as well as carrots. In late 2023, Russia banned imports of agricultural produce from both Armenia and Moldova, supposedly on sanitary grounds. Farmers in both countries are heavily reliant on the Russian market. This followed a suspension of Armenian dairy exports in March 2023. Restrictions on the border crossing at Upper Lars in Georgia in the Caucasus mountains also hurt Armenian businesses that are reliant on this route to trade with Russia.

Russia has many opportunities to apply economic pressure tactics against Moldova and Armenia, just as it has done against Georgia in the past. However, the Kremlin must balance risky tactics such as cutting off gas exports or banning agricultural goods against the prospect that this will alienate the public in those countries and encourage their leaders to diversify their economies.

In 2006, Georgia and Moldova responded to a protracted Russian ban on wine exports by fundamentally restructuring and modernizing their wine industries. Even though Georgian wine eventually returned to the Russian market in 2013, it also expanded its inroads into other markets around the world, from China to Western Europe. While Russia is now once again the main export destination for Georgian wine, the country's ambitions would have been far narrower if Russia had not forced the issue.

Moldova is also diversifying its export markets. The EU overtook Russia as the country's leading export destination back in 2014, and that margin has gradually increased ever since. The war and the ensuing collapse of traditional transport routes dealt a final blow to Russia's status as a major market for Moldovan goods. In 2021-2023 export volumes halved, decreasing Russia's share in Moldova's exports to a negligible 3.5 percent. If sanctions against Russia are tightened or trade routes via Georgia shut down, Armenia may be forced to do the same and support for Russia among Armenia's traditionally Russian-oriented business community could fall.

Russia's ill-fated invasion of Ukraine has dealt a severe blow to its ability to project military and economic power in its neighborhood. A number of countries that are not members of either the EU or NATO, and that in the prewar years looked set to remain forever in a gray zone between Russia and the West, have suddenly found themselves much better positioned to make progress on the path of Euro-Atlantic integration and strengthen cooperation with both the EU and the United States. Many impediments remain, however, not least the unanimity principle in EU decisionmaking, which can still slow down or halt the accession prospects of candidate countries. In a country such as Armenia, whose government aspires to closer alignment with the West, European states face a more immediate problem: how to assist a government that is heavily reliant on Russian gas and wheat and that -- as a member of the Eurasian Economic Union -- is disqualified from pursuing a free trade agreement with the EU.

Moreover, even though pro-European sentiment has grown, societies in countries such as Armenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Moldova are divided, and opinion polls suggest there are many ""swing voters"" who are receptive to the messages of both Russia and the West.

The Kremlin's appeal has never been limited to solely financial or military issues. Its ever- deepening confrontation with the West has pushed Moscow into creating more sophisticated and comprehensive messaging in its attempt to present its vision as a viable alternative to a Western-led international order. Russia is good at taking advantage of local conflicts, capitalizing on preexisting tensions, and recruiting the support of disgruntled segments of society.

Negative messaging about the West gets an especially sympathetic hearing in those segments, especially among Orthodox Christian believers, who regard themselves as adherents of ""traditional values"" and are skeptical of the liberal values promoted in Western countries. Russia also appeals to the economically disadvantaged, such as rural farmers and migrant workers who do not see immediate obvious economic benefits of European integration and are more used to selling their products to Russia than to EU countries or working there.

In three forthcoming papers, Carnegie scholars will map out the more specific and differing challenges facing Armenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Moldova as they navigate relations with both Russia and the West. Despite their many differences, these three countries share a predicament in that their medium-term futures are highly dependent on the course of the war in Ukraine. In all these countries Moscow continues to send the message that its historic interest there is deep and long-term, and that the West can be an unreliable partner.",carnegieendowment.org,news,Carnegie Endowment for International Peace,,0.04313725490196085,454791071,7,https://carnegie-production-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/media/images/serbia-putin-new.jpg,eng-9612340

The funding is delivered via a fourth Important Project of Common European Interest (IPCEI) and will support research and innovation to work towards industrial deployment of the hydrogen value chain.

The project, known as IPCEI Hy2Move, was prepared and notified by seven Member States, which include Estonia, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Slovakia and Spain.

Investing in Europe's hydrogen infrastructure will contribute to the EU's 90% emissions reduction target by decarbonising mobility and transport sectors.

Margrethe Vestager, Executive Vice-President in charge of competition policy, commented: ""Hydrogen can support us to move around and transport goods with zero emissions.

""However, investing in hydrogen-powered mobility and transport technologies can be risky for one Member State or one company alone. This is where State aid rules for IPCEI have a role to play.

""The IPCEI Hy2Move is an example of truly ambitious European cooperation for a key common objective. It also shows how competition policy works hand in hand with breakthrough innovation.""

Under IPCEI Hy2Move, the seven Member States will inject â¬1.4bn of public funding, which is expected to generate an additional â¬3.3bn in private investments.

The funding will support 11 companies with activities in one or more Member States, including start-ups and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), who will run 13 projects.

The participating companies will work together and in partnership with Breuer Technical Development, a Belgian SME.

They will also engage with over 200 indirect partners, which include universities, research institutions, and other SMEs throughout Europe.

IPCEI Hy2Move will cover a wide range of the hydrogen technology value chain by supporting the development of several technological innovations.

These include the integration of hydrogen technologies in various transport means, such as road, maritime, and aviation. This involves creating fuel cell vehicle platforms for buses and trucks.

Additionally, the project focuses on developing high-performance fuel cell technologies that use hydrogen to generate electricity with enough power to move ships and locomotives.

It also aims to develop next-generation onboard hydrogen storage solutions, particularly lightweight and robust tanks for aircraft, to ensure safety and efficiency during flights.

Furthermore, IPCEI Hy2Move will advance technologies for producing hydrogen specifically for mobility and transport applications, ensuring on-site hydrogen refuelling stations can be supplied with pressurised, 99.99% pure, fuel-cell-grade hydrogen.

The overall IPCEI is expected to be completed by 2031, creating around 3,600 direct jobs and many more indirect opportunities.",innovationnewsnetwork.com,news,Innovation News Network,Jack Thomas,0.3568627450980393,454754294,1,https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Â©-shutterstockFOTOGRIN_2402113667.jpg,eng-9604649

The European Commission has approved a EUR 1.4 billion ($1.5 billion) joint state aid package put forward by Estonia, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Slovakia and Spain for research and development projects on hydrogen technologies and applications.

The IPCEI Hy2Move package, which is the fourth Important Project of Common European Interest (IPCEI) on the hydrogen value chain, supports 11 companies for 13 innovative projects. The owners' share of the investment is expected to be EUR 3.3 billion ($3.6 billion), the Commission said in a statement.

In the transport sector, IPCEI Hy2Move supports ""applications to integrate hydrogen technologies in transport means (road, maritime and aviation)... for example, fuel cell vehicle platforms for use in buses and trucks"". The companies selected in this sector are Air Products in the Netherlands; Airbus and BMW in Germany; Airbus and Hydrogene de France in France; Airbus and Evolution Synergetique in Spain; Skeleton in Estonia; and Tomark in Slovakia.

The aid also supports projects to develop high-performance fuel cell technologies, which use hydrogen to produce electricity. The recipients under this theme are Airbus and BMW in Germany; Hydrogene de France and Michelin in France; and UFI in Italy.

Another technology supported by IPCEI Hy2Move is hydrogen storage tanks. Funded for this undertaking are Airbus' French, German and Spanish arms, as well as BMW and Tomark.

IPCEI Hy2Move also picked projects on hydrogen production technologies, particularly those that can be used to refuel using pressurized 99.99 percent pure fuel cell-grade hydrogen. The beneficiaries in this topic are Air Products; Gen-Hy Cube and Michelin in France; and Neumann & Esser in Germany.

""The participating companies will cooperate with each other as well as with the associated partner Breuer Technical Development, a Belgian SME [small and medium enterprise], and with over 200 indirect partners, such as universities, research organizations and SMEs across Europe"", the Commission added.

""All 13 projects part of the IPCEI are highly ambitious, as they aim at developing technologies and processes that go beyond current technology and will allow major improvements notably in the areas of mobility and transport applications, fuel cells, on-board hydrogen storage and generation of hydrogen for the use in mobility and transport"", the Commission said.

Margrethe Vestager, executive vice president in charge of competition policy at the Commission, said in a statement, ""Hydrogen can support us to move around and transport goods with zero emissions, but investing into hydrogen powered mobility and transport technologies can be risky for one Member State or one company alone"".

""This is where State aid rules for IPCEI have a role to play"", Vestager added.

The EU aims to reach 10 million metric tons of hydrogen production capacity by 2030, as set out in the 27-member bloc's hydrogen strategy adopted 2020.

Last April the Commission announced the results of the first auction under the European Hydrogen Bank, an EU funding program to scale up hydrogen production. Seven projects across Finland, Norway, Portugal and Spain were to receive a total of EUR 720 million ($771.1 million).

""The winning bidders will produce renewable hydrogen in Europe and will receive a subsidy to bridge the price difference between their production costs and the market price for hydrogen, which is currently driven by non-renewable producers"", the Commission said in a statement April 30.

Three projects in Spain with a combined output of 595 megawatts electric (mWe) were among the seven provisional recipients, which will now have to undergo individual grant agreements with the European Climate, Infrastructure and Environment Executive Agency. Renato Ptx Holdco will build the 500 mWe Catalina project, while the other two smaller projects are under Benbros Energy SL (the 60 mWe El Alamillo H2) and Angus (the 35 mWe Hysencia).

The two Portuguese projects in this cohort have a combined capacity of 700 mWe: Madoquapower 2x's MP2X project (500 mWe) and Petrogal SA's Grey2Green II project (200 mWe).

In Norway, the Skiga project by the namesake company has a 117 mWe capacity.

Rounding up this round is the 90 mWe eNRG Lahti project of Nordic Ren-Gas Oy in Finland.

""Together, the winning bidders plan to produce 1.58 million tonnes of renewable hydrogen over ten years, avoiding more than 10 million tonnes of CO2 [carbon dioxide] emissions"", the Commission said.

""The renewable hydrogen they produce will be used in sectors such as steel, chemicals, maritime transport and fertilizers"", it said.

The seven projects will receive subsidies of EUR 8 million ($8.6 million) to EUR 245 million ($264.4 million).

In the inaugural rollout, the producers get a fixed premium per kilogram of output, capped at EUR 4.5 ($4.9) a kilogram.

Projects throughout the duration of the Hydrogen Bank will receive a subsidy on top of the market revenues that they generate from hydrogen sales, for up to 10 years. They will have to start producing renewable hydrogen within five years upon the signing of grant agreements.

For the awardees in the first auction, the Commission expects the grant agreements to be signed by November.",rigzone.com,news,Rigzone,,0.3411764705882352,454748685,7,https://images.rigzone.com/images/news/articles/Seven-EU-States-Provide-15B-Funding-for-Hydrogen-RD-176915-582x327.webp,eng-9604649

Intelligence experts have warned that Europe is under a growing threat from Russian sabotage operations, and believe those operations aim to secure concrete military results in Ukraine, political and economic costs to Europe, and nuisance value.

""We are experiencing the early stages of a systematic activation of Russian sleeper cells worldwide,"" Joseph Fitsanakis, professor of Intelligence and National Security Studies at Coastal Carolina University, told Al Jazeera. ""This is an unprecedented phenomenon in Western post-war history.""

The Financial Times this month cited intelligence of imminent Russian hybrid operations in Germany, Sweden and the United Kingdom, and a report from Chatham House, a London-based think tank, detailed incidents across Europe that ""match predictions of what Russia would attempt to do in advance of an open conflict with NATO"".

The author of that report told Al Jazeera that Russia has a scattershot of aims, including causing trouble just to see what will happen.

""Russia has this view of security where anything they do to damage us is relatively speaking good for them because it makes them stronger,"" said Keir Giles, a senior consulting fellow at Chatham House. ""That in itself is an incentive to do things which are disruptive.""

In late April, two Finnair flights were forced to return home after GPS jamming prevented them from landing at Tartu, Estonia's second-largest city. The airline suspended flights for a month to find an alternative landing system.

The Finnish transport agency blamed Moscow.

""It is possible that the interference observed in aviation currently [is] most likely a side effect of Russia's self-protection. In practice, self-protection interference is used to prevent the navigation and control of drones controlled by [global navigation satellite systems] or mobile frequencies,"" it said in a statement. ""The interference has not only remained within Russia's borders, but has also reached Finnish territory.""

Giles explained, that the GPS jamming ""may have started with absolutely nothing in mind with regard to disrupting air traffic across Europe ... But once it became clear that those disruptive effects are substantial and there's no downside to Russia for doing it, then there's no reason why they shouldn't expand.""

This nuisance approach may not sound alarming for European security, but at the very least it suggests that Russia feels no constraints against performing any disruption of which it is capable.

And the disruption goes well beyond nuisance.

Soviet operatives and their proxies would typically target network industries such as electric cables, power stations, pipelines, transport and telecommunications, Daniela Richterova, a senior lecturer in Intelligence Studies at the War Studies Department of King's College London, told Al Jazeera.

That is precisely the kind of infrastructure that has reportedly been attacked.

""We're seeing this happen at a time of escalation. That was a key part of [Soviet] doctrine, that sabotage operations were meant to be used also in a time of peace if necessary, but especially in times of war, and they were meant to undermine the enemy's resolve, power and war effort.""

The use of proxies is also a telltale sign, she said.

Last month, Germany arrested two dual nationals on suspicion of plotting to plant explosives at US military facilities in Bavaria. The UK has arrested several people this year on similar suspicions. The people arrested are not considered to be members of the Russian General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU), which typically plans sabotage operations.

The GRU is also suspected of acting directly.

In early May, NATO said GRU had launched cyberattacks against critical infrastructure in Germany, the Czech Republic, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Sweden. All of them, along with Finland and Estonia, are among the Nordic group of countries that comprise Russia's most vocal critics and Ukraine's most dedicated allies in Europe. The GRU is also believed to field 20 to 40 operations officers, said experts.

Russian government officials generally do not comment on their own covert operations, but on Tuesday Putin reciprocated Western accusations to mark the anniversary of the FSB, Russia's Federal Security Service, whose duties include guarding the borders.

""Largely due to the resolve of the border security troops, numerous attempts to break into the Russian territory by mercenaries, traitors and enemy sabotage groups have been thwarted,"" said Putin, referring to incursions on Russian territory by anti-Putin Russian militias operating from Ukrainian soil.

""Those who planned these terrorist raids on our land have miscalculated and were met with a harsh and brutal rebuff,"" said Putin in a video address.

Russia's ultimate aim is military advantage, said Fitsanakis.

""Currently the Russian sabotage campaign appears to be aimed primarily at disrupting the military supply chain from the West to Ukraine.""

That means stopping the flow of weapons, or destroying the weapons themselves, and Russia's attempts to do so go back a decade. Last month, Czech police said the detonation of 63 tonnes of ordnance intended for Ukraine at a warehouse in Vrbetice in October 2014 was the work of GRU.

Front-line states Poland and Romania, from whose borders all war materiel enters Ukraine, are at obvious risk, said Fitsanakis, but earlier stages in the supply chain are equally critical. That includes Norwegian logistics facilities, ports on the US eastern seaboard, and military instructors in Darwin, Australia.

""A typical example is the port of Alexandroupolis in Greece, which the US Department of Defense credits as providing Washington with 'strategic access' to its Ukrainian ally,"" said Fitsanakis. ""Until recently, the port in this small northern Greek city was far removed from the epicentre of global geopolitics. As a result, security had to be elevated drastically within weeks.""

In addition to military targets, Fitsanakis added, ""Their skills are evolving with an eye to intensification, in case of an all-out war with NATO.""

In that case, sabotage operations would spread to the full gamut of network industries, aiming to shut down travel, power and telecommunications overnight, sending civilian society back to the 19th century and creating political pressure on governments to sue for peace - what Fitsanakis calls, ""mass-scale psychological objectives"".

Early this year, a series of NATO military chiefs publicly warned that the latest intelligence suggested a Russia-NATO war in the next five to eight years was more likely than had previously been thought, and European militaries should prepare accordingly.

EU governments have stepped up long-term contracts to defence industries since January, but it is more difficult to provide security over sprawling infrastructure.

The prime example of this is the North Sea, said Christian Bueger, a professor of Maritime Security at the University of Copenhagen.

""The North Sea today is just a dense industrialised infrastructure environment where there's multiple points of failure,"" he told Al Jazeera.

It's not just the pipelines, data and electricity cables that criss-cross the shallow sea floor, which have already come under suspected attack - most recently when a Russian-operated Chinese merchant vessel dragged its anchors on the sea floor, rupturing the Baltic Connector gas pipeline and telecoms cables between Estonia and Finland last October.

""We are also talking about a lot of emerging infrastructure,"" Bueger said. ""In many ways, the future of the green energy transition hangs on what we can do in the North Sea.""

That includes future offshore wind parks, hydrogen pipelines, and disused oilfields that are intended for carbon storage.

""We haven't even started to consider what the security implication of carbon storage will be,"" Bueger said.

Compared with protection, disruption is frighteningly easy. ""You don't need a submarine,"" said Bueger. ""Most of the time it will be easier to do it from the surface to hide in the official traffic ... you can do it with divers, you can do it with anchors ... you can also potentially do it with submersibles and autonomous vessels.""

NATO has started a subsea infrastructure protection centre.

France and Italy are co-ordinating on a system of marine sensors. The Royal Navy is acquiring an underwater surveillance vessel. But the biggest problem is jurisdictional, said Bueger, who is involved in several transnational projects to build information-sharing protocols across the military, coastguard, law enforcement and shipping industry in EU NATO countries.

""There's been a complete and abject failure by Western leaderships to explain to their electorates just what is at stake,"" said Chatham House's Giles.

""It's telling that the primary instinct from a lot of people seems to be, 'What other defensive measures can we take?' that are going to make life more expensive and inconvenient across Europe,"" he said. ""It's all defensive, it's all reactive. There's nothing apparently being suggested to deal with the root of the problem, which lies in Moscow.""

There are plenty of self-imposed constraints Europe could do away with to push back against Russia. Ukraine has pleaded with Germany to provide long-range Taurus missiles to attack Russian infrastructure - something Germany resists for fear of provoking a nuclear attack.

A growing chorus of legal experts says Europe may confiscate 210 billion euros ($228bn) in EU-held Russian central bank assets. France's President Emmanuel Macron has raised the prospect of sending NATO troops to man Ukraine's rear, and Estonia's Kaja Kallas says some have already done so. Nordic and Baltic countries fearing attack are already putting their economies on a partial war footing, but Germany finds itself unable to overcome legal constraints to spend more on the military.

Giles said all this allows Russia to steal a march on Europe, ""[Russia's] idea of how much you can do without precipitating conflict has been precipitated by Western countries not setting boundaries.""

""The fact that there's no downside is the defining factor of how Russia has seen sub-threshold operations over the last decade.""",aljazeera.com,news,Al Jazeera Online,John T Psaropoulos,0.07450980392156858,454674344,1,https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2018-11-02T160626Z_951838612_RC191D3F4740_RTRMADP_3_BRITAIN-RUSSIA-PUTIN-1716974507.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,eng-9600352

Tachyum Demonstrates Full BF16 AI Support in GCC and PyTorch

LAS VEGAS-(BUSINESS WIRE)-#Linux -- Tachyum today announced that it has successfully integrated the BF16 data type into its Prodigy compiler and software distribution, which is now available to early adopters and customers as a pre-installed image as part of beta testing.

BF16, or bfloat16, is a shortened floating point data type based on the IEEE 32-bit single-precision floating point data type (f32). It is used to accelerate machine learning by reducing storage requirements and increasing the calculation speed of ML algorithms. Tachyum now fully supports BF16 for use with GCC 13.2 (GNU Compiler Collection); HPC/linear algebra Eigen library optimized for Prodigy Universal Processor; and PyTorch AI framework.

Tachyum's Prodigy was designed to handle matrix and vector processing from the ground up rather than as an afterthought. Among Prodigy's vector and matrix features are support for a range of data types (FP64, FP32, TF32, BF16, Int8, FP8, FP4 and TAI); 2Ã1024-bit vector units per core; AI sparsity and super-sparsity support; and no penalty for misaligned vector loads or stores when crossing cache lines. This built-in support offers high performance for AI training and inference workloads, increases performance and reduces memory utilization.

""We continue to strengthen our software distribution package to ensure the greatest breadth of application, framework and library support for Prodigy in advance of its release,"" said Dr. Radoslav Danilak, founder and CEO of Tachyum. ""The use of BF16 improves hardware efficiency by improving performance. Our support of the format is consistent with our goals of having Prodigy provide the performance required of hyperscale, high-performance computing and AI workloads without modifications and affirms our commitment to transforming data centers around the world.""

As a Universal Processor offering industry-leading performance for all workloads, Prodigy-powered data center servers can seamlessly and dynamically switch between computational domains (such as AI/ML, HPC, and cloud) with a single homogeneous architecture. By eliminating the need for expensive dedicated AI hardware and dramatically increasing server utilization, Prodigy reduces CAPEX and OPEX significantly while delivering unprecedented data center performance, power, and economics. Prodigy integrates 192 high-performance custom-designed 64-bit compute cores, to deliver up to 4.5x the performance of the highest-performing x86 processors for cloud workloads, up to 3x that of the highest performing GPU for HPC, and 6x for AI applications.

A video demonstration of image classification using ResNet model utilizing native PyTorch implementation on Tachyum Linux on a Prodigy emulation system is available for viewing at https://youtu.be/BOZ2ZV6Nr48 . The demonstrated ResNet model has been quantized using the BF16 data type to take advantage of Prodigy BF16 vector instruction, particularly activation, loss and reduction functions. The next video will demonstrate the completion of FP8 testing.

Tachyum is transforming the economics of AI, HPC, public and private cloud workloads with Prodigy, the world's first Universal Processor. Prodigy unifies the functionality of a CPU, a GPU, and a TPU in a single processor to deliver industry-leading performance, cost and power efficiency for both specialty and general-purpose computing. As global data center emissions continue to contribute to a changing climate, with projections of their consuming 10 percent of the world's electricity by 2030, the ultra-low power Prodigy is positioned to help balance the world's appetite for computing at a lower environmental cost. Tachyum recently received a major purchase order from a US company to build a large-scale system that can deliver more than 50 exaflops performance, which will exponentially exceed the computational capabilities of the fastest inference or generative AI supercomputers available anywhere in the world today. When complete in 2025, the Prodigy-powered system will deliver a 25x multiplier vs. the world's fastest conventional supercomputer - built just this year - and will achieve AI capabilities 25,000x larger than models for ChatGPT4.

The project contributes to the EU's target of 90% reduction of emissions from the mobility and transport sectors, in order for the EU to become climate-neutral by 2050. By fostering the use of hydrogen as a fuel, it will also help achieve the objectives of the European Green Deal, the EU Hydrogen Strategy and the Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy.

The project, called 'IPCEI Hy2Move', was jointly prepared and notified by seven Member States: Estonia, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Slovakia and Spain.

The Member States will provide up to â¬1.4 billion in public funding, which is expected to unlock additional â¬3.3 billion in private investments. As part of this IPCEI, 11 companies with activities in one or more Member States, including small and medium-sized enterprises ('SMEs') and start-ups, will undertake 13 innovative projects.

IPCEI Hy2Move will cover a wide part of the hydrogen technology value chain, by supporting the development of a set of technological innovations, including:

The development of mobility and transport applications to integrate hydrogen technologies in transport means (road, maritime and aviation). This includes, for example, fuel cell vehicle platforms for use in buses and trucks.The development of high-performance fuel cell technologies, which use hydrogen to generate electricity with sufficient power to move ships and locomotives.The development of next generation on-board storage solutions for hydrogen. For the use in aircraft, lightweight, yet robust hydrogen tanks are necessary ensuring safety and efficiency in flight conditions.The development of technologies to produce hydrogen for mobility and transport applications, in particular for supplying hydrogen refuelling stations on-site with pressurised, 99.99% pure fuel-cell-grade hydrogen.

IPCEI Hy2Move complements the first three IPCEIs on the hydrogen value chain. The Commission approved IPCEI 'Hy2Tech' on 15 July 2022, which focuses on the development of hydrogen technologies for end users. IPCEI 'Hy2Use' was approved on 21 September 2022 and focuses on hydrogen applications in the industrial sector. IPCEI 'Hy2Infra', approved by the Commission on 15 February 2024, concerns infrastructure investments, which are not covered by the first two IPCEIs. Hy2Move focuses exclusively on specific challenges and objectives that arise for hydrogen technology in mobility and transport applications.

The completion of the overall IPCEI is expected by 2031, with timelines varying in function of the individual projects and the companies involved. Around 3,600 direct jobs are expected to be created, and many more indirect ones.

The Commission assessment

The Commission assessed the proposed project under EU State aid rules, more specifically its 2021 Communication on Important Projects of Common European Interest ('IPCEI Communication'). Where private initiatives supporting breakthrough innovation fail to materialise because of the significant risks such projects entail, the IPCEI rules enable Member States to jointly fill the gap to overcome these important market failures. At the same time, the IPCEI rules ensure that the EU economy at large benefits from the supported investments and limit potential distortions to competition.

The Commission has found that the IPCEI Hy2Move fulfils the required conditions set out in its Communication. In particular, the Commission concluded that:

The project contributes to a common objective by supporting a key strategic value chain for the future of Europe in particular contributing to the objectives of the European Green Deal, the EU Hydrogen Strategy and the Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy.All 13 projects part of the IPCEI are highly ambitious, as they aim at developing technologies and processes that go beyond current technology and will allow major improvements notably in the areas of mobility and transport applications, fuel cells, on-board hydrogen storage and generation of hydrogen for the use in mobility and transport.The project also involves significant technological and financial risks, and public support is therefore necessary to provide incentives to companies to carry out the investment.Aid to individual companies is limited to what is necessary, proportionate and does not unduly distort competition. In particular, the Commission has verified that the total planned maximum aid amounts are in line with the eligible costs of the projects and their funding gaps. Furthermore, if large projects covered by the IPCEI turn out to be very successful, generating extra net revenues, the companies will return part of the aid received to the respective Member States (claw-back mechanism).The results of the project will be widely shared by participating companies with the European scientific community and industry beyond the companies and Member States that are part of the IPCEI, including through conferences, publications, access to pilot and production facilities, or licensing of intellectual property rights. As a result, positive spill-over effects will be generated throughout Europe.

On this basis, the Commission concluded that the project is in line with EU State aid rules.

Funding, participants and structure of the IPCEI

The project will involve 13 projects of 11 companies in one or more Member States, including small and medium-sized enterprises ('SMEs') and start-ups.

The figure below presents the overall structure of IPCEI Hy2Move, including the individual workstreams:

The participating companies will cooperate with each other as well as with the associated partner Breuer Technical Development, a Belgian SME, and with over 200 indirect partners, such as universities, research organisations and SMEs across Europe.

The ecosystem created by the IPCEI Hy2Move with its direct participants, the associated partner and the Member States supporting them, and the different project areas are as follows:

Germany, Slovakia and Spain included their participation in the IPCEI Hy2Move in their Recovery and Resilience Plans and thus can partly fund their projects through the Recovery and Resilience Facility.

'Prosumers' -- private households with wind and solar installations, in particular play a key role.

A report published this week by Bankwatch, a network of grassroots, environmental and human rights groups across Central and Eastern Europe, suggests that the EU's Green Deal, and its approach of combining a lift in climate ambition with new financial and other support instruments, has started to change the perception of the CEE region as a laggard when it comes to clean energy transition.

Ahead of two CEE presidencies of the European Council (Hungary and Poland), the new European Commission should now build on this progress and step up its support for the energy transition in CEE countries, the report, which analyses progress made in eight CEE countries (Bulgaria, Czechia, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Poland, Romania, Slovakia) over the last five years, argues.

The Green Deal is one of the greatest legacies of the current Ursula von der Leyen Commission (2019-24). A firm priority introduced at the inception of the Commission's term with strong political leadership, it has been followed up with multiple strategies and pieces of legislation. It has given the EU a solid impetus to tackle important environmental challenges such as climate change or biodiversity loss.

However, the Commission's mandate comes to an end in 2024 with most climate policies adopted. While debate remains about the level of ambition that will eventually have been achieved, the time has come to implement the new standards to make sure the EU's 2030 climate objectives can be fulfilled.

It will be the task of the incoming Commission to ensure consistent implementation across Europe. Particular focus will need to be on those countries and regions where challenges are higher than elsewhere, due to a higher reliance on fossil fuels or a lack of political support to change.

That is the case in many Central and Eastern European countries. The region is dependent on the EU to advance the climate agenda, with EU policies, funds and other tools instrumental in driving the transition.

EU funds also help to drive policy change thanks to financial support for specific clean energy measures. The post-pandemic recovery fund helped to make some CEE countries commit to phasing out coal by a certain date while providing the funds needed for introducing renewables and improving energy efficiency.

More recent events, particularly the large-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, also had a major impact on the latest developments in the CEE region, disrupting the energy system.

However, important challenges remain to CEE countries embarking on a lasting energy transition, not the least of which is governments continuing to plan for a high reliance on fossil gas.

Plans for new nuclear meanwhile compete with a faster rollout of renewables and energy efficiency measures, and there are technical difficulties in integrating renewables into the grids.

Then there are those governments that are simply reluctant to fully embrace climate objectives, putting the transition in serious jeopardy.

To overcome these challenges, Central and Eastern Europe needs to play a central role in the next phase of the European Green Deal that will be shaped by the next European Commission. A failure to do so would come with serious risk, as the strongest political opposition against the European Green Deal often comes from this region.

A successful contribution of the region to Europe's energy transition is especially important given the central role it plays in other areas: first and foremost security -- being on the front line of a hostile Russia -- but also in terms of its contribution to the EU's economic competitiveness through key sectors such as IT.

The Commission will start its mandate and propose new priorities concurrently with two Council presidencies from the CEE area: Hungary in the second half of 2024, and Poland in the first part of 2025. These presidencies offer an occasion to put the spotlight on the region and make sure climate action is enabled to the fullest extent there.

However, both countries present problems. While Hungary's political ambition for the energy transition is underscored by a goal of achieving climate neutrality by 2050, enshrined in a 2020 law, its National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP) presents weak interim targets, prioritising gas and nuclear power.

Political decisions, such as the construction of combined cycle gas turbine plants and reliance on Russian fossil gas imports, hinder a robust energy transition, suggests Bankwatch.

Furthermore, Hungary relies on EU funds to roll out its energy transition. However, the government's uncooperative attitude to the EU, including its rule of law conditionality mechanism, is putting these funds into jeopardy, impacting crucial energy transition initiatives.

Other challenges in Hungary's energy transition landscape include the dominant influence of major industrial actors shaping government policies, hindering the move towards a carbon-neutral and decentralised energy economy. Limited freedom of information and government control over media further impede meaningful public discourse on the energy and climate crisis.

Poland has the highest share of fossil fuels in its power mix, mainly coal and lignite, out of the eight countries profiled at 72.9 per cent of its electricity mix in 2023. It has yet to set an end date for the phase out of coal.

However, some progress has been made even under very difficult circumstances with the previous conservative populist Law and Justice (PiS) government signalling severe unwillingness to engage in any dialogue regarding the phase-out of coal before 2049.

Nevertheless, renewables increased in their share of power generation by 74 per cent between 2019 and 2023, and there is hope that the new Polish government will set much more ambitious energy transition targets. The country's new Secretary of State for Climate Urszula ZieliÅska said in January 2024 that the new government plans to set an end date for coal.

Another report published this week, by Beyond Fossil Fuels and Polish Green Network meanwhile reveals that Polish energy communities eager to deploy more solar are being stymied by a combination of push-back from established state-owned energy companies, a lack of financial support, inadequate grid infrastructure, and a web of regulatory uncertainties.

As a result, although Poland's solar capacity has more than doubled in the last three years, only 30 of the EU's 9,000 energy communities are located in Poland.

Poland's installed solar capacity surged to over 17 GW in 2023, making it the fourth-largest solar market in the European Union with over 1.3 million micro solar installations contributing to the energy mix. But the Energising Communities: Transforming Poland's Power Sector with Locally-owned Renewables report finds that despite the immense public appetite for solar, communities that seek to combine their resources and launch an energy cooperative face a needlessly tough operating environment.

""Energy communities consistently tell us they're eager to seize the potential of solar power to reduce energy bills, create local jobs and cut air pollution. They also recognise that decentralised solar systems have been far more effective in the context of Russia's onslaught in neighbouring Ukraine than the centralised power system,"" says Michal Zablocki from Beyond Fossil Fuels.

""But these voluntary, community-based initiatives face an uneven playing field due to the presence of large state-owned power companies, and must overcome numerous funding, grid-connection and regulatory hurdles.""

Twenty years after the first wave of EU enlargement to the East, there is still significant fragmentation between EU countries when it comes to decarbonising national energy systems.

The energy transition in CEE countries has made progress; indeed, some CEE countries such as Latvia and Romania are now front runners in renewable energy deployment.

However, barriers to a net zero energy system in all CEE countries remain -- many of them political. Governments still do not consider the energy transition a priority, with long-term strategies and policy frameworks missing.

The Hungarian and Polish European Council presidencies present the region with a chance to shine -- but it remains to be seen if the governments of the two countries will make the most of the opportunity.

Do you share this existential concern?

Yes, Europe is mortal. It is important to remember this, especially at a time when its values are under attack. They are under attack from outside, if we think of the war in Ukraine, the challenges posed by Russia's interference and the actions of foreign powers trying to influence our democratic elections. But they are also being challenged from within: we see it in the European Parliament and in some Member States, with governments trying to oppose or undermine the foundations of the European Union. These attempts could succeed if we are not strong enough to counter them. Imagine a European Union in which we could no longer move forward, in which we could no longer define new projects, despite not being satisfied with the status quo. There are areas in which we might need to go further, such as defence, and areas in which we might need to allow for more national flexibility, such as agriculture. If we don't question the situation, if we don't manage to set a course, we shall be heading for disaster. Europe will not survive if it does not evolve.

Against this backdrop, the forthcoming European elections will be particularly important. And they could result in a clear upsurge for the far right...

The far right is on the rise, not everywhere, but in France in particular, as well as in countries such as Portugal, which until now have been relatively unaffected by this phenomenon. In Italy, it has shifted from one party to another, in a system of communicating vessels: Giorgia Meloni is riding high, but she is taking votes from the League (Lega). This development is clearly worrying. The more extremists there are in Parliament, the more complicated it will be to build or find compromises to advance the European cause.

Even if the majority remains pro-European, should we expect the next Parliament to become more right-wing?

The pro-European right is sometimes tempted to imitate the far right because it thinks it can win back its electorate. However, the French example has clearly shown that this does not work. Moreover, pro-Europeans are in the majority in most of the Member States: now they must go out and vote. Abstention is a huge problem because it allows extremists to win more seats. I do not agree that we should take it for granted that the far right will get stronger in the next elections. Look at Germany. When people heard about the AfD's (Alternative fÃ¼r Deutschland) conference on ""remigration"", the plan to expel all foreigners and German citizens of foreign origin, there were massive demonstrations in the streets, and awareness was triggered among the population. As a result, the far right is declining in the opinion polls. We have to fight, because if we give up, we have already lost. All democrats obviously stand in solidarity with our colleague Matthias Ecke, who was attacked in Dresden. This shows that democratic gains are under pressure. As democrats, we support each other in the face of extremist attacks.

The Renew group, to which your party the FDP (Freie Demokratische Partei) belongs, could lose its position as the third party in the hemicycle. Is one of the reasons for this the divisions within the European liberal family?

I do not agree with the narrative that Renew is divided. All the political groups are divided and Renew is no more divided than the others. The Socialists are divided on agricultural issues, the Christian Democrats on economic issues, not a single group in the European Parliament agrees on everything. And that is normal, because MEPs come from different countries, different cultures and different national situations. Renew is present in 24 out of 27 countries, so sometimes there are divisions within the group on certain issues, and some MEPs do not vote in the same way as the rest of the group. But it is extremely united on the fundamentals that led to its creation, namely a very humanist approach to politics and a belief that Europe should be competitive and economically strong.

What makes the FDP unique within Renew?

As elected liberals, we have a particular position; whereas in some countries there is a social liberal party and also a right-wing liberal party, the FDP unites the two. We are generally further to the right than our French colleagues on economic issues and further to the left than them regarding social questions. We place high value on freedom in both an economic and a societal sense. For example, we are in favour of same-sex marriage and adoption by same-sex couples, we are in favour of liberalising cannabis, and we have rather liberal positions on immigration. On this subject, we are in favour of economic immigration to make up for labour shortages. We also have a humanitarian responsibility towards those who are persecuted in their own countries and fleeing war. But we must send back those who do not respect the rules of our countries, who do not have the right to stay or who do not want to integrate, as well as criminals.

You are standing again in the European elections. What are your priorities for the next term?

The first is to take Europe forward regarding defence. This is obviously closely linked to the war in Ukraine, because this has highlighted that we are still partly dependent on aid from the United States. But we do not know what will happen in the forthcoming American elections. I believe, and this is the FDP's programme, that Europe must be more sovereign when it comes to military capabilities. This means more investment in this area, more cooperation between Member States, including in the training of troops and soldiers in the use of drones and other new technologies. The first objective would be to be able to rapidly deploy troops in the field, but in my opinion, we should go further and set ourselves the long-term goal of creating a European army. Such an army should then be equipped with a common command placed under the control of the European Parliament: this would probably be an unthinkable prospect for the French, but it is shared by the German political parties who want a European army. Germany has a complicated history, and one of the lessons it has learnt is that we must not place all the power in the hands of one person who decides everything.

Emmanuel Macron supports a European preference for military purchases in Europe and defends the idea of a European defence loan. What do you think of these ideas, which are not by any means unanimously supported in Germany?

The question of a European loan remains complicated for the Germans, because for us the European Union should not go into debt. Having said that, the idea of a European defence loan requires debate, because we need investment and therefore money. As for a European preference for military purchases, we could subscribe to it, but not immediately, because the most important thing right now is not to buy European but to help the Ukrainians. If, for example, we need to buy arms or munitions and they are not available in the EU, then we should buy them elsewhere. But in the long term, if we can achieve sufficient production capacity in Europe and perhaps even support European champions, let's go for it. I do not believe, however, that we should abolish all competition in the armaments sector. Airbus would not be as good as it is without competition from Boeing. I would also say that ""European preference"" should not end up as ""let's buy French"" or ""let's buy German"". Behind all this is an industrial strategy that should not be guided by national, but by European interests. We need to speed things up and find a common path. Member States, however, have different sensitivities on the subject: four of them are not members of NATO and neutrality is part of the Irish Constitution. To move forward more quickly on defence, we need to see if we can't, as we did with the euro or Schengen, deepen cooperation with many countries, but not with 27.

What about the Franco-German dimension?

We cannot do without it. Europe will only move forward if France and Germany agree and show the way.

Is Europe up to the requirements, the risks and the challenges posed by the war in Ukraine?

Europe reacted quickly, and well. But it must not slacken in its efforts; it must continue. There are strategic and military needs, such as the Patriot or Taurus missiles, for which we must do more and respond to the requests of the Ukrainians. In the end, the Ukrainians are defending our European Union and our freedom. I don't believe at all in the theory that if Putin were to win in Ukraine he would stop there. No, he would not stop there, he would continue, including in EU countries. Our colleagues in the Baltic States are afraid, deeply afraid. Putin is uncontrollable, so nothing can be ruled out. That is why Ukraine must absolutely win this war.

In addition to defence, you mentioned other priorities for the next term of office ...

The second one is competitiveness. We need to be very clear on this point: it has not been a priority during Ursula von der Leyen's term of office. We need to change our approach on this issue and tackle European bureaucracy, excessive documentation and reporting requirements as a matter of priority. We shall need proposals from the European Commission after Ms von der Leyen's departure.

Are you suggesting that Mrs von der Leyen might not be reappointed to head the Commission?

Look at the Sorbonne speech, Emmanuel Macron wants to change the narrative of Europe. When he wanted to change the narrative of his government, what did he do? He changed Prime Minister! And there's the answer. The EPP will retain the Presidency of the Commission. But I'd be happy to have someone else in the job. Mrs von der Leyen is very good at representing the European Union on the world stage, but her first task is to advance European law, and she has not focused on the right priorities. Admittedly, she talked more about defence when the war broke out in Ukraine, which is a good thing. But she has failed to change course on competitiveness issues, and she has let Frans Timmermans[1] continue as if nothing were wrong. Companies from third countries, particularly multinationals, are not investing enough in Europe because the rules are too strict. So, in the long term, we run the risk of losing jobs, particularly in industry, and of losing income, and therefore the opportunity to invest in social welfare, education and so on. So, the lack of foreign investment in Europe is a real problem. One of the major challenges of the next mandate will be to apply the rules we have adopted. For example, we need to see whether the implementation of the Green Deal is in keeping with expectations, or whether we need to reassess the rules. Regarding the end of the internal combustion engine in 2035, for example, we should see whether the projections come true, and ask ourselves what we have to do if they do not. Will we have to distribute more aid, invest more in research, impose constraints on Member States? Electric car charging points are mainly being built in three countries: the Netherlands, Germany and France. What are the countries doing? What do we need to do to make it work elsewhere? There is a real East/West divide on this issue.

Should we not rethink the common trade policy to adapt it to new geopolitical constraints?

Europe's economic success is based on trade. So, the right response cannot be to have less trade. On the contrary, we need to forge trade agreements with our strategic democratic partners around the world. If we don't manage to do this with the United States, Canada or Australia, it will be a failure. It is imperative that we move forward on this.

It is not necessarily a question of trading less, but of doing it differently, by insisting on mirror clauses, reciprocity, fair manufacturing conditions, etc.

We need to improve the rules and conditions of production in terms of labour law, ecology and the fight against climate change. But what does a mirror clause mean -- asking third countries to apply exactly the same rules as the European Union? It is a little naive to think that this would be possible. A great deal of progress can already be made with the certification of production conditions. We also need to combat unfair competition, such as that from Chinese electric cars, which are heavily subsidised. But China is the biggest market in the world, and it is important for our companies to be able to export there. I wouldn't say that everything is simple and easy when it comes to trade, so we have to try to resolve the problems by relying on the WTO and the international rules to which we have subscribed. Another factor weighing on European competitiveness is the excessive price of energy. As a German liberal, I agree with Emmanuel Macron on the nuclear issue. The does not mean discussing old power stations that have been closed down, but about a new way of producing electricity, thanks to smaller plants that use technologies in which Europeans are at the cutting edge. Fear of nuclear power is deeply rooted in German society and there is currently no appetite to invest in this area. Other countries have decided to hedge their bets on it. That is their right and, alongside renewables, it is an option that should not be neglected in Europe because it is a carbon-neutral form of energy. Even though we should not ignore the problems of the waste it produces ....

And your third main priority?

The third aspect is the defence of the rule of law against those who wish to damage the European cause. We have to tell the truth: far-right parties do not want to serve the people of Europe, they do not want to serve the European cause, they want to serve their own interests or those of certain third countries. In this respect, they represent a real danger within our continent itself. We must not close our eyes to this. It is very important for the European Union to guarantee the fundamental rights of European citizens, whether with or against their governments. We achieved a major victory during this term of office with the adoption of the conditionality mechanism, which makes it possible to block European funds be granted to states that do not respect fundamental rights and the basic principles of democracy. The countries that are breaching the rule of law in the Union right now are Viktor Orban's Hungary and Robert Fico's Slovakia. I would say that not everything is rosy in Greece either, with members of parliament being spied on by their own government and the freedom of the press diminishing. The situation is not yet comparable to that in Hungary, but we need to be vigilant.

Europe could be enlarged over the next few years to include new countries. Is it ready for this?

We cannot proceed with further enlargements without first making the necessary institutional reforms. The European Union will not be able to welcome other countries as it stands while it is already not functioning correctly with 27 Member States. In particular, we need to get rid of the unanimity requirement. We also need a stronger European Parliament, which can better control the Commission by being able to investigate and summon the Commissioners. We can draw inspiration from many other national parliaments, which have greater rights vis-Ã -vis their governments than we do.

Is it fair to say, as some believe, that Ukraine was promised membership of the European Union too quickly?

No, because it was the right decision to grant Ukraine candidate country status. This means that we shall be able to help it better. But it will take many years, even decades, for Ukraine to join the European Union.",robert-schuman.eu,news,Fondation Robert Schuman,,-0.04313725490196074,454585796,1,https://server.www.robert-schuman.eu/storage/images/banque/largeur-975/image-illustration-ee1.png,

Ukrenergo CEO Volodymyr Kudrytskiy said last week that 3,500 to 4,000 MWh of interstate interconnector capacity could be installed in the next five years and European grid companies needed to reinforce their substations, install additional transformers, build new transmission lines.

May 27 (Interfax) - Power outage schedules will be in effect again for Ukrainian households and industrial enterprises on Monday, May 27, Ukrainian media said, citing an Ukrenergo statement on a social network.

""Power supply will be limited for households and industrial enterprises in all regions of Ukraine between 6 a.m. and 12:00 a.m. on May 27,"" the statement said.

""Regional electric companies may resort to hourly power outage schedules if the limits are exceeded,"" Ukrenergo said.

It noted that power supply to critical infrastructure would not be limited.

In turn, media said with the reference to DTEK that power consumption limits in Kiev would be enough to meet 81% of the demand.

According to Ukrenergo, 16,258MW/h of electricity are being imported from Romania, Slovakia, Poland, Hungary and Moldova on Monday, which is a third more than on Sunday.

The company said that the imports might reach the technical capacity of 1,700MW in particular hours. There are no electricity exports, and they are not planned, it said.

Ukraine accepted excessive electricity from Poland between 1 p.m. and 6 p.m. on Sunday, May 26, at the request of the Polish electricity system operator, Ukrenergo said.

As of Monday morning, 458 populated localities in Ukraine were having a power outage for various reasons, it said.",interfax.com,news,interfax.com,,-0.05098039215686279,454500701,10,,

The company, one of the pioneers in the field of climate technology investments in Central and Eastern Europe, participated in Balkan Energy Forum 2024, which gathered 500 participants from 30 countries.

Director of janom Energy and Battery Matej Å anta was a speaker on a panel on accelerating energy storage investments in the region.

Andrej SrÅ¡eÅ said it is a private equity group investing in renewable energy sources, battery storage, and innovative energy solutions.

Over the last two decades, the company has been operating in Central Europe, the Nordics and Finland.

""Therefore, we take BEF 2024 not only as an opportunity to invest into local projects, but also to share our knowledge and address the challenges the sector is facing,"" SrÅ¡eÅ stressed.

Conference participants get how important these topics are for their countries

By increasing the share of renewables in the energy mix and developing battery storage capacity, the Western Balkans are doing good things not only for the environment, but also for themselves because they are strengthening energy security, in his view.

At the same time, they are contributing to cheaper energy generation and the creation of modern and exciting jobs while attracting foreign direct investments as investors require clean and local electricity, SrÅ¡eÅ explained.

""We feel that the conference participants get how important these topics are for their countries. So we hope that we can do our part as an investor and mentor of local developers of the projects,"" he noted.

The future 30 MW photovoltaic facility in Croatia is the firm's first-ever investment in the country. It is eyeing other wind and PV projects in Croatia with an estimated overall capacity of over 200 MW, which will require investing an estimated EUR 300 million.

The company has long followed the renewables development potential in Croatia, SrÅ¡eÅ said when the project was announced.

Janom Investments was established in Slovakia in 2008. It operates several solar and hydropower plants in Slovakia and the Czech Republic. The company developed wind farms TyrinselkÃ¤ and SoidinmÃ¤ki in Finland, with a combined capacity of 70 MW, and later sold them to Aquila Capital.

It also invests in climate technologies. It is one of the founding investors in Greenway, the largest operator of charging networks for electric vehicles in Poland and Slovakia, with more than 2,500 charging points.

The company announced a significant profit growth aligned with its guidance and demonstrated excellent cash generation capabilities. In a strategic move, Tate & Lyle has sold its remaining stake in Primient for $350 million, marking the completion of its transformation into a specialty food and beverage solutions business. The company is set to initiate a share buyback program with the net proceeds from the sale.

In conclusion, Tate & Lyle has delivered a strong financial performance with a clear focus on growth and sustainability. The company's strategic initiatives and investments in technology and innovation are set to further solidify its position in the specialty food and beverage solutions market.

Nick Hampton: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I am pleased to present Tate & Lyle's results for the year ended 31st of March 2024. The agenda for today's presentation is on the screen. I will begin with an overview of the year, Dawn will run through the financial results, and then I will come back to talk about our strategic progress and the outlook. Finally, Dawn and I will be happy to take your questions. So starting with the key headlines. We successfully delivered a strong financial performance in a challenging external environment, with profit growth in line with our guidance and excellent cash generation. The sale of our remaining interest in premiums, which we also announced today, completes the transformation of Tate & Lyle into a fully focused specialty food and beverage solutions business. Following completion of this transaction, we intend to start a share buyback program to return the net cash proceeds from the sale to shareholders. We continue to make good progress delivering our strategy with solutions new business wins once again increasing in the year. We are also taking a leadership position on sustainability, a critical area for the future of the food industry. Turning to our financial performance. Group revenue was 2% lower, with EBITDA up 7%. Free cash flow was GBP 49 million higher with 85% cash conversion and we delivered $41 million of productivity savings, significantly ahead of targets. Earlier today, we announced we have signed an agreement to sell our remaining stake in Primient to KPS Capital Partners for $350 million. This values our 49.7% stake, well ahead of the valuation when we sold a controlling interest in this business in April 2022. It is anticipated that the completion of the sale will be before the end of July, and that net cash proceeds after tax will be around $270 million. The 20-year supply agreements between Primient and Tate & Lyle put in place in April 2022 will continue to operate. The sale completes our staged exit from Primient well ahead of expiry of the original lockup period of 8 years to April 2030. Total gross cash proceeds from the sale of Primient together with dividends received since April 2022 exceed $1.5 billion. The Board intends to return the net cash proceeds from the sale of Primient to shareholders by way of an on-market share buyback program. This is expected to commence on completion of the Primient sale. This decision is consistent with the Board's capital allocation policy, which Dawn will talk about later. Further details about the share buyback program will be announced in due course. Over the last 6 years, we've been on a journey to transform Tate & Lyle into a fully focused specialty Food & Beverage Solutions business. With the sale of Primient this transformation is complete. Over that period, we have fundamentally changed the way we focus on customers and categories, invested in our innovation and solution selling capabilities and significantly strengthened each of our sweetening, mouthfeel and fortification platforms through both new product launches and acquisitions. The transformation has positioned Tate & Lyle right at the center of the future of food, focused on creating solutions that meet growing consumer demand for healthier, tastier and more sustainable food and drink. We have a clear strategy and purpose and are very well placed to capture the considerable growth opportunities ahead. Moving to our strategic progress during the year. I am pleased to report we made good progress on our ambition to accelerate growth from innovation and solution selling. New products as a percentage of Food & Beverage Solutions revenue was 16%, and we met our target of growing our investment in innovation and solution selling by at least 5% in the year. Solutions revenue from new business wins increased to 21% and I will talk more about this later in my presentation. Finally, turning to our purpose targets where we continue to perform well. We made strong progress reducing greenhouse gas emissions, both within our own operations and across our supply chain. Our Scope 1 and 2 emissions have been reduced by 11% over the last 4 years, benefiting in particular from an increase in the use of renewable electricity. Our Scope 3 emissions are now 20% lower, exceeding our 2030 target of a 15% reduction 7 years ahead of schedule. This has been driven largely by the investments we made previously in 3 plants now owned by Primient to eliminate the use of coal and the success of our sustainable agriculture programs for corn and stevia. Our other purpose metrics are also progressing well. For example, over the last 4 years, our no and low calorie sweeteners and fibers have helped to remove 7.9 million tonnes of sugar from people's diets. That's 31 trillion calories or more than the recommended daily calorie intake for the entire global population. As a purpose-led business, we recognize the importance of combining growth with the responsibility. And that means playing our part in tackling climate change. This is critical for the future of the food industry as around 1/3 of the planet greenhouse gas emissions comes from food production and agriculture. In addition, agriculture currently uses 70% of the world's fresh water. For that reason, I am delighted that earlier this month, we announced a significant increase in our climate ambition with new Scope 1 and 2 and Scope 3 emissions targets to 2028. These targets have been validated as science-based by the science-based targets initiative and are aligned to a 1.5-degree centigrade trajectory in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement. In summary, this means we will now be delivering a larger reduction in emissions at a faster pace. We are already taking actions to make this happen, and I look forward to sharing our progress in future presentations. I will come back to talk about our strategic progress and the outlook later. But for now, I would hand over to Dawn to talk through the financial results. Dawn, over to you.

Dawn Allen: Thank you, Nick, and good morning, everyone. In line with previous presentations, I will focus on adjusted measures. Items with percentage growth are in constant currency unless I indicate otherwise. As Nick said, we have successfully navigated a challenging external environment and softer consumer demand with considerable agility to deliver another year of strong profit growth in line with our guidance and acceleration in our productivity program with savings well ahead of our target, excellent cash generation driven by significantly improved working capital discipline and continued investment for the long term across all 3 pillars of science, solutions and society. In terms of financial highlights, despite the fact that group revenue was 2% lower, we delivered EBITDA growth of 7% with EBITDA margin 170 basis points higher at 19.9%. Profit before tax was 18% higher, reflecting strong performance from food and beverage solutions and improved performance in our minority holding in Primient and lower finance charges. Earnings per share were 18% higher. Return on capital employed was 20 basis points lower at 17.4%, while on an organic basis, it was 40 basis points higher. Finally, free cash flow was up GBP 49 million at GBP 170 million. So overall, the business showed considerable agility and resilience to deliver a robust financial performance. Moving onto our 3 operating segments. Starting with Food & Beverage Solutions. This business is our growth engine and represents more than 80% of our revenue. Revenue was 2% lower, with 5 percentage points decrease from volume and price mix, partially offset by 3 percentage points increase from the recovery of net inflation across the year. The volume and price mix decrease of 5 percentage points was driven by 2 factors. Firstly, 6 percentage points volume reduction from the impact of consumer demand softness and customer destocking. Secondly, a 1 percentage point benefit from our continued focus on mix management and solution selling. Looking at the performance of our 3 regions. In North America, revenue was 3% lower, driven by cost of living pressures on consumers, resulting in softer demand across our core categories. In Asia, Middle East, Africa and Latin America, revenue was down 3%. In Asia, revenue was lower, reflecting pricing pressure and weaker demand, particularly in China. In Latin America, revenue declined driven by lower-priced imports from outside the region, especially in Mexico. And in the Middle East and Africa, revenue was ahead of the prior year with strong demand for dairy solutions in North Africa. In Europe, revenue was slightly ahead, driven by good demand across the dairy and infant nutrition categories. This was offset by the exit of some low-margin business in line with our strategy and increased competition from imports from outside the region. Our approach last year was to focus on margin ahead of volume, this drove EBITDA growth 8% higher, benefiting from positive customer and product mix and increased solution selling, productivity savings and strong cost discipline also contributed to higher profits with 180 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion. Food & Beverage Solutions has a proven growth track record with revenue growth of 12% and EBITDA growth of 10% over the last 3 years. Let's move to sucralose. This is a strongly cash-generative business and its role is to provide attractive returns. Revenue was broadly in line with the prior year as volume remained flat and customer mix led to modestly lower pricing. EBITDA at GBP 52 million was 4% lower, reflecting cost inflation across a range of imports. Industry demand for sucralose remains robust, driven by growing consumer demand for reduced share and calories in food and drink. We continue to see good demand from our larger customers. Primary Products Europe is the smallest segment, comprising 7% of our revenue. We continue to successfully optimize its financial performance as we transition capacity to higher-margin food and beverage solutions ingredients. Revenue was 12% lower, mainly reflecting reduced volume. Adjusted EBITDA losses reduced significantly from GBP 9 million to GBP 5 million, benefiting from lower input costs. So pulling this all together, Food & Beverage Solutions increased EBITDA by 8% or GBP 20 million. Sucralose saw a slight decline in EBITDA of GBP 3 million, which was more than offset by Primary Products Europe, where EBITDA losses were GBP 4 million lower. Overall, this led to an increase in absolute EBITDA in constant currency of GBP 21 million or 7%. This growth is impressive, given that we had to offset input cost inflation of around GBP 60 million in the year, and we continue to invest in long-term growth. Finally, the impact of foreign exchange was to decrease EBITDA by GBP 15 million to GBP 328 million. Turning to productivity. We delivered $41 million of productivity savings in the year, demonstrating the strong productivity culture we have embedded across the business. Savings came from the following areas: 70% was from operational and supply chain efficiencies, and 30% was from strong cost management and savings in SG&A. A strong contribution came from our manufacturing excellence program, which includes projects to drive production yield improvements at our plants. We also made good savings optimizing our logistics network. Our investment in digital also continues to be a key enabler of productivity savings and to enhance our end-to-end customer experience. For example, we are using process analytics to identify bottlenecks in our supplier invoice chain helping to eliminate manual touch points and improve our processing rates. We are also using digital to enhance a demand planning processes not only improving the customers' experience but also delivering working capital efficiencies. Given our strong progress, we are increasing our productivity savings target for the 5 years to the 31st of March 2028 by 50% from $100 million to $150 million. Let's move on to talk through tax and exceptional items. The adjusted effective tax rate was 21.6%, 170 basis points above the prior year. This was due to an increase in the headline U.K. corporation tax rate from 19% to 25% and more profit being taxed in higher rate jurisdictions. We anticipate the adjusted effective tax rate for the 2025 financial year will be in line with the 2024 rate. On exceptional items, net pretax exceptional charges were GBP 24 million, most of which related to restructuring costs for organizational improvements and productivity benefits. From a cash flow perspective, this translated into a total exceptional cash outflow of GBP 27 million. Moving on to Primient. Our share of profit was 53% higher at GBP 35 million as Primient benefited from strong customer contracting in both 2023 and 2024. Robust sweetener demand and improved operational performance. This was partially offset by higher finance charges. We received $74 million in cash dividends from Primient in the year. Moving now to free cash flow. Adjusted free cash flow was GBP 49 million higher at GBP 170 million. This drove cash conversion 23 percentage points higher to 85%, well above our long-term target of 75%. Increased Discipline in inventory management and improved demand planning led to GBP 112 million improvement in net working capital. We also continue to invest in long-term growth with capital expenditure, GBP 39 million higher, at GBP 110 million. For the 2025 financial year, we expect capital expenditure will be in the GBP 100 million to GBP 120 million range. Cash generation will continue to be a key priority and our focus in the future is to consistently exceed cash conversion of 75%. Moving on to net debt and dividends. Net debt was GBP 85 million lower at GBP 153 million. This was the result of 3 main factors: firstly, a step change in cash generation; secondly, the receipt of $74 million of dividends from Primient; and lastly, the payment of dividends to shareholders of GBP 76 million. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio is 0.5x and we continue to have strong liquidity headroom to invest for growth. During the year, we have repaid $120 million of debt from cash, of which $95 million was floating rate debt. Earlier this month, we renewed our committed undrawn and sustainability-linked revolving credit facility of $800 million, extending its maturity to 2029. The Board is recommending a final dividend of 12.9p per share. This brings the full year dividend to 19.1p per share, an increase of 3.2%. Our capital allocation framework remains unchanged. Our priority is to continue the disciplined deployment of capital and to maintain Tate & Lowe's (NYSE:LOW) financial strength. Under our capital allocation framework, we have a clear prioritization: firstly, investment in organic growth; secondly, investment in acquisitions joint ventures and partnerships; thirdly, our progressive dividend policy; and finally, to return capital to shareholders should it become surplus to the needs of the company. Consistent with the above, as Nick said earlier, we intend to return the net cash proceeds from the sale of our remaining stake in Primient to shareholders from completion. We have a strong balance sheet. And looking forward, we want to retain the flexibility to drive value-accretive growth, guided by our view that our long-term efficient leverage is in the range of 1x to 2.5x net debt to EBITDA. We remain focused on converting our profit into cash to support all uses of capital in line with our capital allocation policy. I want to leave you with 3 key messages. The first is that we delivered strong profit performance in line with our guidance while navigating a challenging external environment. Secondly, we've improved the quality of our financial performance. We have done this through the delivery of a specialty EBITDA margin of 21% in Food & Beverage Solutions. The acceleration of productivity savings with our 5-year target increasing to $150 million and a step change in cash generation ahead of our long-term target. And thirdly, we continue to apply our capital allocation framework to drive value accretive growth through investment for the long term as well as returning surplus cash to shareholders. With that, let me hand you back to Nick.

Nick Hampton: Thank you, Dawn. I'm now going to give you a brief update on our strategic progress and then cover the outlook. I'm going to focus on 3 areas: firstly, the completion of the transformation of the business following the sale of Primient; secondly, how we are accelerating our solutions-based business with customers; and thirdly, the investments we are making in technology, innovation and new capacity to support our customers and drive long-term growth. Over the last 6 years, Tate & Lyle has been through a major transformation. With the sale of Primient, this transformation is now complete. Driven by our purpose of transforming lives through the science of food, Tate & Lyle today is a growth-focused Speciality Food & Beverage Solutions business, a global leader in sweetening, mouthfeel and fortification with world-class scientific and solutions capabilities and strong customer relationships. It is a focused and agile business with an ambitious purpose and a clear strategy for growth. And the growth opportunities are considerable. The global specialty food ingredients market is $75 billion and expected to grow at around 6% on a compound annual basis. $19 billion of this market is addressable by Tate & Lyle's 3 platforms. Our core categories of beverages, dairy, soup sources and dressings and bakery and snacks represents 70% or $13 billion of this addressable market. The other 30% is in categories such as confectionery and infant nutrition, where we have regional expertise. But the real opportunity is even bigger. While the global specialty ingredient sweetness market is around $5 billion, sugar still makes up 80% of the global sweetening market. And there is an estimated further $3 billion of sugar replacement opportunity across our 4 core categories. Within our addressable markets, there are structural trends, which are driving consumer preference and changes in consumption. The rise of diseases like obesity and diabetes and concerns about digestive health and immunity are leading people to be increasingly concerned about their health and wellness. As a result, consumers are looking for products lower in sugar and calories and with added fiber. They are also moving to more plant-based food. Consumer desire for food and drink, which is healthy, tasty, convenient and more sustainable and affordable all play directly into Tate & Lyle's areas of expertise. Through our 3 platforms, we create ingredients and solutions, which reduce sugar and calories, enhanced texture and the mouthfeel experience, increase nutrition through fiber and protein and where necessary, optimize cost. The strategic focus and intent of Tate & Lyle is clear. Based on our market-leading positions and world-class scientific and solutions capabilities, we are a leading differentiated specialty Food & Beverage Solutions business, delivering sweetening, mouthfeel and fortification across our 4 core categories and beyond. The increasing strength and quality of the business is reflected in our financial performance. Despite what has been a period of considerable economic volatility over the last 3 years, the group has delivered a compound average growth rate for revenue of 11% and EBITDA of 10%, well ahead of our current 5-year financial ambition. Food & Beverage Solutions delivered revenue growth of 12% and EBITDA growth of 10% in the same period. This growth has been supported by a second area I want to focus on, the acceleration of our solutions-based business with customers. Innovation is a key growth engine for our solutions offering, and it's very encouraging to see is continuing to deliver a steady flow of new products into the market. During the year, we launched 9 new products, 5 from our sweetener platform, mainly stevia line extensions and 4 from our fortification platform, including a new high fiber product for use in low alcohol beverages. Overall, revenue from new products on a like-for-like basis, including those which fell out of the calculation this year, grew by 13%. And to demonstrate the traction our new products are getting with customers, 44% of the revenue from our new business pipeline involve formulating 1 or more of our new products. Increased customer adoption of new products is one of the reasons why solution-based revenue from new business wins grew this year, up 3 percentage points to 21%. This is 5 percentage points higher than the average between 2020 and 2022. And so the acceleration over the last 2 years is very encouraging. I was also pleased to see a strong solutions performance in our growth markets of Asia, Middle East and Africa and Latin America. Our chassis approach for solutions development, where we build a global template solution up to anywhere between 50% and 80% of a customer requirement and then adopt the -- and complete the rest of the solution to meet local market needs continues to work well and to increase customer collaboration. As a reminder, collaboration on solutions has a number of benefits. The value of ingredients used in solutions tends to be higher, about 2x higher on average. And they are also a stickier sale as the solution directly involves solving a customer's challenge. It also builds stronger customer relationships, often leading to new business. Let me give you one example of our solutions in action. In the U.K., our food scientists recently worked with Paris to create a healthier version of the iconic McVitie's digested biscuit. The brief was to reduce both the sugar and fat content in the biscuit retain its distinctive taste and to not change the production process. Sugar plays a crucial role in biscuits, creating both texture and taste as well as improving shelf life so that the biscuit retains their crunch. Through our deep understanding of the complex intersection between sweetening, mouthfeel and fortification, we were able to find a solution based on our fiber portfolio. That not only reduce both the sugar and fat content in the biscuit by 30%, but also added 50% more fiber. And its iconic mouthfeel and taste were also maintained. The combination of our increasing focus on innovation and solution selling is having a positive impact on customer perception of Tate & Lyle and our position as a preferred partner of choice. At the start of 2024, we undertook a major survey looking at the experience of customers working with Tate & Lyle. This survey which is conducted by an independent third party assessed the views of 286 customers across the world. The survey showed that over 90% of our customers believe we provide a better or as good a service as other ingredient suppliers they use. Reasons given include our high levels of technical support, the quality of our products and the strong levels of customer service and reliability. These results are very encouraging and show that the journey we have been on over the last 6 years to significantly sharpen our focus on the customer is now paying real dividends. While we can always do more as we move forward as a fully focused specialty business, the customer-focused culture we have embedded in Tate & Lyle will play a key part in delivering our growth strategy. To ensure we can continue to grow our solutions offering for customers, we are increasing our investment in technology, innovation and growth capacity. Let me take each one in turn. Firstly, we have installed a new robotic system in our lab in Singapore with enhanced characterization and predictive modeling capabilities. This system is transforming the way we develop mouthfeel solutions for customers and has led to a significant increase in the customer collaboration at the lab. Secondly, we opened a new customer innovation and collaboration center in Jakarta, Indonesia, which is already helping to build our business in a market with significant long-term growth potential. And thirdly, we continue to add new growth capacity to our network. Earlier this month, we formally opened our new Non-GMO PROMITOR soluble fibers line at our facility in Slovakia. This EUR 25 million investment will ensure we have the capacity to meet growing demand for dietary fiber. Bringing all this together with the transformation into a fully focused specialty business now complete, we are well positioned to capture the growth opportunities ahead, both organic and inorganic. Our strategy to increase our solution-based business with customers is working well. And our innovation pipeline continues to launch new products into the market that directly meet consumers' desire for healthier food and drink. We are adding new capacity to meet future demand and we continue to strengthen our capabilities in key areas such as sensory applications and open innovation. We also continue to actively pursue value-accretive acquisitions to expand and strengthen our portfolio and to seek partnerships which bring us new products and technology. Today, Tate & Lyle is a business with a clear strategy focused on growth, and that is what we intend to deliver. Turning to the outlook. In the last quarter of our 2024 financial year we saw average daily volumes accelerate, and we expect this improvement to continue into the 2025 financial year. This is based on 3 main factors: firstly, our approach to last year was to focus on revenue and margin ahead of volume and the contracts we have put in place for the 2024 calendar year position us well to grow from this new base; secondly, customer destocking has come to an end; and thirdly, consumer confidence is beginning to improve, albeit remaining somewhat fragile. In light of this, we expect good volume growth in the 2025 financial year accelerating as the year progresses. Moving on to revenue. Following a period of input cost inflation, we are now seeing input cost deflation. As a result, revenue was lower in the second half of the 2024 financial year, reflecting the pass-through of lower costs. And this is expected to continue in the first half of the 2025 financial year. Therefore, for the year ending the 31st of March 2025, we expect to deliver in constant currency revenues slightly lower than the prior year and EBITDA growth of between 4% and 7%. Following the completion of the sale of Primient, we will no longer consolidate its profits. In summary then, we have demonstrated considerable agility to successfully navigate a challenging external environment and soft consumer demand. Once again, we have delivered what we said we would do with profit in line with our guidance and excellent cash generation. The sale of Primient completes our transformation into a fully focused specialty Food & Beverage Solutions business and we intend to return the net cash proceeds from this sale to shareholders via an on-market share buyback program. Our solution strategy continues to work well and through our sustainable agriculture programs and our commitment to deliver larger, faster emission reductions on a 1.5-degree centigrade trajectory, we are taking a leadership position on sustainability. Tate & Lyle is positioned right at the center of the future of food, focused on creating solutions that meet growing consumer demand for healthier, tastier and more sustainable food and drink. We are operating in exciting segments of the market, which have strong growth potential. We are a business fueled by science obsessed with customer collaboration and with a strong desire to make a positive impact on the world. The future ahead is exciting. As always, I would like to finish by thanking everyone at Tate & Lyle for their hard work in delivering these results and for living our purpose with great passion and belief. For their support. I am very grateful. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's full year results presentation. We are now into the live Q&A. As I said in the prerecording, we delivered robust performance in the year with strong profit growth and cash generation and significant strategic progress, while successfully navigating a challenging external environment. Following the sale of the remaining stake in Primient, Tate & Lyle is now a fully focused specialty business creating solutions that meet growing consumer demand for healthier, tastier and more sustainable food and drink. At the completion of the transaction, we will return the net proceeds to shareholders through a share buyback program.

A - Nick Hampton: Turning now to your questions. The first question comes from Damian McNeela at Deutsche Numis.

Damian McNeela: Just two for me, please. Just on the EBITDA growth for this year. Can you just sort of talk about the considerations around volume expectations that is being incorporated into that? And then on the longer-term sort of EBITDA growth ambitions. Do you still think you can hit that sort of 7% to 9% over the 5-year time frame that you set last year? And then the second question is just on the volume performance. I think you've talked about an improving volume performance so far, well, in Q4 and then a bit into this year. Can you just give any more color on whether there are any sort of particular categories or channels which are seeing the growth and whether there any laggards that you would expect to recover as we go through the year, please?

Nick Hampton: Sure. Both very good questions, Damian. Let me take the first one and then maybe Dawn can add some more color on the volumes. So as we thought about guidance for this year, I'd say a few things. Firstly, we're clearly seeing positive signs of recovery in the market. And we saw that in the last quarter of the last financial year. And as we built our plan for this year, we were really looking to balance a few things. The first is signs of recovery, both with customers and with consumers. So with customers, we're seeing an entity stocking, we're seeing some more positive views of the future, and we're seeing increased engagement on innovation. That's all good. And a view that things are going to recover through this year as consumer confidence improves because of the improving economic environment in general around the world. So we're balancing off a view of seeing improved volume performance because of the fundamentals in the market. On top of that, a positive contracting round. Alongside that, we're trying to continue to make sure we invest in the future growth of the business. We've been very, very consistent through the last 3 or 4 years despite all the economic volatility, investing in innovation, investing in solution selling, investing in capacity, investing in in-market capability to serve customers. And you saw that again last year. So we will continue to invest. And the range of our guidance reflects the fact that we want to see how volume improves through the year. It was still early in the year. So that's the first part of your question. The second part is absolutely we believe we can hit our medium-term guidance. If you look at the last 3 years, we delivered double-digit revenue and EBITDA performance, which underpins that confidence. We're just coming into this year, we're trying to balance off an improving economic environment with continuing to invest for the future so that we can successfully continue to deliver what we've done in the last 3 years. So Dawn, I don't know whether you want to add something on the volume color?

Dawn Allen: Well, I think that maybe a couple of things just to build on the EBITDA. So we've delivered 10% EBITDA growth over the last 3 years. So if you add in the -- if you add in our outlook for this year, we'll still be towards the top of our long-term range. So I think that's a very strong performance. I think in terms of the volume, as Nick talked about, we are seeing small pockets of volume growth. Clearly, it's different across the different geographies and different categories around the world. So stronger performance starting to come through in beverages, particularly in places like nonalcoholic beverages as well as dairy. And I think particularly in China and in the U.S., consumer confidence is still -- we're still looking and waiting for that to improve. But as we talked about, we expect volume performance, and Nick talked about it. We expect that to continue to improve throughout the year and accelerate as we move through.

Nick Hampton: So our next question is from Alex Sloane at Barclays (LON:BARC).

Alex Sloane: The first one, just in terms of the price resets for 2024 reflecting, in part, lower input costs. I think the statement still refers to some competition in FBS in Latin America and Europe. Obviously, you talked about that earlier last year. Have you seen any easing on this front with the new reset prices? That would be the first question. And the second one, just going back to the question on volume. I think you had said in quarter 3, maybe there was a 3-point impact from destocking into the year-end, which you expect it to reverse in the first quarter. If I look at the first quarter -- sorry, in the fourth quarter, in the calendar first quarter, if I look at the volumes in quarter 4, it looks like maybe excluding that phasing benefit, they were still slightly negative. So I just wondered, is there any sort of worsening in the trends as you exited the quarter? And just be interested in terms of what you've already seen in April and May on this front, presumably, values are improving to give you the confidence in the full year outlook.

Nick Hampton: So maybe I'll take the first question -- the second question first, and I'll come back to the pricing point. So yes, we saw a sequential improvement in volume as we went into the fourth quarter. I'd say if you take into -- the sort of residual impact of destocking as we entered the last quarter of our financial year, we clearly saw an improvement in volume run rates. And as we come into the first part of this financial year, we're starting to see that continue as well. So we're definitely seeing some positive momentum that is both about exiting the destocking. It's also about exiting the period of when we were exiting low-margin business, and it reflects the positive signs we saw in the contract round along the market evolution that we talked about earlier. So we're definitely seeing improvement as we come into the first quarter of this year. So that's all very consistent actually with what we said in our Q3 statement. That's all that's all good. In terms of the pricing reset, it varies by geography, clearly. We're probably seeing net-net a slight easing rather than an acceleration of the trends that you mentioned. But they're clearly still there in pockets of the business, and we need to make sure we balance the price, price revenue margin to reflect the relative competitive dynamics across the world. So hopefully, that gives you a broad sense, Alex, if what we're seeing on your 2 questions. And our next question comes from Karel Zoete of Kepler Cheuvreux.

Karel Zoete: I've got two questions. The first one is on mix, mix improvements in the second half of the year. It seems that has slowed quite a bit. Part of it anticipated. But if you can speak a bit about the mix trends during the second half of the year. And the other thing is looking at the cost situation, a very good savings momentum. In general, I think the outlook for cost of goods sold, but also other cost lines is more favorable than 12 months ago. So if you can touch upon that. And obviously, that also comes back to the EBITDA guidance as -- yes. It seems there is good savings momentum in the business. Volumes will recover. So yes, much appreciated.

Nick Hampton: So why don't I take the second question and then Dawn can maybe pick up on the mix point. So as you rightly say, Karel, I mean, 2 headlines, I would say, on cost. Incredibly pleased with the discipline the team is bringing to productivity. So $40 million plus productivity last year and that reflects a systemic program, but also some of the investments we're making in systems to allow us to get more efficient at predicting and planning the business and managing our end supply chain and serving our customers better. And that's reflected in the fact that we've called up our productivity guidance for the 5-year period, so from $100 million to $150 million. So the team doing a really good job there. Of course, we're also seeing the impact of inflation easing on input costs as well. And that delivers that delivers some significant benefits this year, which as we've done -- as we did with inflationary pressures, we're passing through to customers in a responsible way. They were accepting of price increases when we were under inflationary pressures because of the value we bring to their products. And we were committed to being fair with them as inflation abated. So that's reflected in the pricing dynamics in the business as we've given guidance on revenue for this year. Now when you add all of that up, though and you think about the shape of our EBITDA guidance, it really reflects the balance between being really disciplined on cost and productivity, but also continuing to invest in the long-term future of the business in innovation, in solution selling and customer intimacy. And as we add all of that up and look at the volume trajectory, that's where we end up with EBITDA guidance that sort of touches the end of our long-term range. So Dawn, do you want to pick up mix?

Dawn Allen: Yes. So Karel, if you remember, in the first half of last year, we did have very strong price mix. Obviously, at the half year, we had 13 points of price mix, roughly driven half inflation and half price mix. As we moved into quarter 3, we saw a similar trend, but it came off slightly. And then as we moved into quarter 4 and we set the new contracting round. And as we've talked about, we've set up that contracting round to drive volume growth. We also moved into a deflationary environment. So high single-digit deflation in quarter 4. We also selectively chose to invest with specific customers to drive long-term growth, but that is a small impact in the quarter. And as we look forward, we would expect to see high single-digit deflation particularly in the first half of the year. And as the volume momentum improves, we expect that to start to offset and more than offset as we move through the year, the selective investment that we've chosen to do with some customers.

Nick Hampton: Okay. So our next question is from Chris Pitcher at Redburn.

Chris Pitcher: A couple of questions for me on the sort of the momentum in innovations and solutions selling. You increased spend by a double-digit rate in the first half. It was up 5% for the full year. So it's kind of flat in the second half. Is that because you've got to sort of level that you think is sustainable? And could you give a bit more color on what your R&D spend is doing? And then I appreciate it's modest changes, but the percentage of new business wins went down a bit at the full year versus the first half. I'm just wondering what's going on in the background. And last one, are you able to give us an absolute share of your business between what draft at the CMD between specification, technical sports and solutions? What is solutions actually the underlying business? I understand that the goal to get the new wins up to over 30%. But just I -- just clarify where we are on the base?

Nick Hampton: So let me try and take those 3 questions in turn. So I would think about the investment level in innovation, solution selling R&D, the 5% in the year. I would just think of it as a phasing impact half 1, half 2. It doesn't really reflect any slowdown. And it certainly doesn't reflect that we think we've reached the limit of where we want to be. So we're going to continue to commit to delivering at least 5% increase in spend on innovation and solution selling and customer intimacy through the next few years. So it's not a sign of any slowdown. It's just a phasing impact to half 1, half 2. In terms of kind of solution selling, as percentage of wins. Again, we're up 3 points in the year at 21%. That's the real message. And of course, it's going to vary a little bit quarter-on-quarter. And importantly, in that 21% nearly half of that came from new products. So our new products are really starting to have an impact on the business. We said before that in broad terms, if you think about what -- how much of that business is actually in solution selling today, it's around about 20% in round terms. It's growing. And that's good news because that means there's plenty to go after in terms of improving that proportion as part of the business. And as we said before, that business is really valuable because it tends to be bigger pieces of business. It tends to be stickier because we're formulating into the critical part of the product. And it builds relationships, which leads to more business. So lots more to go after. We're going to continue to invest with intent to make sure we're managing the shape of the business for the future.

Chris Pitcher: I've got a follow-up but someone else is on the line looking to question. So I mean can I quickly ask, I mean CapEx is lower than the trend you said previously for this year. Is this a phasing effect? Or do you think you can drive growth at lower investments?

Nick Hampton: Dawn, do you want to take that?

Dawn Allen: Yes. So I would say -- I mean, CapEx at GBP 110 million is GBP 39 million up versus the previous year. So I'd say that we are continuing to invest in CapEx. And a good example of that is our new fibers line in BolerÃ¡z, that's just recently come on stream. I think if you think about -- in terms of capital markets, you're right, we did talk about an increasing CapEx spend going up to the region of GBP 130 million to GBP 150 million. If you think about what's happened over the last 12 months with low consumer confidence and destocking, there hasn't been as much of a need to invest in growth CapEx given that more than half of our CapEx is spent on growth investments. But when you look to next year, I mean, our forecast for CapEx for next year is in the range of GBP 100 million to GBP 120 million. So we are actually increasing to get to that long-term range that we talked about. But it's still a key growth driver and a key investment driver for us.

Nick Hampton: And Chris, I'd probably just add one point to that, which is -- we've been very focused in the last really 5 or 6 years to try and increase the quality of the business. And part of the benefits of that is you get more out of your existing assets, and you could be more efficient with your capital spend. That's reflected in where our return on capital is, it's just reflected in the progress in our EBITDA margins. And it's reflected in the strength of the balance sheet. So we've got plenty of firepower to invest, but we want to continue to invest to drive maximum returns. So should we move on? And our next question comes from Joan Lim from BNP Exane. Joan?

Joan Lim: Perfect. Two questions from me, please. So your leverage is still strong even after the share buyback. Why did you not do a bigger share buyback?

Joan Lim: Okay. And then your FY '25 guidance, it looks conservative to that 4% to 7%, given that you think volumes are going to improve and then prices pass through is there anything, I don't know, maybe for Q1 trends you've seen so far or is there scope for an upgrade to your guidance very -- maybe too early. But so if you could just help us understand a bit more into the drivers of this guidance?

Nick Hampton: So let me take the first question and then come back -- we'll come back to the second one. So look, on the buyback. We've announced we're going to return all the net proceeds from the sale of our final stake in Primient to shareholders. Do you think that's a responsible thing to do with the excess cash that we're bringing in as a result of that transaction. As we've demonstrated in the past, we will hand back cash to shareholders as appropriate. But our capital allocation policy is very clear. We want to maintain the scope to invest both inorganically and organically. And we want to make sure that we're paying an appropriate dividend to our shareholders. And on top of that, we'll continue to reevaluate returning capital. We're not saying that that's necessarily the last thing we're going to do, but it feels like a very sensible position to take as we speak today. On your point on conservatism on guidance, look, I think we've been very clear we're starting to see improvements in volume momentum. We're starting to see economic recovery around the world and a sense of consumer confidence increasing but still fragile. And we want to continue to invest in the business. So that's why the 4% to 7% guidance feels appropriate today. We'll be in a much better position to give you a view on where we are on that when we get to a half year, and we'll see how economies develop and the business develops over the next 6 months. So for now, we think it's the right way to calibrate a business that, by the way, has delivered double-digit EBITDA growth over the last 3 years pretty consistently. And whether that's conservative or not, we'll have a better view on at the half year, frankly. So I think we've come to end of our questions. So thank you to everyone for watching and for all of your questions. In summary, we delivered good performance in the year with strong profit growth in line with our guidance and excellent cash generation. The sale of our remaining stake in Primient completes the transformation of Tate & Lyle into a specialty solutions provider to the food and beverage industry. We will continue to progress our growth focus strategy and remain well placed to benefit from the long-term trends towards healthier, tastier and more sustainable food and drink.

The company announced a significant profit growth aligned with its guidance and demonstrated excellent cash generation capabilities. In a strategic move, Tate & Lyle has sold its remaining stake in Primient for $350 million, marking the completion of its transformation into a specialty food and beverage solutions business. The company is set to initiate a share buyback program with the net proceeds from the sale.

In conclusion, Tate & Lyle has delivered a strong financial performance with a clear focus on growth and sustainability. The company's strategic initiatives and investments in technology and innovation are set to further solidify its position in the specialty food and beverage solutions market.

Nick Hampton: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I am pleased to present Tate & Lyle's results for the year ended 31st of March 2024. The agenda for today's presentation is on the screen. I will begin with an overview of the year, Dawn will run through the financial results, and then I will come back to talk about our strategic progress and the outlook. Finally, Dawn and I will be happy to take your questions. So starting with the key headlines. We successfully delivered a strong financial performance in a challenging external environment, with profit growth in line with our guidance and excellent cash generation. The sale of our remaining interest in premiums, which we also announced today, completes the transformation of Tate & Lyle into a fully focused specialty food and beverage solutions business. Following completion of this transaction, we intend to start a share buyback program to return the net cash proceeds from the sale to shareholders. We continue to make good progress delivering our strategy with solutions new business wins once again increasing in the year. We are also taking a leadership position on sustainability, a critical area for the future of the food industry. Turning to our financial performance. Group revenue was 2% lower, with EBITDA up 7%. Free cash flow was GBP 49 million higher with 85% cash conversion and we delivered $41 million of productivity savings, significantly ahead of targets. Earlier today, we announced we have signed an agreement to sell our remaining stake in Primient to KPS Capital Partners for $350 million. This values our 49.7% stake, well ahead of the valuation when we sold a controlling interest in this business in April 2022. It is anticipated that the completion of the sale will be before the end of July, and that net cash proceeds after tax will be around $270 million. The 20-year supply agreements between Primient and Tate & Lyle put in place in April 2022 will continue to operate. The sale completes our staged exit from Primient well ahead of expiry of the original lockup period of 8 years to April 2030. Total gross cash proceeds from the sale of Primient together with dividends received since April 2022 exceed $1.5 billion. The Board intends to return the net cash proceeds from the sale of Primient to shareholders by way of an on-market share buyback program. This is expected to commence on completion of the Primient sale. This decision is consistent with the Board's capital allocation policy, which Dawn will talk about later. Further details about the share buyback program will be announced in due course. Over the last 6 years, we've been on a journey to transform Tate & Lyle into a fully focused specialty Food & Beverage Solutions business. With the sale of Primient this transformation is complete. Over that period, we have fundamentally changed the way we focus on customers and categories, invested in our innovation and solution selling capabilities and significantly strengthened each of our sweetening, mouthfeel and fortification platforms through both new product launches and acquisitions. The transformation has positioned Tate & Lyle right at the center of the future of food, focused on creating solutions that meet growing consumer demand for healthier, tastier and more sustainable food and drink. We have a clear strategy and purpose and are very well placed to capture the considerable growth opportunities ahead. Moving to our strategic progress during the year. I am pleased to report we made good progress on our ambition to accelerate growth from innovation and solution selling. New products as a percentage of Food & Beverage Solutions revenue was 16%, and we met our target of growing our investment in innovation and solution selling by at least 5% in the year. Solutions revenue from new business wins increased to 21% and I will talk more about this later in my presentation. Finally, turning to our purpose targets where we continue to perform well. We made strong progress reducing greenhouse gas emissions, both within our own operations and across our supply chain. Our Scope 1 and 2 emissions have been reduced by 11% over the last 4 years, benefiting in particular from an increase in the use of renewable electricity. Our Scope 3 emissions are now 20% lower, exceeding our 2030 target of a 15% reduction 7 years ahead of schedule. This has been driven largely by the investments we made previously in 3 plants now owned by Primient to eliminate the use of coal and the success of our sustainable agriculture programs for corn and stevia. Our other purpose metrics are also progressing well. For example, over the last 4 years, our no and low calorie sweeteners and fibers have helped to remove 7.9 million tonnes of sugar from people's diets. That's 31 trillion calories or more than the recommended daily calorie intake for the entire global population. As a purpose-led business, we recognize the importance of combining growth with the responsibility. And that means playing our part in tackling climate change. This is critical for the future of the food industry as around 1/3 of the planet greenhouse gas emissions comes from food production and agriculture. In addition, agriculture currently uses 70% of the world's fresh water. For that reason, I am delighted that earlier this month, we announced a significant increase in our climate ambition with new Scope 1 and 2 and Scope 3 emissions targets to 2028. These targets have been validated as science-based by the science-based targets initiative and are aligned to a 1.5-degree centigrade trajectory in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement. In summary, this means we will now be delivering a larger reduction in emissions at a faster pace. We are already taking actions to make this happen, and I look forward to sharing our progress in future presentations. I will come back to talk about our strategic progress and the outlook later. But for now, I would hand over to Dawn to talk through the financial results. Dawn, over to you.

Dawn Allen: Thank you, Nick, and good morning, everyone. In line with previous presentations, I will focus on adjusted measures. Items with percentage growth are in constant currency unless I indicate otherwise. As Nick said, we have successfully navigated a challenging external environment and softer consumer demand with considerable agility to deliver another year of strong profit growth in line with our guidance and acceleration in our productivity program with savings well ahead of our target, excellent cash generation driven by significantly improved working capital discipline and continued investment for the long term across all 3 pillars of science, solutions and society. In terms of financial highlights, despite the fact that group revenue was 2% lower, we delivered EBITDA growth of 7% with EBITDA margin 170 basis points higher at 19.9%. Profit before tax was 18% higher, reflecting strong performance from food and beverage solutions and improved performance in our minority holding in Primient and lower finance charges. Earnings per share were 18% higher. Return on capital employed was 20 basis points lower at 17.4%, while on an organic basis, it was 40 basis points higher. Finally, free cash flow was up GBP 49 million at GBP 170 million. So overall, the business showed considerable agility and resilience to deliver a robust financial performance. Moving onto our 3 operating segments. Starting with Food & Beverage Solutions. This business is our growth engine and represents more than 80% of our revenue. Revenue was 2% lower, with 5 percentage points decrease from volume and price mix, partially offset by 3 percentage points increase from the recovery of net inflation across the year. The volume and price mix decrease of 5 percentage points was driven by 2 factors. Firstly, 6 percentage points volume reduction from the impact of consumer demand softness and customer destocking. Secondly, a 1 percentage point benefit from our continued focus on mix management and solution selling. Looking at the performance of our 3 regions. In North America, revenue was 3% lower, driven by cost of living pressures on consumers, resulting in softer demand across our core categories. In Asia, Middle East, Africa and Latin America, revenue was down 3%. In Asia, revenue was lower, reflecting pricing pressure and weaker demand, particularly in China. In Latin America, revenue declined driven by lower-priced imports from outside the region, especially in Mexico. And in the Middle East and Africa, revenue was ahead of the prior year with strong demand for dairy solutions in North Africa. In Europe, revenue was slightly ahead, driven by good demand across the dairy and infant nutrition categories. This was offset by the exit of some low-margin business in line with our strategy and increased competition from imports from outside the region. Our approach last year was to focus on margin ahead of volume, this drove EBITDA growth 8% higher, benefiting from positive customer and product mix and increased solution selling, productivity savings and strong cost discipline also contributed to higher profits with 180 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion. Food & Beverage Solutions has a proven growth track record with revenue growth of 12% and EBITDA growth of 10% over the last 3 years. Let's move to sucralose. This is a strongly cash-generative business and its role is to provide attractive returns. Revenue was broadly in line with the prior year as volume remained flat and customer mix led to modestly lower pricing. EBITDA at GBP 52 million was 4% lower, reflecting cost inflation across a range of imports. Industry demand for sucralose remains robust, driven by growing consumer demand for reduced share and calories in food and drink. We continue to see good demand from our larger customers. Primary Products Europe is the smallest segment, comprising 7% of our revenue. We continue to successfully optimize its financial performance as we transition capacity to higher-margin food and beverage solutions ingredients. Revenue was 12% lower, mainly reflecting reduced volume. Adjusted EBITDA losses reduced significantly from GBP 9 million to GBP 5 million, benefiting from lower input costs. So pulling this all together, Food & Beverage Solutions increased EBITDA by 8% or GBP 20 million. Sucralose saw a slight decline in EBITDA of GBP 3 million, which was more than offset by Primary Products Europe, where EBITDA losses were GBP 4 million lower. Overall, this led to an increase in absolute EBITDA in constant currency of GBP 21 million or 7%. This growth is impressive, given that we had to offset input cost inflation of around GBP 60 million in the year, and we continue to invest in long-term growth. Finally, the impact of foreign exchange was to decrease EBITDA by GBP 15 million to GBP 328 million. Turning to productivity. We delivered $41 million of productivity savings in the year, demonstrating the strong productivity culture we have embedded across the business. Savings came from the following areas: 70% was from operational and supply chain efficiencies, and 30% was from strong cost management and savings in SG&A. A strong contribution came from our manufacturing excellence program, which includes projects to drive production yield improvements at our plants. We also made good savings optimizing our logistics network. Our investment in digital also continues to be a key enabler of productivity savings and to enhance our end-to-end customer experience. For example, we are using process analytics to identify bottlenecks in our supplier invoice chain helping to eliminate manual touch points and improve our processing rates. We are also using digital to enhance a demand planning processes not only improving the customers' experience but also delivering working capital efficiencies. Given our strong progress, we are increasing our productivity savings target for the 5 years to the 31st of March 2028 by 50% from $100 million to $150 million. Let's move on to talk through tax and exceptional items. The adjusted effective tax rate was 21.6%, 170 basis points above the prior year. This was due to an increase in the headline U.K. corporation tax rate from 19% to 25% and more profit being taxed in higher rate jurisdictions. We anticipate the adjusted effective tax rate for the 2025 financial year will be in line with the 2024 rate. On exceptional items, net pretax exceptional charges were GBP 24 million, most of which related to restructuring costs for organizational improvements and productivity benefits. From a cash flow perspective, this translated into a total exceptional cash outflow of GBP 27 million. Moving on to Primient. Our share of profit was 53% higher at GBP 35 million as Primient benefited from strong customer contracting in both 2023 and 2024. Robust sweetener demand and improved operational performance. This was partially offset by higher finance charges. We received $74 million in cash dividends from Primient in the year. Moving now to free cash flow. Adjusted free cash flow was GBP 49 million higher at GBP 170 million. This drove cash conversion 23 percentage points higher to 85%, well above our long-term target of 75%. Increased Discipline in inventory management and improved demand planning led to GBP 112 million improvement in net working capital. We also continue to invest in long-term growth with capital expenditure, GBP 39 million higher, at GBP 110 million. For the 2025 financial year, we expect capital expenditure will be in the GBP 100 million to GBP 120 million range. Cash generation will continue to be a key priority and our focus in the future is to consistently exceed cash conversion of 75%. Moving on to net debt and dividends. Net debt was GBP 85 million lower at GBP 153 million. This was the result of 3 main factors: firstly, a step change in cash generation; secondly, the receipt of $74 million of dividends from Primient; and lastly, the payment of dividends to shareholders of GBP 76 million. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio is 0.5x and we continue to have strong liquidity headroom to invest for growth. During the year, we have repaid $120 million of debt from cash, of which $95 million was floating rate debt. Earlier this month, we renewed our committed undrawn and sustainability-linked revolving credit facility of $800 million, extending its maturity to 2029. The Board is recommending a final dividend of 12.9p per share. This brings the full year dividend to 19.1p per share, an increase of 3.2%. Our capital allocation framework remains unchanged. Our priority is to continue the disciplined deployment of capital and to maintain Tate & Lowe's (NYSE:LOW) financial strength. Under our capital allocation framework, we have a clear prioritization: firstly, investment in organic growth; secondly, investment in acquisitions joint ventures and partnerships; thirdly, our progressive dividend policy; and finally, to return capital to shareholders should it become surplus to the needs of the company. Consistent with the above, as Nick said earlier, we intend to return the net cash proceeds from the sale of our remaining stake in Primient to shareholders from completion. We have a strong balance sheet. And looking forward, we want to retain the flexibility to drive value-accretive growth, guided by our view that our long-term efficient leverage is in the range of 1x to 2.5x net debt to EBITDA. We remain focused on converting our profit into cash to support all uses of capital in line with our capital allocation policy. I want to leave you with 3 key messages. The first is that we delivered strong profit performance in line with our guidance while navigating a challenging external environment. Secondly, we've improved the quality of our financial performance. We have done this through the delivery of a specialty EBITDA margin of 21% in Food & Beverage Solutions. The acceleration of productivity savings with our 5-year target increasing to $150 million and a step change in cash generation ahead of our long-term target. And thirdly, we continue to apply our capital allocation framework to drive value accretive growth through investment for the long term as well as returning surplus cash to shareholders. With that, let me hand you back to Nick.

Nick Hampton: Thank you, Dawn. I'm now going to give you a brief update on our strategic progress and then cover the outlook. I'm going to focus on 3 areas: firstly, the completion of the transformation of the business following the sale of Primient; secondly, how we are accelerating our solutions-based business with customers; and thirdly, the investments we are making in technology, innovation and new capacity to support our customers and drive long-term growth. Over the last 6 years, Tate & Lyle has been through a major transformation. With the sale of Primient, this transformation is now complete. Driven by our purpose of transforming lives through the science of food, Tate & Lyle today is a growth-focused Speciality Food & Beverage Solutions business, a global leader in sweetening, mouthfeel and fortification with world-class scientific and solutions capabilities and strong customer relationships. It is a focused and agile business with an ambitious purpose and a clear strategy for growth. And the growth opportunities are considerable. The global specialty food ingredients market is $75 billion and expected to grow at around 6% on a compound annual basis. $19 billion of this market is addressable by Tate & Lyle's 3 platforms. Our core categories of beverages, dairy, soup sources and dressings and bakery and snacks represents 70% or $13 billion of this addressable market. The other 30% is in categories such as confectionery and infant nutrition, where we have regional expertise. But the real opportunity is even bigger. While the global specialty ingredient sweetness market is around $5 billion, sugar still makes up 80% of the global sweetening market. And there is an estimated further $3 billion of sugar replacement opportunity across our 4 core categories. Within our addressable markets, there are structural trends, which are driving consumer preference and changes in consumption. The rise of diseases like obesity and diabetes and concerns about digestive health and immunity are leading people to be increasingly concerned about their health and wellness. As a result, consumers are looking for products lower in sugar and calories and with added fiber. They are also moving to more plant-based food. Consumer desire for food and drink, which is healthy, tasty, convenient and more sustainable and affordable all play directly into Tate & Lyle's areas of expertise. Through our 3 platforms, we create ingredients and solutions, which reduce sugar and calories, enhanced texture and the mouthfeel experience, increase nutrition through fiber and protein and where necessary, optimize cost. The strategic focus and intent of Tate & Lyle is clear. Based on our market-leading positions and world-class scientific and solutions capabilities, we are a leading differentiated specialty Food & Beverage Solutions business, delivering sweetening, mouthfeel and fortification across our 4 core categories and beyond. The increasing strength and quality of the business is reflected in our financial performance. Despite what has been a period of considerable economic volatility over the last 3 years, the group has delivered a compound average growth rate for revenue of 11% and EBITDA of 10%, well ahead of our current 5-year financial ambition. Food & Beverage Solutions delivered revenue growth of 12% and EBITDA growth of 10% in the same period. This growth has been supported by a second area I want to focus on, the acceleration of our solutions-based business with customers. Innovation is a key growth engine for our solutions offering, and it's very encouraging to see is continuing to deliver a steady flow of new products into the market. During the year, we launched 9 new products, 5 from our sweetener platform, mainly stevia line extensions and 4 from our fortification platform, including a new high fiber product for use in low alcohol beverages. Overall, revenue from new products on a like-for-like basis, including those which fell out of the calculation this year, grew by 13%. And to demonstrate the traction our new products are getting with customers, 44% of the revenue from our new business pipeline involve formulating 1 or more of our new products. Increased customer adoption of new products is one of the reasons why solution-based revenue from new business wins grew this year, up 3 percentage points to 21%. This is 5 percentage points higher than the average between 2020 and 2022. And so the acceleration over the last 2 years is very encouraging. I was also pleased to see a strong solutions performance in our growth markets of Asia, Middle East and Africa and Latin America. Our chassis approach for solutions development, where we build a global template solution up to anywhere between 50% and 80% of a customer requirement and then adopt the -- and complete the rest of the solution to meet local market needs continues to work well and to increase customer collaboration. As a reminder, collaboration on solutions has a number of benefits. The value of ingredients used in solutions tends to be higher, about 2x higher on average. And they are also a stickier sale as the solution directly involves solving a customer's challenge. It also builds stronger customer relationships, often leading to new business. Let me give you one example of our solutions in action. In the U.K., our food scientists recently worked with Paris to create a healthier version of the iconic McVitie's digested biscuit. The brief was to reduce both the sugar and fat content in the biscuit retain its distinctive taste and to not change the production process. Sugar plays a crucial role in biscuits, creating both texture and taste as well as improving shelf life so that the biscuit retains their crunch. Through our deep understanding of the complex intersection between sweetening, mouthfeel and fortification, we were able to find a solution based on our fiber portfolio. That not only reduce both the sugar and fat content in the biscuit by 30%, but also added 50% more fiber. And its iconic mouthfeel and taste were also maintained. The combination of our increasing focus on innovation and solution selling is having a positive impact on customer perception of Tate & Lyle and our position as a preferred partner of choice. At the start of 2024, we undertook a major survey looking at the experience of customers working with Tate & Lyle. This survey which is conducted by an independent third party assessed the views of 286 customers across the world. The survey showed that over 90% of our customers believe we provide a better or as good a service as other ingredient suppliers they use. Reasons given include our high levels of technical support, the quality of our products and the strong levels of customer service and reliability. These results are very encouraging and show that the journey we have been on over the last 6 years to significantly sharpen our focus on the customer is now paying real dividends. While we can always do more as we move forward as a fully focused specialty business, the customer-focused culture we have embedded in Tate & Lyle will play a key part in delivering our growth strategy. To ensure we can continue to grow our solutions offering for customers, we are increasing our investment in technology, innovation and growth capacity. Let me take each one in turn. Firstly, we have installed a new robotic system in our lab in Singapore with enhanced characterization and predictive modeling capabilities. This system is transforming the way we develop mouthfeel solutions for customers and has led to a significant increase in the customer collaboration at the lab. Secondly, we opened a new customer innovation and collaboration center in Jakarta, Indonesia, which is already helping to build our business in a market with significant long-term growth potential. And thirdly, we continue to add new growth capacity to our network. Earlier this month, we formally opened our new Non-GMO PROMITOR soluble fibers line at our facility in Slovakia. This EUR 25 million investment will ensure we have the capacity to meet growing demand for dietary fiber. Bringing all this together with the transformation into a fully focused specialty business now complete, we are well positioned to capture the growth opportunities ahead, both organic and inorganic. Our strategy to increase our solution-based business with customers is working well. And our innovation pipeline continues to launch new products into the market that directly meet consumers' desire for healthier food and drink. We are adding new capacity to meet future demand and we continue to strengthen our capabilities in key areas such as sensory applications and open innovation. We also continue to actively pursue value-accretive acquisitions to expand and strengthen our portfolio and to seek partnerships which bring us new products and technology. Today, Tate & Lyle is a business with a clear strategy focused on growth, and that is what we intend to deliver. Turning to the outlook. In the last quarter of our 2024 financial year we saw average daily volumes accelerate, and we expect this improvement to continue into the 2025 financial year. This is based on 3 main factors: firstly, our approach to last year was to focus on revenue and margin ahead of volume and the contracts we have put in place for the 2024 calendar year position us well to grow from this new base; secondly, customer destocking has come to an end; and thirdly, consumer confidence is beginning to improve, albeit remaining somewhat fragile. In light of this, we expect good volume growth in the 2025 financial year accelerating as the year progresses. Moving on to revenue. Following a period of input cost inflation, we are now seeing input cost deflation. As a result, revenue was lower in the second half of the 2024 financial year, reflecting the pass-through of lower costs. And this is expected to continue in the first half of the 2025 financial year. Therefore, for the year ending the 31st of March 2025, we expect to deliver in constant currency revenues slightly lower than the prior year and EBITDA growth of between 4% and 7%. Following the completion of the sale of Primient, we will no longer consolidate its profits. In summary then, we have demonstrated considerable agility to successfully navigate a challenging external environment and soft consumer demand. Once again, we have delivered what we said we would do with profit in line with our guidance and excellent cash generation. The sale of Primient completes our transformation into a fully focused specialty Food & Beverage Solutions business and we intend to return the net cash proceeds from this sale to shareholders via an on-market share buyback program. Our solution strategy continues to work well and through our sustainable agriculture programs and our commitment to deliver larger, faster emission reductions on a 1.5-degree centigrade trajectory, we are taking a leadership position on sustainability. Tate & Lyle is positioned right at the center of the future of food, focused on creating solutions that meet growing consumer demand for healthier, tastier and more sustainable food and drink. We are operating in exciting segments of the market, which have strong growth potential. We are a business fueled by science obsessed with customer collaboration and with a strong desire to make a positive impact on the world. The future ahead is exciting. As always, I would like to finish by thanking everyone at Tate & Lyle for their hard work in delivering these results and for living our purpose with great passion and belief. For their support. I am very grateful. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's full year results presentation. We are now into the live Q&A. As I said in the prerecording, we delivered robust performance in the year with strong profit growth and cash generation and significant strategic progress, while successfully navigating a challenging external environment. Following the sale of the remaining stake in Primient, Tate & Lyle is now a fully focused specialty business creating solutions that meet growing consumer demand for healthier, tastier and more sustainable food and drink. At the completion of the transaction, we will return the net proceeds to shareholders through a share buyback program.

A - Nick Hampton: Turning now to your questions. The first question comes from Damian McNeela at Deutsche Numis.

Damian McNeela: Just two for me, please. Just on the EBITDA growth for this year. Can you just sort of talk about the considerations around volume expectations that is being incorporated into that? And then on the longer-term sort of EBITDA growth ambitions. Do you still think you can hit that sort of 7% to 9% over the 5-year time frame that you set last year? And then the second question is just on the volume performance. I think you've talked about an improving volume performance so far, well, in Q4 and then a bit into this year. Can you just give any more color on whether there are any sort of particular categories or channels which are seeing the growth and whether there any laggards that you would expect to recover as we go through the year, please?

Nick Hampton: Sure. Both very good questions, Damian. Let me take the first one and then maybe Dawn can add some more color on the volumes. So as we thought about guidance for this year, I'd say a few things. Firstly, we're clearly seeing positive signs of recovery in the market. And we saw that in the last quarter of the last financial year. And as we built our plan for this year, we were really looking to balance a few things. The first is signs of recovery, both with customers and with consumers. So with customers, we're seeing an entity stocking, we're seeing some more positive views of the future, and we're seeing increased engagement on innovation. That's all good. And a view that things are going to recover through this year as consumer confidence improves because of the improving economic environment in general around the world. So we're balancing off a view of seeing improved volume performance because of the fundamentals in the market. On top of that, a positive contracting round. Alongside that, we're trying to continue to make sure we invest in the future growth of the business. We've been very, very consistent through the last 3 or 4 years despite all the economic volatility, investing in innovation, investing in solution selling, investing in capacity, investing in in-market capability to serve customers. And you saw that again last year. So we will continue to invest. And the range of our guidance reflects the fact that we want to see how volume improves through the year. It was still early in the year. So that's the first part of your question. The second part is absolutely we believe we can hit our medium-term guidance. If you look at the last 3 years, we delivered double-digit revenue and EBITDA performance, which underpins that confidence. We're just coming into this year, we're trying to balance off an improving economic environment with continuing to invest for the future so that we can successfully continue to deliver what we've done in the last 3 years. So Dawn, I don't know whether you want to add something on the volume color?

Dawn Allen: Well, I think that maybe a couple of things just to build on the EBITDA. So we've delivered 10% EBITDA growth over the last 3 years. So if you add in the -- if you add in our outlook for this year, we'll still be towards the top of our long-term range. So I think that's a very strong performance. I think in terms of the volume, as Nick talked about, we are seeing small pockets of volume growth. Clearly, it's different across the different geographies and different categories around the world. So stronger performance starting to come through in beverages, particularly in places like nonalcoholic beverages as well as dairy. And I think particularly in China and in the U.S., consumer confidence is still -- we're still looking and waiting for that to improve. But as we talked about, we expect volume performance, and Nick talked about it. We expect that to continue to improve throughout the year and accelerate as we move through.

Nick Hampton: So our next question is from Alex Sloane at Barclays.

Alex Sloane: The first one, just in terms of the price resets for 2024 reflecting, in part, lower input costs. I think the statement still refers to some competition in FBS in Latin America and Europe. Obviously, you talked about that earlier last year. Have you seen any easing on this front with the new reset prices? That would be the first question. And the second one, just going back to the question on volume. I think you had said in quarter 3, maybe there was a 3-point impact from destocking into the year-end, which you expect it to reverse in the first quarter. If I look at the first quarter -- sorry, in the fourth quarter, in the calendar first quarter, if I look at the volumes in quarter 4, it looks like maybe excluding that phasing benefit, they were still slightly negative. So I just wondered, is there any sort of worsening in the trends as you exited the quarter? And just be interested in terms of what you've already seen in April and May on this front, presumably, values are improving to give you the confidence in the full year outlook.

Nick Hampton: So maybe I'll take the first question -- the second question first, and I'll come back to the pricing point. So yes, we saw a sequential improvement in volume as we went into the fourth quarter. I'd say if you take into -- the sort of residual impact of destocking as we entered the last quarter of our financial year, we clearly saw an improvement in volume run rates. And as we come into the first part of this financial year, we're starting to see that continue as well. So we're definitely seeing some positive momentum that is both about exiting the destocking. It's also about exiting the period of when we were exiting low-margin business, and it reflects the positive signs we saw in the contract round along the market evolution that we talked about earlier. So we're definitely seeing improvement as we come into the first quarter of this year. So that's all very consistent actually with what we said in our Q3 statement. That's all that's all good. In terms of the pricing reset, it varies by geography, clearly. We're probably seeing net-net a slight easing rather than an acceleration of the trends that you mentioned. But they're clearly still there in pockets of the business, and we need to make sure we balance the price, price revenue margin to reflect the relative competitive dynamics across the world. So hopefully, that gives you a broad sense, Alex, if what we're seeing on your 2 questions. And our next question comes from Karel Zoete of Kepler Cheuvreux.

Karel Zoete: I've got two questions. The first one is on mix, mix improvements in the second half of the year. It seems that has slowed quite a bit. Part of it anticipated. But if you can speak a bit about the mix trends during the second half of the year. And the other thing is looking at the cost situation, a very good savings momentum. In general, I think the outlook for cost of goods sold, but also other cost lines is more favorable than 12 months ago. So if you can touch upon that. And obviously, that also comes back to the EBITDA guidance as -- yes. It seems there is good savings momentum in the business. Volumes will recover. So yes, much appreciated.

Nick Hampton: So why don't I take the second question and then Dawn can maybe pick up on the mix point. So as you rightly say, Karel, I mean, 2 headlines, I would say, on cost. Incredibly pleased with the discipline the team is bringing to productivity. So $40 million plus productivity last year and that reflects a systemic program, but also some of the investments we're making in systems to allow us to get more efficient at predicting and planning the business and managing our end supply chain and serving our customers better. And that's reflected in the fact that we've called up our productivity guidance for the 5-year period, so from $100 million to $150 million. So the team doing a really good job there. Of course, we're also seeing the impact of inflation easing on input costs as well. And that delivers that delivers some significant benefits this year, which as we've done -- as we did with inflationary pressures, we're passing through to customers in a responsible way. They were accepting of price increases when we were under inflationary pressures because of the value we bring to their products. And we were committed to being fair with them as inflation abated. So that's reflected in the pricing dynamics in the business as we've given guidance on revenue for this year. Now when you add all of that up, though and you think about the shape of our EBITDA guidance, it really reflects the balance between being really disciplined on cost and productivity, but also continuing to invest in the long-term future of the business in innovation, in solution selling and customer intimacy. And as we add all of that up and look at the volume trajectory, that's where we end up with EBITDA guidance that sort of touches the end of our long-term range. So Dawn, do you want to pick up mix?

Dawn Allen: Yes. So Karel, if you remember, in the first half of last year, we did have very strong price mix. Obviously, at the half year, we had 13 points of price mix, roughly driven half inflation and half price mix. As we moved into quarter 3, we saw a similar trend, but it came off slightly. And then as we moved into quarter 4 and we set the new contracting round. And as we've talked about, we've set up that contracting round to drive volume growth. We also moved into a deflationary environment. So high single-digit deflation in quarter 4. We also selectively chose to invest with specific customers to drive long-term growth, but that is a small impact in the quarter. And as we look forward, we would expect to see high single-digit deflation particularly in the first half of the year. And as the volume momentum improves, we expect that to start to offset and more than offset as we move through the year, the selective investment that we've chosen to do with some customers.

Nick Hampton: Okay. So our next question is from Chris Pitcher at Redburn.

Chris Pitcher: A couple of questions for me on the sort of the momentum in innovations and solutions selling. You increased spend by a double-digit rate in the first half. It was up 5% for the full year. So it's kind of flat in the second half. Is that because you've got to sort of level that you think is sustainable? And could you give a bit more color on what your R&D spend is doing? And then I appreciate it's modest changes, but the percentage of new business wins went down a bit at the full year versus the first half. I'm just wondering what's going on in the background. And last one, are you able to give us an absolute share of your business between what draft at the CMD between specification, technical sports and solutions? What is solutions actually the underlying business? I understand that the goal to get the new wins up to over 30%. But just I -- just clarify where we are on the base?

Nick Hampton: So let me try and take those 3 questions in turn. So I would think about the investment level in innovation, solution selling R&D, the 5% in the year. I would just think of it as a phasing impact half 1, half 2. It doesn't really reflect any slowdown. And it certainly doesn't reflect that we think we've reached the limit of where we want to be. So we're going to continue to commit to delivering at least 5% increase in spend on innovation and solution selling and customer intimacy through the next few years. So it's not a sign of any slowdown. It's just a phasing impact to half 1, half 2. In terms of kind of solution selling, as percentage of wins. Again, we're up 3 points in the year at 21%. That's the real message. And of course, it's going to vary a little bit quarter-on-quarter. And importantly, in that 21% nearly half of that came from new products. So our new products are really starting to have an impact on the business. We said before that in broad terms, if you think about what -- how much of that business is actually in solution selling today, it's around about 20% in round terms. It's growing. And that's good news because that means there's plenty to go after in terms of improving that proportion as part of the business. And as we said before, that business is really valuable because it tends to be bigger pieces of business. It tends to be stickier because we're formulating into the critical part of the product. And it builds relationships, which leads to more business. So lots more to go after. We're going to continue to invest with intent to make sure we're managing the shape of the business for the future.

Chris Pitcher: I've got a follow-up but someone else is on the line looking to question. So I mean can I quickly ask, I mean CapEx is lower than the trend you said previously for this year. Is this a phasing effect? Or do you think you can drive growth at lower investments?

Nick Hampton: Dawn, do you want to take that?

Dawn Allen: Yes. So I would say -- I mean, CapEx at GBP 110 million is GBP 39 million up versus the previous year. So I'd say that we are continuing to invest in CapEx. And a good example of that is our new fibers line in BolerÃ¡z, that's just recently come on stream. I think if you think about -- in terms of capital markets, you're right, we did talk about an increasing CapEx spend going up to the region of GBP 130 million to GBP 150 million. If you think about what's happened over the last 12 months with low consumer confidence and destocking, there hasn't been as much of a need to invest in growth CapEx given that more than half of our CapEx is spent on growth investments. But when you look to next year, I mean, our forecast for CapEx for next year is in the range of GBP 100 million to GBP 120 million. So we are actually increasing to get to that long-term range that we talked about. But it's still a key growth driver and a key investment driver for us.

Nick Hampton: And Chris, I'd probably just add one point to that, which is -- we've been very focused in the last really 5 or 6 years to try and increase the quality of the business. And part of the benefits of that is you get more out of your existing assets, and you could be more efficient with your capital spend. That's reflected in where our return on capital is, it's just reflected in the progress in our EBITDA margins. And it's reflected in the strength of the balance sheet. So we've got plenty of firepower to invest, but we want to continue to invest to drive maximum returns. So should we move on? And our next question comes from Joan Lim from BNP Exane. Joan?

Joan Lim: Perfect. Two questions from me, please. So your leverage is still strong even after the share buyback. Why did you not do a bigger share buyback?

Joan Lim: Okay. And then your FY '25 guidance, it looks conservative to that 4% to 7%, given that you think volumes are going to improve and then prices pass through is there anything, I don't know, maybe for Q1 trends you've seen so far or is there scope for an upgrade to your guidance very -- maybe too early. But so if you could just help us understand a bit more into the drivers of this guidance?

Nick Hampton: So let me take the first question and then come back -- we'll come back to the second one. So look, on the buyback. We've announced we're going to return all the net proceeds from the sale of our final stake in Primient to shareholders. Do you think that's a responsible thing to do with the excess cash that we're bringing in as a result of that transaction. As we've demonstrated in the past, we will hand back cash to shareholders as appropriate. But our capital allocation policy is very clear. We want to maintain the scope to invest both inorganically and organically. And we want to make sure that we're paying an appropriate dividend to our shareholders. And on top of that, we'll continue to reevaluate returning capital. We're not saying that that's necessarily the last thing we're going to do, but it feels like a very sensible position to take as we speak today. On your point on conservatism on guidance, look, I think we've been very clear we're starting to see improvements in volume momentum. We're starting to see economic recovery around the world and a sense of consumer confidence increasing but still fragile. And we want to continue to invest in the business. So that's why the 4% to 7% guidance feels appropriate today. We'll be in a much better position to give you a view on where we are on that when we get to a half year, and we'll see how economies develop and the business develops over the next 6 months. So for now, we think it's the right way to calibrate a business that, by the way, has delivered double-digit EBITDA growth over the last 3 years pretty consistently. And whether that's conservative or not, we'll have a better view on at the half year, frankly. So I think we've come to end of our questions. So thank you to everyone for watching and for all of your questions. In summary, we delivered good performance in the year with strong profit growth in line with our guidance and excellent cash generation. The sale of our remaining stake in Primient completes the transformation of Tate & Lyle into a specialty solutions provider to the food and beverage industry. We will continue to progress our growth focus strategy and remain well placed to benefit from the long-term trends towards healthier, tastier and more sustainable food and drink. Thank you all for your time, and I wish you all a very good day.",investing.com,news,Investing.com,,0.4823529411764707,454264235,1,https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/LYNXMPEB2C0AG_L.jpg,eng-9596907

As the joint initiative just turned two, the European Commission released country reports tracking progress.

Diversifying the EU's energy supplies, speeding up the green transition and improving the bloc's energy security are the goals of the REPowerEU plan which celebrated its two-year anniversary recently.

On Tuesday, EU ministers gave final approval to the electricity market reform - also geared towards improving the bloc's energy security. The reform further promotes the expansion of renewable energies and should better protect consumers from escalating electricity prices in the future.

Two years of REPowerEU

Faced with the difficulties and disruptions in the global energy market caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the European Commission launched the REPowerEU plan in May 2022. The plan foresees energy saving goals, the production of clean energy and the diversification of energy supplies - and ultimately ending the dependency on Russian fossil fuels.

Since the adoption of the REPowerEU plan, the EU has successfully reduced gas supplies from Russia. The share of gas from Russia - by pipeline and Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) - made up 45 percent of all imported gas in 2021, but only 15 percent in 2023. The Union replaced it with gas from other third countries. Norway and the USA have become the largest gas suppliers.

Seaborne imports of Russian crude oil, refined petroleum products and Russian coal imports have been banned through EU sanctions.

Natural gas consumption: How much did member states reduce?

In 27 country reports released for the two-year anniversary of REPowerEU, the European Commission compiled member states' performances between August 2022 and January 2024. Each country report includes a country-specific analysis on a range of points, for example on the key energy figures, diversification of energy supplies, energy price developments or the natural gas demand reduction.

The EU countries had agreed on a voluntary 15 percent reduction target of natural gas consumption and almost all countries have managed to lower their gas consumption. On EU level, the countries achieved a decrease of 18 percent.

21 countries lowered their gas consumption even further than the agreed-upon reduction target, including Denmark (-40%), Finland (-39%), Latvia (-30%), Sweden (-29%), Lithuania (-29%), Estonia (-28%), the Netherlands (-27%), Luxembourg (-26%), Portugal (-23%), Slovakia (-22%), France (-20%), Romania (-19%), Austria (-19%), Hungary (-18%) and Bulgaria (-18%), Italy (-17%), Croatia (-17%), Czechia (-17%), Greece (-16%), Germany (-16%) and Belgium (-16%).

According to the European Commission's data, only five countries did not meet the 15 percent reduction target. Among those are Spain (-12%), Slovenia (-10%), Poland (-8%), Ireland (-4%) and Malta, the only country which increased its gas consumption by ten percent. According to the report, Cyprus does not use natural gas.

Slovenia: Cutting down on consumption, but still reliant on Russian gas

In the case of Slovenia, the REPowerEU report pointed out that while the country 'has taken measures to strengthen alternative supplies of natural gas', it 'effectively remains reliant on Russian gas imported through Austria'.

Data by the Slovenian Energy Agency shows that in 2023 Slovenia imported 68.3 percent of gas from Austria and 28.3 percent from Algeria, through Italy. The agency cannot say with certainty how much of the gas imported from Austria is of Russian origin.

Even though gas importers have not had direct contracts for supply of gas from Russia for 2023 or 2024, the Energy Agency believes that the share of Russian gas was still predominant both in 2023 and in the first part of 2024.

Moving forward on renewables with room for improvement

The EU and its member states are continuously working towards becoming more sustainable and less reliant on fossil fuels. What have countries achieved so far?

In 2023, according to the European Commission, Portugal for example installed around 1.3 gigawatts of renewable electricity capacity, bringing the total to 18.4 gigawatts - in comparison to 5.1 gigawatts in 2021. Additionally, the annual growth rate of installed renewable energy capacity increased to 7.6 percent compared to 6.1 percent in 2021. However, the country's energy mix still included 69 percent fossil fuels in 2022.

Neighbouring Spain accelerated its transition towards a decarbonised energy system. According to Spanish grid operator Red Electrica, renewables accounted for 65.2 percent of the Spanish electricity mix in March - an all-time high. Still, the REPowerEU Spain report states that fossil fuels continue to play a central role in the country's energy system, representing 70.1 percent of primary energy imported in 2021.

Croatia quickly deduced its dependence on Russian gas imports by increasing its own production and intensifying the use of the existing LNG terminal. However, Croatia is still highly dependent on energy imports from countries outside the EU. Fossil fuels also continue to play an important role in Croatia's energy mix, as they accounted for 72 percent of gross available energy in 2022.

Moving into a greener direction, the country could soon start to produce green hydrogen: INA, the leading Croatian oil and gas company, recently signed two contracts related to renewable energy projects - one for the production of green hydrogen and the other for a bio-methane production facility. The completion of the construction of both plants is expected in 2026. The green hydrogen project, together with its solar plant and logistic capacity, will be co-financed via the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF).

The EU's RRF is a tool providing grants and loans to support reforms and investments in member states. It should, among other things, help member states become more sustainable, boost progress with the green and digital transition and achieve the EU target of climate neutrality by 2050.

...just hang on for a year

In Bulgaria, one of the major national energy reforms has been postponed by a year, which means the artificial maintenance of coal capacity will remain for at least another twelve months. This, in turn, could lead to the country not receiving the expected 1.3 billion BNG (around 665.15 million Euro) under the Bulgarian National Recovery and Resilience Plan which is funded under the EU's RFF. The energy reform is a mandatory requirement.

While Bulgarian MPs justified this citing a lack of readiness to switch from a regulated to a free electricity market or funds, several media outlets and experts attributed the decision mostly to pre-election populism.

A reformed energy market for security and a green future

This week, the electricity market reform took its final hurdle after representatives from EU member states and the European Parliament had signed off on the market reforms last December.

Belgium's Energy Minister Tinne Van der Straeten described the day as a 'milestone for the EU' on the path to a carbon-free and greener future. 'By adopting the electricity market reform, we are empowering consumers, ensuring security of supply and paving the way for a more stable, predictable and sustainable energy market.'

New long-term contracts between governments and electricity producers, under which the state would chip in if the market price drops below an agreed price, are central to the reform efforts.This is meant to incentivise domestic green and nuclear power production by ensuring a return on investments.

It also protects consumers who, in the future, have the right to both fixed-price contracts and contracts with dynamic prices. This would allow consumers to opt for both secure, long-term prices and contracts with changing prices if they want to take advantage of price fluctuations - for example, to use electricity when it is cheaper for charging electric cars or for heat pumps.

How does the electricity market work?

The electricity market in the EU works according to the merit-order principle, defining the order in which power plants connected to the electricity exchange are used to deliver energy and to determine the market price.

Those that can produce electricity at relatively low marginal cost, like wind farms, are used first to cover demand. But as demand rises beyond those initial sources' capabilities, higher marginal cost sources are used.

The final price therefore depends on which sources need to be used to meet demand, as well as fluctuations in the costs of using those sources. For example, a surge in natural gas prices raises the cost of using gas-fired power plants. (AGERPRES: RO - editors: Mariana Ionescu, Cristina Zaharia)

European Union citizens will vote on June 6-9 to choose the 720 members of the next European Parliament, who will serve for five years. Most EU countries hold the election on June 9, but the Netherlands votes on June 6, Ireland and the Czech Republic on June 7 and Malta, Slovakia and Latvia on June 8.

Why it is important:

The European Parliament is one of the three EU institutions that run the 27-nation bloc. Together with EU governments, it decides on laws, proposed by the European Commission, that govern policies and the EU market of almost 450 million people. It does not wield as much power as the Commission or the member states' national governments. But it can reject or substantially amend legislation and, as the only directly elected EU institution, its pronouncements have political clout.

Expected power shift in the European Parliament:

Polls suggest the main pro-EU groups around the political centre - the centre-right, centre-left, Greens and liberals - will have a smaller majority than they currently enjoy, while the far right will make gains.

The polls predict the centrist groups will win around 450 seats in the 720-member chamber. That compares with 491 seats in the outgoing parliament, which has 705 members.

The parties that formed the populist far-right Identity and Democracy (ID) group in the last parliament are projected to gain ground, rising from around 58 seats to 80 or more.

Those parties include the Alternative for Germany (AfD), the National Rally of France's Marine Le Pen and the Lega party of Italy's Matteo Salvini. The group decided on May 23 to expel the AfD over remarks by a party leader about the Nazi SS force.

Another eurosceptic and populist group, the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR), dominated by Poland's former ruling PiS party and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's Brothers of Italy, may rise from 68 to around 80 seats.

The projected rise in eurosceptic lawmakers would not stop the EU in its tracks. But it may make it more difficult to push through policies that give the EU more power or share resources within the bloc. This might affect the parliament's stance on policies identified by EU leaders as priorities for the next five years including:

- The EU's transition to net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050

While many of the EU's policies to curb CO2 and methane emissions are already in place in the form of the Green Deal package, some of the laws have reviews coming up in the next five years and pushing through new laws might be tougher.

- Industrial policy to keep the EU competitive against China and the United States

While EU officials argue that a united front gives Europe the best chance of competing with the world's two biggest economies, eurosceptic parties often oppose such an approach, arguing national sovereignty must come first.

- An EU energy union to lower energy prices and make supply more stable

Scarred by the experience of excessive dependence on Russian pipeline gas deliveries, EU countries want to find alternative energy suppliers, expand storage and build out trans-European networks to send electricity across borders. But views differ on how far to go

- A Capital Markets Union to mobilise private money to pay for EU priorities

EU countries have been trying for 10 years to harmonise laws to make it easier to invest in securities across borders and finance companies in this way. But national vested interests have prevented progress. More eurosceptic and nationally-oriented MEPs will not help advance this goal.

- Boosting the EU's defence production capabilities

EU officials argue the bloc needs more joint financing, development and coordination of defence projects, traditionally the domain of national governments. Russia's invasion of Ukraine shows the EU must work together to defend itself, they say. But the issue is highly contentious and would have a tougher time in a more eurosceptic European Parliament.

Influence on top EU jobs

EU leaders take into account the election result when they choose the head of the European Commission, the executive arm that has exclusive power to propose new EU laws.

The centre-right European People's Party is forecast to come first in the election, giving it a strong claim on the post. Its candidate for the Commission presidency is the incumbent, Germany's Ursula von der Leyen.

Influence on EU money

The next European Parliament will co-decide with EU governments on the next EU budget for 2028-2034. The current seven-year budget is around 1.1 trillion euros ($1.18 trillion).

The next long-term budget might be increased and certainly will have to change in terms of spending priorities to take into account the possible enlargement of the EU to include Ukraine, Moldova and the Western Balkans.

Influence on future shape of EU

EU officials and governments say the bloc needs to reform its internal agriculture policy and the way it supports its members to equalise standards of living before it admits new countries, especially big ones such as Ukraine.

Many also say the EU needs to change how it makes decisions, reducing the need for unanimity, if more countries are to join.

Nick Hampton

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I am pleased to present Tate & Lyle's results for the year ended 31st of March 2024. The agenda for today's presentation is on the screen. I will begin with an overview of the year, Dawn will run through the financial results, and then I will come back to talk about our strategic progress and the outlook. Finally, Dawn and I will be happy to take your questions.

So starting with the key headlines. We successfully delivered a strong financial performance in a challenging external environment, with profit growth in line with our guidance and excellent cash generation. The sale of our remaining interest in premiums, which we also announced today, completes the transformation of Tate & Lyle into a fully focused specialty food and beverage solutions business. Following completion of this transaction, we intend to start a share buyback program to return the net cash proceeds from the sale to shareholders.

We continue to make good progress delivering our strategy with solutions new business wins once again increasing in the year. We are also taking a leadership position on sustainability, a critical area for the future of the food industry.

Turning to our financial performance. Group revenue was 2% lower, with EBITDA up 7%. Free cash flow was GBP 49 million higher with 85% cash conversion and we delivered $41 million of productivity savings, significantly ahead of targets.

Earlier today, we announced we have signed an agreement to sell our remaining stake in Primient to KPS Capital Partners for $350 million. This values our 49.7% stake, well ahead of the valuation when we sold a controlling interest in this business in April 2022.

It is anticipated that the completion of the sale will be before the end of July, and that net cash proceeds after tax will be around $270 million. The 20-year supply agreements between Primient and Tate & Lyle put in place in April 2022 will continue to operate.

The sale completes our staged exit from Primient well ahead of expiry of the original lockup period of 8 years to April 2030. Total gross cash proceeds from the sale of Primient together with dividends received since April 2022 exceed $1.5 billion.

The Board intends to return the net cash proceeds from the sale of Primient to shareholders by way of an on-market share buyback program. This is expected to commence on completion of the Primient sale. This decision is consistent with the Board's capital allocation policy, which Dawn will talk about later. Further details about the share buyback program will be announced in due course.

Over the last 6 years, we've been on a journey to transform Tate & Lyle into a fully focused specialty Food & Beverage Solutions business. With the sale of Primient this transformation is complete. Over that period, we have fundamentally changed the way we focus on customers and categories, invested in our innovation and solution selling capabilities and significantly strengthened each of our sweetening, mouthfeel and fortification platforms through both new product launches and acquisitions.

The transformation has positioned Tate & Lyle right at the center of the future of food, focused on creating solutions that meet growing consumer demand for healthier, tastier and more sustainable food and drink. We have a clear strategy and purpose and are very well placed to capture the considerable growth opportunities ahead.

Moving to our strategic progress during the year. I am pleased to report we made good progress on our ambition to accelerate growth from innovation and solution selling. New products as a percentage of Food & Beverage Solutions revenue was 16%, and we met our target of growing our investment in innovation and solution selling by at least 5% in the year.

Solutions revenue from new business wins increased to 21% and I will talk more about this later in my presentation. Finally, turning to our purpose targets where we continue to perform well. We made strong progress reducing greenhouse gas emissions, both within our own operations and across our supply chain.

Our Scope 1 and 2 emissions have been reduced by 11% over the last 4 years, benefiting in particular from an increase in the use of renewable electricity. Our Scope 3 emissions are now 20% lower, exceeding our 2030 target of a 15% reduction 7 years ahead of schedule. This has been driven largely by the investments we made previously in 3 plants now owned by Primient to eliminate the use of coal and the success of our sustainable agriculture programs for corn and stevia.

Our other purpose metrics are also progressing well. For example, over the last 4 years, our no and low calorie sweeteners and fibers have helped to remove 7.9 million tonnes of sugar from people's diets. That's 31 trillion calories or more than the recommended daily calorie intake for the entire global population.

As a purpose-led business, we recognize the importance of combining growth with the responsibility. And that means playing our part in tackling climate change. This is critical for the future of the food industry as around 1/3 of the planet greenhouse gas emissions comes from food production and agriculture.

In addition, agriculture currently uses 70% of the world's fresh water. For that reason, I am delighted that earlier this month, we announced a significant increase in our climate ambition with new Scope 1 and 2 and Scope 3 emissions targets to 2028. These targets have been validated as science-based by the science-based targets initiative and are aligned to a 1.5-degree centigrade trajectory in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement.

In summary, this means we will now be delivering a larger reduction in emissions at a faster pace. We are already taking actions to make this happen, and I look forward to sharing our progress in future presentations. I will come back to talk about our strategic progress and the outlook later. But for now, I would hand over to Dawn to talk through the financial results. Dawn, over to you.

Dawn Allen

Thank you, Nick, and good morning, everyone. In line with previous presentations, I will focus on adjusted measures. Items with percentage growth are in constant currency unless I indicate otherwise.

As Nick said, we have successfully navigated a challenging external environment and softer consumer demand with considerable agility to deliver another year of strong profit growth in line with our guidance and acceleration in our productivity program with savings well ahead of our target, excellent cash generation driven by significantly improved working capital discipline and continued investment for the long term across all 3 pillars of science, solutions and society.

In terms of financial highlights, despite the fact that group revenue was 2% lower, we delivered EBITDA growth of 7% with EBITDA margin 170 basis points higher at 19.9%. Profit before tax was 18% higher, reflecting strong performance from food and beverage solutions and improved performance in our minority holding in Primient and lower finance charges.

Earnings per share were 18% higher. Return on capital employed was 20 basis points lower at 17.4%, while on an organic basis, it was 40 basis points higher. Finally, free cash flow was up GBP 49 million at GBP 170 million. So overall, the business showed considerable agility and resilience to deliver a robust financial performance.

Moving onto our 3 operating segments. Starting with Food & Beverage Solutions. This business is our growth engine and represents more than 80% of our revenue. Revenue was 2% lower, with 5 percentage points decrease from volume and price mix, partially offset by 3 percentage points increase from the recovery of net inflation across the year.

The volume and price mix decrease of 5 percentage points was driven by 2 factors. Firstly, 6 percentage points volume reduction from the impact of consumer demand softness and customer destocking. Secondly, a 1 percentage point benefit from our continued focus on mix management and solution selling.

Looking at the performance of our 3 regions. In North America, revenue was 3% lower, driven by cost of living pressures on consumers, resulting in softer demand across our core categories. In Asia, Middle East, Africa and Latin America, revenue was down 3%.

In Asia, revenue was lower, reflecting pricing pressure and weaker demand, particularly in China. In Latin America, revenue declined driven by lower-priced imports from outside the region, especially in Mexico. And in the Middle East and Africa, revenue was ahead of the prior year with strong demand for dairy solutions in North Africa.

In Europe, revenue was slightly ahead, driven by good demand across the dairy and infant nutrition categories. This was offset by the exit of some low-margin business in line with our strategy and increased competition from imports from outside the region. Our approach last year was to focus on margin ahead of volume, this drove EBITDA growth 8% higher, benefiting from positive customer and product mix and increased solution selling, productivity savings and strong cost discipline also contributed to higher profits with 180 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion.

Food & Beverage Solutions has a proven growth track record with revenue growth of 12% and EBITDA growth of 10% over the last 3 years. Let's move to sucralose. This is a strongly cash-generative business and its role is to provide attractive returns.

Revenue was broadly in line with the prior year as volume remained flat and customer mix led to modestly lower pricing. EBITDA at GBP 52 million was 4% lower, reflecting cost inflation across a range of imports. Industry demand for sucralose remains robust, driven by growing consumer demand for reduced share and calories in food and drink. We continue to see good demand from our larger customers.

Primary Products Europe is the smallest segment, comprising 7% of our revenue. We continue to successfully optimize its financial performance as we transition capacity to higher-margin food and beverage solutions ingredients. Revenue was 12% lower, mainly reflecting reduced volume.

Adjusted EBITDA losses reduced significantly from GBP 9 million to GBP 5 million, benefiting from lower input costs. So pulling this all together, Food & Beverage Solutions increased EBITDA by 8% or GBP 20 million. Sucralose saw a slight decline in EBITDA of GBP 3 million, which was more than offset by Primary Products Europe, where EBITDA losses were GBP 4 million lower.

Overall, this led to an increase in absolute EBITDA in constant currency of GBP 21 million or 7%. This growth is impressive, given that we had to offset input cost inflation of around GBP 60 million in the year, and we continue to invest in long-term growth. Finally, the impact of foreign exchange was to decrease EBITDA by GBP 15 million to GBP 328 million.

Turning to productivity. We delivered $41 million of productivity savings in the year, demonstrating the strong productivity culture we have embedded across the business. Savings came from the following areas: 70% was from operational and supply chain efficiencies, and 30% was from strong cost management and savings in SG&A.

A strong contribution came from our manufacturing excellence program, which includes projects to drive production yield improvements at our plants. We also made good savings optimizing our logistics network. Our investment in digital also continues to be a key enabler of productivity savings and to enhance our end-to-end customer experience.

For example, we are using process analytics to identify bottlenecks in our supplier invoice chain helping to eliminate manual touch points and improve our processing rates. We are also using digital to enhance a demand planning processes not only improving the customers' experience but also delivering working capital efficiencies.

Given our strong progress, we are increasing our productivity savings target for the 5 years to the 31st of March 2028 by 50% from $100 million to $150 million.

Let's move on to talk through tax and exceptional items. The adjusted effective tax rate was 21.6%, 170 basis points above the prior year. This was due to an increase in the headline U.K. corporation tax rate from 19% to 25% and more profit being taxed in higher rate jurisdictions. We anticipate the adjusted effective tax rate for the 2025 financial year will be in line with the 2024 rate.

On exceptional items, net pretax exceptional charges were GBP 24 million, most of which related to restructuring costs for organizational improvements and productivity benefits. From a cash flow perspective, this translated into a total exceptional cash outflow of GBP 27 million.

Moving on to Primient. Our share of profit was 53% higher at GBP 35 million as Primient benefited from strong customer contracting in both 2023 and 2024. Robust sweetener demand and improved operational performance. This was partially offset by higher finance charges. We received $74 million in cash dividends from Primient in the year.

Moving now to free cash flow. Adjusted free cash flow was GBP 49 million higher at GBP 170 million. This drove cash conversion 23 percentage points higher to 85%, well above our long-term target of 75%. Increased Discipline in inventory management and improved demand planning led to GBP 112 million improvement in net working capital.

We also continue to invest in long-term growth with capital expenditure, GBP 39 million higher, at GBP 110 million. For the 2025 financial year, we expect capital expenditure will be in the GBP 100 million to GBP 120 million range. Cash generation will continue to be a key priority and our focus in the future is to consistently exceed cash conversion of 75%.

Moving on to net debt and dividends. Net debt was GBP 85 million lower at GBP 153 million. This was the result of 3 main factors: firstly, a step change in cash generation; secondly, the receipt of $74 million of dividends from Primient; and lastly, the payment of dividends to shareholders of GBP 76 million.

Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio is 0.5x and we continue to have strong liquidity headroom to invest for growth. During the year, we have repaid $120 million of debt from cash, of which $95 million was floating rate debt. Earlier this month, we renewed our committed undrawn and sustainability-linked revolving credit facility of $800 million, extending its maturity to 2029.

The Board is recommending a final dividend of 12.9p per share. This brings the full year dividend to 19.1p per share, an increase of 3.2%. Our capital allocation framework remains unchanged. Our priority is to continue the disciplined deployment of capital and to maintain Tate & Lowe's financial strength.

Under our capital allocation framework, we have a clear prioritization: firstly, investment in organic growth; secondly, investment in acquisitions joint ventures and partnerships; thirdly, our progressive dividend policy; and finally, to return capital to shareholders should it become surplus to the needs of the company.

Consistent with the above, as Nick said earlier, we intend to return the net cash proceeds from the sale of our remaining stake in Primient to shareholders from completion. We have a strong balance sheet. And looking forward, we want to retain the flexibility to drive value-accretive growth, guided by our view that our long-term efficient leverage is in the range of 1x to 2.5x net debt to EBITDA.

We remain focused on converting our profit into cash to support all uses of capital in line with our capital allocation policy. I want to leave you with 3 key messages. The first is that we delivered strong profit performance in line with our guidance while navigating a challenging external environment. Secondly, we've improved the quality of our financial performance. We have done this through the delivery of a specialty EBITDA margin of 21% in Food & Beverage Solutions. The acceleration of productivity savings with our 5-year target increasing to $150 million and a step change in cash generation ahead of our long-term target.

And thirdly, we continue to apply our capital allocation framework to drive value accretive growth through investment for the long term as well as returning surplus cash to shareholders. With that, let me hand you back to Nick.

Nick Hampton

Thank you, Dawn. I'm now going to give you a brief update on our strategic progress and then cover the outlook. I'm going to focus on 3 areas: firstly, the completion of the transformation of the business following the sale of Primient; secondly, how we are accelerating our solutions-based business with customers; and thirdly, the investments we are making in technology, innovation and new capacity to support our customers and drive long-term growth.

Over the last 6 years, Tate & Lyle has been through a major transformation. With the sale of Primient, this transformation is now complete. Driven by our purpose of transforming lives through the science of food, Tate & Lyle today is a growth-focused Speciality Food & Beverage Solutions business, a global leader in sweetening, mouthfeel and fortification with world-class scientific and solutions capabilities and strong customer relationships.

It is a focused and agile business with an ambitious purpose and a clear strategy for growth. And the growth opportunities are considerable. The global specialty food ingredients market is $75 billion and expected to grow at around 6% on a compound annual basis. $19 billion of this market is addressable by Tate & Lyle's 3 platforms.

Our core categories of beverages, dairy, soup sources and dressings and bakery and snacks represents 70% or $13 billion of this addressable market. The other 30% is in categories such as confectionery and infant nutrition, where we have regional expertise. But the real opportunity is even bigger. While the global specialty ingredient sweetness market is around $5 billion, sugar still makes up 80% of the global sweetening market. And there is an estimated further $3 billion of sugar replacement opportunity across our 4 core categories.

Within our addressable markets, there are structural trends, which are driving consumer preference and changes in consumption. The rise of diseases like obesity and diabetes and concerns about digestive health and immunity are leading people to be increasingly concerned about their health and wellness. As a result, consumers are looking for products lower in sugar and calories and with added fiber.

They are also moving to more plant-based food. Consumer desire for food and drink, which is healthy, tasty, convenient and more sustainable and affordable all play directly into Tate & Lyle's areas of expertise. Through our 3 platforms, we create ingredients and solutions, which reduce sugar and calories, enhanced texture and the mouthfeel experience, increase nutrition through fiber and protein and where necessary, optimize cost.

The strategic focus and intent of Tate & Lyle is clear. Based on our market-leading positions and world-class scientific and solutions capabilities, we are a leading differentiated specialty Food & Beverage Solutions business, delivering sweetening, mouthfeel and fortification across our 4 core categories and beyond.

The increasing strength and quality of the business is reflected in our financial performance. Despite what has been a period of considerable economic volatility over the last 3 years, the group has delivered a compound average growth rate for revenue of 11% and EBITDA of 10%, well ahead of our current 5-year financial ambition.

Food & Beverage Solutions delivered revenue growth of 12% and EBITDA growth of 10% in the same period. This growth has been supported by a second area I want to focus on, the acceleration of our solutions-based business with customers. Innovation is a key growth engine for our solutions offering, and it's very encouraging to see is continuing to deliver a steady flow of new products into the market.

During the year, we launched 9 new products, 5 from our sweetener platform, mainly stevia line extensions and 4 from our fortification platform, including a new high fiber product for use in low alcohol beverages. Overall, revenue from new products on a like-for-like basis, including those which fell out of the calculation this year, grew by 13%.

And to demonstrate the traction our new products are getting with customers, 44% of the revenue from our new business pipeline involve formulating 1 or more of our new products. Increased customer adoption of new products is one of the reasons why solution-based revenue from new business wins grew this year, up 3 percentage points to 21%. This is 5 percentage points higher than the average between 2020 and 2022. And so the acceleration over the last 2 years is very encouraging.

I was also pleased to see a strong solutions performance in our growth markets of Asia, Middle East and Africa and Latin America. Our chassis approach for solutions development, where we build a global template solution up to anywhere between 50% and 80% of a customer requirement and then adopt the -- and complete the rest of the solution to meet local market needs continues to work well and to increase customer collaboration.

As a reminder, collaboration on solutions has a number of benefits. The value of ingredients used in solutions tends to be higher, about 2x higher on average. And they are also a stickier sale as the solution directly involves solving a customer's challenge. It also builds stronger customer relationships, often leading to new business.

Let me give you one example of our solutions in action. In the U.K., our food scientists recently worked with Paris to create a healthier version of the iconic McVitie's digested biscuit. The brief was to reduce both the sugar and fat content in the biscuit retain its distinctive taste and to not change the production process.

Sugar plays a crucial role in biscuits, creating both texture and taste as well as improving shelf life so that the biscuit retains their crunch. Through our deep understanding of the complex intersection between sweetening, mouthfeel and fortification, we were able to find a solution based on our fiber portfolio. That not only reduce both the sugar and fat content in the biscuit by 30%, but also added 50% more fiber. And its iconic mouthfeel and taste were also maintained.

The combination of our increasing focus on innovation and solution selling is having a positive impact on customer perception of Tate & Lyle and our position as a preferred partner of choice. At the start of 2024, we undertook a major survey looking at the experience of customers working with Tate & Lyle. This survey which is conducted by an independent third party assessed the views of 286 customers across the world.

The survey showed that over 90% of our customers believe we provide a better or as good a service as other ingredient suppliers they use. Reasons given include our high levels of technical support, the quality of our products and the strong levels of customer service and reliability.

These results are very encouraging and show that the journey we have been on over the last 6 years to significantly sharpen our focus on the customer is now paying real dividends. While we can always do more as we move forward as a fully focused specialty business, the customer-focused culture we have embedded in Tate & Lyle will play a key part in delivering our growth strategy.

To ensure we can continue to grow our solutions offering for customers, we are increasing our investment in technology, innovation and growth capacity. Let me take each one in turn. Firstly, we have installed a new robotic system in our lab in Singapore with enhanced characterization and predictive modeling capabilities.

This system is transforming the way we develop mouthfeel solutions for customers and has led to a significant increase in the customer collaboration at the lab. Secondly, we opened a new customer innovation and collaboration center in Jakarta, Indonesia, which is already helping to build our business in a market with significant long-term growth potential.

And thirdly, we continue to add new growth capacity to our network. Earlier this month, we formally opened our new Non-GMO PROMITOR soluble fibers line at our facility in Slovakia. This EUR 25 million investment will ensure we have the capacity to meet growing demand for dietary fiber. Bringing all this together with the transformation into a fully focused specialty business now complete, we are well positioned to capture the growth opportunities ahead, both organic and inorganic.

Our strategy to increase our solution-based business with customers is working well. And our innovation pipeline continues to launch new products into the market that directly meet consumers' desire for healthier food and drink. We are adding new capacity to meet future demand and we continue to strengthen our capabilities in key areas such as sensory applications and open innovation.

We also continue to actively pursue value-accretive acquisitions to expand and strengthen our portfolio and to seek partnerships which bring us new products and technology. Today, Tate & Lyle is a business with a clear strategy focused on growth, and that is what we intend to deliver.

Turning to the outlook. In the last quarter of our 2024 financial year we saw average daily volumes accelerate, and we expect this improvement to continue into the 2025 financial year. This is based on 3 main factors: firstly, our approach to last year was to focus on revenue and margin ahead of volume and the contracts we have put in place for the 2024 calendar year position us well to grow from this new base; secondly, customer destocking has come to an end; and thirdly, consumer confidence is beginning to improve, albeit remaining somewhat fragile.

In light of this, we expect good volume growth in the 2025 financial year accelerating as the year progresses. Moving on to revenue. Following a period of input cost inflation, we are now seeing input cost deflation. As a result, revenue was lower in the second half of the 2024 financial year, reflecting the pass-through of lower costs. And this is expected to continue in the first half of the 2025 financial year.

Therefore, for the year ending the 31st of March 2025, we expect to deliver in constant currency revenues slightly lower than the prior year and EBITDA growth of between 4% and 7%. Following the completion of the sale of Primient, we will no longer consolidate its profits.

In summary then, we have demonstrated considerable agility to successfully navigate a challenging external environment and soft consumer demand. Once again, we have delivered what we said we would do with profit in line with our guidance and excellent cash generation.

The sale of Primient completes our transformation into a fully focused specialty Food & Beverage Solutions business and we intend to return the net cash proceeds from this sale to shareholders via an on-market share buyback program. Our solution strategy continues to work well and through our sustainable agriculture programs and our commitment to deliver larger, faster emission reductions on a 1.5-degree centigrade trajectory, we are taking a leadership position on sustainability.

Tate & Lyle is positioned right at the center of the future of food, focused on creating solutions that meet growing consumer demand for healthier, tastier and more sustainable food and drink. We are operating in exciting segments of the market, which have strong growth potential. We are a business fueled by science obsessed with customer collaboration and with a strong desire to make a positive impact on the world. The future ahead is exciting.

As always, I would like to finish by thanking everyone at Tate & Lyle for their hard work in delivering these results and for living our purpose with great passion and belief. For their support. I am very grateful.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's full year results presentation. We are now into the live Q&A. As I said in the prerecording, we delivered robust performance in the year with strong profit growth and cash generation and significant strategic progress, while successfully navigating a challenging external environment.

Following the sale of the remaining stake in Primient, Tate & Lyle is now a fully focused specialty business creating solutions that meet growing consumer demand for healthier, tastier and more sustainable food and drink. At the completion of the transaction, we will return the net proceeds to shareholders through a share buyback program.

Question-and-Answer Session

A - Nick Hampton

Turning now to your questions. The first question comes from Damian McNeela at Deutsche Numis.

Damian McNeela

Just two for me, please. Just on the EBITDA growth for this year. Can you just sort of talk about the considerations around volume expectations that is being incorporated into that? And then on the longer-term sort of EBITDA growth ambitions. Do you still think you can hit that sort of 7% to 9% over the 5-year time frame that you set last year?

And then the second question is just on the volume performance. I think you've talked about an improving volume performance so far, well, in Q4 and then a bit into this year. Can you just give any more color on whether there are any sort of particular categories or channels which are seeing the growth and whether there any laggards that you would expect to recover as we go through the year, please?

Nick Hampton

Sure. Both very good questions, Damian. Let me take the first one and then maybe Dawn can add some more color on the volumes. So as we thought about guidance for this year, I'd say a few things. Firstly, we're clearly seeing positive signs of recovery in the market. And we saw that in the last quarter of the last financial year. And as we built our plan for this year, we were really looking to balance a few things. The first is signs of recovery, both with customers and with consumers. So with customers, we're seeing an entity stocking, we're seeing some more positive views of the future, and we're seeing increased engagement on innovation. That's all good. And a view that things are going to recover through this year as consumer confidence improves because of the improving economic environment in general around the world. So we're balancing off a view of seeing improved volume performance because of the fundamentals in the market.

On top of that, a positive contracting round. Alongside that, we're trying to continue to make sure we invest in the future growth of the business. We've been very, very consistent through the last 3 or 4 years despite all the economic volatility, investing in innovation, investing in solution selling, investing in capacity, investing in in-market capability to serve customers. And you saw that again last year. So we will continue to invest. And the range of our guidance reflects the fact that we want to see how volume improves through the year. It was still early in the year. So that's the first part of your question.

The second part is absolutely we believe we can hit our medium-term guidance. If you look at the last 3 years, we delivered double-digit revenue and EBITDA performance, which underpins that confidence. We're just coming into this year, we're trying to balance off an improving economic environment with continuing to invest for the future so that we can successfully continue to deliver what we've done in the last 3 years. So Dawn, I don't know whether you want to add something on the volume color?

Dawn Allen

Well, I think that maybe a couple of things just to build on the EBITDA. So we've delivered 10% EBITDA growth over the last 3 years. So if you add in the -- if you add in our outlook for this year, we'll still be towards the top of our long-term range. So I think that's a very strong performance. I think in terms of the volume, as Nick talked about, we are seeing small pockets of volume growth. Clearly, it's different across the different geographies and different categories around the world. So stronger performance starting to come through in beverages, particularly in places like nonalcoholic beverages as well as dairy.

And I think particularly in China and in the U.S., consumer confidence is still -- we're still looking and waiting for that to improve. But as we talked about, we expect volume performance, and Nick talked about it. We expect that to continue to improve throughout the year and accelerate as we move through.

Nick Hampton

So our next question is from Alex Sloane at Barclays.

Alex Sloane

The first one, just in terms of the price resets for 2024 reflecting, in part, lower input costs. I think the statement still refers to some competition in FBS in Latin America and Europe. Obviously, you talked about that earlier last year. Have you seen any easing on this front with the new reset prices? That would be the first question.

And the second one, just going back to the question on volume. I think you had said in quarter 3, maybe there was a 3-point impact from destocking into the year-end, which you expect it to reverse in the first quarter. If I look at the first quarter -- sorry, in the fourth quarter, in the calendar first quarter, if I look at the volumes in quarter 4, it looks like maybe excluding that phasing benefit, they were still slightly negative. So I just wondered, is there any sort of worsening in the trends as you exited the quarter? And just be interested in terms of what you've already seen in April and May on this front, presumably, values are improving to give you the confidence in the full year outlook.

Nick Hampton

So maybe I'll take the first question -- the second question first, and I'll come back to the pricing point. So yes, we saw a sequential improvement in volume as we went into the fourth quarter. I'd say if you take into -- the sort of residual impact of destocking as we entered the last quarter of our financial year, we clearly saw an improvement in volume run rates. And as we come into the first part of this financial year, we're starting to see that continue as well. So we're definitely seeing some positive momentum that is both about exiting the destocking. It's also about exiting the period of when we were exiting low-margin business, and it reflects the positive signs we saw in the contract round along the market evolution that we talked about earlier. So we're definitely seeing improvement as we come into the first quarter of this year. So that's all very consistent actually with what we said in our Q3 statement.

That's all that's all good. In terms of the pricing reset, it varies by geography, clearly. We're probably seeing net-net a slight easing rather than an acceleration of the trends that you mentioned. But they're clearly still there in pockets of the business, and we need to make sure we balance the price, price revenue margin to reflect the relative competitive dynamics across the world. So hopefully, that gives you a broad sense, Alex, if what we're seeing on your 2 questions.

And our next question comes from Karel Zoete of Kepler Cheuvreux.

Karel Zoete

I've got two questions. The first one is on mix, mix improvements in the second half of the year. It seems that has slowed quite a bit. Part of it anticipated. But if you can speak a bit about the mix trends during the second half of the year.

And the other thing is looking at the cost situation, a very good savings momentum. In general, I think the outlook for cost of goods sold, but also other cost lines is more favorable than 12 months ago. So if you can touch upon that. And obviously, that also comes back to the EBITDA guidance as -- yes. It seems there is good savings momentum in the business. Volumes will recover. So yes, much appreciated.

Nick Hampton

So why don't I take the second question and then Dawn can maybe pick up on the mix point. So as you rightly say, Karel, I mean, 2 headlines, I would say, on cost. Incredibly pleased with the discipline the team is bringing to productivity. So $40 million plus productivity last year and that reflects a systemic program, but also some of the investments we're making in systems to allow us to get more efficient at predicting and planning the business and managing our end supply chain and serving our customers better. And that's reflected in the fact that we've called up our productivity guidance for the 5-year period, so from $100 million to $150 million. So the team doing a really good job there. Of course, we're also seeing the impact of inflation easing on input costs as well.

And that delivers that delivers some significant benefits this year, which as we've done -- as we did with inflationary pressures, we're passing through to customers in a responsible way. They were accepting of price increases when we were under inflationary pressures because of the value we bring to their products. And we were committed to being fair with them as inflation abated. So that's reflected in the pricing dynamics in the business as we've given guidance on revenue for this year.

Now when you add all of that up, though and you think about the shape of our EBITDA guidance, it really reflects the balance between being really disciplined on cost and productivity, but also continuing to invest in the long-term future of the business in innovation, in solution selling and customer intimacy. And as we add all of that up and look at the volume trajectory, that's where we end up with EBITDA guidance that sort of touches the end of our long-term range. So Dawn, do you want to pick up mix?

Dawn Allen

Yes. So Karel, if you remember, in the first half of last year, we did have very strong price mix. Obviously, at the half year, we had 13 points of price mix, roughly driven half inflation and half price mix. As we moved into quarter 3, we saw a similar trend, but it came off slightly. And then as we moved into quarter 4 and we set the new contracting round. And as we've talked about, we've set up that contracting round to drive volume growth. We also moved into a deflationary environment. So high single-digit deflation in quarter 4. We also selectively chose to invest with specific customers to drive long-term growth, but that is a small impact in the quarter. And as we look forward, we would expect to see high single-digit deflation particularly in the first half of the year. And as the volume momentum improves, we expect that to start to offset and more than offset as we move through the year, the selective investment that we've chosen to do with some customers.

Nick Hampton

Okay. So our next question is from Chris Pitcher at Redburn.

Chris Pitcher

A couple of questions for me on the sort of the momentum in innovations and solutions selling. You increased spend by a double-digit rate in the first half. It was up 5% for the full year. So it's kind of flat in the second half. Is that because you've got to sort of level that you think is sustainable? And could you give a bit more color on what your R&D spend is doing? And then I appreciate it's modest changes, but the percentage of new business wins went down a bit at the full year versus the first half. I'm just wondering what's going on in the background.

And last one, are you able to give us an absolute share of your business between what draft at the CMD between specification, technical sports and solutions? What is solutions actually the underlying business? I understand that the goal to get the new wins up to over 30%. But just I -- just clarify where we are on the base?

Nick Hampton

So let me try and take those 3 questions in turn. So I would think about the investment level in innovation, solution selling R&D, the 5% in the year. I would just think of it as a phasing impact half 1, half 2. It doesn't really reflect any slowdown. And it certainly doesn't reflect that we think we've reached the limit of where we want to be. So we're going to continue to commit to delivering at least 5% increase in spend on innovation and solution selling and customer intimacy through the next few years. So it's not a sign of any slowdown. It's just a phasing impact to half 1, half 2. In terms of kind of solution selling, as percentage of wins. Again, we're up 3 points in the year at 21%. That's the real message. And of course, it's going to vary a little bit quarter-on-quarter. And importantly, in that 21% nearly half of that came from new products. So our new products are really starting to have an impact on the business.

We said before that in broad terms, if you think about what -- how much of that business is actually in solution selling today, it's around about 20% in round terms. It's growing. And that's good news because that means there's plenty to go after in terms of improving that proportion as part of the business. And as we said before, that business is really valuable because it tends to be bigger pieces of business. It tends to be stickier because we're formulating into the critical part of the product. And it builds relationships, which leads to more business. So lots more to go after. We're going to continue to invest with intent to make sure we're managing the shape of the business for the future.

Chris Pitcher

I've got a follow-up but someone else is on the line looking to question. So I mean can I quickly ask, I mean CapEx is lower than the trend you said previously for this year. Is this a phasing effect? Or do you think you can drive growth at lower investments?

Nick Hampton

Dawn, do you want to take that?

Dawn Allen

Yes. So I would say -- I mean, CapEx at GBP 110 million is GBP 39 million up versus the previous year. So I'd say that we are continuing to invest in CapEx. And a good example of that is our new fibers line in BolerÃ¡z, that's just recently come on stream. I think if you think about -- in terms of capital markets, you're right, we did talk about an increasing CapEx spend going up to the region of GBP 130 million to GBP 150 million. If you think about what's happened over the last 12 months with low consumer confidence and destocking, there hasn't been as much of a need to invest in growth CapEx given that more than half of our CapEx is spent on growth investments. But when you look to next year, I mean, our forecast for CapEx for next year is in the range of GBP 100 million to GBP 120 million. So we are actually increasing to get to that long-term range that we talked about. But it's still a key growth driver and a key investment driver for us.

Nick Hampton

And Chris, I'd probably just add one point to that, which is -- we've been very focused in the last really 5 or 6 years to try and increase the quality of the business. And part of the benefits of that is you get more out of your existing assets, and you could be more efficient with your capital spend. That's reflected in where our return on capital is, it's just reflected in the progress in our EBITDA margins. And it's reflected in the strength of the balance sheet. So we've got plenty of firepower to invest, but we want to continue to invest to drive maximum returns. So should we move on? And our next question comes from Joan Lim from BNP Exane. Joan?

Joan Lim

Hello. Can you hear me?

Nick Hampton

Yes, we can.

Joan Lim

Perfect. Two questions from me, please. So your leverage is still strong even after the share buyback. Why did you not do a bigger share buyback?

Nick Hampton

So you said you had two questions, Joan?

Joan Lim

Yes. Shall I ask...

Nick Hampton

Yes. Give us a second one as well.

Joan Lim

Okay. And then your FY '25 guidance, it looks conservative to that 4% to 7%, given that you think volumes are going to improve and then prices pass through is there anything, I don't know, maybe for Q1 trends you've seen so far or is there scope for an upgrade to your guidance very -- maybe too early. But so if you could just help us understand a bit more into the drivers of this guidance?

Nick Hampton

So let me take the first question and then come back -- we'll come back to the second one. So look, on the buyback. We've announced we're going to return all the net proceeds from the sale of our final stake in Primient to shareholders. Do you think that's a responsible thing to do with the excess cash that we're bringing in as a result of that transaction. As we've demonstrated in the past, we will hand back cash to shareholders as appropriate. But our capital allocation policy is very clear. We want to maintain the scope to invest both inorganically and organically. And we want to make sure that we're paying an appropriate dividend to our shareholders. And on top of that, we'll continue to reevaluate returning capital. We're not saying that that's necessarily the last thing we're going to do, but it feels like a very sensible position to take as we speak today. On your point on conservatism on guidance, look, I think we've been very clear we're starting to see improvements in volume momentum.

We're starting to see economic recovery around the world and a sense of consumer confidence increasing but still fragile. And we want to continue to invest in the business. So that's why the 4% to 7% guidance feels appropriate today. We'll be in a much better position to give you a view on where we are on that when we get to a half year, and we'll see how economies develop and the business develops over the next 6 months. So for now, we think it's the right way to calibrate a business that, by the way, has delivered double-digit EBITDA growth over the last 3 years pretty consistently. And whether that's conservative or not, we'll have a better view on at the half year, frankly.

So I think we've come to end of our questions. So thank you to everyone for watching and for all of your questions. In summary, we delivered good performance in the year with strong profit growth in line with our guidance and excellent cash generation. The sale of our remaining stake in Primient completes the transformation of Tate & Lyle into a specialty solutions provider to the food and beverage industry. We will continue to progress our growth focus strategy and remain well placed to benefit from the long-term trends towards healthier, tastier and more sustainable food and drink.

The decision was made with the second vote of the Chairman of the Supervisory Board against the votes of the employee representatives, as Thyssenkrupp announced. The Executive Board had reached an agreement in principle with EPCG at the end of April.

The EPCG holding company is owned by the Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky. The strategic partnership will primarily focus on energy supplies. Among other things, he owns all or part of the lignite companies Mibrag and Leag in eastern Germany, which want to generate more climate-neutral electricity from renewable energies in future. Slovakia's largest electricity producer, Slovenske elektrarny, is also part of his conglomerate. Kretinsky is also the largest shareholder in the wholesaler Metro. The EPCG share is to be increased to 50 percent in the future and the steel division is to become independent.

The Thyssenkrupp steel division is Germany's largest steel company. Around 27,000 people work there, 13,000 of them in Duisburg alone. Production capacities in Duisburg are to be significantly reduced against the backdrop of the weak economy and high energy costs, which will entail job losses. However, details are still open.

IG Metall: Risks of the sale are completely unclear

IG Metall expressed its dismay at the Supervisory Board's decision. The risks arising from the sale are completely unclear, explained the Second Chairman of IG Metall, JÃ¼rgen Kerner. He is also Deputy Chairman of the Supervisory Board of Thyssenkrupp AG. ""The Steel Executive Board is currently working on a restructuring concept that will probably result in the loss of thousands of jobs."" Billions would be due for the restructuring. ""Thyssenkrupp AG is abdicating its responsibility for its employees even before the plan for the steel division is even available.""

The employee side expressly welcomes EPCG's willingness to get involved in steel, Kerner continued. ""We also understand that Mr. Kretinsky would like to gain insight into the development of the new plan."" However, neither a hasty approach nor an immediate 20 percent stake is necessary. ""What is needed now is prudence and clarity."" Instead, there is wild actionism to send the steel division into independence. ""This will meet with our fierce resistance,"" he continued.

Thyssenkrupp: Strategic partnership is an important step

Thyssenkrupp, on the other hand, expressed confidence. ""The entry of EPCG combines the leading materials know-how of Thyssenkrupp Steel Europe with the energy expertise of EPCG,"" it said. The transaction is expected to be completed before the end of the current financial year. ""The strategic partnership with EPCG is an important step towards ensuring resilient, cost-efficient and climate-friendly steel production at Thyssenkrupp Steel - and thus also a significant contribution to safeguarding the steel industry in Germany,"" the company added.

Prior to the meeting, several thousand employees had demonstrated at midday for more say and transparency in important company decisions. IG Metall criticized the fact that too little was known about the planned acquisition of EPCG for the Supervisory Board to be able to approve it. ""A restructuring of Thyssenkrupp AG against the people will not succeed,"" said Tekin Nasikkol, Chairman of the Group Works Council. There must be an end to ""the course against co-determination"".

LÃ³pez: No more redundancies for operational reasons

Group CEO Miguel LÃ³pez also spoke at the rally. ""We want to create socially acceptable solutions in constructive cooperation with the employee representatives,"" said LÃ³pez. ""There will continue to be no compulsory redundancies. But we must act to ensure that steel from Duisburg continues to have a future."" There were numerous heckles during LÃ³pez's speech./tob/DP/he",marketscreener.com,news,Market Screener,,0.223529411764706,454187448,4,,

This week, I'm going to look at what the Georgian government is doing, with its numerous foreign partners, to bring Georgia's buildings in line with Western aspirations to go green and mitigate our negative impact on the environment.

What is Energy Efficiency?

Energy efficiency (EE) refers to the efficient use of resources so as to reduce our energy bills and operating costs, putting a decreased strain on energy infrastructure and lowering investment needs for new supply. It also refers to improving our energy security by reducing our reliance on imported or scarce energy resources, leading to a cleaner and healthier environment, lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and lessening our environmental impact. What's more, the use of clean energy and innovative technologies ultimately leads to more public transport use over cars, more employment opportunities, and renovated and energy efficient buildings offering us healthier and more cost effective living and working spaces.

The drivers of energy efficiency and renewable energy source reforms in Georgia

There are five main drivers behind Georgia's moves to unite with the global community against climate change and energy inefficiency.

Georgia's first green driver was the EU-Georgia Association Agreement, signed in 2014 and entering into force in 2016, through which, among other things, Georgia committed to gradually aligning its energy legislation and policies with the EU:

* Electricity and gas market liberalization

* Promotion of renewable energy and energy efficiency

* Establishment of independent energy regulatory authorities

* Compliance with EU energy efficiency and environmental standards

* Cooperation in the area of energy security and diversification of energy sources

* Implementation and Monitoring

Next came the Energy Community, which was established in 2005 to extend the EU's internal energy market to Southeast Europe and beyond. Georgia became a member in 2017, and since has sought the Energy Community's help, through exchanges of best practice, to create a single regulatory framework for the energy sector, monitored by the Energy Community Secretariat.

The famed and rather ambitious Paris Agreement, a global climate change accord adopted in 2015, was ratified by Georgia in 2017. Overall, the Paris Agreement aims for GHG emissions reduction by 2030 (compared to 1990) by 35% (47% from 2025) and by 50%-57% in cases of international support.

After this came the EU's even more ambitious and far-reaching introduction of the European Green Deal, adopted in 2019, and referred to as a ""man on the moon moment"" by the European Commission's President, Ursula von der Leyen. The Green Deal's goal is to have a ""global and just transition"" that seeks global net-zero GHG emissions by 2050, economic growth decoupled from resource use, the development of energy efficiency and renewable energy sources, the development of sustainable and energy efficient buildings and a sustainable transport systems, the development of circular economies, the protection of biodiversity, sustainable agriculture and food systems (""from farm to fork""), zero pollution (water, air, soil), development of green finance, global digitalization, and the promotion of research and innovation. It also promises that no person and no place will be left behind.

Georgia also subscribes to the UN's Sustainable Development Goals. Of interest here is SDG Number 7, which seeks to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all, universal access to energy for all, access to electricity and clean cooking fuels and technologies for all, an increase in the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix, and an improvement in energy efficiency across different sectors, among them buildings, industry, and transportation. With this comes investment in and upgrading of energy infrastructure and clean energy technology.

It is well recognized, not least by the Government of Georgia, that achieving SDG 7 is crucial for supporting the country's economic and social development, improving human well-being, and addressing climate change. It is closely linked to other Sustainable Development Goals, among them SDG 1 (No Poverty), SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being), and SDG 13 (Climate Action).

Georgia's Energy Efficiency: Buildings and Businesses

""Georgia has recently enacted regulations to boost energy efficiency in buildings, particularly targeting new constructions,"" Zviad Kharebava, Director of Infrastructure and Environment at PMCG, tells GEORGIA TODAY. ""Regulations set requirements for EE parameters and cover building insulation, heating, cooling, ventilation, lightings systems, etc. However, challenges persist in older privately owned buildings in cities like Tbilisi, where implementing energy-saving measures is difficult due to aging infrastructure. Efforts to innovate and improve energy efficiency in public buildings are gradually gaining traction, in public schools, kindergartens,and so on.""

""We are looking to develop the Net-Zero Consumption Buildings Strategy, which requires that all new buildings should be developed according to the technical requirements of the Law on Energy Performance of Buildings, which were introduced in 2020, though the technical annexes are still in the process of being adopted,"" Giorgi Mukhigulishvili, Researcher in Energy and Climate Change Studies, tells us. ""Net Zero buildings should decrease energy consumption via energy efficiency measures, but also have renewal energy integrated within them. In reality, it's mainly related to future buildings,"" he says.

He also gives us some positive news in that 50% of Georgian municipalities have so far signed the Covenant of Mayors (32 of the 64 municipalities in the country). ""This requires directly that municipalities should save energy, increase the share of renewables in their energy consumption, and also decrease GHG emissions on their territories - public buildings and residential. They do so through donors providing technical and professional support to develop and implement strategies, and through twinning with cities abroad so as to share best practices,"" he says.

As for the private sector, we are told that the state offers incentives to construction companies to go green.

""For example, the National Bank of Georgia developed sustainable taxonomy for the financing sector,"" Mukhigulishvili tells us. ""When a company decides to develop a green business, including energy efficient buildings, they will be provided with low interest loans - this encompasses both from-scratch construction and renovation of existing infrastructure. This Green Taxonomy has 11 sub-topics, including the energy performance of buildings, energy efficiency in buildings, general energy efficiency, for example in agriculture, industry and transport etc., and one of the key requirements is that it should be in line with the energy efficiency law and the performance of buildings law, as well as their technical annexes. If the businesses meet these requirements, they will be eligible for these low interest loans and support mechanisms.""

Mukhigulishvili notes that the donor's role is vital here - the World Bank, USAID, UNDP and GIZ and others are very much involved in the process, he tells us, supporting businesses and the state in developing the above measures.

However, Georgia as yet lacks the necessary qualified and experienced auditors to check the meeting of these standards in the process of construction and renovation.

""We lack qualified professionals,"" Mukhigulishvili says. ""We do have a number of energy auditors for residential buildings, but we don't have energy auditors for large-scale industrial businesses.""

He highlights that to overcome the clear challenge, the government has asked for the development of vocational education programs to grow and support energy auditors, certifiers, evaluators and other necessary specialists.

""And even more can be done,"" Mukhigulishvili states. ""The money is there. A key problem, which the ministry recognizes, is that we need a sustainable system to support energy efficiency and renewables development: In particular, we need to develop an independent entity to implement all the technical annexes, laws and so on. The ministry is responsible for the policy development, not the implementation. In Slovakia, for example, there is a specific energy efficiency agency, under the Ministry of Economy, which monitors and implements these measures. Georgia needs such bodies and coordination.""

The World Bank Green Report

Buildings are responsible for around 40% of energy consumption and 36% of CO2 emissions in the EU, and, while of course the numbers for Georgia will be different, they aren't that far off: Mukhigulishvili tells us that Georgia's residential sector consumes 30% of all energy consumption and the commercial sector 11%.

""In 2021, when the electricity price increased for the commercial sector in Georgia, we saw energy efficiency measures being applied. Last year, the World Bank released a study 'Greening Firms in Georgia,' the first of its kind in Georgia,"" Mukhigulishvili says. ""The report explores key challenges and opportunities for Georgia's businesses to accelerate their contribution to the country's green transition, through efficiency and reduction in emissions. GHG emissions per capita in Georgia are still below the EU average, but are growing faster than those in the EU, which poses a risk for achieving the Paris Agreement's Nationally Determined Contributions [NDCs] and increasing the competitiveness of the Georgian economy.""

The World Bank report highlights that Georgian firms typically use energy-inefficient methods, and have increased their energy use in recent years. This, the report notes, will affect their competitiveness ""as energy prices increase, the demand from consumers changes to products with greener footprints, and as new carbon trade measures are introduced in the EU and other large markets.""

""Greening the private sector is therefore a source of competitive advantage that can facilitate access to global value chains and make the economy more resilient to climate shocks and geopolitical tensions in upcoming years. If no actions are taken, industry emissions are on a path to increase by 90 percent between 2015 and 2030,"" the report highlights.

""Many developed and developing countries are decoupling economic growth from GHG emissions. In Georgia, emissions are growing not only due to GDP growth but also due to the reliance on outdated technologies, poor management and organization, inefficient energy use, and weak incentives to go green because of the institutional framework and relatively low energy prices,"" it adds.

Yet, the World Bank report suggests that it's not too late to turn things around, noting that, while ""there is ample room for cost-effective improvements in energy efficiency in all sectors,"" since 2017, greener and more energy efficient firms, particularly new businesses and startups, have been expanding their market shares, and ""even modest increases in energy efficiency among inefficient firms could reduce aggregate energy expenses and carbon emissions by 50 percent, while increasing firms' profitability due to savings in energy costs.""

It is widely recognized that policy and private capital mobilization are key factors for positive change. Indeed, the World Bank report found that in Georgia, 8 out of 10 inefficient firms ""require upgrading or expanding their fixed assets to reach the median level of efficiency,"" yet ""2 out of 10 could improve their efficiency without additional capital investments and might require investments in training or consulting to improve their organization and increase their efficiency.""

Also key is reliability in supply. Both Georgian business-owners and home-owners experience frequent power outages that, ""combined with an underdeveloped framework for renewables,"" sees more people turning to the quick and easy option of fuel generators rather than investing in the better long-term alternative of cleaner renewables.

The report notes that ""relatively low electricity and gas prices discourage the adoption of clean technologies and a more efficient use of energy in production. Further, despite some progress, the institutional setting and regulatory framework do not promote a more responsible approach to the environmental impact of production,"" and recommends that ""in addition to structural reforms, improving energy efficiency requires firm- and sector-specific interventions that target three set of issues: (i) information and awareness, (ii) skills of managers and workers, and (iii) access to finance.""

Georgia's Promise

Georgia's National Climate Change Strategy 2030 and the Paris Agreement's Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), outline the concrete actions the country plans to take.

In 2017, it was noted that Georgia's share in global emissions was 0.04%, of which energy made up 60% and waste 9%. In its updated NDCs, Georgia has committed to unconditionally reducing its GHG emissions to 35% below its 1990 baseline level (an approximately 16% per capita reduction) by 2030, in doing so reiterating its strong commitment to the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement, through which world leaders agreed to take action to limit the overall temperature rise to well below 2 degrees Celsius, aiming to keep at a safe threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius.

Georgia's national mitigation targets today also see the country aiming to develop low-carbon approaches in the building sector, including with regard public and tourist buildings, and to promote climate-friendly, energy-efficient technologies and services.

Georgia's strategy also supports the development of low-carbon approaches in the agricultural sector by promoting climate-smart agriculture and agro-tourism, and the development of low-carbon approaches in the waste sector. GHG emissions in the power generation and transmission sector are expected to be lowered by 15%, and a 5% cap is to be put on emissions in the industrial sector, implemented by encouraging innovative technologies and services tailored to climate goals. Further, Georgia plans to increase the carbon absorption capacity of the forestry sector by 10% by 2030 compared to the level recorded in 2015.

""The 2030 - 2050 deadlines are feasible goals for us, but only if we stay on and speed up our European integration track,"" Mukhigulishvili opines.

In terms of making Georgia's buildings more energy efficient, future steps include raising energy efficiency standards for new buildings, promoting the use of energy-efficient construction materials, and integrating renewable energy sources like rooftop solar panels.

""Georgia's commitment to aligning its energy efficiency efforts with EU standards is evident, reflecting its broader association agreement with the European Union,"" says PMCG's Zviad Kharebava. ""By harmonizing legislation with EU directives like the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD), Georgia aims to ensure consistency in energy efficiency practices and foster sustainable development.""

In conclusion, while progress has been made, broader efforts encompassing both residential and industrial sectors are crucial for achieving significant and sustainable improvements in energy efficiency nationwide.

Key components of Georgia's new climate pledge include:

* Unconditionally limiting its total GHGs by 35% below the 1990 level by 2030 and potentially increasing this commitment (with sufficient international support) to 50 to 57%.

* Continuing to record GHGs not regulated by the Montreal Protocol in its National GHG Inventory.

* Setting out feasible targets for limiting emissions in seven sectors (transport, buildings, energy generation and transmission, agriculture, industry, waste and forestry).

The organisation said that despite Swiss progress on solar power last year, it was not enough to close the gap with other countries.

In 2023, Switzerland thus ranks 22nd in a European comparison, just ahead of Malta, Romania, the Czech Republic, Slovenia, Slovakia and Latvia, SES said in a statement on Thursday.

Every year, the organisation analyses the per capita production of solar and wind-generated electricity in Switzerland and the 27 European Union (EU) member states.

Top-ranked countries Denmark and Sweden produce six to seven times more solar and wind-generated electricity per capita than Switzerland. And when compared with the eight countries around it, Switzerland finds itself in the penultimate spot.

Just 9% of the electricity consumed in Switzerland is generated by solar panels and wind turbines in Switzerland. In Denmark, the figure is over 70%.

In wind power, the Netherlands is now in the European lead, producing more than twice as much solar energy per capita as Switzerland. Germany is also ahead of Switzerland in terms of solar electricity production.

On June 9, the Swiss electorate will vote on the so-called electricity law, which proposes binding targets and an investment-friendly framework to drive the development of renewable energies. The SES is campaigning in favour of a yes vote.

""In challenging market conditions, it's been another year of robust financial performance and strategic progress, with strong profit growth and productivity delivery, excellent cash generation, and further progress to transform the business.

The actions taken over the last six years have created a higher quality and more resilient business, with the agility to navigate the challenging economic environment and softer consumer demand we saw last year. While managing these short-term market dynamics, we also continued to set up the business for long-term growth by increasing investment in technology, innovation, solution selling and new capacity, and by intentionally moving away from low margin business. I am particularly pleased by our progress building our solutions business with customers, a core element of our strategy, with solutions new business wins continuing to grow.

The separate announcement we made today of the sale of our remaining stake in Primient represents an important milestone for our business. With this sale, the transformation of Tate & Lyle into a fully-focused speciality food and beverage solutions business is complete. We are now well-positioned to capture the significant growth opportunities ahead as we look to provide our customers with the solutions they need to meet growing consumer demand for healthier, tastier and more sustainable food and drink.

Our robust balance sheet, strong cash generation and the proceeds from the sale of Primient underpin our confidence to enhance shareholder returns through the share buyback programme, whilst retaining the flexibility to pursue both organic and inorganic growth opportunities. We are excited by Tate & Lyle's future.""

We have navigated the unprecedented cycle of inflation and volatile consumer demand well, delivering a compound average growth rate of revenue of 11% and adjusted EBITDA of 10% for the three years ended 31 March 2024.

Over the last year, we prioritised revenue and margin, ahead of volume growth. Looking ahead, we expect to grow from this new base and, with the end of customer destocking and consumer confidence gradually improving, we expect good volume growth in the 2025 financial year, accelerating as the year progresses.

Following a period of exceptional input cost inflation, we are now seeing input cost deflation and, as a result, revenue was lower in the second half of the 2024 financial year reflecting the pass through of lower costs. This is expected to continue in the first half of the 2025 financial year.

Therefore, for the year ending 31 March 2025, we expect to deliver in constant currency:

Following completion of the sale of Primient, we will no longer consolidate its profits.

Over the last six years, Tate & Lyle has been executing a major strategic transformation to become a growth-focused speciality food and beverage solutions business. This transformation has included a much sharper focus on customers and categories, increased investments in innovation and solution selling capabilities, and significantly strengthening our sweetening, mouthfeel and fortification platforms through new product development and acquisitions.

A critical step in this transformation journey was the sale, in April 2022, of a controlling interest in Primient, our primary products business in North America and Latin America to KPS Capital Partners, LP (KPS).

Today, we separately announced that we have reached an agreement to sell our remaining 49.7% interest in Primient to KPS. Under the agreement, Tate & Lyle will receive US$350 million (c.Â£279 million). These proceeds will be payable in cash at completion which is anticipated by the end of July 2024. The transaction values Tate & Lyle's 49.7% stake in Primient at 6.5x EV/EBITDA, ahead of the valuation of Primient on the sale of the initial controlling stake, completed on 1 April 2022.

The sale completes the staged exit from Primient well ahead of expiry of the original lock-up period of eight years which lasts until 1 April 2030. The robust long-term agreements between Tate & Lyle and Primient put in place in April 2022 to ensure supply security, with a remaining life of around 18 years, will continue to operate. Net cash proceeds, after tax, are expected to be around US$270 million (c.Â£215 million).

Total cash proceeds from the full exit of Primient including dividends received since the sale of the initial holding in April 2022 exceeds US$1.5 billion.

Share buyback programme and capital allocation

Consistent with the Board's capital allocation policy, the Board intends to return the net cash proceeds received from the Primient sale to shareholders by way of an on-market share buyback programme. The buyback is expected to commence on completion of the Primient sale and further details will be announced in due course.

The Board's priority is to continue its disciplined deployment of capital and to maintain Tate & Lyle's financial strength. Looking forward, we will look to retain the flexibility in the balance sheet to drive value accretive organic and inorganic growth, with long-term efficient leverage sitting in the range of 1.0x to 2.5x net debt to EBITDA.

Fully-focused speciality food and beverage solutions business

Following the sale of Primient, Tate & Lyle is a fully-focused, speciality food and beverage solutions business with a clear strategic focus and strong sense of purpose.

Â· Global leader in sweetening, mouthfeel and fortification, creating solutions for our customers to meet growing consumer trends for healthier food and drink.

Â· Science-driven business, with an established record of innovation and scientific expertise.

Â· Well-balanced and global business with a strong presence in developed markets and a platform for accelerated growth in the large markets of Asia, Middle East, Africa and Latin America.

Â· Strong balance sheet providing flexibility to invest for growth, and an experienced management team with a track record of delivery.

Over the last six years, Tate & Lyle has been re-positioned to be at the centre of the future of food, operating in segments of the market which are seeing significant growth. This supports our five-year financial ambition to 31 March 2028, to deliver:

Â· Improved organic return on capital employed by up to 50bps on average each year (2024: 40 bps improvement)

Â· US$100m of productivity savings (2024: US$41 million savings and ambition increased to US$150m).

As stated at our Capital Markets Event on 8 February 2023, revenue growth is on an underlying basis excluding the impact of abnormal inflation and deflation. We also have the potential to further accelerate growth through partnerships and M&A.

We continued to invest in progressing our strategy in line with our commitment to 'Science, Solutions, Society'.

Â· Investment in innovation and solution selling was 5% higher, with investments in new customer-facing labs, new technology and strengthening capabilities in areas such as sensory and open innovation.

Â· New Product revenue was up 13% on a like-for-like basis (i.e. no products are removed from disclosure due to age) with strong growth in the mouthfeel platform; revenue was modestly lower on a reported basis.

Â· We launched 9 New Products into the market including TASTEVA SOL Stevia Sweetener, a patent-protected breakthrough in stevia technology to help customers solve stevia solubility challenges.

Â· New automated lab established at our Customer Innovation and Collaboration Centre in Singapore with advanced technology to accelerate the development of mouthfeel solutions and increase our customers' speed-to-market.

Â· We added 61 patents to our patent portfolio and now have over 540 patents granted and over 220 pending.

Â· The value of solutions-based new business wins increased by 3ppts to 21% of revenue, with strong solutions performance in Asia, Middle East, Africa and Latin America.

Â· Innovation is a key driver of our solutions offering. 44% of revenue from our new business pipeline involved the formulation of one or more New Products.

Â· We opened a new Customer Innovation and Collaboration Centre in Jakarta, Indonesia, bringing our global network of Centres to seventeen.

Â· We invested â¬25 million to add new capacity for non-GMO PROMITOR Soluble Fibres in BolerÃ¡z, Slovakia. Production came on-line in May 2024.

Â· We significantly advanced our sustainability agenda:

- In the 2023 calendar year, from a 2019 base, our Scope 1 and 2 absolute greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions were 11% lower (2030 target: 30% reduction), and our Scope 3 absolute GHG emissions were 20% lower, exceeding our target of a 15% reduction by 2030 seven years ahead of schedule.

- In May 2024, we announced new targets to accelerate the reduction of our Scope 1 and 2 and Scope 3 GHG emissions. Our new targets to 2028, from a 2019 base, replace our existing 2030 targets and have been validated as science-based on a 1.5C trajectory by the Science Based Targets initiative.

- Our facility in Guarani, Brazil became our first site to be 100% powered by renewable energy, and our facilities in the Netherlands, UK and Italy are buying 100% of their electricity from renewable sources.

- We continued to support sustainable acres of corn equivalent to 100% of the corn we buy each year (367,000 acres in 2023), and to support intervention programmes with farmers in the US, for example to manage nitrogen levels in the soil to increase crop yields, improve soil health and minimise the impact on local watersheds.

- 90% of our waste was beneficially used mainly either as nutrients on local farms or for energy recovery.

Â· 45% of leadership and management roles (~500 positions) are held by women.

Â· Since 31 March 2020, our low- and no-calorie sweeteners and our fibres have removed 7.9 million tonnes of sugar from people's diets, equivalent to more than 31 trillion calories.

The Group delivered strong adjusted EBITDA growth. Revenue was 2% lower reflecting lower volume partially offset by good mix management and the recovery of inflation. Adjusted EBITDA was 7% higher with adjusted profit before tax 18% higher.

Food & Beverage Solutions performed well with revenue slightly lower and adjusted EBITDA 8% higher. The underlying performance of the Sucralose business remained steady, with adjusted EBITDA 4% lower. The optimisation of Primary Products Europe is continuing with losses significantly reduced.

Our focus in Food & Beverage Solutions was to prioritise revenue and margin, ahead of volume growth. This intentional re-positioning, together with softer consumer demand and customer de-stocking, combined to deliver lower volume. Revenue was 2% lower, reflecting the benefit of mix management and the recovery of net input cost inflation. A key driver of our growth-focused approach is our investment in innovation and solution selling. We made further progress in the year, with revenue from New Products up 13% on a like-for-like basis, and solutions as a percentage of our new business wins by value increasing by 3ppts to 21%.

For Primient, the adjusted share of joint venture profit was Â£35 million, 53% higher. Operating performance improved, supported by robust demand for sweetener products, strong customer contracting in 2023 and 2024 and improved operational performance, while increased interest rates drove finance charges higher. Tate & Lyle received US$74 million in cash dividends from Primient in the year.

Free cash flow was Â£49 million higher at Â£170 million, with an improvement in working capital of Â£112 million, benefiting from increased discipline in inventory management. While driving greater cash generation, we also continued to invest in long-term growth with capital expenditure increasing by Â£39 million to Â£110 million to deliver capacity expansions for Food & Beverage Solutions.

Our ambition is to increase the conversion of profit into cash to 75% in the five years to 31 March 2028. During the 2024 financial year, we exceeded that target delivering cash conversion of 85%, 23ppts higher. Cash generation remains a priority, and our focus now is to consistently exceed cash conversion of 75%. Net debt was Â£153 million, Â£85 million lower, with net debt to EBITDA at 0.5x, and liquidity of over Â£1.1 billion.

We have made an excellent start on our five-year ambition to deliver US$100 million of productivity savings by 31 March 2028. Productivity savings in the year were US$41 million, well ahead of our target at the start of the year of US$25 million savings. These savings came from areas such as operational efficiencies, supply chain and other cost savings. Given this strong progress, we have increased our productivity target and now expect to deliver savings of US$150 million by 31 March 2028.

2 To reflect the underlying drivers of revenue growth, the total percentages for volume and price mix have been adjusted by 4ppts to exclude the impact from our focus on mix management and margin expansion. Without this adjustment, the values for both volume and price mix would be 4ppts greater.

3 Comparative restated to exclude other M&A costs of Â£(2) million reflecting the revised definition of adjusted EBITDA, see page 33.

Revenue was 2% lower in constant currency at Â£1,359 million. Lower volume from softness in consumer demand and customer destocking led to 6ppts reduction in revenue. Price mix increased revenue by 4ppts, reflecting 1ppt from our focus on strategic mix management and solution selling, and 3ppts from the impact of net input cost inflation (the recovery of inflation in the three quarters to 31 December 2023, net of the pass-through of deflation in the quarter to 31 March 2024).

Looking at the three regions, all were impacted by soft consumer demand and customer destocking. Revenue growth in Europe reflected the pricing through of greater net input cost inflation.

Â· North America: Revenue was 3% lower. Cost of living pressures on consumers resulted in softer demand across our focus categories, partially offset by higher pricing. As we entered the fourth quarter, a reducing impact from customer destocking and lower food inflation, and new customer contracts, delivered improved volume momentum.

Â· Asia, Middle East, Africa and Latin America: Revenue was 3% lower. In Asia, revenue was lower reflecting pricing pressure and weaker demand for stabilisation solutions, mitigated by good growth in beverages, particularly in North Asia. Consumer demand in China remained soft. In Latin America, revenue declined driven by lower priced imports from outside the region, especially in Mexico. Excluding the impact of these imports, revenue was ahead of the prior year with strong growth in beverages and bakery. In Middle East and Africa, revenue was ahead of the prior year with strong demand for dairy solutions in North Africa.

Â· Europe: Revenue was slightly ahead of the prior year driven by three main factors. Firstly, we saw good demand across the dairy and infant nutrition categories, and for mouthfeel solutions generally. Secondly, we continued to execute our strategy to exit some low margin business, with revenue from distributors, in particular, lower. Finally, we saw increased competition from imports from outside the region.

The renewal of customer contracts for the 2024 calendar year is expected to deliver a sequential improvement in volume growth as the year progresses. Reflecting this, average daily volume accelerated in the final quarter. The new customer contracts include the pass through of input cost deflation. As a result, revenue was lower in the second half of the 2024 financial year.

Adjusted EBITDA was up 8% in constant currency at Â£281 million benefiting from mix management and the pricing through of net input cost inflation. This, together with the benefit from productivity and strong cost control, saw adjusted EBITDA margins expand by 180bps in constant currency. The effect of currency translation decreased adjusted EBITDA by Â£12 million.

Revenue from New Products was 4% lower. Certain ingredients reached post-launch maturity in the year and were removed from the definition of New Products. On a like-for-like basis, which assumes the same ingredients are included in New Products revenues in both the current and comparative periods, New Products revenue was 13% higher. On this like-for-like basis, we saw strong growth in the mouthfeel platform, protein delivered a near-doubling of revenue and Quantum Hi-Tech helped to accelerate growth in fortification.

Investment in innovation and customer-facing solution selling capabilities including sensory and open innovation was 5% higher. Targeted programmes to develop new ways of working with customers and build stronger solutions-based partnerships helped increase solutions new business wins by value to 21% (2023 - 18%). We have set an ambition to increase this to 32% over the five years to 31 March 2028.

Underlying customer demand for sucralose remained steady. Revenue was broadly in line with the prior year as volume remained consistent and customer mix led to modestly lower pricing. Adjusted EBITDA declined modestly reflecting cost inflation across a range of inputs. Currency translation decreased adjusted EBITDA by Â£3 million.

We continue to optimise the financial performance of Primary Products Europe through the transition of capacity to speciality ingredients. Revenue was lower by 12%, mainly reflecting the reduced volume of co-products. Adjusted EBITDA losses reduced significantly, benefiting from lower input costs.

1 Comparative restated to exclude other M&A costs of Â£(2) million reflecting the revised definition of adjusted EBITDA, see page 33.

Net finance expense at Â£6 million was 66% lower in constant currency, mainly reflecting higher net income on the Group's cash balances. Because almost all of the Group's borrowings in the year were at fixed rates of interest, the Group was not exposed to significant changes in interest rates on its borrowings.

Net exceptional charges of Â£25 million were included in profit before tax, of which a charge of Â£1 million was included from the Group's share of exceptional items in the Primient joint venture. Of these costs, Â£21 million related to organisational improvements to the Food & Beverage Solutions business and activities to drive productivity savings. Exceptional cash outflows for the period totalled Â£27 million. (For more information see Note 5).

Adjusted share of profit of Primient joint venture

2 Reclassification adjustment: adjusted operating profit has been increased by Â£2 million and adjusted share of profit from its own joint ventures after tax reduced by the same amount.

3 The Group's share of the adjusted profit of Primient joint venture is based on profit after tax. Primient is a US partnership (so its partners rather than Primient itself are responsible for tax on its US income). Tax of Â£12 million (2023 - Â£6 million) has been deducted from profit before tax relating to tax on income earned by Primient's Brazilian subsidiary.

Adjusted operating profit was 47% higher in constant currency at Â£143 million reflecting robust demand for sweeteners, strong customer contracting in 2023 and 2024, and improved operational performance. The net finance expense increase reflected higher US interest rates. Statutory share of profit from the joint venture for the 2024 financial year was Â£25 million, mainly reflecting a Â£9 million charge for the amortisation of acquired intangibles and other fair value assets which was excluded from the adjusted share of profit.

Tate & Lyle received cash dividends from Primient of US$74 million in the year.

The adjusted effective tax rate for the year was 21.6% (2023 - 19.9%). The increase in the rate reflects more profit taxed in higher rate jurisdictions and the increase in the rate of UK corporation tax from 19% to 25%. Looking ahead, we expect the adjusted effective tax rate for the year ending 31 March 2025 to be in line with the rate for fiscal year 2024. The reported effective tax rate (on statutory earnings) for the year was 20.6% (2023 - 16.8%). The lower rate in the comparative year was due to higher tax deductions on exceptional items recorded by Primient.

Adjusted earnings per share for continuing operations at 55.5p were 18% higher (in constant currency). This increase reflects 16% higher profits after tax and benefit from a lower weighted number of shares of 2ppts, reflecting the share consolidation completed on 3 May 2022. Statutory diluted earnings per share for continuing operations increased significantly to 44.4p (2023 - 30.8p), reflecting mainly higher exceptional costs in, and therefore a lower share of profit from, joint ventures in the comparative period.

ROCE at 17.4% (2023 - 17.6%) was slightly lower reflecting the impact of the acquisition of Quantum Hi-Tech part way through the comparative period. ROCE increased by 40bps on an organic basis.

The Board is recommending a final dividend of 12.9p (2023 - 13.1p) per share. This brings the full year dividend to 19.1p (2023 - 18.5p), an increase of 3.2%. In February 2023, in our Capital Markets Event, we announced our policy of paying interim dividends at the level of one third of the previous year's full-year dividend, accordingly an interim dividend for the six months to 30 September 2023 was paid of 6.2p (30 September 2022 - 5.4p) per share. Subject to shareholder approval, the proposed final dividend will be due and payable on 2 August 2024 to all shareholders on the Register of Members on 21 June 2024. In addition to the cash dividend option, shareholders will continue to be offered a Dividend Reinvestment Plan alternative.

Free cash flow was Â£170 million (2023 - Â£121 million), an increase of Â£49 million. This reflected both higher profits and a strong focus on cash generation which delivered a Â£112 million improvement in net working capital mainly through improved inventory management discipline, with strong progress in initiatives to optimise inventory, across all of; raw materials, in-process inventory, and finished goods. Investments in infrastructure, capacity and technology drove capital expenditure to Â£110 million, Â£39 million higher in the year. Overall, cash conversion for the period improved by 23ppts to 85%.

We expect capital expenditure in the year ending 31 March 2025 to be in the Â£100 million to Â£120 million range.

Net debt at 31 March 2024 was Â£153 million, Â£85 million lower than at 31 March 2023. Strong free cash flow generation and dividends received from Primient of US$74 million (Â£59 million) were more than offset by outflows including the payment of dividends to shareholders of Â£76 million and payments in respect of share incentive schemes of Â£25 million. In April 2023, to reduce interest costs and in line with on-going balance sheet optimisation, the Group repaid a US private placement debt floating rate note of US$95 million ahead of its maturity using cash. On 30 October 2023, a US$25 million US private placement 3.83% fixed rate note was repaid on maturity using cash.

At 31 March 2024, the Group had access to Â£1.1 billion of available liquidity through readily available cash and cash equivalents and access to a committed, undrawn revolving credit facility of US$800 million (Â£633 million). Reported leverage at 31 March 2024 was 0.5 times net debt to EBITDA. On a covenant testing basis, the net debt to EBITDA ratio was 0.3 times, which was much lower than the covenant threshold of 3.5 times.

On 16 May 2024 the Group's committed, undrawn and sustainability-linked revolving credit facility of US$800 million (Â£633 million) was amended and re-stated. The maturity date was extended for five years to 16 May 2029, and includes two further one-year extension options, which are subject to lender credit approval.

1 Free cash conversion calculated as: free cash flow before capital expenditure divided by adjusted EBITDA

Some performance discussion and narrative in this announcement includes measures which are not defined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) such as IFRS. The Group believes this information, together with comparable GAAP measures, is useful to investors in providing a basis for measuring our operating performance, cash generation and financial strength. The Group uses these alternative performance measures for internal performance analysis and incentive compensation arrangements for employees. These measures are not defined terms and may therefore not be comparable with similarly-titled measures reported by other companies. Wherever appropriate and practical, reconciliations are provided to relevant GAAP measures.

Alternative performance measures are used for and refer to continuing operations only.

The Group uses constant currency percentages and movements, using constant exchange rates which exclude the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We calculate constant currency values by retranslating current year results at prior year exchange rates into British Pounds. The average and closing US dollar and Euro exchange rates used to translate reported results were as follows:

Items adjusted in alternative performance income statement measures (Adjustment items)

Several alternative performance measures are adjusted to exclude items due to their size, nature and / or frequency of occurrence.

1. Adjusted items excluded from earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (adjusted EBITDA) are: exceptional items (as they are material in amount; and are outside the normal course of business or relate to events which do not frequently recur), amortisation of acquired intangible assets, the unwind of fair value adjustments and other M&A costs.

2. Additional adjusted items excluded from adjusted profit after tax are: tax on the above items and tax items that themselves are exceptional as they meet these definitions. For tax items to be treated as exceptional, amounts must be material and their treatment as exceptional enable a better understanding of the Group's underlying financial performance. Included in adjusted profit after tax is the adjusted share of profit of Primient (the Group's non-controlling joint venture interest, where the results of Primient have been adjusted for items meeting the Group's definitions herein).

Adjusted revenue growth refers to the change in revenue for the period, in constant currency. This is analysed between the drivers of revenue growth attributable to:

1. Volume - this means, for the applicable period, the change in revenue in the period attributable to volume excluding those related to the re-positioning of the Food & Beverage Solutions business through a focus on mix management and margin expansion.

2. Price mix - this means, for the applicable period, the change in revenue in such period calculated as the sum of i) the change in revenue attributable to changes in prices during the period; and ii) the change in revenue attributable to the composition of revenue in the period, including the volume effect of the impact of the re-positioning of the Food & Beverage Solutions business through a focus on mix management and margin expansion.

In the narrative where acquisitions are referred to in explaining revenue growth, this means changes in revenue resulting from acquisitions.

Adjusted EBITDA is used as the Group's primary profit measure for internal performance analysis. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as follows:

1 Comparative restated to exclude other M&A costs of Â£(2) million reflecting the revised definition of adjusted EBITDA, see page 33.

Adjusted earnings per share (adjusted EPS) is calculated as the adjusted profit for continuing operations attributable to shareholders' equity divided by the diluted average number of ordinary shares. In calculating adjusted profit attributable to shareholders' equity, net profit attributable to shareholders' equity is adjusted to eliminate the post-tax impact of all excluded adjustment items. Refer to Note 8 for reconciliation of net profit attributable to shareholders' equity to adjusted profit attributable to shareholders equity.

Change in adjusted earnings per share is shown in constant currency.

The Group also presents an alternative cash flow measure, 'free cash flow' which is defined as cash generated from operating activities after net capital expenditure, net interest and tax payments, and excludes the impact of exceptional items, tax payments on behalf of Primient and the impact of acquisitions and disposals.

The reconciliation of net cash flow from operating activities to free cash flow is as follows:

1 Comparative restated to exclude other M&A costs of Â£(2) million reflecting the revised definition of adjusted EBITDA, see page 33.

2 Includes exceptional cash flow of Â£27 million (2023 - Â£59 million) and tax paid in relation to gain on disposal of Primient of Â£12 million (2023 - Â£42 million)

1 Comparative restated to exclude other M&A costs of Â£(2) million reflecting the revised definition of adjusted EBITDA, see page 33.

2 Includes net interest paid of Â£5 million (2023 - Â£14 million) and tax paid (excluding tax in relation to Primient) of Â£52 million (2023 - Â£14 million).

The Group uses three financial metrics as key performance measures to assess its financial strength. These are net debt, the net debt to EBITDA ratio and the return on capital employed ratio. For the purposes of KPI reporting, the Group uses a simplified calculation of these KPIs to make them more directly related to information in the Group's financial statements.

All ratios are calculated based on unrounded figures in Â£ million.

Net debt is a measure that provides valuable additional information on the summary presentation of the Group's net financial liabilities. Net debt is defined as the excess of borrowings and lease liabilities over cash and cash equivalents.

The components of the Group's net debt are as follows:

The net debt to EBITDA ratio shows how well a company can cover its debts if net debt and EBITDA are held constant.

1 Comparative restated to exclude other M&A costs of Â£(2) million reflecting the revised definition of adjusted EBITDA, see page 33.

Return on capital employed (ROCE) is a measure of the return generated on capital invested by the Group. The measure encourages compounding reinvestment within the business and discipline around acquisitions, as such it provides a guardrail for long-term value creation. ROCE is a component of the Group's five-year performance ambition to 31 March 2028 and is used in incentive compensation.

ROCE is calculated as underlying operating profit excluding exceptional items and M&A related costs, divided by the average invested operating capital (calculated as the average for each month of goodwill, intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, working capital, provisions and non-debt related derivatives). As such the average invested operating capital is derived from the management balance sheet and does not reconcile directly to the statutory balance sheet. All elements of average invested operating capital are calculated in accordance with IFRS.

1 Comparative restated to exclude other M&A costs of Â£(2) million reflecting the revised definition of adjusted EBITDA, see page 33.

The expected reduction in key interest rates from theÂ­

summer should also provide significant positive momentum here. Falling gas and electricity prices will boost consumer spending, while only a slow decline is forecast for key inflation. Industry is also expected to provide more positive impetus from the second half of the year. The experts at the German ifo Institute then anticipate an economic turnaround, which is forcast to lead to annual growth of 0.2%.

Significantly stronger economic growth is expected for Poland, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Romania in 2024. Poland should be able to increase its economic output by 3.1% as a result of political innovations and increased access to EU financing. The experts at the Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies forecast growth of 1.6% and 1.2% for Slovakia and the Czech Republic respectively. In Romania, growth of 3.0% is expected for 2024, not least as a result of the Next- GenerationEU budget. While investment activity in these countries is only recovering slowly, strong economic growth is being assisted by rising consumer demand in particular.

Turnaround in the construction industry

As a late-cycle industry, the construction sector has recently had to contend with the weak economic con- ditions. However, a stabilisation seems to be emerging since the start of 2024. In February, there were renewed growth trends in European construction volumes, which were supported by both civil engineering and building construction in equal measure.

In building construction, residential construction remained burdened by the high interest rate environ- ment. Although the demand for affordable housing remains high, property developers are hesitant to award contracts due to a lack of financing. PORR continues to see stable demand in industrial construction, driven not least by megatrends such as digitalisation and the technology sector. In public building construction, the healthcare sector in particular is ensuring a stable order intake alongside social housing.

Growth in civil engineering and infrastructure construction is continuing, whereby it remains a significant pillar for the construction industry as a whole. In the first two months of 2024, the volumes in European civil engineering volume recorded an average growth rate of 2.6%. The main driver of this growth is the energy transition underway across Europe, which is ensuring continuous demand in pipeline and power plant construction. The demand for sustainable mobility is equally strong, which is particularly evident in new and expansion projects in railway construction.",marketscreener.com,news,Market Screener,,0.5372549019607844,454136337,4,https://www.marketscreener.com/images/twitter_MS_fdblanc.png,

Without adequate air defenses to counter assaults and allow for repairs, though, the shortages could still worsen as need spikes in late summer and the bitter-cold winter.

The Russian airstrikes targeting the grid since March have meant blackouts have even returned to the capital, Kyiv, which hadn't experienced them since the first year of the war. Among the strikes were an April barrage that damaged Kyiv's largest thermal power plant and a massive attack on May 8 that targeted power generation and transmission facilities in several regions.

WATCH: How recent Russian attacks on power plants have ravaged Ukraine's energy system

In all, half of Ukraine's energy system was damaged, Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said.

Entire apartment blocks in the capital went dark. The city's military administration said at least 10 percent of consumers were disconnected.

For many, it is a taste of what might be in store if Ukraine doesn't find other electricity sources before winter.

Before dawn Wednesday, a Russian drone attack on Sumy plunged the northern Ukraine city into darkness. Some power was restored to the city of around a quarter-million people in the morning as crews rushed to repair the damage, local authorities said.

With no end in sight to the attacks on the power grid and without a way to adequately defend against them, there are no quick fixes to the electricity shortages, Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko explained. Ukraine is appealing to Western allies for more air defense systems and spare parts to fix its Soviet-era plants.

""With each attack we lose additional power generation, so it just goes minus, minus, minus,"" Halushchenko said Tuesday while standing outside a coal-fired plant in central Ukraine that was destroyed in an April 11 attack. Any efforts to repair the plant would be futile until the military can defend it from another attack.

""Should we repair (power stations) just for them (Russians) to renew strikes while we are unable to defend ourselves?"" the minister asked.

German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock's joined him on the plant visit, underscoring Ukraine's desperation to close the power gap as quickly as possible.

The first major test of the grid will come in July and August, when consumption due to summer heat can mirror levels in the sub-freezing winter months, the minister said.

By mid-May, Kyiv's residents began to feel the consequences of Russia's attacks. A cold snap drove up consumption, forcing Ukrenergo, the main transmission system operator, to introduce controlled blackouts throughout the country. Ukraine can't generate enough power to cover evening peaks, and the shortage is greater than the country's ability to import electricity from Poland, Slovakia and Romania.

The April 11 attack on the plant destroyed generators, transformers and turbines -- every necessary part to generate electricity, said Yevhen Harkavyi, the technical director of Centerenergo, which operates the plant.

Five missiles hit the facility that day, and workers were still clearing away rubble on Tuesday as snow-like tufts of poplar cotton fell through a hole in the roof.

The plan for winter is to restore power generation as much as possible, said Harkavyi. How that will happen isn't clear, he conceded: ""The situation is already too difficult.""

Ukraine is hoping to acquire parts from long-decommissioned German plants. Harkavyi said Ukrainian teams recently went to Germany to evaluate the equipment, which was taken offline because it doesn't meet European Union environmental standards. It remains to be seen how willing European allies will be to invest in Ukraine's coal-fueled energy sector given their own greener goals.

The teams are still evaluating how to get the equipment back to Ukraine, he said.

""This is the first question,"" he said.

""With each attack we lose additional power generation, so it just goes minus, minus, minus,"" Halushchenko said Tuesday while standing outside a coal-fired plant in central Ukraine that was destroyed in an April 11 attack. Any efforts to repair the plant would be futile until the military can defend it from another attack.

""Should we repair (power stations) just for them (Russians) to renew strikes while we are unable to defend ourselves?"" the minister asked.

German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock's joined him on the plant visit, underscoring Ukraine's desperation to close the power gap as quickly as possible.

The first major test of the grid will come in July and August, when consumption due to summer heat can mirror levels in the sub-freezing winter months, the minister said.

By mid-May, Kyiv's residents began to feel the consequences of Russia's attacks. A cold snap drove up consumption, forcing Ukrenergo, the main transmission system operator, to introduce controlled blackouts throughout the country. Ukraine can't generate enough power to cover evening peaks, and the shortage is greater than the country's ability to import electricity from Poland, Slovakia and Romania.

The April 11 attack on the plant destroyed generators, transformers and turbines -- every necessary part to generate electricity, said Yevhen Harkavyi, the technical director of Centerenergo, which operates the plant.

Five missiles hit the facility that day, and workers were still clearing away rubble on Tuesday as snow-like tufts of poplar cotton fell through a hole in the roof.

The plan for winter is to restore power generation as much as possible, said Harkavyi. How that will happen isn't clear, he conceded: ""The situation is already too difficult.""

Ukraine is hoping to acquire parts from long-decommissioned German plants. Harkavyi said Ukrainian teams recently went to Germany to evaluate the equipment, which was taken offline because it doesn't meet European Union environmental standards. It remains to be seen how willing European allies will be to invest in Ukraine's coal-fueled energy sector given their own greener goals.

The teams are still evaluating how to get the equipment back to Ukraine, he said.

Such claims are more akin to conspiracy theories, as they require falsifying data from the European platform, bribing Ukrainian officials, officials in neighboring EU countries, and all energy professionals involved in imports and exports.

Despite this, such theories are popular among some Ukrainians. OBOZ.UA has collected data on electricity exports and imports and publishes graphs that confirm the absence of commercial electricity exports.

Ukraine does not sell electricity in times of shortage

""No one exports electricity when there is a deficit in the system. We operate in a single European power system, and there are no export contracts. But there are technical flows, when we do not consume electricity and there is a surplus, it flows to the EU,"" explains Ivan Plachkov, chairman of the supervisory board of Kyivenergo.

A conspiracy theory is being spread among Ukrainians: that electricity is being sold to the EU when we are short of it ourselves. This fake is easy to refute, as all data on exports and imports are published on a special website, the European platform for collecting data on electricity production, transportation, and consumption.

However, those who believe in this conspiracy theory find confirmation even in the platform's data. Instead of the ""commercial exchange"" section (actually trade), they open the section of the site about physical flows (which cannot be eliminated as long as we are part of a single energy system) and claim that this is exports.

One such post on Facebook has more than 3 thousand shares. The author of the post took a picture of her computer screen, which shows the ""physical flow"" section, and stated that ""Ukraine is always selling electricity to Romania and Moldova."" Although this information is easy to refute, most of those who commented on her post seemed to believe it.

The author of the post shows a graph for May 13 and claims that on this day Ukraine allegedly sold electricity to Romania. However, if you open the graph of commercial exchange of electricity with Romania for this day, you will see that on the contrary, on May 13, Ukraine bought electricity from Romania between 00:00 and 07:00 and from 18:00 and 00:00.

Ukraine also bought electricity from Moldova on May 13, but did not sell it. You can check this information here. In the panel on the left, you can select a country and see data on exports and imports with Ukraine.

It is worth noting that the power system does not have the ability to accumulate current in large volumes. That is, if there is too much electricity today (more than Ukrainians consume), it cannot be ""saved"" for a rainy day. It is either necessary to reduce production (which is impossible now) or sell it abroad. To sharply reduce or increase production (when consumption is growing), energy is used from hydroelectric power plants and thermal power plants. It was these stations that Russia destroyed during its recent attacks on the energy sector.

Therefore, if electricity was sold in March, it could not have affected the deficit in May. Moreover, even within a single day, the Ukrainian energy system can have both a surplus (for example, in the afternoon, when solar generation is actively working and consumption is low) and a deficit (in the morning and evening). And the fact that there will be a surplus of current at lunchtime will not help cover the evening peak in consumption.

For example, let's look at information on electricity exports and imports on a weekday. On May 17, there were schedules of power outages from 00:00 to 08:00 and from 19:00 to 24:00. That is, it was during this period that there was a deficit that could not be covered even by imports of electricity. And if you look at the volume of trade, it was during these periods that most electricity was bought. At the same time, no electricity was sold at all. Ukraine imports electricity from Romania, Slovakia, Poland, Hungary, and Moldova. Exports to these countries are also possible.

Ukraine did not sell a single kWh to Romania that day. Instead, electricity was imported: from 00:00 to 09:00 and from 14:00 to 22:00. Moreover, at 6 am, the volume of imports (due to peak consumption) increased fivefold - from 50 to 255 MW.

No kWh was sold to Slovakia that day, but electricity was bought throughout the day. Mostly during the morning (at 7, 8 am) and evening (until 22:00) peaks.

We bought electricity from Poland from 6 am to 7 pm (and did not sell it), and from Moldova - throughout the day. There were no exports at all.

Sometimes, to ""confirm"" the sale of electricity, graphs from the Ukrainian Energy Exchange are shown. However, they show sales on the domestic wholesale market. For the industry, market mechanisms have long been in place for both the purchase of electricity and price formation. There are no separate contracts for exports, all data goes through a single European platform.

The blackouts cannot be linked to the tariff decision

Another conspiracy theory is that Ukrainians are being cut off from electricity to justify the tariff increase. In fact, and without any argumentation, the current electricity tariff for Ukrainians (UAH 2.64 per 1 kWh) covers only the delivery. That is, Ukrainians do not pay a single penny for electricity generation.

At the same time, electricity debts continue to grow. That is, consumers do not pay on time even for electricity delivery to their apartments.

""The situation is painfully clear. The goal is to cause more inconvenience to people to reduce resistance to the tariff increase,"" a resident of Zaporizhzhia wrote on her Facebook page. This statement has been actively spreading on social media over the past few days.

Despite the fact that Ukrainians have witnessed the largest attack on the energy sector in recent months, with the lion's share of balancing generation destroyed, some still find it easier to believe that the blackouts are the fault of Ukrainian power engineers or the government, not Russia.

""People are starting to look for someone to blame. There are no commercial sales, there are technical flows that are necessary. They are ten times smaller,"" Plachkov adds.

The situation in the energy sector remains extremely difficult. Right now, the repair campaign at NPPs is underway. In addition, Zaporizhzhia NPP remains under occupation (6 thousand MW), Kakhovka HPP is destroyed, Dnipro HPP is out of operation, and several large thermal power plants have been destroyed. All these are the results of the Russian attack on energy facilities. And while some facilities can indeed be protected, it is virtually impossible to build ""sarcophagi"" and close a large thermal power plant from a direct missile attack. In any case, no country has yet learned how to create such protection. And the very fact of an attack on a thermal power plant is a war crime.

Any search for those responsible for the electricity shortage should begin with reminders of who destroyed part of Ukraine's generation. There is no evidence of any electricity sales during the lockdown. Not a single investigator, power engineer, or official has confirmed even the possibility of such exports. Moreover, Europeans publish all data on commercial electricity exchange, and it would be impossible to hide such information.",eng.obozrevatel.com,news,Obozrevatel,,-0.1764705882352942,454078535,100,https://i2.obozrevatel.com/news/2024/5/22/elekroenergiya-elektrika-svitlo-freepik.jpg?size=2010x1050,

Without adequate air defences to counter assaults and allow for repairs, though, the shortages could still worsen as need spikes in late summer and the bitter-cold winter.

The Russian air strikes targeting the grid since March have meant blackouts have even returned to the capital, Kyiv, which hadn't experienced them since the first year of the war. Among the strikes were an April barrage that damaged Kyiv's largest thermal power plant and a massive attack on May 8 that targeted power generation and transmission facilities in several regions.

In all, half of Ukraine's energy system was damaged, Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said.

Entire apartment blocks in the capital went dark. The city's military administration said at least 10 per cent of consumers were disconnected.

For many, it is a taste of what might be in store if Ukraine doesn't find other electricity sources before winter.

Before dawn Wednesday, a Russian drone attack on Sumy plunged the northern Ukraine city into darkness. Some power was restored to the city of around a quarter-million people in the morning as crews rushed to repair the damage, local authorities said.

With no end in sight to the attacks on the power grid and without a way to adequately defend against them, there are no quick fixes to the electricity shortages, Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko explained. Ukraine is appealing to Western allies for more air defence systems and spare parts to fix its Soviet-era plants.

""With each attack we lose additional power generation, so it just goes minus, minus, minus,"" Halushchenko said Tuesday while standing outside a coal-fired plant in central Ukraine that was destroyed in an April 11 attack. Any efforts to repair the plant would be futile until the military can defend it from another attack.

""Should we repair (power stations) just for them (Russians) to renew strikes while we are unable to defend ourselves?"" the minister asked.

German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock's joined him on the plant visit, underscoring Ukraine's desperation to close the power gap as quickly as possible.

The first major test of the grid will come in July and August, when consumption due to summer heat can mirror levels in the subfreezing winter months, the minister said.

By mid-May, Kyiv's residents began to feel the consequences of Russia's attacks. A cold snap drove up consumption, forcing Ukrenergo, the main transmission system operator, to introduce controlled blackouts throughout the country. Ukraine can't generate enough power to cover evening peaks, and the shortage is greater than the country's ability to import electricity from Poland, Slovakia and Romania.

The April 11 attack on the plant destroyed generators, transformers and turbines - every necessary part to generate electricity, said Yevhen Harkavyi, the technical director of Centerenergo, which operates the plant.

Five missiles hit the facility that day, and workers were still clearing away rubble on Tuesday as snowlike tufts of poplar cotton fell through a hole in the roof.

The plan for winter is to restore power generation as much as possible, said Harkavyi. How that will happen isn't clear, he conceded: ""The situation is already too difficult.""

Ukraine is hoping to acquire parts from long-decommissioned German plants. Harkavyi said Ukrainian teams recently went to Germany to evaluate the equipment, which was taken offline because it doesn't meet European Union environmental standards. It remains to be seen how willing European allies will be to invest in Ukraine's coal-fueled energy sector given their own greener goals.

German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock voiced concern&nbsp;on Tuesday over the worsening battlefield conditions for Ukrainian forces on the eastern front, during an unannounced visit to Kyiv.The visit from Baerbock, who urged the West to supply Ukraine with more air defences, came after more than two dozen Russian drones targeted Ukraine overnight, in an attack that left several wounded in the eastern Kharkiv region.""The situation in Ukraine has once more dramatically deteriorated with the massive Russian aerial attacks on civilian infrastructure and the brutal Russian offensive in the Kharkiv region,"" Baerbock said when she arrived for her eighth visit to the country since Russia invaded in February 2022.To protect itself from the ""rain of Russian drones and missiles"", Ukraine ""urgently needs a boosted air defence"", she said.""Our support is based on the deep conviction that Ukraine will win this war,"" Baerbock said.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned last week that the Russian ground offensive launched this month in the Kharkiv region may only be a ""first wave"" and that Russian troops could be aiming for the city of Kharkiv -- the second largest in Ukraine.The Russian official appointed by Moscow as governor of the Kharkiv region said on Tuesday that his country's forces were now in control of nearly half of Vovchansk.The town near the Russian border that had around 17,000 residents before the war and is now the epicentre of fighting.- Drone barrage -""Our guys control about 40 percent of the city. They have cut deep into the defence and knocked out the enemy as far as they could,"" said the official, Vitaly Ganchev.""The northern part of the city has already been completely liberated,"" he told Russian state television.A Ukrainian military spokesman meanwhile told state media that fighting in the Kharkiv region ""remains difficult and is changing dynamically"".But he also said the number of bouts with Russian forces had decreased.In a rebuke to Baerbock, the Kremlin said that even if supplies of Western weapons to Ukraine picked up, more deliveries would not change Russia's dominant position on the front.""It will still not allow the Ukrainian armed forces to somehow change the dynamics on the fronts,"" spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.Zelensky has repeatedly called on Ukraine's allies to provide at least seven more air defence systems, including at least two to protect the Kharkiv region.Russian President Vladimir Putin believes that Ukraine and its allies will at some point run out of steam, Baerbock said.""(But) we have the capacity to hold out,"" she said.Just before Baerbock arrived, the Ukrainian air force said it had intercepted 28 out of 29 Iranian-designed attack drones launched by Russian forces overnight.&nbsp;The unmanned aerial vehicles were downed over southern and eastern regions of Ukraine.The head of the Kharkiv region said a 53-year-old man was wounded by Russian rocket fire that targeted a transport infrastructure facility.Systematic Russian attacks on Ukraine's energy grid have crippled the sector and officials in the capital announced rolling power cuts throughout the day on Tuesday to reduce the load on the network.The national grid operator said Ukraine was importing electricity from Hungary, Moldova, Poland, Romania and Slovakia to make up a shortfall due to Russian strikes.bur-jbr/gil",uk.news.yahoo.com,news,Yahoo News UK,,-0.6235294117647059,454069370,1,https://media.zenfs.com/en/reuters.com/c94c56a6f1bb35379708ed061875accd,eng-9584999

- Global cooling experts call for 'absolute urgency to drive development and deployment of sustainable, affordable and resilient cooling solutions' to meet climate targets

- Undertaken by home appliance expert Beko, the report challenges the public and private sectors to innovate together

ISTANBUL, May 22, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- A new report has highlighted the 'double bind' presented by the rapid expansion of access to domestic refrigeration - the need to balance improvements in global living standards with the environmental impact of the additional 2.3 billion domestic refrigerators that may be in use globally by 2050 (+121% versus 2022).

Hakan Bulgurlu

The report, ""Without Access to Fundamental Services: The Right to Refrigeration"", has been undertaken by home appliance leader Beko, and features contributions by world-leading cooling experts Professor Toby Peters and Dr Leyla Sayin from the University of Birmingham in the UK.

Challenge 1: adequate access to cooling

In their contribution to the report, the two experts highlight the many challenges that stand in the way of the universal provision of the essential service of refrigeration.

Globally, more than 1.2 billion lack of access to cooling and are consequently categorised as high-risk (~15% of the global population); Lack of effective refrigeration contributes to the loss of 526 million tonnes of food produced annually. This is enough to feed an estimated one billion people - representing its own massive emissions hazard. Improved access to refrigeration is impeded by the fact that 745 million people lack access to electricity and 3.5 billion suffer frequent power cuts. Entrenched poverty and inequality mean many cannot afford a fridge at all, whether on-grid or off. Cutting food waste is essential, given that in 2023 in 333 million people were facing acute food insecurity.

Challenge 2: the associated environmental impact

Rising emissions is the other key concern.

Household appliances already account for 8% of global carbon emissions, which is more than three times the global carbon emissions of the aviation[1] industry. Of the total emissions from household appliances, 15% is caused by domestic refrigerators. The cooling sector more broadly already accounts for nearly 20% of global electricity consumption and comprises more than 10% of global emissions.

The global energy consumption by appliances and equipment continues to grow every year. This is driven largely by expanding ownership and use of energy-consuming devices, particularly in developing countries. The report estimates that 2.3 billion people worldwide are reaching income levels where they are likely to purchase inexpensive but inefficient, polluting refrigerators. What will happen to these figures as the number of domestic refrigerators in use shoots up, as predicted? By 2050, 4.2 billion domestic refrigerators are predicted to be in use.

Creating a future in which everyone can access essential services in harmony with the planet

Hakan Bulgurlu, CEO of Beko, says: ""It is simply not acceptable to deny those in the Global South access to a comfortable and healthy living due to business-as-usual emissions increases as this population gains access to what many in the Global North have taken for granted for decades. Our question is this: how can more people gain access to essential home appliances, while we ensure efficient energy consumption?""

""We decided to investigate an area of Beko expertise - refrigeration. A fridge at home is linked to a variety of important development and human rights indicators. But more refrigerators mean more energy consumption and emissions, and by extension an increase in the effect of global warming, which is being felt around the world, but acutely in the Global South. Therein lies the conflict that Beko is urging businesses and policymakers to address.""

Distinct issues to be tackled in different parts of the world

The complexities of the problem are playing out in different ways around the world, which are illuminated by examples in this report. For instance, in Pakistan, where a huge rural population struggles with access to a reliable supply of electricity and low to average incomes, a large, fast-growing population will nonetheless likely boost the number of refrigerators, with serious implications for global emissions.

South Africa, too, struggles with an intermittent electricity supply, although a larger proportion of the population has access. The key issues facing South Africa are electricity production practices that depend on coal, and the stark inequality that means despite being an upper middle-income country, its poorest citizens may struggle to buy a quality, energy-efficient refrigerator.

Solutions through genuine collaboration

Solving the refrigeration problem won't be easy. But there are ways forward. To truly address the problems presented in this report, genuine collaboration between the private and public sectors will be essential, not optional.

The private sector needs to research and develop pioneering energy-efficient, low leakage, and affordable refrigeration solutions; communicate the advantages of energy-efficient products; respect local knowledge and build trust among consumers; lobby for stringent regulation; and contribute to global industry standards.

Policymakers should pursue and enforce international agreements; create National Cooling Action Plans[2]; run public information campaigns; put processes in place to dispose of older or broken fridges in an environmentally friendly way; and, through advocacy and research, make sure the world's poorest are not excluded from the right to refrigeration.

Key data points summary

333 million people were facing acute food insecurity in 2023, which is more than 200,000 above pre-pandemic levels. The United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) says that food production must increase by 70% by 2050 to feed a fast-growing global population. A household is likely to buy a fridge once its income reaches 10,000 USD per year (source: the German Agency for International Cooperation, GIZ) 745 million people may still live without access to electricity. By 2030, an estimated 660 million are likely to be left without electricity. The number of people without or with inconsistent access to electricity stands at 3.5 billion. The number of refrigeration appliances in use in 2022 was 1.9 billion, with 165 million units sold. By 2030, there are projected to be 2.5 billion units in use and 209 million units sold annually; and by 2050, 3.8 billion units in use and 256 million units sold annually. More than 1.2 billion rural and urban poor globally are categorised at high risk due to lack of access to cooling. If everyone who needed a refrigerator had one, there would be 4.2 billion domestic refrigerators in 2050. Providing cooling for all who need it by 2050 would require 14 billion active cooling appliances worldwide. The cooling sector consumes more than 17% of the overall electricity used worldwide.

[2] A National Cooling Action Plan (NCAP) is a document that outlines a country's strategy for sustainable cooling. It covers regulatory, policy, technical and operational areas to reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions in the cooling sector. NCAPs are seen as an effective tool to strategize sustainable cooling actions.

Kyiv: The Russian offensive on Ukraine's power grid in recent weeks have forced the war-ravaged country leaders to roll-out nationwide blackouts. The shortage of power supply will worsen more with spike in need in late summer and the bitter-cold winter.

The Russian airstrikes since March targeting power grid have triggered the blackouts even in capital, Kyiv which remained untouched since the break out of war.

The Russian airstrikes targeting the grid since March have meant blackouts have even returned to the capital, Kyiv, which hadn't experienced them since the first year of the war.

In April's airstrike, Kyiv's largest thermal power plant was damaged, followed by massive strike on May 8 that targeted power generation and transmission facilities in several regions.

In all, half of Ukraine's energy system was damaged, Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said.

Entire apartment blocks in the capital went dark. The city's military administration said at least 10 per cent of consumers were disconnected.

For many, it is a taste of what might be in store if Ukraine doesn't find other electricity sources before winter.

With no end in sight to the attacks on the power grid and without a way to adequately defend against them, there are no quick fixes to the electricity shortages, Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko explained. Ukraine is appealing to Western allies for more air defence systems and spare parts to fix its Soviet-era plants.

""With each attack we lose additional power generation, so it just goes minus, minus, minus,"" Halushchenko said on Tuesday while standing outside a coal-fired plant in central Ukraine that was destroyed in an April 11 attack.

Any efforts to repair the plant would be futile until the military can defend it from another attack.

""Should we repair (power stations) just for them (Russians) to renew strikes while we are unable to defend ourselves?"" the minister asked.

German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock's joined him on the plant visit, underscoring Ukraine's desperation to close the power gap as quickly as possible.

The first major test of the grid will come in July and August, when consumption can mirror levels in the sub-freezing winter months, the minister said.

By mid-May, Kyiv's residents began to feel the consequences of Russia's attacks. A cold snap drove up consumption, forcing Ukrenergo, the main transmission system operator, to introduce controlled blackouts throughout the country. Ukraine can't generate enough power to cover evening peaks, and the shortage is greater than the country's ability to import electricity from Poland, Slovakia and Romania.

The April 11 attack on the plant destroyed generators, transformers and turbines -- every necessary part to generate electricity, said Yevhen Harkavyi, the technical director of Centerenergo, which operates the plant.

Five missiles hit the facility that day, and workers were still clearing away rubble on Tuesday as snow-like tufts of poplar cotton fell through a hole in the roof.

The plan for winter is to restore power generation as much as possible, said Harkavyi. How that will happen isn't clear, he conceded: ""The situation is already too difficult."" Ukraine is hoping to acquire parts from long-decommissioned German plants. Harkavyi said Ukrainian teams recently went to Germany to evaluate the equipment, which was taken offline because it doesn't meet European Union environmental standards. It remains to be seen how willing European allies will be to invest in Ukraine's coal-fuelled energy sector given their own greener goals.

The teams are still evaluating how to get the equipment back to Ukraine, he said.

""This is the first question,"" he said. ""The second question is what Ukraine is crying about: We need active protection with air defense systems, and we hope that Mrs. Minister (Baerbock) has seen the scale of destruction and will do everything possible to call for help from the whole world.""",republicworld.com,news,Republic World,Digital Desk,-0.4823529411764705,454063286,10,https://img.republicworld.com/rimages/ap24129248478763-171517428235516_9.webp,eng-9588741

- Global cooling experts call for 'absolute urgency to drive development and deployment of sustainable, affordable and resilient cooling solutions' to meet climate targets

- Undertaken by home appliance expert Beko, the report challenges the public and private sectors to innovate together

ISTANBUL , May 22, 2024 /CNW/ -- A new report has highlighted the 'double bind' presented by the rapid expansion of access to domestic refrigeration - the need to balance improvements in global living standards with the environmental impact of the additional 2.3 billion domestic refrigerators that may be in use globally by 2050 (+121% versus 2022).

The report, ""Without Access to Fundamental Services: The Right to Refrigeration "" , has been undertaken by home appliance leader Beko, and features contributions by world-leading cooling experts Professor Toby Peters and Dr Leyla Sayin from the University of Birmingham in the UK.

Challenge 1: adequate access to cooling

In their contribution to the report, the two experts highlight the many challenges that stand in the way of the universal provision of the essential service of refrigeration.

Globally, more than 1.2 billion lack of access to cooling and are consequently categorised as high-risk (~15% of the global population); Lack of effective refrigeration contributes to the loss of 526 million tonnes of food produced annually. This is enough to feed an estimated one billion people - representing its own massive emissions hazard. Improved access to refrigeration is impeded by the fact that 745 million people lack access to electricity and 3.5 billion suffer frequent power cuts . Entrenched poverty and inequality mean many cannot afford a fridge at all , whether on-grid or off. Cutting food waste is essential, given that in 2023 in 333 million people were facing acute food insecurity . Challenge 2: the associated environmental impact

Rising emissions is the other key concern.

Household appliances already account for 8% of global carbon emissions , which is more than three times the global carbon emissions of the aviation[1] industry. Of the total emissions from household appliances, 15% is caused by domestic refrigerators . The cooling sector more broadly already accounts for nearly 20% of global electricity consumption and comprises more than 10% of global emissions. The global energy consumption by appliances and equipment continues to grow every year. This is driven largely by expanding ownership and use of energy-consuming devices, particularly in developing countries. The report estimates that 2.3 billion people worldwide are reaching income levels where they are likely to purchase inexpensive but inefficient, polluting refrigerators. What will happen to these figures as the number of domestic refrigerators in use shoots up, as predicted? By 2050, 4.2 billion domestic refrigerators are predicted to be in use.

Creating a future in which everyone can access essential services in harmony with the planet

Hakan Bulgurlu , CEO of Beko, says: ""It is simply not acceptable to deny those in the Global South access to a comfortable and healthy living due to business-as-usual emissions increases as this population gains access to what many in the Global North have taken for granted for decades. Our question is this: how can more people gain access to essential home appliances, while we ensure efficient energy consumption?""

""We decided to investigate an area of Beko expertise - refrigeration. A fridge at home is linked to a variety of important development and human rights indicators. But more refrigerators mean more energy consumption and emissions, and by extension an increase in the effect of global warming, which is being felt around the world, but acutely in the Global South. Therein lies the conflict that Beko is urging businesses and policymakers to address.""

Distinct issues to be tackled in different parts of the world

The complexities of the problem are playing out in different ways around the world, which are illuminated by examples in this report. For instance, in Pakistan , where a huge rural population struggles with access to a reliable supply of electricity and low to average incomes, a large, fast-growing population will nonetheless likely boost the number of refrigerators, with serious implications for global emissions.

South Africa , too, struggles with an intermittent electricity supply, although a larger proportion of the population has access. The key issues facing South Africa are electricity production practices that depend on coal, and the stark inequality that means despite being an upper middle-income country, its poorest citizens may struggle to buy a quality, energy-efficient refrigerator.

Solutions through genuine collaboration

Solving the refrigeration problem won't be easy. But there are ways forward. To truly address the problems presented in this report, genuine collaboration between the private and public sectors will be essential, not optional.

The private sector needs to research and develop pioneering energy-efficient, low leakage, and affordable refrigeration solutions; communicate the advantages of energy-efficient products; respect local knowledge and build trust among consumers; lobby for stringent regulation; and contribute to global industry standards.

Policymakers should pursue and enforce international agreements; create National Cooling Action Plans[2] ; run public information campaigns; put processes in place to dispose of older or broken fridges in an environmentally friendly way; and, through advocacy and research, make sure the world's poorest are not excluded from the right to refrigeration.

Key data points summary

333 million people were facing acute food insecurity in 2023, which is more than 200,000 above pre-pandemic levels. The United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) says that food production must increase by 70% by 2050 to feed a fast-growing global population. A household is likely to buy a fridge once its income reaches 10,000 USD per year (source: the German Agency for International Cooperation, GIZ) 745 million people may still live without access to electricity. By 2030, an estimated 660 million are likely to be left without electricity. The number of people without or with inconsistent access to electricity stands at 3.5 billion. The number of refrigeration appliances in use in 2022 was 1.9 billion, with 165 million units sold. By 2030, there are projected to be 2.5 billion units in use and 209 million units sold annually; and by 2050, 3.8 billion units in use and 256 million units sold annually. More than 1.2 billion rural and urban poor globally are categorised at high risk due to lack of access to cooling. If everyone who needed a refrigerator had one, there would be 4.2 billion domestic refrigerators in 2050. Providing cooling for all who need it by 2050 would require 14 billion active cooling appliances worldwide. The cooling sector consumes more than 17% of the overall electricity used worldwide.

[2] A National Cooling Action Plan (NCAP) is a document that outlines a country's strategy for sustainable cooling . It covers regulatory, policy, technical and operational areas to reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions in the cooling sector. NCAPs are seen as an effective tool to strategize sustainable cooling actions.

Without adequate air defenses to counter assaults and allow for repairs, though, the shortages could still worsen as need spikes in late summer and the bitter-cold winter.

The Russian airstrikes targeting the grid since March have meant blackouts have even returned to the capital, Kyiv, which hadn't experienced them since the first year of the war. Among the strikes were an April barrage that damaged Kyiv's largest thermal power plant and a massive attack on May 8 that targeted power generation and transmission facilities in several regions.

In all, half of Ukraine's energy system was damaged, Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said.

Entire apartment blocks in the capital went dark. The city's military administration said at least 10% of consumers were disconnected.

For many, it is a taste of what might be in store if Ukraine doesn't find other electricity sources before winter.

Before dawn Wednesday, a Russian drone attack on Sumy plunged the northern Ukraine city into darkness. Some power was restored to the city of around a quarter-million people in the morning as crews rushed to repair the damage, local authorities said.

With no end in sight to the attacks on the power grid and without a way to adequately defend against them, there are no quick fixes to the electricity shortages, Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko explained. Ukraine is appealing to Western allies for more air defense systems and spare parts to fix its Soviet-era plants.

""With each attack we lose additional power generation, so it just goes minus, minus, minus,"" Halushchenko said Tuesday while standing outside a coal-fired plant in central Ukraine that was destroyed in an April 11 attack. Any efforts to repair the plant would be futile until the military can defend it from another attack.

""Should we repair (power stations) just for them (Russians) to renew strikes while we are unable to defend ourselves?"" the minister asked.

German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock's joined him on the plant visit, underscoring Ukraine's desperation to close the power gap as quickly as possible.

The first major test of the grid will come in July and August, when consumption due to summer heat can mirror levels in the sub-freezing winter months, the minister said.

By mid-May, Kyiv's residents began to feel the consequences of Russia's attacks. A cold snap drove up consumption, forcing Ukrenergo, the main transmission system operator, to introduce controlled blackouts throughout the country. Ukraine can't generate enough power to cover evening peaks, and the shortage is greater than the country's ability to import electricity from Poland, Slovakia and Romania.

The April 11 attack on the plant destroyed generators, transformers and turbines -- every necessary part to generate electricity, said Yevhen Harkavyi, the technical director of Centerenergo, which operates the plant.

Five missiles hit the facility that day, and workers were still clearing away rubble on Tuesday as snow-like tufts of poplar cotton fell through a hole in the roof.

The plan for winter is to restore power generation as much as possible, said Harkavyi. How that will happen isn't clear, he conceded: ""The situation is already too difficult.""

Ukraine is hoping to acquire parts from long-decommissioned German plants. Harkavyi said Ukrainian teams recently went to Germany to evaluate the equipment, which was taken offline because it doesn't meet European Union environmental standards. It remains to be seen how willing European allies will be to invest in Ukraine's coal-fueled energy sector given their own greener goals.

The teams are still evaluating how to get the equipment back to Ukraine, he said.

""This is the first question,"" he said. ""The second question is what Ukraine is crying about: We need active protection with air defense systems, and we hope that Mrs. Minister (Baerbock) has seen the scale of destruction and will do everything possible to call for help from the whole world.""

Hakan Bulgurlu, CEO of Beko, says: ""It is simply not acceptable to deny those in the Global South access to a comfortable and healthy living due to business-as-usual emissions increases as this population gains access to what many in the Global North have taken for granted for decades. Our question is this: how can more people gain access to essential home appliances, while we ensure efficient energy consumption?""

""We decided to investigate an area of Beko expertise - refrigeration. A fridge at home is linked to a variety of important development and human rights indicators. But more refrigerators mean more energy consumption and emissions, and by extension an increase in the effect of global warming, which is being felt around the world, but acutely in the Global South. Therein lies the conflict that Beko is urging businesses and policymakers to address.""

Distinct issues to be tackled in different parts of the world

The complexities of the problem are playing out in different ways around the world, which are illuminated by examples in this report. For instance, in Pakistan, where a huge rural population struggles with access to a reliable supply of electricity and low to average incomes, a large, fast-growing population will nonetheless likely boost the number of refrigerators, with serious implications for global emissions.

South Africa, too, struggles with an intermittent electricity supply, although a larger proportion of the population has access. The key issues facing South Africa are electricity production practices that depend on coal, and the stark inequality that means despite being an upper middle-income country, its poorest citizens may struggle to buy a quality, energy-efficient refrigerator.

Solutions through genuine collaboration

Solving the refrigeration problem won't be easy. But there are ways forward. To truly address the problems presented in this report, genuine collaboration between the private and public sectors will be essential, not optional.

The private sector needs to research and develop pioneering energy-efficient, low leakage, and affordable refrigeration solutions; communicate the advantages of energy-efficient products; respect local knowledge and build trust among consumers; lobby for stringent regulation; and contribute to global industry standards.

Policymakers should pursue and enforce international agreements; create National Cooling Action Plans[2]; run public information campaigns; put processes in place to dispose of older or broken fridges in an environmentally friendly way; and, through advocacy and research, make sure the world's poorest are not excluded from the right to refrigeration.

Key data points summary

333 million people were facing acute food insecurity in 2023, which is more than 200,000 above pre-pandemic levels.The United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) says that food production must increase by 70% by 2050 to feed a fast-growing global population.A household is likely to buy a fridge once its income reaches 10,000 USD per year (source: the German Agency for International Cooperation, GIZ)745 million people may still live without access to electricity. By 2030, an estimated 660 million are likely to be left without electricity.The number of people without or with inconsistent access to electricity stands at 3.5 billion.The number of refrigeration appliances in use in 2022 was 1.9 billion, with 165 million units sold. By 2030, there are projected to be 2.5 billion units in use and 209 million units sold annually; and by 2050, 3.8 billion units in use and 256 million units sold annually.More than 1.2 billion rural and urban poor globally are categorised at high risk due to lack of access to cooling.If everyone who needed a refrigerator had one, there would be 4.2 billion domestic refrigerators in 2050. Providing cooling for all who need it by 2050 would require 14 billion active cooling appliances worldwide.The cooling sector consumes more than 17% of the overall electricity used worldwide.

[2] A National Cooling Action Plan (NCAP) is a document that outlines a country's strategy for sustainable cooling. It covers regulatory, policy, technical and operational areas to reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions in the cooling sector. NCAPs are seen as an effective tool to strategize sustainable cooling actions.

Sustained Russian attacks on Ukraine's power grid in recent weeks have forced leaders of the war-ravaged country to institute nationwide rolling blackouts.

Since March, Russian airstrikes have damaged key infrastructure, including Kyiv's largest thermal power plant, and caused significant blackouts even in the capital, which had been spared since the first year of the war. A particularly devastating attack on May 8 targeted power facilities across several regions.

Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said that in all, half of Ukraine's energy system was damaged by Russia's strike.

This situation could deteriorate further if alternative electricity sources are not secured before winter. Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko highlighted the difficulty of repairing power stations only to have them targeted again by Russian strikes, underscoring the urgent need for more air defense systems and spare parts from Western allies.

The grid's resilience will be tested in July and August, when consumption can rival winter levels. By mid-May, the effects of the attacks were already felt in Kyiv, where a cold snap increased energy demand, prompting Ukrenergo, the main transmission system operator, to implement controlled blackouts nationwide.

Ukraine cannot currently generate enough power for peak evening hours and cannot import sufficient electricity from neighbouring Poland, Slovakia, and Romania to bridge the gap.

Ukrainian soldiers in the Kharkiv region near Vovchansk report that the combat situation is even more intense than it was around the fallen city of Bakhmut, though they now have sufficient ammunition to counter the Russian forces.

President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said that Ukrainian troops are achieving ""tangible"" progress in Kharkiv, but he acknowledged that the frontline near Pokrovsk, Kramatorsk, and Kurakhove remains ""extremely difficult.""

The World Health Organization (WHO) reported that more than 14,000 people have been displaced from the Kharkiv region in recent days. Jarno Habicht, the WHO representative in Ukraine, noted that nearly 189,000 people still reside within 25 kilometers of the Russian border, facing significant dangers due to the ongoing conflict.",firstpost.com,news,Firstpost,,-0.3647058823529412,454061051,4,"https://images.firstpost.com/uploads/2024/05/Representative-Image-2024-05-22T122320.149-2024-05-11ce4a78c53cd858c8d8e0a0f3eca6bf.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(1200,675)",eng-9588741

Without adequate air defenses to counter assaults and allow for repairs, though, the shortages could still worsen as need spikes in late summer and the bitter-cold winter.

The Russian airstrikes targeting the grid since March have meant blackouts have even returned to the capital, Kyiv, which hadn't experienced them since the first year of the war. Among the strikes were an April barrage that damaged Kyiv's largest thermal power plant and a massive attack on May 8 that targeted power generation and transmission facilities in several regions.

In all, half of Ukraine's energy system was damaged, Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said.

Entire apartment blocks in the capital went dark. The city's military administration said at least 10% of consumers were disconnected.

For many, it is a taste of what might be in store if Ukraine doesn't find other electricity sources before winter.

With no end in sight to the attacks on the power grid and without a way to adequately defend against them, there are no quick fixes to the electricity shortages, Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko explained. Ukraine is appealing to Western allies for more air defense systems and spare parts to fix its Soviet-era plants.

""With each attack we lose additional power generation, so it just goes minus, minus, minus,"" Halushchenko said Tuesday while standing outside a coal-fired plant in central Ukraine that was destroyed in an April 11 attack. Any efforts to repair the plant would be futile until the military can defend it from another attack.

""Should we repair (power stations) just for them (Russians) to renew strikes while we are unable to defend ourselves?"" the minister asked.

German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock's joined him on the plant visit, underscoring Ukraine's desperation to close the power gap as quickly as possible.

The first major test of the grid will come in July and August, when consumption can mirror levels in the sub-freezing winter months, the minister said.

By mid-May, Kyiv's residents began to feel the consequences of Russia's attacks. A cold snap drove up consumption, forcing Ukrenergo, the main transmission system operator, to introduce controlled blackouts throughout the country. Ukraine can't generate enough power to cover evening peaks, and the shortage is greater than the country's ability to import electricity from Poland, Slovakia and Romania.

The April 11 attack on the plant destroyed generators, transformers and turbines -- every necessary part to generate electricity, said Yevhen Harkavyi, the technical director of Centerenergo, which operates the plant.

Five missiles hit the facility that day, and workers were still clearing away rubble on Tuesday as snow-like tufts of poplar cotton fell through a hole in the roof.

The plan for winter is to restore power generation as much as possible, said Harkavyi. How that will happen isn't clear, he conceded: ""The situation is already too difficult.""

Ukraine is hoping to acquire parts from long-decommissioned German plants. Harkavyi said Ukrainian teams recently went to Germany to evaluate the equipment, which was taken offline because it doesn't meet European Union environmental standards. It remains to be seen how willing European allies will be to invest in Ukraine's coal-fueled energy sector given their own greener goals.

The teams are still evaluating how to get the equipment back to Ukraine, he said.

""This is the first question,"" he said. ""The second question is what Ukraine is crying about: We need active protection with air defense systems, and we hope that Mrs. Minister (Baerbock) has seen the scale of destruction and will do everything possible to call for help from the whole world.""

Without adequate air defenses to counter assaults and allow for repairs, though, the shortages could still worsen as need spikes in late summer and the bitter-cold winter.

The Russian airstrikes targeting the grid since March have meant blackouts have even returned to the capital, Kyiv, which hadn't experienced them since the first year of the war. Among the strikes were an April barrage that damaged Kyiv's largest thermal power plant and a massive attack on May 8 that targeted power generation and transmission facilities in several regions.

In all, half of Ukraine's energy system was damaged, Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said.

Entire apartment blocks in the capital went dark. The city's military administration said at least 10% of consumers were disconnected.

For many, it is a taste of what might be in store if Ukraine doesn't find other electricity sources before winter.

With no end in sight to the attacks on the power grid and without a way to adequately defend against them, there are no quick fixes to the electricity shortages, Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko explained. Ukraine is appealing to Western allies for more air defense systems and spare parts to fix its Soviet-era plants.

""With each attack we lose additional power generation, so it just goes minus, minus, minus,"" Halushchenko said Tuesday while standing outside a coal-fired plant in central Ukraine that was destroyed in an April 11 attack. Any efforts to repair the plant would be futile until the military can defend it from another attack.

""Should we repair (power stations) just for them (Russians) to renew strikes while we are unable to defend ourselves?"" the minister asked.

German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock's joined him on the plant visit, underscoring Ukraine's desperation to close the power gap as quickly as possible.

The first major test of the grid will come in July and August, when consumption can mirror levels in the sub-freezing winter months, the minister said.

By mid-May, Kyiv's residents began to feel the consequences of Russia's attacks. A cold snap drove up consumption, forcing Ukrenergo, the main transmission system operator, to introduce controlled blackouts throughout the country. Ukraine can't generate enough power to cover evening peaks, and the shortage is greater than the country's ability to import electricity from Poland, Slovakia and Romania.

The April 11 attack on the plant destroyed generators, transformers and turbines -- every necessary part to generate electricity, said Yevhen Harkavyi, the technical director of Centerenergo, which operates the plant.

Five missiles hit the facility that day, and workers were still clearing away rubble on Tuesday as snow-like tufts of poplar cotton fell through a hole in the roof.

Ukraine can't generate enough power to cover evening peaks, and the shortage is greater than the country's ability to import electricity from Poland, Slovakia and Romania.

The April 11 attack on the plant destroyed generators, transformers and turbines -- every necessary part to generate electricity, said Yevhen Harkavyi, the technical director of Centerenergo, which operates the plant.

Five missiles hit the facility that day, and workers were still clearing away rubble on Tuesday as snow-like tufts of poplar cotton fell through a hole in the roof.

The plan for winter is to restore power generation as much as possible, said Harkavyi. How that will happen isn't clear, he conceded: ""The situation is already too difficult.""

Ukraine is hoping to acquire parts from long-decommissioned German plants. Harkavyi said Ukrainian teams recently went to Germany to evaluate the equipment, which was taken offline because it doesn't meet European Union environmental standards. It remains to be seen how willing European allies will be to invest in Ukraine's coal-fueled energy sector given their own greener goals.

The teams are still evaluating how to get the equipment back to Ukraine, he said.

Without adequate air defenses to counter assaults and allow for repairs, though, the shortages could still worsen as need spikes in late summer and the bitter-cold winter.

The Russian airstrikes targeting the grid since March have meant blackouts have even returned to the capital, Kyiv, which hadn't experienced them since the first year of the war. Among the strikes were an April barrage that damaged Kyiv's largest thermal power plant and a massive attack on May 8 that targeted power generation and transmission facilities in several regions.

In all, half of Ukraine's energy system was damaged, Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said.

Entire apartment blocks in the capital went dark. The city's military administration said at least 10% of consumers were disconnected.

For many, it is a taste of what might be in store if Ukraine doesn't find other electricity sources before winter.

With no end in sight to the attacks on the power grid and without a way to adequately defend against them, there are no quick fixes to the electricity shortages, Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko explained. Ukraine is appealing to Western allies for more air defense systems and spare parts to fix its Soviet-era plants.

""With each attack we lose additional power generation, so it just goes minus, minus, minus,"" Halushchenko said Tuesday while standing outside a coal-fired plant in central Ukraine that was destroyed in an April 11 attack. Any efforts to repair the plant would be futile until the military can defend it from another attack.

""Should we repair (power stations) just for them (Russians) to renew strikes while we are unable to defend ourselves?"" the minister asked.

German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock's joined him on the plant visit, underscoring Ukraine's desperation to close the power gap as quickly as possible.

The first major test of the grid will come in July and August, when consumption can mirror levels in the sub-freezing winter months, the minister said.

The first major test of the grid will come in July and August, when consumption can mirror levels in the sub-freezing winter months, the minister said.

By mid-May, Kyiv's residents began to feel the consequences of Russia's attacks. A cold snap drove up consumption, forcing Ukrenergo, the main transmission system operator, to introduce controlled blackouts throughout the country. Ukraine can't generate enough power to cover evening peaks, and the shortage is greater than the country's ability to import electricity from Poland, Slovakia and Romania.

The April 11 attack on the plant destroyed generators, transformers and turbines -- every necessary part to generate electricity, said Yevhen Harkavyi, the technical director of Centerenergo, which operates the plant.

Five missiles hit the facility that day, and workers were still clearing away rubble on Tuesday as snow-like tufts of poplar cotton fell through a hole in the roof.

The plan for winter is to restore power generation as much as possible, said Harkavyi. How that will happen isn't clear, he conceded: ""The situation is already too difficult.""

Ukraine is hoping to acquire parts from long-decommissioned German plants. Harkavyi said Ukrainian teams recently went to Germany to evaluate the equipment, which was taken offline because it doesn't meet European Union environmental standards. It remains to be seen how willing European allies will be to invest in Ukraine's coal-fueled energy sector given their own greener goals.

The teams are still evaluating how to get the equipment back to Ukraine, he said.

""This is the first question,"" he said. ""The second question is what Ukraine is crying about: We need active protection with air defense systems, and we hope that Mrs. Minister (Baerbock) has seen the scale of destruction and will do everything possible to call for help from the whole world.""

Without adequate air defenses to counter assaults and allow for repairs, though, the shortages could still worsen as need spikes in late summer and the bitter-cold winter.

The Russian airstrikes targeting the grid since March have meant blackouts have even returned to the capital, Kyiv, which hadn't experienced them since the first year of the war. Among the strikes were an April barrage that damaged Kyiv's largest thermal power plant and a massive attack on May 8 that targeted power generation and transmission facilities in several regions.

In all, half of Ukraine's energy system was damaged, Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said.

Entire apartment blocks in the capital went dark. The city's military administration said at least 10% of consumers were disconnected.

For many, it is a taste of what might be in store if Ukraine doesn't find other electricity sources before winter.

With no end in sight to the attacks on the power grid and without a way to adequately defend against them, there are no quick fixes to the electricity shortages, Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko explained. Ukraine is appealing to Western allies for more air defense systems and spare parts to fix its Soviet-era plants.

""With each attack we lose additional power generation, so it just goes minus, minus, minus,"" Halushchenko said Tuesday while standing outside a coal-fired plant in central Ukraine that was destroyed in an April 11 attack.

Without adequate air defenses to counter assaults and allow for repairs, though, the shortages could still worsen as need spikes in late summer and the bitter-cold winter.

The Russian airstrikes targeting the grid since March have meant blackouts have even returned to the capital, Kyiv, which hadnÂ´t experienced them since the first year of the war. Among the strikes were an April barrage that damaged KyivÂ´s largest thermal power plant and a massive attack on May 8 that targeted power generation and transmission facilities in several regions.

In all, half of UkraineÂ´s energy system was damaged, Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said.

Entire apartment blocks in the capital went dark. The city's military administration said at least 10% of consumers were disconnected.

For many, it is a taste of what might be in store if Ukraine doesn't find other electricity sources before winter.

With no end in sight to the attacks on the power grid and without a way to adequately defend against them, there are no quick fixes to the electricity shortages, Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko explained. Ukraine is appealing to Western allies for more air defense systems and spare parts to fix its Soviet-era plants.

""With each attack we lose additional power generation, so it just goes minus, minus, minus,"" Halushchenko said Tuesday while standing outside a coal-fired plant in central Ukraine that was destroyed in an April 11 attack. Any efforts to repair the plant would be futile until the military can defend it from another attack.

""Should we repair (power stations) just for them (Russians) to renew strikes while we are unable to defend ourselves?"" the minister asked.

German Foreign Minister Annalena BaerbockÂ´s joined him on the plant visit, underscoring UkraineÂ´s desperation to close the power gap as quickly as possible.

The first major test of the grid will come in July and August, when consumption can mirror levels in the sub-freezing winter months, the minister said.

By mid-May, KyivÂ´s residents began to feel the consequences of RussiaÂ´s attacks. A cold snap drove up consumption, forcing Ukrenergo, the main transmission system operator, to introduce controlled blackouts throughout the country. Ukraine can't generate enough power to cover evening peaks, and the shortage is greater than the countryÂ´s ability to import electricity from Poland, Slovakia and Romania.

The April 11 attack on the plant destroyed generators, transformers and turbines - every necessary part to generate electricity, said Yevhen Harkavyi, the technical director of Centerenergo, which operates the plant.

Five missiles hit the facility that day, and workers were still clearing away rubble on Tuesday as snow-like tufts of poplar cotton fell through a hole in the roof.

Without adequate air defenses to counter assaults and allow for repairs, though, the shortages could still worsen as need spikes in late summer and the bitter-cold winter.

The Russian airstrikes targeting the grid since March have meant blackouts have even returned to the capital, Kyiv, which hadn't experienced them since the first year of the war. Among the strikes were an April barrage that damaged Kyiv's largest thermal power plant and a massive attack on May 8 that targeted power generation and transmission facilities in several regions.

In all, half of Ukraine's energy system was damaged, Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said.

Entire apartment blocks in the capital went dark. The city's military administration said at least 10% of consumers were disconnected.

For many, it is a taste of what might be in store if Ukraine doesn't find other electricity sources before winter.

With no end in sight to the attacks on the power grid and without a way to adequately defend against them, there are no quick fixes to the electricity shortages, Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko explained. Ukraine is appealing to Western allies for more air defense systems and spare parts to fix its Soviet-era plants.

""With each attack we lose additional power generation, so it just goes minus, minus, minus,"" Halushchenko said Tuesday while standing outside a coal-fired plant in central Ukraine that was destroyed in an April 11 attack. Any efforts to repair the plant would be futile until the military can defend it from another attack.

""Should we repair (power stations) just for them (Russians) to renew strikes while we are unable to defend ourselves?"" the minister asked.

The visit from Ms. Baerbock, who urged the West to supply Ukraine with more air defences, came after more than two dozen Russian drones targeted Ukraine overnight, in an attack that left several wounded in the eastern Kharkiv region.

""The situation in Ukraine has once more dramatically deteriorated with the massive Russian aerial attacks on civilian infrastructure and the brutal Russian offensive in the Kharkiv region,"" Ms. Baerbock said when she arrived for her eighth visit to the country since Russia invaded in February 2022.

To protect itself from the ""rain of Russian drones and missiles"", Ukraine ""urgently needs a boosted air defence"", she said.

""Our support is based on the deep conviction that Ukraine will win this war,"" Ms. Baerbock said.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned last week that the Russian ground offensive launched this month in the Kharkiv region may only be a ""first wave"" and that Russian troops could be aiming for the city of Kharkiv -- the second largest in Ukraine.

The Russian official appointed by Moscow as governor of the Kharkiv region said on Tuesday that his country's forces were now in control of nearly half of Vovchansk.

The town near the Russian border that had around 17,000 residents before the war and is now the epicentre of fighting.

""Our guys control about 40 percent of the city. They have cut deep into the defence and knocked out the enemy as far as they could,"" said the official, Vitaly Ganchev.

""The northern part of the city has already been completely liberated,"" he told Russian state television.

A Ukrainian military spokesman meanwhile told state media that fighting in the Kharkiv region ""remains difficult and is changing dynamically"".

But he also said the number of bouts with Russian forces had decreased.

In a rebuke to Ms. Baerbock, the Kremlin said that even if supplies of Western weapons to Ukraine picked up, more deliveries would not change Russia's dominant position on the front.

""It will still not allow the Ukrainian armed forces to somehow change the dynamics on the fronts,"" spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.

Mr. Zelenskyy has repeatedly called on Ukraine's allies to provide at least seven more air defence systems, including at least two to protect the Kharkiv region.

Russian President Vladimir Putin believes that Ukraine and its allies will at some point run out of steam, Ms. Baerbock said.

""(But) we have the capacity to hold out,"" she said.

Just before Ms. Baerbock arrived, the Ukrainian air force said it had intercepted 28 out of 29 Iranian-designed attack drones launched by Russian forces overnight.

The unmanned aerial vehicles were downed over southern and eastern regions of Ukraine.

The head of the Kharkiv region said a 53-year-old man was wounded by Russian rocket fire that targeted a transport infrastructure facility.

Systematic Russian attacks on Ukraine's energy grid have crippled the sector and officials in the capital announced rolling power cuts throughout the day on Tuesday to reduce the load on the network.

The national grid operator said Ukraine was importing electricity from Hungary, Moldova, Poland, Romania and Slovakia to make up a shortfall due to Russian strikes.

To conserve energy, the government has ordered nationwide rolling blackouts for Monday night, broadening the smaller regional ones that have become the norm in recent weeks.

""This is another front line in the war,"" said Maxim Timchenko, the head of DTEK, Ukraine's largest private electricity company, on social media last week. He said the company's workers were engaged in a ""race against time"" to restore power to consumers.

The nationwide blackout, scheduled from 6 p.m. to midnight, will affect the entire country for the first time this year, but it is unclear if it will continue past Monday.

The winter of 2022-23 was especially hard on Ukrainians after Russian forces struck many power plants, leaving much of the population without heat in the bitter cold. But after that, Ukrainian forces became more adept at shooting down incoming missiles and had more weapons at their disposal to do so. At least until this spring.

As Ukrainian troops run low on weaponry, especially after the United States slowed down deliveries of arms, they have been less able to protect themselves against Russian barrages that have also become more sophisticated.

Stepped-up attacks by Russia are raising fears that power cuts will not only affect consumers but that they will also hurt Ukraine's defense industry when it is most needed.

""It definitely slows down the production, and it becomes more expensive,"" said Oleksandr Dmitriyev, who coordinates efforts to supply the military with weapons and other equipment. ""It is easier for civilians to survive without electricity, but for military production during the war it is critically important to have it.""

Besides imposing blackouts, Ukraine is asking for assistance from its Western partners, requesting power grid equipment and emergency electricity imports. On Sunday, Ukraine imported power from Romania, Slovakia, Poland, Hungary and Moldova.

DTEK has also started a campaign asking countries to give Ukraine used equipment that they no longer need.

""To buy or order the production of new equipment quickly is impossible,"" said Pavlo Bilodid, a spokesperson for the company. ""The only way is to get used equipment from countries that don't need it anymore, and only their political will is needed for that.""

The electricity equipment that is possible to use in Ukraine is in the post-Soviet countries of Eastern Europe. Many of them have already started working on donating it.

Ukrainian boxer Oleksandr Usyk, who became the undisputed world heavyweight champion Sunday, also joined the campaign and recorded a video wearing a T-shirt with the words ""the fight for light.""

""These attacks are directed against people,"" Usyk said in the video.

Ukraine is also requesting more air defense systems, especially the U.S.-made Patriot system, both to protect its electricity grid and to help it resist the Russian offensive in the northeastern Kharkiv region that started 10 days ago. Deep State, a group that analyzes combat footage and has close links to the Ukrainian army, said Sunday that Russian forces had advanced in 10 different locations in Ukraine's east and south, but had not captured any new villages.

""Two Patriots for the Kharkiv region could significantly help in protecting lives from Russian terror,"" President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said last week during his meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken.

Zelenskyy has also urged Ukrainians and businesses to consume electricity responsibly. ""We need to ensure that the public is fully informed about how power cuts happen now, when there is a peak load, and why we need everyone to be conscious of their consumption,"" he said in a video address Friday night.

One consumer, a tailor named Oleksandr, said he worried about the effect the rolling blackouts would have on his business. Other business owners have expressed similar worries.

""When the power cut is at home, my family has prepared for it,"" said Oleksandr, who would provide only his first name. ""My biggest fear is no power at work, which I will not be able to do without the electricity.""",seattletimes.com,news,The Seattle Times,Constant Meheut,-0.2156862745098039,454007075,22,https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/05202024_TZR_UKRAINE_RUSSIA_FIGHTING-NYT_tzr_125304.jpg?d=1020x655,eng-9595977

In a rebuke to Baerbock, the Kremlin said that even if supplies of Western weapons to Ukraine picked up, more deliveries would not change Russia's dominant position on the front.

""It will still not allow the Ukrainian armed forces to somehow change the dynamics on the fronts,"" spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.

Zelensky has repeatedly called on Ukraine's allies to provide at least seven more air defence systems, including at least two to protect the Kharkiv region.

Russian President Vladimir Putin believes that Ukraine and its allies will at some point run out of steam, Baerbock said.

""(But) we have the capacity to hold out,"" she said.

Just before Baerbock arrived, the Ukrainian air force said it had intercepted 28 out of 29 Iranian-designed attack drones launched by Russian forces overnight.

The unmanned aerial vehicles were downed over southern and eastern regions of Ukraine.

The head of the Kharkiv region said a 53-year-old man was wounded by Russian rocket fire that targeted a transport infrastructure facility.

Systematic Russian attacks on Ukraine's energy grid have crippled the sector and officials in the capital announced rolling power cuts throughout the day on Tuesday to reduce the load on the network.

The national grid operator said Ukraine was importing electricity from Hungary, Moldova, Poland, Romania and Slovakia to make up a shortfall due to Russian strikes.

May 21 (Interfax) - The Ukrainian national power grid operator Ukrenergo will not restrict electricity consumption by businesses and households from 11:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. on Tuesday, having revised its plans announced earlier to limit electricity consumption nationwide for the whole day on Tuesday.

""This has become possible now that the weather is less cloudy in all regions. Industrial and rooftop solar power systems have increased generation, and this has reduced shortage in the power system. The Ukrainian power system is also absorbing surplus electricity from Poland at the request of its power grid operator,"" Ukrainian media quoted Ukrenergo as saying in a post on its social account.

Considering this, Ukrenergo has asked customers to use power-intensive devices during daytime hours rather than in the evening or at night.

""Hour-by-hour outage schedules will be applied to industrial consumers and households from 5:00 p.m. to midnight,"" it said.

Ukraine received emergency assistance from European countries from 0:01 a.m. to 7:00 a.m. on Tuesday, Ukrenergo said. On Monday, it received such assistance from 0:01 a.m. to 7:00 a.m. and from 11:00 p.m. to 11:59 p.m.

Commercial electricity imports from Romania, Slovakia, Poland, Hungary, and Moldova declined by 6.5% to 18,242 MWh on Tuesday compared to Monday.

(BREAK) GEOFF BENNETT: Welcome to the ""NewsHour.""

Houston and other parts of the Gulf Coast are dealing with the aftermath of intense storms that have been hammering the region.

At least four people were killed in Houston after hurricane-force winds tore through the city.

And more than 700,000 customers remain without power in Texas and Louisiana as utility crews work to address it.

Ali Rogan has our report.

ALI ROGIN: Today, the Houston area is littered with debris.

Downtown is at a standstill and the city's school district was closed after an evening of deadly storms.

JOHN WHITMIRE (D), Mayor of Houston, Texas: It was fierce, it was intense, it was quick, and most Houstonians didn't have time to place themselves out of harm's way.

ALI ROGIN: It all began late yesterday, when ominous clouds rolled into the region.

TERESA HARRIS, Downtown Houston Worker: I realized it was pretty bad when it got black.

I mean, it really got dark.

ALI ROGIN: Soon, torrential rain and fierce winds lashed the area.

Officials say gusts in some places reached 100 miles per hour.

ALI ROGIN: The storm easily knocked out electricity.

Eyewitness video caught the moment the lights went out as hundreds of customers took shelter in a Costco.

Emergency officials called the damage to transmission lines catastrophic and said it could take weeks to restore power in some places.

In downtown Houston, the storms shattered windows and high-rises, leaving the streets below litter with glass.

At a briefing today, state Representative Jolanda Jones warned people to keep out.

STATE REP. JOLANDA JONES (D-TX): You need to stay away from downtown.

ALI ROGIN: Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo said the storms were unexpected and historic.

JUDGE LINA HIDALGO, Harris County, Texas: Last night, we were expecting some rain.

This kind of wind is something we have not seen in Harris County since Hurricane Alicia in 1983.

ALI ROGIN: In Louisiana, similar scenes overnight of heavy rain, flooding and a suspected tornado.

And it didn't end last night.

The National Weather Service kept flood watches and warnings in effect today for large swathes of the southeast, all further complicating efforts to clean up and rebuild.

For the ""PBS NewsHour,"" I'm Ali Rogin.

GEOFF BENNETT: In the day's other news: The Israeli military says its troops in Gaza found the bodies of three hostages all killed by Hamas as they tried to flee the Nova Music Festival on October 7.

They were identified as 22-year-old Shani Louk, 28-year-old Amit Buskila, and 56-year-old Yitzhak Gelernter.

Meantime, the first shipments of aid arrived on Gaza's shoreline via a floating pier made by the U.S. military.

Trucks lined up nearby ready to load.

In Washington this afternoon, White House officials said distribution would be swift.

JOHN KIRBY, NSC Coordinator For Strategic Communications: The U.N. has now taken possession of these first pallets and are getting them ready for distribution inside Gaza.

So, look, I mean, hopefully by the time we're done here, I mean, some of that stuff will actually be in the mouths of some hungry people, but we will see.

GEOFF BENNETT: Separately, Israel argued before the U.N.'s top court at The Hague today that its military is doing everything it can to protect the civilian population in Gaza.

The International Court of Justice wrapped up a third round of hearings on emergency measures requested by South Africa, which has accused Israel of genocide.

It has been a surreal day at the PGA Championship in Kentucky after the world's top ranked golfer was arrested while trying to drive around a traffic stop outside the Valhalla Golf Club.

Police say Scottie Scheffler ignored instructions and dragged an officer with his car.

Scheffler was booked for assaulting a police officer and other charges.

The Masters champion was handcuffed and put into a police car.

In a statement, Scheffler said it was a misunderstanding.

He was released and back at the course for his tee time.

The man who attacked former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband, Paul Pelosi, with a hammer was sentenced today to 30 years in prison.

David DePape was found guilty last November of attempting to kidnap a federal official and assaulting an official's family member.

The 44-year-old admitted to breaking into the speaker's home with the goal of taking her hostage.

The U.S. State Department issued a worldwide caution security alert today addressing threats to the LGBTQ community.

In its statement, the department said it's aware of the increased potential for foreign terrorist organization-inspired violence against LGBTQI-plus persons in events and advises U.S. citizens overseas to exercise increased caution.

The alert comes two weeks before the start of Pride Month here in the U.S. Russia has carried out multiple strikes on Ukrainian territory today.

At least one person was killed and eight others injured in an attack near the Black Sea port of Odesa.

Five others were hospitalized.

Separately, the mayor of Kharkiv says that Russian bombs killed at least three people and injured 28 others.

Ukraine's second largest city has come under increasing attack in recent months.

Wrapping up a two-day summit in China, President Vladimir Putin said Russia won't invade Kharkiv, but instead aims to use it as a buffer zone.

VLADIMIR PUTIN, Russian President (through translator): As for what is happening in the Kharkiv direction, this is also their fault, because they shoot residential areas of the border territories, including Belgorod.

I said publicly that, if this continues, we will be forced to create a safety zone, a sanitary zone.

GEOFF BENNETT: In response to Russia's latest military advances, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed a bill to allow prisoners to enlist in the military in exchange for parole.

He also raised fines for draft dodgers.

Slovakia's Prime Minister Robert Fico has undergone another surgery two days after he was shot multiple times following a government meeting.

He remains in very serious condition.

A suspect has been charged with attempted murder.

Earlier today, investigators removed a computer and other evidence from the suspect's home in Eastern Slovakia.

Police escorted the 71-year-old there for the search before loading him back into a police car.

Employees at two Mercedes facilities in Alabama have voted against joining the United Auto Workers.

In the final tally, 56 percent of workers were opposed to the union.

The result is a setback to the UAW's efforts to organize 150,000 workers at more than a dozen nonunion auto factories, mostly in the South.

It also comes a month after workers at a Volkswagen factory in Tennessee voted in favor of joining.

On Wall Street today, the Dow closed above 40000 for the first time ever.

The Nasdaq slipped 12 points after hitting records of its own this week.

The S&P 500 added six points.

And Brazil will host the 2027 Women's World Cup, becoming the first South American country to stage that tournament.

The announcement was made today at the FIFA Congress in Bangkok, Thailand.

Brazil beat out a joint bid of Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany.

Still to come on the ""NewsHour"": a national security expert makes the case that we're in a second Cold War, this time with China; Jonathan Capehart and Eliana Johnson weigh in on the week's political headlines; and a college course examines the depiction of alcohol and drunkenness on film.

As we reported, this has been a big week for the stock market.

Not only did the Dow Jones close above the 40000 mark for the first time today.

The much broader S&P 500 and the Nasdaq also reached record highs this week.

The markets have rallied back from the recent lows of 2022, and the Dow is about 40 percent higher than when the pandemic started.

Roben Farzad joins us now.

He's the host of public radio's ""Full Disclosure"" podcast.

Because the Dow doesn't tell us as much about the economy as the S&P 500 does.

ROBEN FARZAD, Host, ""Full Disclosure"": It's a great talking point.

Everything is kind of feeling pricey right now, whether it's housing, crypto, gold, stocks.

Then again, at the turn of the century, there was an infamous book called ""Dow 36000.""

And it took forever for the Dow to even visit 20000, 25000, much less 40000.

There's another school's thought that says the Dow should be far higher if it was more rationally planned, for example, if Apple or Amazon was added, or if there were other components right now that more represent this economy than the old economy components that are still in it.

So -- but we will take it.

But nothing is really cheap in this really peculiar economy.

GEOFF BENNETT: So what's behind the broader rise in markets right now?

ROBEN FARZAD: Artificial intelligence.

We have a semiconductor company called Nvidia, which is suddenly a $1 trillion, $2 trillion player.

How is it going to affect manufacturing, construction, journalism, media, all these powerful semiconductor chips that are going to be required, the staffing, the consulting, professional services that are going to be disrupted because of that?

So it's almost a parallel Internet.

We have had companies with record profits because they have pricing power.

And oddly enough, I mean, that passes through to stock market investors.

Time was you would worry that inflation would kill stocks.

But if you're actually buying a Chipotle, if you're buying a homebuilder, you have these portfolio companies that are pushing through price increases, then you as a shareholder are partaking in that, hence Dow 40000 and the S&P at an all-time high.

GEOFF BENNETT: So if you take this into account and you add last month's cooler-than-expected jobs report, is this an overall indication that the Fed might finally take this step of cutting interest rates?

ROBEN FARZAD: It's bizarre that we're having that conversation.

And yet the Fed is romancing this idea of cutting interest rates?

I think it speaks to the weakness in the economy, the fact that those who are not partaking in this wealth effect, lower-middle-income people, lower-income people, who have to overmax credit card debt, who are struggling to make ends meet amid this inflation, the kind of the value meal shock at a drive-through at a McDonald's.

And if they ease into this, does the housing market really need stimulus right now?

And, indeed, the Fed was supposed to hike earlier, and it's been punting on it.

GEOFF BENNETT: So what I hear you say is that this is not enough to improve Americans' overall perception of the economy.

ROBEN FARZAD: Well, what am I going to do, take my paper stock market winnings?

ROBEN FARZAD: That money is on a login thing, but it's not like it's giving me a dividend to deal with the real world sticker shock of gas, housing, rents, clothing, you name it.

I mean, auto insurance, it's a bizarre, bizarre economy.

But when hasn't the economy been bizarre, you know?

GEOFF BENNETT: So how do you see this playing out moving forward?

ROBEN FARZAD: I don't know how we put the genie back in the bottle.

As I have said before, it's the first time in a generation that we have dealt with capital-I inflation.

And the Fed, the Powell Fed was telling us a few years ago that this was transitory, I mean, it's going to pass.

But you get this once-in-a-generation pandemic, you flood the plain with money, and it's really hard to pull all of that back and to normalize in it.

I think that's a $15 trillion, $20 trillion question right now.

GEOFF BENNETT: Roben Farzad, always enjoy speaking with you.

GEOFF BENNETT: Texas Governor Greg Abbott has pardoned a man convicted of fatally shooting a Black Lives Matter protester in the summer of 2020.

Abbott had faced pressure to issue the pardon from white right-wing conservatives, including then FOX News host Tucker Carlson.

Stephanie Sy has the story.

STEPHANIE SY: Yesterday, the Texas State Parole Board, whose members are appointed by the governor, unanimously recommended the release of convicted killer Daniel Perry and the restoration of his firearm rights.

He walked free just hours after the pardon was issued.

Perry was serving a 25-year prison sentence for the murder of Garrett Foster, an armed white man who was attending a racial justice protest with his Black fiance.

In court, Perry argued he shot Foster from his car in self-defense.

Prosecutors argued he sought out the encounter, and the jury ultimately agreed.

For more on what led to Perry's pardon, we're joined by KVUE and Austin-American Statesman investigative reporter Tony Plohetski.

Tony, welcome to the ""NewsHour.""

The board said it did a meticulous review of this case.

But critics say this is politics, and you had right-wing pundits like Tucker Carlson calling for this for a year.

What was the biggest justification Governor Abbott gave for this pardon?

TONY PLOHETSKI, The Austin-American Statesman: Well, to your point, while the parole and pardons board issued this statement saying that they had done a meticulous review, what was absent from their statement was any sort of legal rationale, in terms of recommending that the governor issued this pardon.

In a separate proclamation, the governor, however, says that Texas has a very strong, one of the strongest, in his words, self-defense, stand-your-ground laws here in Texas.

And so he saw this as upholding that law, and that the conviction of Daniel Perry in this case were, in his words, a travesty of justice.

STEPHANIE SY: And he also had criticism for Travis County's DA's handling of the case, right?

But how does this fit into Abbott's broader record on pardons?

Is this a governor who has shown mercy to others who have been convicted of such serious crimes?

TONY PLOHETSKI: Well, certainly this adds fuel to the already burning fire between Republicans here in Texas and progressive district attorneys like district attorney Jose Garza here in Austin.

There has been a lot of back-and-forth discussion about what crimes get prosecuted and what crimes don't get prosecuted here in Austin.

But with regard to the governor's record with regard to pardons, over time, the governor has issued precious few of these pardons, usually doing so at the end of the year.

We're talking, Stephanie, only about a handful per year, most of them nonviolent offenders who were convicted, some of them after serving years or in some cases even decades in prison.

This pardon, however, stands very distinct from that, in that Daniel Perry has only been in prison a little more than a year.

STEPHANIE SY: I want to read a statement from Whitney Mitchell, Garrett Foster's surviving fiancee.

And she said through her attorney -- quote -- ""With this pardon, the governor has desecrated the life of a murdered Texan and U.S. Air Force veteran and impugned that jury's just verdict.

He has declared that Texans who hold political views that are different from his and different from those in power can be killed in this state with impunity.""

TONY PLOHETSKI: I can tell you that that is certainly the concern, not only here in the criminal justice community in Austin, but really across the state, what this might lead to with regard to other cases that are on dockets, not only in Austin, but across the state, whether or not Governor Abbott may lend support to those offenders, should they be convicted sometime down the line, and, in the minds of some people here in Texas, further upending the criminal justice system.

STEPHANIE SY: How else are you hearing reaction from this, particularly from the family and Black Lives Matter protesters?

TONY PLOHETSKI: Well, I can assure you that the reaction of Whitney Mitchell is consistent to a lot of feelings here in Austin.

Austin has a very strong community with regard to activism and demonstrations.

And so they were alarmed the night that Garrett Foster was killed.

But let me assure you that, elsewhere in the state, a deeply conservative state, others view this, other loud voices, including, for example, the attorney general, view this as righting a wrong, that a miscarriage of justice occurred in this case.

And so they see this as the governor using his authority, legally using his partner authority to right that wrong.

But, again, the reaction really does range, depending on who you talk to, not only in Austin, but across the state of Texas.

STEPHANIE SY: Tony Plohetski with The Austin-American Statesman, thank you so much for joining the ""NewsHour.""

TONY PLOHETSKI: Thanks for having me.

GEOFF BENNETT: We turn now to a seismic shift within the United Methodist Church.

It recently voted to lift bans on LGBTQ clergy and same-sex marriages.

I spoke to a Methodist pastor about these changes, but, first, a bit of background.

WOMAN: And the results should now appear on the screen.

GEOFF BENNETT: It was described as the most consequential meeting of the United Methodist Church in more than half-a-century.

In late April, hundreds of delegates from around the world gathered in Charlotte, the first such meeting since 2019.

WOMAN: The affirmative has it, and the motion is adopted.

GEOFF BENNETT: They voted overwhelmingly to end the church's bans on same-sex marriage and the ordination of LGBTQ clergy.

BISHOP TRACY MALONE, Council of Bishops President, United Methodist Church: And these decisions that have been made over these last few days is a testimony that we are claiming that we are a church where everyone belongs.

We are a church with open hearts, open minds and open doors.

GEOFF BENNETT: In 1972, the Methodists adopted language that ""the practice of homosexuality was incompatible with Christian teaching.""

In 1984, they banned clergy who are ""self-avowed practicing homosexuals.""

And, in 1996, the church prohibited clergy from officiating same-sex marriages.

MAN: We will not leave this church of Jesus Christ.

GEOFF BENNETT: After heated discussions at a conference in 2019, delegates voted to uphold those bans.

But in the years that followed, some 7,600 U.S. conservative Methodist congregations located mostly in the South left the church over its lack of enforcement of the anti-LGBTQ policies.

By 2022, the United Methodists had 5.4 million members in the U.S., less than half their peak in the 1960s.

The recent departures have seen that number drop even further.

For more on the significance of these changes, I spoke recently with the Reverend Valerie Jackson, the lead pastor at Park Hill United Methodist Church in Denver.

She joined the Methodist Church from the Baptist Church years ago.

I asked Reverend Jackson how the church lifting its bans has resonated with her.

REV.

DR. VALERIE JACKSON, Leader Pastor, Park Hill United Methodist Church: I didn't think I was really feeling the oppression of the rule until it was lifted.

And then, once it was lifted, I became aware of how much I embodied that oppression.

And it surprised me that, on the last day of the conference, I so freely danced.

I danced freely by myself in the middle of the assembly hall on the last day of general conference.

It was beautiful.

GEOFF BENNETT: When you say that you were embodying the oppression, help us understand what that means.

DR. VALERIE JACKSON: What that means is, even though I had the privilege of living in a conference, in a region where being LGBTQ was not criminalized, that, somewhere deep within me, I still knew that I was at risk, that my ordination was at risk, that a claim could be filed against me, that I could go to trial.

Somewhere deep within me, I knew that.

And so it's almost like looking over your shoulder unconsciously or subconsciously all day, every day, 365 days a year.

That's a lot of pressure.

GEOFF BENNETT: Nearly a quarter of the United Methodist Church broke away.

What is the impact of that on the church and really on the faith?

So the impact is grieving the loss of United Methodist siblings.

Even though we did not have the same theology or the same values, they were family.

And so you grieve the loss of family members.

On the other hand, it was liberating because it's like being in a marriage where you grow apart and you don't share the same vision for the lives that you have or the future that you're living into.

And so, when you finally make that courageous decision to separate and go your different ways, it's freeing, it's liberating, and it gives the space for people to live into being who they really are.

It's tiring to code-switch depending on who you're talking to and who is in the space.

Think about the time that it takes for the mind to take in, in seconds who is in the room and what you are allowed to say and what you should not say.

And to live like that is so profoundly tiring.

GEOFF BENNETT: What do you say, Reverend Jackson, to those conservative Methodists who argue that the church is now buying into the culture, that the Bible hasn't changed, but the church has changed?

DR. VALERIE JACKSON: The church is changing, and thank God.

The church is becoming aware of who God is, in comparison to who writers throughout generations have said about God and who those religious leaders that have been dear to us throughout the generations have also declared that God is.

I know what it's like as a former Baptist to be indoctrinated with a particular teaching and to not be able to see anything beyond that teaching.

So we are not responsible for the systems that we are born into, but we are accountable and responsible for the decision to remain in those systems.

And so I pray for my siblings, and I pray that they will one day be liberated and set free and come to experience the liberating, unconditional love and grace of God.

GEOFF BENNETT: Lastly, what does all of this mean for the clergy, for your congregants, and for the future of the United Methodist Church?

REV.

DR. VALERIE JACKSON: We are looking forward to preserving a church for the future, for those who are coming behind us that will not have to worry, can they walk through the doors?

We look forward to leaving a church where those who are in the LGBTQ community can walk into the church holding hands, can sit in the pews in each other's arms, just like those who are heteronormative?

There are so many things about being LGBTQ that we have to give up that those who are heteronormative never have to think about.

So we look forward to a church where all people will get to thrive in love, life and liberation.

GEOFF BENNETT: The Reverend Dr. Valerie Jackson is lead pastor at Park Hill United Methodist Church in Denver.

Thanks so much for your time and for your insights this evening.

DR. VALERIE JACKSON: Thank you so much for having me.

GEOFF BENNETT: This week, China's Xi Jinping and Russia's Vladimir Putin inaugurated a new era of partnership just before Taiwan inaugurates a new president on Monday.

A new book argues that Taiwan is at the center of China's challenge to U.S. power and influence in Asia.

Here's Nick Schifrin.

NICK SCHIFRIN: The Biden administration calls China the only country in the world with the will, intent and military strength to change the world order.

It says China threatens the U.S. and allied interests all over the world.

And now the U.S.' national security strategy prioritizes confronting China.

How did Washington and Beijing get to this point?

How strong are Washington and Beijing compared to each other?

And how should the U.S. approach its relationship to China?

Those questions are at the heart of a new book, ""World on the Brink: How America Can Beat China in the Race for the Twenty-First Century.""

The author is Dmitri Alperovitch, with Garrett Graff.

DMITRI ALPEROVITCH, Author, ""World on the Brink: How America Can Beat China in the Race for the Twenty-First Century"": Thank you.

NICK SCHIFRIN: You start the book with a scenario.

It's right after Election Day 2028, and Beijing decides to invade Taiwan.

Is that the future we're headed towards?

DMITRI ALPEROVITCH: Well, look, I think that period of 2028, potentially, through 2032, when you could see Xi Jinping at the twilight of his power -- he's going to be 79 in 2032, when he's up for Communist Party election once again.

And I believe that he wants to do it on his own watch, just like Putin wanted to invade Ukraine.

They don't only want to take these countries, Ukraine in the case of Putin, Taiwan in the case of China, but they want to be the ones to do it, because they want to go down into the pantheon of history and be presented as a great leaders of their country.

DMITRI ALPEROVITCH: When you compare it to the first Cold War, the similarities are just numerous.

We have an ideological struggle and authoritarians versus democracy that the Biden administration talks about.

You have an arms race, both a conventional one and a nuclear one.

And on top of all of this, you have a global competition for supremacy between the United States and China that plays out in the diplomatic sphere, in the military sphere, and in the economic sphere all over the world.

NICK SCHIFRIN: Let's go back to what you call a turning point.

You write that China achieving presence in the Spratly Islands and the South China Sea near the Philippines was -- quote -- ""a microcosm of the modern China challenge, America's failure to read China correctly, and its failure or disinterest in acting earlier to counter its rival's rise.""

Why?

DMITRI ALPEROVITCH: So the Chinese have been practicing this salami-slicing strategy, where they have been building up these artificial islands, encroaching on the disputed territories of Vietnam and now the Philippines, and building up military installations, even though at first they said that they had no interest in doing that.

And, today, you look at the South China Sea, it's become a lake for the Chinese Navy.

What they're trying to do now is do the same thing in the East China Sea.

NICK SCHIFRIN: So what should the U.S. do about this?

You describe the overall approach to China as this, an echo really of what the U.S. did to the Soviet Union, ""patiently practicing deterrence and waiting out the inevitable economic-driven decline.""

Why is that the overall approach?

DMITRI ALPEROVITCH: Look, we believe that we have all the strengths, and China is actually incredibly weak.

Its economy is in stagnation now.

It is fundamentally contained by U.S. allies and U.S. bases in the Pacific.

If China looks out at the world, it sees Korea, Japan, Taiwan, and the Philippines surrounded by U.S. military bases, U.S. allies, completely contained, and its navy is not able to get out to the broader Pacific without going through the choke points in the so-called first-island chain.

NICK SCHIFRIN: Militarily, though, as you know, there are some people who are worried the U.S. isn't doing enough, and that China actually would be able to practice the denial of U.S. ships in the territory that it claims as its own.

DMITRI ALPEROVITCH: Well, that's right, because even though we're stronger on paper or on spreadsheets, spreadsheets don't go to war.

And context matters.

And there's no question that we could defeat the Chinese military easily if we were fighting a battle in Atlantic.

But that's not the case.

We would be fighting if we do fight in East China Sea next to their shores, in the Taiwan Strait, and that's what they have been practicing and building capability for the last 40 years, and we're just now desperately trying to catch up.

NICK SCHIFRIN: Not only has the Biden administration expanded the military footprint, but also political agreements with Japan, South Korea, Australia, the Philippines, and between those countries.

Does that kind of thing deter Xi Jinping?

DMITRI ALPEROVITCH: It's all about creating dilemmas for him.

If he's thinking that there's going to be U.S. military forces shooting missiles at his ships crossing the strait from the Philippines, from Japan, from Guam, which is a little bit further out, potentially even on Taiwan itself, that's going to make this much more difficult.

DMITRI ALPEROVITCH: So a lot of people talk about chips, and chips are certainly important.

And Taiwan manufactures the vast majority of the advanced ships.

It's on the -- right next to Japan, right next to the Philippines.

Those countries would feel much less safe if China controls Taiwan and is able to project power on the eastern shore of Taiwan, across that Pacific, push the U.S. out all the way back to Hawaii, and establish dominance in the region, where you have 50 percent of the world's GDP, most of the supply chains, most of the economic growth.

NICK SCHIFRIN: This week, the Biden administration is announcing new tariffs on electric vehicles.

The Biden administration has continued most of the Trump era tariffs, which remain intact.

And you have to apply all elements of our power, military power, diplomatic, and economic, to try to deter him, to convince him that if -- even if he succeeds in taking Taiwan, the impact on the Chinese economy would be disastrous.

NICK SCHIFRIN: Do you believe Taiwan is taking enough steps to defend itself?

DMITRI ALPEROVITCH: I think they're moving in that direction, but too slowly.

And they're not focusing enough on asymmetric capabilities.

The key is to prevent Taiwan -- China from coming across the Taiwan Strait in significant numbers.

I believe, if they establish a presence on the Taiwanese island, it's game over.

If they're able to bring hundreds of thousands of troops, it's going to be very, very difficult for the Taiwanese to defend themselves.

But if they manage to sink those ships with mines, with anti-ship missiles, if they're able to defend their cities with air defense capabilities, I believe they can win.

NICK SCHIFRIN: And then, finally, is the U.S. doing enough to help Taiwan defend itself?

DMITRI ALPEROVITCH: I think, again, we're doing a lot.

The head of INDOPACOM, Admiral Paparo, I think, believes that he can defend Taiwan if he's so ordered, and we're certainly building up capabilities.

The INDOPACOM command that you just visited in Hawaii, they are preparing for war, and they're getting most of the resources right now.

And the key to this is the political decision.

Will the president, whoever is it's going to be in 2028 or beyond, will they order the Americans to fight for Taiwan?

And I think it's, at best, a 50/50 proposition.

NICK SCHIFRIN: Dmitri Alperovitch, the book is ""World on the Brink: How America Can Beat China in the Race for the Twenty-First Century.""

GEOFF BENNETT: President Biden and former President Trump agree to face off on the debate stage after months of back-and-forth.

On that and the other political stories shaping the week, we turn to the analysis tonight of Capehart and Johnson.

That's Jonathan Capehart, associate editor for The Washington Post, and Eliana Johnson, editor in chief of The Washington Free Beacon.

GEOFF BENNETT: So we have got a pair of debates on the books between President Biden and former President Trump, June 27 and September 10, debates that suddenly came together in a matter of minutes, it felt like, on Wednesday.

So the first, as you see there, is going to be hosted by CNN, the second hosted by ABC News.

The Biden campaign has also agreed to a vice presidential debate hosted by CBS this summer.

No agreement yet from the Trump campaign on that one, which has yet to name a V.P.

pick.

So, Jonathan, these debates will be unusual for a few reasons.

One, they're happening earlier than normal.

The Commission on Presidential Debates is not involved at all.

JONATHAN CAPEHART: Well, look, I think it benefits - - well, first, it benefits the American people.

Leave aside the Commission on Presidential Debates.

The point is, the American people need to see these two men debate the issues and let the American people see and judge for themselves who they want to vote for or not vote for, but you better vote.

Now, in terms of the specifics of the debate, President Biden got everything he wanted.

He taunts Donald Trump with a video out on Wednesday saying, hey, I hear you're free on Wednesday.

Donald Trump immediately agrees to do it after taunting weeks ago saying, ah, Joe Biden, he's not up to it.

He's never going to take the debate stage.

But, again, anyone who's been paying attention to Joe Biden knows that there was no way he was not going to debate Donald Trump.

And that leads to my big question.

Even though Donald Trump did agree to these two debates, I will believe it when I see it.

Do you think these debates are actually going to happen as planned?

ELIANA JOHNSON, Editor in Chief, The Washington Free Beacon: I do think they're going to happen.

And Trump had said, I will debate him any time, anywhere.

He then accepted the debate.

And the specifics of the proposal from the Biden campaign indicate clearly to me, I think, an effort to mitigate risk on their part.

They're taking place in June and then in September.

Typically, the debates take place much, much closer to the election.

They're going to be seen by a fewer number of people, because the first debate will take place on cable.

Typically, they're on public access channels that anybody can see.

So I think Biden wanted to show that he is able to debate.

But, if anything happens, he's got time to make a correction.

GEOFF BENNETT: And, Jonathan, Donald Trump has actually been downplaying expectations for President Biden, saying that he's the worst debater ever.

Because, typically, what you try to do is raise the expectations for your opponent going into something like this.

JONATHAN CAPEHART: Well, right.

But we're talking about Donald Trump, who never misses an opportunity to belittle someone he's afraid of, but just to belittle anyone.

And back to something Eliana just said, the key thing about these two debates is that they happen before early voting.

One of the big complaints has been, you have got these debates that are happening... JONATHAN CAPEHART: ... and people, some people have already voted, and some might regret the votes that they cast.

By having these debates in June and September, people get to see before they cast that first early ballot.

I think this is a great thing.

ELIANA JOHNSON: That's true, but, typically, they talk about an October surprise and a debate's impact on the election.

They're mitigating the chance that this could happen -- that that could happen by making them so far away.

JONATHAN CAPEHART: But October surprises happen like every Friday every week.

JONATHAN CAPEHART: So we should just get rid of the concept of October surprise.

GEOFF BENNETT: Well, it looks like we could get a decision from the jury and Donald Trump's historic criminal hush money trial as soon as next week.

Eliana, do you think that the prosecution so far has effectively made their case against Donald Trump?

ELIANA JOHNSON: Geoff, I would say I'm probably not the target audience for the prosecution here.

ELIANA JOHNSON: So I don't think they have effectively made their case, but they have -- it's a high bar.

They need to convince every one of those jurors.

And they have not been clear about what law it is that Trump violated.

The defense, it will be interesting to see how extensive of a case, if any, they mount, whether they call any witnesses.

It looks like they could rest their case without calling any witnesses, which would suggest they don't feel too threatened by this case in which the central witness, Michael Cohen, is not -- wouldn't say he's our idea of a stellar, upright citizen.

GEOFF BENNETT: And, Jonathan, this at the outset was seen as being the weakest of the four criminal cases facing Donald Trump, and yet it might be the only case that goes to trial and ends before the election.

JONATHAN CAPEHART: Right.

And that's why I think folks who have been putting down this case, I think, were wrong to do so.

The whole point is to hold Donald Trump accountable.

And now a jury of his peers are about to hold him accountable.

And anyone who thinks that this entire case rests on the credibility of Michael Cohen hasn't been paying attention to the case.

There's a reason why David Pecker, the former publisher of ""The National Enquirer,"" went first, to show, there was a culture here, there was a system here.

Stormy Daniels talked about the system.

Hope Hicks took the stand and talked about her work in that time.

All of these people clubbed Michael Cohen like he was a pinata in the week before he took the stand.

And I think that was for the sole purpose of getting it into the jury's head that Michael Cohen's not a good guy, and you're going to see a -- not a good guy take the stand.

And so just take all of that information in and then pay attention to the law and to what's at stake here.

And I think -- I think, the defense, I would love for them to make their case.

They're hammering Michael Cohen, but I have not heard them rebut any of the allegations against the former president.

And that's something I would love to see.

ELIANA JOHNSON: Their case is going to be that this isn't a crime.

And you talked about the other witnesses, Pecker, Hope Hicks.

Stormy Daniels was up there, talking about things that are not appropriate to repeat on this network.

But Michael Cohen is the key witnesses to the crime, which is the falsification of business records.

The other people named were not witness to the particular crime in question, and that's what the defense is going to focus on.

GEOFF BENNETT: In the time that remains, I want to talk about this reporting from The New York Times.

We learned yesterday that an upside-down American flag, which is the symbol that was used by some Trump supporters who challenged the legitimacy of Joe Biden's 2020 victory, that this upside-down flag hung outside the home of Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito.

I think we -- I hope we have the picture there published by The New York Times.

And Justice Alito issued the statement where he says: ""I had no involvement whatsoever in the flying of the flag.

It was briefly placed by Mrs. Alito in response to a neighbor's use of objectionable and personally insulting language on yard signs.""

And it's outrageous because this is a Supreme Court justice who, at the time that flag was flown, was sitting in judgment of a particular case involving the -- still, at that point, the sitting president.

The other thing is, could you imagine what would have happened if that flag was flying like that on the property of Ruth Bader Ginsburg or Ketanji Brown Jackson, someone from the liberal wing on the bench of the Supreme Court?

They would have been impeached.

And so the idea that we're supposed to accept Justice Alito's rationale here that, oh, my wife did it, it's unacceptable.

And I think it just feeds into the erosion of the trust and the standing of the Supreme Court with the American public.

GEOFF BENNETT: And, Eliana, apart from the ethical issues, there are dispassionate observers here who've said that the -- Alito doesn't deny that the flag was flying upside down.

ELIANA JOHNSON: Well, he has said that it involved a dispute -- his wife's dispute with a neighbor.

But let's stipulate, let's stipulate that his wife doesn't believe -- and I have no idea whether this is true -- his wife doesn't believe Joe Biden is the rightful victor of the 2020 election, and she flew the flag upside down in protest of that.

I don't think that the good liberal readers of The New York Times or viewers of this network would be willing to argue with a straight face that the views of a woman -- and she has not come out to say that she didn't do this - - are derivative of her husband's views.

My husband has nothing to do with the things I say on this network, and you can't have it both ways.

You cannot say that women are strong and should be out and employed and have their own views and that their husbands are responsible for everything they then go and do.

JONATHAN CAPEHART: Just, you -- I mean, liberals will do that because they're just using what conservatives have used as a cudgel against them.

And if that had happened, again, to RBG, they would be raining thunder calling for her resignation.

And I wouldn't -- I would have a hard time arguing with them.

GEOFF BENNETT: All right, Jonathan Capehart, Eliana Johnson, we thank you both.

GEOFF BENNETT: As college students wrap up the year, many reflect on what they learned in the classroom and what it means for their lives.

At the University of Notre Dame, a hugely popular course offering has very real-life implications.

Special correspondent Mike Cerre reports for our ongoing series at the intersection of health and arts, part of Canvas.

MIKE CERRE: From ""Animal House"" in the '80s to the more recent ""Hangover"" films... ACTOR: Oh, it's like college.

ACTOR: All right.

MIKE CERRE: ... pop culture and advertising's depiction of drinking is playing out on college campuses to a much more alarming degree than the toga parties of the past.

Nearly half of college students say they drink, and 30 percent say they binge-drink, according to a recent survey by the National Institute on Drug Abuse and Alcoholism.

Here on the campus of the University of Notre Dame, they are taking a more academic and intellectual approach to the issue, in addition to traditional counseling and disciplinary action.

The psychology department is teaming up with the film, television and theater department on a course that teaches students why they think drinking is so cool and why it's probably not.

MAN: Societally, people seem to condone your actions because you are drunk.

MIKE CERRE: ""Drunk on Film"" is a full-credit in person and online course with over 150 students on the wait-list each semester.

Psychology Professor Anre Venter and film and TV Professor Ted Mandell lead the students in their critiques of popular films featuring heavy drinking and its social and health consequences.

MAN: So what we want to focus on and what we, like, researched a little bit into is kind of this effect of depressed on depressants, obviously, since alcohol is a depressant.

MIKE CERRE: Along with pop culture favorites, the films include classics like ""It's A Wonderful Life"" and even some cartoons the students grow up with, like ""Beauty and the Beast.""

Professor Mandell believes film, TV and advertising have long cultivated the students' acceptance of drinking as part of normal life.

Where does total abstinence fit into this course?

TED MANDELL, Professor, University of Notre Dame: Nowhere.

Nowhere.

This course is -- to me, is about the ability to look at media and entertainment that you have been exposed to since you were 2 years old and reevaluate it and ask yourself, is this really the narrative of alcohol that's true?

Does alcohol really bring me community?

And to get students to look at narratives and reevaluate that and then compare that to what they are personally doing in college.

MIKE CERRE: Co-professor Anre Venter has a Ph.D. in clinical psychology and focuses more on the behavioral aspects of college drinking.

ANRE VENTER, Professor, University of Notre Dame: But isn't that what we often hear students talk about, drinking because of social anxiety?

MIKE CERRE: The professors are careful not to turn the ""Drunk on Film"" class into an intervention or therapy session that would more likely shut down the students, rather than open them up for the discussions, which are the key teaching moments.

ANRE VENTER: And we're not doing therapy in any way, shape, or form,.

But what we're, I think, getting the students to do is to begin to ask questions as to why?

Why do I do it this way?

MAN: Alcohol changes the relationship between what's called the hypothalamus and the pituitary ground and the adrenal.

MIKE CERRE: Related podcasts and nonfiction films addressing the health and social consequences of excessive drinking and are part of the mix of videos.

TED MANDELL: I want to welcome you to tonight's conversation with Holly Whitaker.

MIKE CERRE: Guest lecturers have included Holly Whitaker with The New York Times and bestselling author of ""Quit Like a woman,"" which highlights the added health and safety risks for female students drinking heavily on campuses.

HOLLY WHITAKER, Author, ""Quit Like a Woman"": I think that you are trained to become a participant in drinking culture.

We are trained to drink like this.

We're given images and those images are reinforced our entire lives.

MIKE CERRE: She and the course take on call traditions, like the football tailgating parties, often hosted by parents and adults, who she believes are often complicit in normalizing excessive student drinking as socially acceptable.

TED MANDELL: The phrase you can't be an alcoholic while you're in college is a very common.

People have heard that around here.

MIKE CERRE: Aedan Joel and Ava Bidner took the class last year and are now teaching assistants.

AVA BIDNER, Student: Yes, so we watched one called ""The Spectacular Now,"" which has Miles Teller as the main actor, and he plays a character called Sutton.

And it's really just about his relationship with alcohol and his story.

And you kind of see it gradually progress, where you don't really think his drinking is a problem.

And then, as you kind of go through the film, you see that he becomes just increasingly dependent on it and it really affects all aspects of his life.

AEDAN JOEL, Student: I was drinking freshman year and then after that started to kind of become curious as to whether or not, not drinking would be something that would fit into my own self-concept.

ANRE VENTER: As a social psychologist, we think that human behavior is a function of both the person and their environment.

Often, the environment is a more powerful predictor of behavior than the person's disposition.

TED MANDELL: I think the one thing when we started this class that truly surprised me was not that students drink in college, but the level of drinking that is normalized.

What is considered normal right now, I would never even think -- it wouldn't have crossed my mind when I was an undergraduate.

MIKE CERRE: Many students taking the course believe alcohol has taken on an oversized role in socializing on campus, at the expense of other activities.

Because so much of college life today is based on drinking, if you say, one of the premises of the course is that media has caused this new acceptance of a moral standard that probably doesn't really work for these kids, can media also correct it?

I mean, cigarettes for decades and decades were pushed on audiences as being socially desirable.

And then that narrative has changed.

MIKE CERRE: How many of you really didn't drink at all until you went to college?

There are no solid metrics for gauging the course's success in curbing alcohol abuse on campus.

But if the student's final exam, in the form of a personal essay, is any indication, Professors Mandell and Venter are confident they're on the right track.

AVA BIDNER: So, as I started thinking about all those things, I realized that we really all do have a relationship with alcohol, whether your choice is one way or the other.

And even just with my family and friends and all those different connections, I think it really does affect a lot of different parts of your lives, whether you realize it or not.

MIKE CERRE: For the ""PBS NewsHour,"" I'm Mike Cerre in South Bend, Indiana.

GEOFF BENNETT: Finally tonight, a major transition of note here at the ""NewsHour.""

Russ Clarkson, who has led our news team for nearly 25 years, is retiring.

Russ represents all that is great about the ""NewsHour.""

He and his team are the beating heart of this broadcast.

His editorial judgment and commitment to the highest standards have shaped the newsroom and helped us maintain the level of excellence we strive for every day.

His wisdom and experience have been invaluable, and his presence will be deeply missed.

There's a whole generation of journalists out there telling stories with graduate degrees from the school of Russ Clarkson under their belts, and our industry and our world are better for it.

Russ, Amna and I and the entire team thank you for everything that you have done for us here at the ""NewsHour"" and for being such a terrific colleague and friend.

We wish you and your wife, Karen (ph), the absolute best.

Here's to a wonderful retirement, friend.

Kherson was recaptured by Ukrainian forces in late 2022, months after Russian forces invaded Ukraine, but the region and its largest city have been under persistent Russian attacks since.

'Another resident of Kherson was killed by Russian shelling,' the region's governor Oleksandr Prokudin announced on social media, adding that a 72-year-old man had also been wounded in the attack.

Ukraine said earlier it had downed more than two dozen Russian drones overnight that targeted regions in the west, centre and south of the country.

The governor of the southern Mykolaiv region said debris from one drone damaged a private residence and left one woman with burns.

The Ukrainian air force said air defence systems intercepted the Iranian-style Shahed attack drones over the central Poltava region, the southern Odesa region on the Black Sea and the western Lviv region, bordering Poland.

Russia also fired an Iskander ballistic missile at the northeastern Kharkiv region, where Russian forces recently launched a ground offensive and captured several villages, the air force said.

Russian aerial attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure have forced providers to introduce rolling blackouts to limit consumption.

The Slovak Republic's government officially approved the plans for a new 1.2 GWe unit, near the existing Bohunice nuclear power plant, last week. The government asked the economy ministry to draw up details of the plan by the end of October. The government meeting and the decision took place last Wednesday, before Prime Minister Robert Fico was targeted in an assassination attempt. He is described as in a serious but stable condition and recovering in hospital.

Slovak Republic Foreign Minister Juraj BlanÃ¡r was on a visit to South Korea last week, and held talks with his South Korean counterpart Cho Tae-yul about expanding their bilateral cooperation to the status of strategic partnership.

The Slovak Republic's official TASR news agency reported BlanÃ¡r as saying: ""We also talked with our South Korean partner about the use of nuclear energy, in which Slovakia and South Korea see great potential. The Republic of Korea has extensive experience in the planning, construction and operation of nuclear power plants, so we welcome further discussion and consultations with the South Korean side.""

It added that the minister said that South Korea could be a potential partner in the construction of the new nuclear block, and that there was also discussion about small modular reactors, which Slovakia is considering.

Slovakia currently has five nuclear reactors - three at Mochovce and two at Bohunice - generating half of its electricity, and it has one more at Mochovce under construction. Both plants are operated by Slovenske Elektrarne.

In February last year JadrovÃ¡ EnergetickÃ¡ SpoloÄnosÅ¥ Slovenska (JESS) submitted a request to the Slovak Nuclear Regulatory Authority (ÃJD) for a siting permit for a new nuclear power plant near the existing Bohunice plant in JaslovskÃ© Bohunice, a small village in the west of the Slovak Republic. JESS - a joint venture between Slovak state-owned radioactive waste management company JAVYS (51%) and Czech utility ÄEZ (49%) - was formed in December 2009 to build and operate a new nuclear power plant at Bohunice.

JESS is responsible for the preparation of the New Nuclear Resource Project (NJZ) and, ""as part of the activities of the pre-preparation stage and in accordance with the approved Business Plan for the NJZ Project for the period 2022-2025, processed the necessary documentation for the written application for a permit for the location of a nuclear facility"". At the time of submitting the siting permit application JESS said it planned to apply for a construction licence for the plant at the end of 2025 with construction work scheduled to start in 2031.

JAVYS signed a framework cooperation agreement with France's EDF in August last year and a memorandum of understanding with the USA's Westinghouse the previous month, both relating to potential projects involving large scale units and small modular reactors. Associated Press reported last week that the Slovak Republic's economy minister Denisa Sakova had said there would be a tender to pick the supplier of the new unit, with Russia's Rosatom not allowed to compete.",world-nuclear-news.org,news,World Nuclear News (WNN),,0.1450980392156862,453914277,7,,

May 20 (Interfax) - Electricity shortage in the Ukrainian energy system has somewhat lessened owing to warmer and sunnier weather, although it is still considerable during evening and night hours, and therefore, hour-by-hour outage schedules could possibly be applied both to businesses and households in all parts of Ukraine from 6:00 p.m. to midnight, Ukrainian media have reported with reference to the national power grid operator Ukrenergo's post on its social account.

Outage schedules can be applied if customers exceed consumption limits, which Ukrenergo's dispatch center has set for each regional energy operator, it said.

It again urged customers to use electricity economically at any time.

The Energy Ministry said on its social account that Ukraine received emergency power supplies from Romania, Slovakia, and Poland early on Monday.

Ukrenergo said Ukraine had previously received emergency power supplies from Romania, Poland, and Slovakia from 0:01 a.m. to 8:00 a.m. and from 7:00 p.m. to 11:59 p.m. on Sunday. In addition, the Ukrainian energy system absorbed surplus electricity from Poland at a request from its power grid operator from 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. on Sunday.

Ukraine also increased commercial electricity imports by 50% to 19,499 MWh on Monday compared to Sunday. The country will be importing electricity from Romania, Slovakia, Poland, Hungary, and Moldova.

About 90% of Ukraine's power generation capacity has been taken out by Russian missile attacks, according to former minister of infrastructure Aleksey Kucherenko.

The situation is not expected to improve dramatically, as the damaged infrastructure cannot be restored quickly, the member of parliament warned during an interview with the YouTube channel Vishka.

Moscow began targeting Ukrainian energy infrastructure in the autumn of 2022, after Russia's Crimean Bridge was bombed that October.

In recent months Russia has intensified its strikes on Ukrainian military and energy facilities. In April, the Russian Defense Ministry said the bombardment was in response to Kiev's attempts to target Russian oil infrastructure. Since January, Ukraine has launched multiple long-range attacks on energy facilities deep inside Russia, including oil depots and refineries, using kamikaze drones.

In April, Russian President Vladimir Putin said Russia's strikes on energy facilities ""directly affect the defense industry of Ukraine,"" calling them part of ""demilitarization"" efforts. Moscow reiterated the attacks are only aimed at Ukrainian military targets and facilities that support their operations, and never at the civilian population.

To alleviate the pressure on the power grid, Ukraine has introduced temporary blackouts for industrial and household consumers in all regions. The nation has also ramped up imports of electricity from neighboring EU countries - Romania, Poland, Slovakia and Hungary - and also from Moldova.

Earlier this month, Ukrainian Energy Minister German Galushchenko claimed that the combined financial losses from Russian attacks amounted to more than $1 billion, and warned that the figure is likely to rise.

Even though the warm weather in recent days has lowered power usage and thus, the power deficit, the situation is said to remain critical.

""Thanks to warming and sunny weather, the deficit in the power system has decreased somewhat, but in the evening and night hours, the lack of electricity is significant.

""Because of this, today, May 20, for the period from 18:00 to 24:00 in all regions of Ukraine, there are hourly shutdown schedules for industrial and household consumers,"" read Ukrenergo's Telegram announcement.

The energy deficit is caused by Russian strikes on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, it said.

""We will remind you that the application of restrictive measures stems from the consequences of enemy missile attacks on Ukrainian power plants. From March 22 to May 8, the Russians targeted all large thermal and hydroelectric plants five times.

""Due to extensive damage, they cannot produce as much electricity as before the attacks began,"" it said, adding that Ukraine has been importing electricity from Romania, Slovakia, Poland, Hungary and Moldova to help cope with the deficit.

However, the power supply for critical infrastructure should not be affected, according to Ukrenergo's Facebook announcement made on Sunday evening.

Ukraine started to reintroduce nationwide energy restrictions in recent weeks following intensified Russian air strikes on Ukrainian energy infrastructure - enabled by the delay of Western air defense delivery - that has damaged or destroyed power plants and substations across the country.

An exclusive Kyiv Post report illustrates the aftermath of Russian strikes on the Trypillya Thermal Power Plant (TPP) in the Kyiv region in April; In early March this year, the Zmiyivska TPP in the Kharkiv region was also completely destroyed. Additionally, in July 2022, Russian troops occupied the Vuhlehirsk TPP in the Donetsk region.

On May 8, Ukraine announced plans to restrict power usage that evening, and it has since introduced multiple emergency blackouts across the country, including the western regions far from the front line.

Strikes kill 11 in Kharkiv under Russian offensive

It comes as Russian attacks on the Kharkiv region yesterday killed at least 11 people, authorities said.

Russian troops since May 10 have carried out a ground assault in the northeastern region, where they have achieved their largest territorial gains in the last 18 months.

Ukraine said it has stopped their progress - a claim contradicted by Russia.

Six people - including a pregnant woman - were killed on the outskirts of Kharkiv city by a missile attack launched from Russia's territory of Belgorod, Ukrainian authorities said.

Another 27 people were wounded in the strike on a recreation centre, with one employee missing, the prosecutor's office said.

""Among the wounded is a police officer and an ambulance paramedic who came to help people after the first hit,"" the Kharkiv prosecutor's office said.

It accused Russian forces of ""once again using the tactic of 'repeated strike'... aimed at killing civilians, law enforcement officers, medics, and rescuers.""

Russia has often been accused of using ""double tap"" attacks, in which a second strike follows shortly after the first, increasing the chances of casualties among those responding to the initial incident.

Russia insists it only targets military infrastructure.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russia of using its weapons to ""terrorise our cities and communities, to kill ordinary people"".

Mr Zelensky said Ukraine needed ""two Patriots for Kharkiv, (which) will fundamentally change the situation"", referring to the sophisticated US-made air-defence system.

Offensive in the Kharkiv region

Shortly afterwards, authorities reported another attack in the Kharkiv region.

""Five civilians were killed and nine injured as a result of shelling of Novoosynove and Kivsharivka villages with multiple rocket launchers,"" governor Oleg Synegubov said.

After launching increased aerial strikes, Russia carried out a ground assault in the border region on 10 May.

It had mostly been under control from Ukrainian forces, which pushed back Moscow's troops that had occupied the region between spring and autumn 2022.

However, Russian troops surged through defence lines on Friday, opening a new front with artillery and aircraft attacks, forcing thousands to flee.

Ukrainian police and volunteers evacuated just over 1,000 people in the region, Mr Synegubov said yesterday.

In his evening address, Mr Zelensky said his forces had strengthened their defences in the area.

""As a result of these days - of the whole week - we have secured stronger positions in the Kharkiv region,"" he said.

Ukraine's General Staff said Russian attacks in the Kharkiv area ""slowed down a bit"" on yesterday but that forces ""continue their attempts to break through our defences near Vovchansk, Starytsya and Lyptsi"".

Mr Zelensky also said ""brutal Russian shelling and missile attacks, attacks with guided aerial bombs continue every day. Sumy region, Kharkiv region. Donetsk region, Zaporizhzhia, Mykolaiv region, cities of Dnipropetrovsk region.""

Russia's defence ministry, which had claimed to have seized Starytsya, said its units ""continued to advance into the depth of the enemy's defences"".

Russian refinery attacked

Meanwhile, Russia said it shot down 61 Ukrainian drones overnight, most of them above the southern region of Krasnodar.

Six drones fell on the territory of the Slovyansk-on-Kuban refinery in the region and forced it to halt operations, its management and authorities said.

""There have been strikes. The plant is currently at a standstill. We are assessing the damage,"" Eduard Trutnev, the refinery head of security, told Interfax news agency.

The Slovyansk-on-Kuban refinery, in the Krasnodar region east of the Sea of Azov, is one of the biggest in southern Russia.

A Ukrainian defence source said its forces targeted the refinery and the Kushchyovsky military airfield.

""This is the second attack by (Ukraine's security service) drones on the Kushchyovsky military airfield and the Slovyansk refinery in the last three weeks,"" the source said.

""Several aircraft were hit at the airfield"" and the refinery complex was hit, the source added.

Ukrainian air attacks targeted the border region of Belgorod, injuring 11 including three children according to regional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov.

I suppose that's their right even though the information appears inaccurate, but when these official media channels are supposed to be the source of supreme truth and counterpoints are silenced, the hypocritical house of cards that is the EU effort to supposedly combat misinformation falls apart.

As far as I can see, there has been no reflection on this since the assassination attempt; instead media like AFP and the Financial Times subtly suggest ""divisive"" and ""toxic"" politics of Fico and others in Slovakia are to blame.

It's interesting that the EU censorship-industrial complex doesn't appear inclined to take a deeper look at this considering it's been hellbent on rooting out what they label misinformation in recent years. Consider that while the shooter is being described as a lone wolf, he was motivated - at least in part - by the Fico government's opposition to Project Ukraine. Here's CNN:

He said that the suspect told law enforcement officers that he disagreed with Fico's policies and that he decided to act after the recent presidential election, which saw a Fico ally - Pellegrini - emerge as the winner.

""The reasons (the suspect gave) were the decision to abolish the special prosecutor's office, the decision to stop supplying military assistance to Ukraine, the reform of public service broadcaster and the dismissal of the judicial council head,"" Å utaj EÅ¡tok said.

That means European officials and media who have been relentlessly hyping the Russian threat while simultaneously labeling Fico as pro-Russia, created an environment where Fico's opposition to supplying military assistance to Ukraine is treated as some unholy act and apparent motivation for the assassination attempt. Even the other issues that allegedly the shooter gave almost certainly received outsize negative media attention largely due to Fico's opposition to Project Ukraine.

Fico is a relatively standard center-left politician. The one difference - and it is a major one in today's Europe - is that he opposed Project Ukraine. His party, Smer, for example, was recently suspended from the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats group in the parliament for questioning NATO and its focus on bread and butter issues over identity politics. Why the opposition to Project Ukraine? It has been a disaster for Slovakia, which initially suffered from the biggest GDP growth revision in the entire EU -- dropping from five percent to 2.3 percent. More from the Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies:

Industry and automotive production have been badly affected and are in decline. Industrial production fell by almost 4% in the first seven months of 2022. The main manufacturing industry in Slovakia - the automotive sector - fared even worse, suffering a 6.3% decline in the same period. It is troubled by the continuing shortage of chips and the disruption of its supply chains: the Russian invasion of Ukraine has affected supply chains since March...

The damage to households is similar, according to Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung:

Rising energy prices have been challenging not only for households (where there is a risk of increased energy poverty), but also for industry (due to risk of suspension of production or of higher costs) and municipalities. While financial compensations of high energy bills could be among short-term solutions (financial compensations for industry, households, and municipalities were agreed by the government by the end of 202225), it is unsustainable from the point of view of long-term public finances. Well-targeted measures and policies to protect vulnerable consumers on the one hand and decreased energy demand on the other should be among the key solutions. In December 2022 the government had debated the materials drafted by the Regulatory Office for Network Industries, which proposed a definition of energy poverty, pointing out that nearly one out of four Slovak households live in energy poverty.

Slovakia is still dependent on Russian nuclear fuel, but is being pushed by the EU to diversify options; the problem is there aren't options readily available.

Slovakia has been unable to figure a way out of the mess without severe pain for its citizens or blowing holes in the national budget. The government set aside 1.25 billion euros for this year in an effort to prevent a 20 percent hike in household electricity charges, but that leads to other problems. From Euractiv:

The European Commission expected Slovakia will put an end to the energy aid but in 2023, the net budgetary cost of these energy measures was projected at 2.1 %. Even with the prediction counting on these measures to be phased out, the general government deficit is expected to increase to 6.5 % of GDP in 2024, the highest in the EU, according to the latest EU economic forecast.

Meanwhile the European Commission is insisting on stricter fiscal rules for European nations, which will likely only worsen the economic pain already being felt by millions across the bloc largely due to the economic war against Russia. In February, a last-minute agreement between the European Commission and Parliament will force EU member states to slash debt ratios and deficits while maintaining investment in ""strategic areas such as digital, green, social or defense.""

At the same time, according to Bloomberg, EU officials and investors are using the fiscal rules to push for an EU-wide bond program that would bring the investors big time profits while allowing the bloc to ramp up military spending without individual nations incurring more debt.

After years of using the escape clause in order to deal with the economic fallout of the pandemic, the return of fiscal rules in the form of the new ""economic governance"" framework might help the EU get its coveted war bonds, it will also mean more austerity. - especially for those nations with high public debt ratios, which now includes Slovakia.

Despite all that, it's the questioning of the NATO line and opposition to digging the Project Ukraine hole even deeper that got Fico and Smer in hot water with the Atlanticists that run Europe nowadays.

Fico and Smer are relentlessly labeled pro-Russia for nothing more than their belief that Project Ukraine is not good for Slovakia. Not that there's anything wrong with being pro-Russia, but since when does not wanting to go to war with Russia make one ""pro-Russia""? And when Putin is compared to Hitler on a daily basis, these become dangerous charges to repeatedly level against a politician like Fico.

So we find ourselves in a situation where in Europe you now need to use a VPN to access Russian news sites like RT and Sputnik, which have been banned to save minds from misinformation. Meanwhile, our trusted sources have been peddling this de facto Fico=Putin=Hitler line for the better part of a year. A brief sampling, but the examples are near endless:

What Putin learned from Hitler The New Statesman. September 12, 2023.

Leaving the comparisons of Putin to Hitler for another day, there is no evidence that I've been able to find that Fico has any sort of connection to Russia aside from being a head of state that interacts with Russia.

The fact is he's a politician who campaigned on what he believed were in the best interests of Slovakia, which included ending support for Project Ukraine and all the economic harm that has meant for Slovakia, Europe, and especially working class Europeans, and he was elected on that platform.

One would think that an EU so concerned with misinformation would be going after all these media outlets that parroted this pro-Russia line. Obviously, that isn't going to happen, though, and we all know why.

Crossing Red Lines on the Homefront

For the past few years the EU and individual countries have been destroying democratic rights at home in their quest for ""freedom"" for Ukraine. Events airing any Russian point of view (or Palestinian) are frequently banned and the crackdown on online speech continues to pick up steam.

This nonsensical and repressive climate is maybe best summed up by the following lines from the Washington-based Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA), which argues that no one can be allowed to hide behind quaint ideas like freedom of speech:

Organizers of pro-Russian events meanwhile invoke democratic rights and freedom of speech in response to criticism...Allowing Kremlin disinformation agents to operate freely has nothing to do with freedom of speech.

In fact, it has everything to do with freedom of speech because what CEPA labels ""Kremlin disinformation agents"" are simply individuals that dare question the official line on Russia and Ukraine. And the EU Digital Services Act is coming for what's left of freedom of speech, as Nick Corbishley recently described:

The goal of the DSA is to combat -- i.e., suppress -- mis- and disinformation online, not just in Europe but potentially across the world, and is part of a broader trend of Western governments actively pushing to censor information on the Internet as they gradually lose control over key narrative threads.

Or here's European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen salivating over these new tools at her disposal:

These are acts of scared people who know their reasons for war are bogus, and they're afraid the plebs will realize that and punish them for their epic malfeasance. So instead it's become commonplace to hide behind misinformation or disinformation - blanket terms for anything that tries to tap the brakes on war with Russia. Facts, opinions, warnings - they're all dangerous and should be banned.

It has become so pervasive it's almost difficult to pick out the most egregious examples of inconvenient facts being labeled Russian misinfo. Here's one that was true before it became untrue and fell under the Russian misinfo umbrella: that neo-Nazis are a major part of the government and armed forces of Ukraine. Nowadays, here's the German Federal Ministry of the Interior and Community listing Russian disinformation and ""the facts"":

They are in fact neo-Nazis, and they're neo-Nazis in a country where the government is[checks watch] no longer democratically elected as the president's term is up today but elections were cancelled. And they're neo-Nazis who might be looking for a new home soon as Ukraine continues to lose the war, and they potentially flee the country. Who knows what kind of mischief the Ukrainian Nazis and those they inspire throughout Western Europe will get up to, especially in an environment where the shooting of Fico is treated as divine justice. We now have Sky News basically saying Fico got what he deserved:

There's a lot of talk about red lines in Ukraine laid down by Russia or the other side, but increasingly the West is speeding past lines that only a few years ago would have been considered dangerous to cross - and they're all at home.

The EU placed all its bets on Uncle Sam, Project Ukraine, and the dream of plundering Russia; and now has nowhere to go and no power to do anything except become more repressive, destroying it's supposed ideals, its working class, their standard of living, destroying welfare states and social cohesion.

The crackdown on democratic rights is coming so fast now it's almost difficult to keep up. The Fico assassination looks like a byproduct of this climate of fear, and in hindsight might serve as a milestone on the road to a Europe at war with itself.",nakedcapitalism.com,news,naked capitalism,Conor Gallagher,-0.1686274509803921,453884937,64,https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Screenshot-2024-05-17-at-5.46.51â¯PM-1024x193.png,eng-9593264

DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) -- The first distribution of badly needed aid is expected to begin this weekend after rolling off a newly built U.S. pier off the coast of Gaza. But aid workers warn much more access is needed to the besieged territory where famine might be under way. United Nations officials have not said where the truckloads of food would be distributed. Israel's war with the Hamas militant group is now in its eighth month, and there is growing pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu from multiple fronts. The U.S. national security adviser is expected to meet with Netanyahu this weekend.

Jesus is their savior, Trump is their candidate. Ex-president's backers say he shares faith, values

Donald Trump's support from white evangelicals and other conservative Christians is as strong as ever. And he's increasingly infusing his campaign events with Christian rhetoric and imagery. In some ways, this is a familiar story. The former president won about 8 in 10 white evangelical Christians' votes in 2016 and 2020. He has maintained support from this group in early primary contests this year, even though Republican voters had several openly conservative Christian candidates to choose from. None of them faced the legal troubles and misconduct allegations he does. This frustrates the minority of conservative evangelicals who see Trump as a poser and would-be authoritarian.

Ukraine's divisive mobilization law comes into force as a new Russian push strains front-line troops

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) -- A divisive mobilization law in Ukraine has come into force as Kyiv struggles to boost troop numbers after Russia launched a new offensive that some fear could close in on Ukraine's second-largest city. The legislation, which was watered down from its original draft, will make it easier to identify every conscript in the country. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also signed separate laws Friday that allow prisoners to join the army and increase fines for draft dodgers fivefold. Thousands of Ukrainians have fled the country to escape the draft, and some risked their lives as they tried to swim across a river to neighboring Romania and Hungary.

Noncitizen voting, already illegal in federal elections, becomes a centerpiece of 2024 GOP messaging

NEW YORK (AP) -- In recent months, the specter of people who aren't American citizens and are voting in the United States has become a rallying cry for Republicans. They say new legislation is necessary to protect the sanctity of the vote as the country faces unprecedented illegal immigration at the U.S.-Mexico border. Voting by people who aren't U.S. citizens is illegal in federal elections, and there is no indication it's happening anywhere in significant numbers. States have mechanisms to check whether voters on their rolls are citizens. Still, Republicans at the federal and state level are introducing legislation and fall ballot measures to ensure it remains at the forefront of voters' minds in November.

For decades, states have taken foster children's federal benefits. That's starting to change

JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) -- States have for decades been using foster children's federal Social Security benefits to help cover the costs of state services. The practice has saved states millions of dollars. But that's beginning to change in some states under pressure from child advocates who contend it is immoral and detrimental to kids. Since 2018, at least a dozen states have taken some steps to either halt, scale back or provide greater notice of their use of children's benefits to cover required foster care costs. Some states have enacted laws requiring those funds to instead be set aside for the child's future needs as they transition to adulthood.

US intelligence suggests American who vanished in Syria in 2017 has died, daughter says she was told

WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. officials have developed highly credible intelligence suggesting that an American citizen who disappeared seven years ago while traveling in Syria has died. That word comes from the man's daughter. Maryam Kamalmaz said in an interview Saturday with The Associated Press that during a meeting in Washington earlier this month with eight senior American officials she was presented with detailed intelligence about the presumed death of her father, Majd. The Texas psychotherapist disappeared in 2017 while traveling in Syria to visit an elderly family member. The FBI has said he was stopped at a Syrian government checkpoint in a suburb of Damascus and hasn't been heard from since.

Suspected would-be assassin ordered detained as Slovak prime minister's condition is stable

PEZINOK, Slovakia (AP) -- The man accused of attempting to assassinate Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico has been ordered to remain behind bars. Fico is in serious but stable condition after surviving multiple gunshot wounds. A court spokesperson said Saturday prosecutors said they feared that if released the suspect could flee or carry out other crimes. Prosecutors told police not to publicly identify the man or release other details about the case, but unconfirmed media reports said he is a 71-year-old retiree known as an amateur poet who may have once worked as a mall security guard in the country's southwest. A government minister says Fico's condition is stable but he is still too ill to be transferred to the capital, Bratislava.

Donald Trump will address the NRA in Texas. He's called himself the best president for gun owners

DALLAS (AP) -- Former President Donald Trump is expected to address thousands of members of the National Rifle Association in Texas a day after campaigning in Minnesota in the midst of his hush money trial. Trump has pledged to continue to defend the Second Amendment and has called himself ""the best friend gun owners have ever had in the White House."" The United States faces record numbers of deaths due to mass shootings. Last year ended with 42 mass killings and 217 deaths, making it one of the deadliest years on record. Vice President Kamala Harris is accusing Trump of ""catering to the gun lobby and threatening to make the crisis worse if reelected.""

Widespread power outages from deadly Houston storm raise new risk: hot weather

HOUSTON (AP) -- As the Houston area works to clean up and restore power to thousands after deadly storms that left at least seven dead, it will do so under a smog warning and as southern Texas starts to feel the heat. The National Weather Service in Houston warned that with temperatures around 90 degrees this weekend, people should know the symptoms of heat exhaustion as they start cleaning up. The balmy weather is a concern in a region where more than a half-million homes and businesses remained without electricity Saturday morning. The area was hit with fierce storms Thursday with winds of up to 100 miles per hour.

But two more women filed lawsuits alleging sexual abuse from Combs about a week later. More suits followed between December and February.

For decades, states have taken foster children's federal benefits. That's starting to change

JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) -- States have for decades been using foster children's federal Social Security benefits to help cover the costs of state services. The practice has saved states millions of dollars. But that's beginning to change in some states under pressure from child advocates who contend it is immoral and detrimental to kids. Since 2018, at least a dozen states have taken some steps to either halt, scale back or provide greater notice of their use of children's benefits to cover required foster care costs. Some states have enacted laws requiring those funds to instead be set aside for the child's future needs as they transition to adulthood.

US intelligence suggests American who vanished in Syria in 2017 has died, daughter says she was told

WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. officials have developed highly credible intelligence suggesting that an American citizen who disappeared seven years ago while traveling in Syria has died. That word comes from the man's daughter. Maryam Kamalmaz said in an interview Saturday with The Associated Press that during a meeting in Washington earlier this month with eight senior American officials she was presented with detailed intelligence about the presumed death of her father, Majd. The Texas psychotherapist disappeared in 2017 while traveling in Syria to visit an elderly family member. The FBI has said he was stopped at a Syrian government checkpoint in a suburb of Damascus and hasn't been heard from since.

Suspected would-be assassin ordered detained as Slovak prime minister's condition is stable

PEZINOK, Slovakia (AP) -- The man accused of attempting to assassinate Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico has been ordered to remain behind bars. Fico is in serious but stable condition after surviving multiple gunshot wounds. A court spokesperson said Saturday prosecutors said they feared that if released the suspect could flee or carry out other crimes. Prosecutors told police not to publicly identify the man or release other details about the case, but unconfirmed media reports said he is a 71-year-old retiree known as an amateur poet who may have once worked as a mall security guard in the country's southwest. A government minister says Fico's condition is stable but he is still too ill to be transferred to the capital, Bratislava.

Donald Trump will address the NRA in Texas. He's called himself the best president for gun owners

DALLAS (AP) -- Former President Donald Trump is expected to address thousands of members of the National Rifle Association in Texas a day after campaigning in Minnesota in the midst of his hush money trial. Trump has pledged to continue to defend the Second Amendment and has called himself ""the best friend gun owners have ever had in the White House.""

Vice President Kamala Harris is accusing Trump of ""catering to the gun lobby and threatening to make the crisis worse if reelected.""

Widespread power outages from deadly Houston storm raise new risk: hot weather

HOUSTON (AP) -- As the Houston area works to clean up and restore power to thousands after deadly storms that left at least seven dead, it will do so under a smog warning and as southern Texas starts to feel the heat. The National Weather Service in Houston warned that with temperatures around 90 degrees this weekend, people should know the symptoms of heat exhaustion as they start cleaning up. The balmy weather is a concern in a region where more than a half-million homes and businesses remained without electricity Saturday morning. The area was hit with fierce storms Thursday with winds of up to 100 miles per hour.

Ukraine's divisive mobilization law comes into force as a new Russian push strains front-line troops

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) -- A divisive mobilization law in Ukraine has come into force as Kyiv struggles to boost troop numbers after Russia launched a new offensive that some fear could close in on Ukraine's second-largest city. The legislation, which was watered down from its original draft, will make it easier to identify every conscript in the country. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also signed separate laws Friday that allow prisoners to join the army and increase fines for draft dodgers fivefold. Thousands of Ukrainians have fled the country to escape the draft, and some risked their lives as they tried to swim across a river to neighboring Romania and Hungary.

Noncitizen voting, already illegal in federal elections, becomes a centerpiece of 2024 GOP messaging

NEW YORK (AP) -- In recent months, the specter of people who aren't American citizens and are voting in the United States has become a rallying cry for Republicans.

Voting by people who aren't U.S. citizens is illegal in federal elections, and there is no indication it's happening anywhere in significant numbers.

Here's how Robert F. Kennedy Jr. could make the first debate stage under stringent Biden-Trump rules

PHOENIX (AP) -- To make the first debate stage, Robert F. Kennedy has to secure a ballot place in at least a dozen more states and improve his showing in national polls. And he has just one month to do it. That's due to rules set by the presidential campaigns of Joe Biden and Donald Trump, who bypassed the nonpartisan debate commission. Kennedy has already reached two of the four poll results he needs. But ballot access is his biggest hurdle. Adding up all the states that have confirmed he's on the ballot or where he says he has eligibility totals 201 votes in the Electoral College. CNN is requiring that candidates be on the ballot in states adding up to 270 votes.

Flash floods due to unusually heavy seasonal rains kill at least 68 people in Afghanistan

ISLAMABAD (AP) -- Taliban officials say flash floods from heavy seasonal rains have killed at least 68 people in Afghanistan, adding the death toll was based on preliminary reports. In the hard-hit western province of Ghor, 50 people were reported dead. The province has also suffered significant financial losses after thousands of homes and properties were damaged and hundreds of hectares of agricultural land destroyed following Friday's floods.

Landslide forces closure of iconic Southern California chapel designed by Frank Lloyd Wright's son

RANCHO PALOS VERDES, Calif. (AP) -- A decades-old landslide that's rapidly accelerating has forced the dismantling of an iconic Southern California chapel known for its glass frame built among soaring redwoods and sweeping Pacific Ocean views. The earth beneath The Wayfarers Chapel in Rancho Palos Verdes is moving an unprecedented 2 feet or more each month. Intended to celebrate the natural world, the chapel is instead being destroyed by it. The chapel was designated as a National Historic Landmark in December 2023 and closed just two months later from the worsening effects of the 1956 Portuguese Bend landslide. Restoration is expected to cost at least $20 million.

Prosecutors told police not to publicly identify the man or release other details about the case, but unconfirmed media reports said he was a 71-year-old retiree known as an amateur poet who may have once worked as a mall security guard in the country's southwest. A government minister says Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico's condition is stable but serious.

Here's how Robert F. Kennedy Jr. could make the first debate stage under stringent Biden-Trump rules

PHOENIX (AP) -- To make the first debate stage, Robert F. Kennedy has to secure a ballot place in at least a dozen more states and improve his showing in national polls. And he has just one month to do it. That's due to rules set by the presidential campaigns of Joe Biden and Donald Trump, who bypassed the nonpartisan debate commission. Kennedy has already reached two of the four poll results he needs. But ballot access is his biggest hurdle. Adding up all the states that have confirmed he's on the ballot or where he says he has eligibility totals 201 votes in the Electoral College. CNN is requiring that candidates be on the ballot in states adding up to 270 votes.

Donald Trump will address the NRA in Texas. He's called himself the best president for gun owners

DALLAS (AP) -- Former President Donald Trump is expected to address thousands of members of the National Rifle Association in Texas a day after campaigning in Minnesota in the midst of his hush money trial. Trump has pledged to continue to defend the Second Amendment and has called himself ""the best friend gun owners have ever had in the White House."" The United States faces record numbers of deaths due to mass shootings. Last year ended with 42 mass killings and 217 deaths, making it one of the deadliest years on record. Vice President Kamala Harris is accusing Trump of ""catering to the gun lobby and threatening to make the crisis worse if reelected.""

Widespread power outages from deadly Houston storm raise new risk: hot weather

HOUSTON (AP) -- As the Houston area works to clean up and restore power to thousands after deadly storms that left at least seven dead, it will do so Saturday under a smog warning and as southern Texas starts to feel the heat. The National Weather Service in Houston warned that with temperatures around 90 degrees this weekend, people should know the symptoms of heat exhaustion as they start cleaning up. The balmy weather is a concern in a region where more than a half-million homes and businesses remained without electricity Saturday morning. The area was hit with fierce storms Thursday with winds of up to 100 miles per hour.

Landslide forces closure of iconic Southern California chapel designed by Frank Lloyd Wright's son

RANCHO PALOS VERDES, Calif. (AP) -- A decades-old landslide that's rapidly accelerating has forced the dismantling of an iconic Southern California chapel known for its glass frame built among soaring redwoods and sweeping Pacific Ocean views. The earth beneath The Wayfarers Chapel in Rancho Palos Verdes is moving an unprecedented 2 feet or more each month. Intended to celebrate the natural world, the chapel is instead being destroyed by it. The chapel was designated as a National Historic Landmark in December 2023 and closed just two months later from the worsening effects of the 1956 Portuguese Bend landslide. Restoration is expected to cost at least $20 million.

Ukraine's divisive mobilization law comes into force as a new Russian push strains front-line troops

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) -- A divisive mobilization law in Ukraine has come into force as Kyiv struggles to boost troop numbers after Russia launched a new offensive that some fear could close in on Ukraine's second-largest city. The legislation, which was watered down from its original draft, will make it easier to identify every conscript in the country. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also signed separate laws Friday that allow prisoners to join the army and increase fines for draft dodgers fivefold. Thousands of Ukrainians have fled the country to escape the draft, and some risked their lives as they tried to swim across a river to neighboring Romania and Hungary.

Noncitizen voting, already illegal in federal elections, becomes a centerpiece of 2024 GOP messaging

NEW YORK (AP) -- In recent months, the specter of people who aren't American citizens and are voting in the United States has become a rallying cry for Republicans. They say new legislation is necessary to protect the sanctity of the vote as the country faces unprecedented illegal immigration at the U.S.-Mexico border. Voting by people who aren't U.S. citizens is illegal in federal elections, and there is no indication it's happening anywhere in significant numbers. States have mechanisms to check whether voters on their rolls are citizens. Still, Republicans at the federal and state level are introducing legislation and fall ballot measures to ensure it remains at the forefront of voters' minds in November.

For decades, states have taken foster children's federal benefits. That's starting to change

JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) -- States have for decades been using foster children's federal Social Security benefits to help cover the costs of state services. The practice has saved states millions of dollars. But that's beginning to change in some states under pressure from child advocates who contend it is immoral and detrimental to kids. Since 2018, at least a dozen states have taken some steps to either halt, scale back or provide greater notice of their use of children's benefits to cover required foster care costs. Some states have enacted laws requiring those funds to instead be set aside for the child's future needs as they transition to adulthood.

Health Minister Zuzana Dolinkova said Saturday that two-hour surgery to remove dead tissue from multiple gunshot wounds ""contributed to a positive prognosis"" for Fico. Defense Minister Robert Kalinak says his condition still makes it impossible to transport him to the capital, Bratislava. The update was issued as prosecutors sought to detain the man accused of shooting Fico in an assassination attempt.

Kennedy has already reached two of the four poll results he needs. But ballot access is his biggest hurdle. Adding up all the states that have confirmed he's on the ballot or where he says he has eligibility totals 201 votes in the Electoral College. CNN is requiring that candidates be on the ballot in states adding up to 270 votes.

JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) -- States have for decades been using foster children's federal Social Security benefits to help cover the costs of state services. The practice has saved states millions of dollars. But that's beginning to change in some states under pressure from child advocates who contend it is immoral and detrimental to kids. Since 2018, at least a dozen states have taken some steps to either halt, scale back or provide greater notice of their use of children's benefits to cover required foster care costs. Some states have enacted laws requiring those funds to instead be set aside for the child's future needs as they transition to adulthood.

Mauhaumad Ovais, a resident of Karachi spoke about no electricity for a longer duration in those parts of the country where the people could not afford to pay inflated bills, power cut in Karachi continues for about eight hours.

Mauhaumad Ovais said, ""The situation in terms of load shedding in Karachi has yet not improved, a general power cut in the city is about eight hours long. And even then we have to pay such high electricity bills. The middle-income person could either pay his bills, educate his children, or pay for their medical bills.""

People are suffering and daily life is being affected. Many heavy electricity-consuming appliances such as refrigerators, freezers and even UPSs are short-circuiting and being destroyed due to the intermittent outages.

""The government is cutting corners on basic amenities like waste collection and treatment which is making the people fall ill. Even after all this when we default on our bills once while combating inflation and high bills. We are warned and threatened that our electricity supply will be cut,"" he added.

Ahmed, another resident of Karachi, raised similar issues of electricity and stated that a monopoly is being maintained. He called for the government's intervention and breaking the monopoly by introducing other private companies to create a little competition in the market.

Through a network spanning 6,500 square kilometres, KE supplies power to all residential, commercial, industrial and agricultural areas that fall under the city's ambit and beyond, serving over 3.4 million customers across Karachi.

Ahmed said, ""There is just one company that is supplying electricity, and they are not allowing any other company to enter the market so that their monopoly continues. The people are suffering from extreme temperatures here, and the government had assured us that there would be no load shedding until this heat wave passes, but still, there is load shedding of several hours.""

""The government needs to intervene and break the monopoly by introducing other private companies, as a little competition in the market will be better for the general public. We have raised the complaints of wrongful billing to the authorities but either they don't pay attention or say that we have to pay the amount. In both ways, we suffer a lot, we have to compensate for the electricity with other important expenses like medical, or educational,"" he added.

Niaz, another resident, echoed similar remarks and added that the Sindh administration does not want to address the problem. He said that people have been facing several basic problems like roads, electricity, cleanliness, and drinking water.

Niaz said, ""Be it the problems of Karachi or the problems of Sindh both of them are the same. There are several basic problems, like roads, electricity, cleanliness, and drinking water. If the government had longed to solve the problems of the people, then these problems would have been solved a long time ago.""

""However, I believe that the Sindh administration does not want these issues of the people to be resolved. We have also been demanding a relief package but there is no action taken towards it,"" he added.

Commercial, as well as household work, is being affected, with people losing sleep as well due to long hours of load shedding in the night with the accompanying heat.

The legislation, which was watered down from its original draft, will make it easier to identify every conscript in the country.

Noncitizen voting, already illegal in federal elections, becomes a centerpiece of 2024 GOP messaging

NEW YORK (AP) -- In recent months, the specter of noncitizens voting in the U.S. has erupted into a leading rallying cry for Republicans. They say new legislation is necessary to protect the sanctity of the vote as the country faces unprecedented illegal immigration at its southern border. Noncitizen voting already is illegal in federal elections, and there is no indication it's happening anywhere in significant numbers. States have mechanisms to check whether voters on their rolls are citizens. Still, Republicans at the federal and state level are introducing legislation and fall ballot measures to ensure it remains at the forefront of voters' minds in November.

Donald Trump will address the NRA in Texas. He's called himself the best president for gun owners

DALLAS (AP) -- Former President Donald Trump is expected to address thousands of members of the National Rifle Association in Texas a day after campaigning in Minnesota in the midst of his hush money trial. Trump has pledged to continue to defend the Second Amendment and has called himself ""the best friend gun owners have ever had in the White House.""

For decades, states have taken foster children's federal benefits. That's starting to change

JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) -- States have for decades been using foster children's federal Social Security benefits to help cover the costs of state services. The practice has saved states millions of dollars. But that's beginning to change in some states under pressure from child advocates who contend it is immoral and detrimental to kids. Since 2018, at least a dozen states have taken some steps to either halt, scale back or provide greater notice of their use of children's benefits to cover required foster care costs. Some states have enacted laws requiring those funds to instead be set aside for the child's future needs as they transition to adulthood.

The Slovak prime minister is stable after 'miracles' in the hospital as suspect appears in court

PEZINOK, Slovakia (AP) -- A government minister says Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico's condition is stable but serious as the man accused of trying to assassinate him faced his first court appearance. Health Minister Zuzana Dolinkova said Saturday that two-hour surgery to remove dead tissue from multiple gunshot wounds ""contributed to a positive prognosis"" for Fico. Defense Minister Robert Kalinak says his condition still makes it impossible to transport him to the capital, Bratislava. The update was issued as prosecutors sought to detain the man accused of shooting Fico in an assassination attempt.

Here's how Robert F. Kennedy Jr. could make the first debate stage under stringent Biden-Trump rules

PHOENIX (AP) -- To make the first debate stage, Robert F. Kennedy has to secure a ballot place in at least a dozen more states and improve his showing in national polls. And he has just one month to do it. That's due to rules set by the presidential campaigns of Joe Biden and Donald Trump, who bypassed the nonpartisan debate commission. Kennedy has already reached two of the four poll results he needs. But ballot access is his biggest hurdle. Adding up all the states that have confirmed he's on the ballot or where he says he has eligibility totals 201 votes in the Electoral College. CNN is requiring that candidates be on the ballot in states adding up to 270 votes.

Flash floods due to unusually heavy seasonal rains kill at least 50 people in western Afghanistan

ISLAMABAD (AP) -- A Taliban official says flash floods from heavy seasonal rains in western Afghanistan have killed at least 50 people and dozens remain missing, adding the death toll was based on preliminary reports and might rise. The hard-hit province of Ghor has suffered significant financial losses, said Abdul Wahid Hamas, spokesman for the provincial governor, after thousands of homes and properties were damaged and hundreds of hectares of agricultural land destroyed following Friday's floods. Last week, the U.N. food agency said the exceptionally heavy rains in Afghanistan have killed more than 300 people, mostly in the province of Baghlan.

Widespread power outages from deadly Houston storm raise new risk: hot weather

HOUSTON (AP) -- As the Houston area works to clean up and restore power to thousands after deadly storms, it will do so Saturday under a smog warning and as all of southern Texas starts to feel the heat. The National Weather Service in Houston warned that with temperatures hitting around 90 degrees this weekend, people should know the symptoms of heat exhaustion and not ""overdo yourself during the cleanup process."" The balmy weather is a concern in a region where more than 555,000 homes and businesses remained without electricity Friday night. The area was hit with fierce storms Thursday with winds of up to 100 miles per hour.

Landslide forces closure of iconic Southern California chapel designed by Frank Lloyd Wright's son

RANCHO PALOS VERDES, Calif. (AP) -- A decades-old landslide that's rapidly accelerating has forced the dismantling of an iconic Southern California chapel known for its glass frame built among soaring redwoods and sweeping Pacific Ocean views. The earth beneath The Wayfarers Chapel in Rancho Palos Verdes is moving an unprecedented 2 feet or more each month. Intended to celebrate the natural world, the chapel is instead being destroyed by it.

Israeli army finds bodies of 3 hostages in Gaza killed at Oct. 7 music festival

JERUSALEM (AP) -- The Israeli military says its troops in Gaza found the bodies of three Israeli hostages killed by Hamas in its Oct. 7 attack, including German-Israeli Shani Louk. A photo of Louk's twisted body in the back of a pickup truck ricocheted around the world, bringing to light the scale of the Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel. The military on Friday identified the other two bodies found as those of a 28-year-old woman, Amit Buskila, and a 56-year-old man, Itzhak Gelerenter. Military spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said all three were killed by Hamas while fleeing the Nova music festival, an outdoor dance party near the Gaza border. The military did not give immediate details on where their bodies were found.

Trucks are rolling across a new US pier into Gaza. But challenges remain to getting enough aid in

WASHINGTON (AP) -- Trucks carrying badly needed aid for the Gaza Strip have rolled across a newly built U.S. pier and into the besieged enclave for the first time. Friday's shipment is the first in an operation that American military officials anticipate could scale up to 150 truckloads a day. It comes as Israeli restrictions on border crossings and heavy fighting hindered the delivery of food and other supplies seven months into the Israel-Hamas war. But the U.S. and aid groups warn that the floating pier project is not a substitute for land deliveries that could bring in all the food, water and fuel needed in Gaza. Before the war, more than 500 truckloads entered the territory on an average day.

And that has not necessarily meant the school with the highest levels of racial integration. Some families describe being torn between schools where their children will feel more included on one hand or schools where they might have better academic opportunities on the other hand.

According to Eurostat, in fact, Malta recorded an increase in emissions of 7.74% in the last three months of the year. In the last quarter of 2023, EU emissions were forecast to be around 897 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent, resulting in a decline of 0.4% compared to the same quarter of 2022, estimated at 935 million tonnes of CO2 . Emissions are estimated to have fallen in 22 EU countries, with the largest reductions occurring in Estonia, Bulgaria and Finland. Emission increases have been estimated for several countries, including Slovenia, Cyprus, Slovakia and Greece.

The European Union's 2030 plan aims to reduce emissions by at least 55% compared to 1990 levels. This includes prioritizing green, renewable energy production and promoting zero-carbon buildings across the continent. Current projections indicate that Malta will miss its carbon emissions targets by a significant 62%. According to the Office for National Statistics, only 10.3% of the total energy generated in Malta in 2022 came from renewable sources, while greenhouse gas emissions from fuel combustion in power stations increased by 3.1% compared to 2021. The EU has set binding climate and energy targets for 2030, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40%, increasing energy efficiency by at least 32%, 5% and ensuring that renewable energy represents at least 32% of EU energy use, as well as achieving at least 15% of electricity interconnection levels between neighboring member states.

SzijjÃ¡rtÃ³ said friendship and mutual respect were ""invaluable"" in light of the heightened tensions in the region, noting the war in Ukraine and the assassination attempt against Slovakia's prime minister.

He welcomed that his Serbian counterpart, Marko Djuric, had made Budapest his first destination for an official visit following his appointment.

SzijjÃ¡rtÃ³ praised the ""great developments"" seen between Hungary and Serbia in recent years, highlighting that of all of Hungary's neighbours, Serbia guaranteed the most rights to its ethnic Hungarian minority, even including Vojvodina Hungarians in the country's governance.

""The security of Hungary's energy supply is in Serbia's hands,"" he said, noting that Hungary's gas supply went through Serbia, and ""we can always sleep easy regarding the transit.""

He noted that Hungary, Serbia and Slovenia had started operating a joint regional electricity exchange, which had given a further boost to energy security, and had also been ""an excellent measure"" against rising prices.

Hungary and Serbia, he said, would build an oil pipeline linking their countries, as well as ""Europe's most modern border crossing point"" at RÃ¶szke. We detailed that project HERE. He said they were aiming to complete the construction of the railway line linking Budapest and Belgrade by the end of next year, and that Hungary would continue to store gas on Serbia's behalf.

Meanwhile, SzijjÃ¡rtÃ³ said that during its presidency of the Council of the European Union in the second half of the year, Hungary would bring Serbia closer to EU membership and had a clear goal of opening the third EU accession chapter with the country.

He said Hungary considered it ""unacceptable, unfair and humiliating"" that the EU had been making Serbia wait for 15 years now when in its ""declining shape"" the bloc ""needs the momentum Serbia would guarantee more than Serbians need EU membership"". He called on EU member states to ""end their hypocrisy and come clean on why they've put obstacles in the way of the progress of Serbia's accession"".

SzijjÃ¡rtÃ³ also touched on next Thursday's scheduled UN General Assembly vote on a resolution ""seeking to demonise the entire Serb nation"" in connection with the Srebrenica massacre. Hungary will vote against the resolution, he said, adding that it would also vote against Kosovo joining the Council of Europe. SzijjÃ¡rtÃ³ said it was necessary to ""wait until the dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina proves successful, and only then will it be worthwhile for Kosovo to apply to join international organisations"".

Djuric called it an ""honour"" that he had been able to start seeing to his official duties with a visit to Hungary, ""reaffirming the excellent relationship Serbia and Hungary have built in recent years, which is a great joy for both nations"".

He said Hungary's accomplishments in protecting its national interests and economic growth were ""inspiring"" to Serbia

He welcomed that Hungary was next in line to take over the EU's rotating presidency, saying it would give Serbia and the entire region ""a reliable partner"" and that he expected Hungary to be a leader that would assume responsibility for European interests.

Djuric thanked Hungary for its support in connection with the UN resolution, pointing out that ""the opening up of old wounds by certain political circles"" had created tensions in the region among Serbs, Croats and Bosnians.

The localities were urged to proactively engage in specific programmes, plans and projects while procedures and conditions for borrowers seeking social housing must be simplified, he said.

The leader also urged building and issuing a resolution allowing the Land Law, Housing Law and Real Estate Business Law to take effect early from July 1, 2024, and the early enforcement of preferential policies for social housing projects.

The PM assigned specific tasks to relevant ministries, local authorities and investors to ensure the successful implementation of the project.

Currently, Vietnam now has 503 underway social housing projects, providing a total of 418,200 apartments./.

Vietnam, AFD strengthen cooperation, promote energy transition

Vietnam wants to deepen the traditional reliable relations and strategic partnership with France, particularly the French Development Agency (AFD), said Deputy Prime Minister Tran Hong Ha while receiving AFD Deputy Director General Marie-HÃ©lÃ¨ne Loison in Hanoi.

During the reception, Ha appreciated the results of AFD's activities in Vietnam as well as changes in its organisational apparatus for wider and more effective access to new development fields.

65th anniversary of Ho Chi Minh Trail marked in Quang Binh

A ceremony to mark the 65th anniversary of the Truong Son - Ho Chi Minh Trail (1959 - 2024) took place in Bo Trach district, the central province of Quang Binh, on May 17, highlighting the significance of the legendary road in the country's resistance war against the US and today's socio-economic development.

The event was attended by 200 delegates, including former pioneering youths and members of youth unions from the provinces of Nghe An, Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thua Thien - Hue, and Quang Nam in the central region, Dak Lak, Gia Lai, Kon Tum and Dak Nong in the Central Highlands, and Binh Phuoc in the south, which the trail traversed.

In his remarks, Secretary of the Ho Chi Minh Communist Youth Union Central Committee Ngo Van Cuong said the Ho Chi Minh Trail, also called Truong Son Trail, went down in the country's history as a legendary route and a miracle, and became a symbol for educating today's young generation about the revolutionary ideal and the spirit of overcoming challenges.

It also holds practical significance in the current national construction and defence, he noted.

Sixty-five years ago, to carry out the Party Central Committee and the Central Military Commission's policy on opening a route to deliver support to the revolution in the South, thanks to extraordinary efforts and the determination of reunifying the nation, forces built a strategic transportation route from rudimentary trails along the majestic Truong Son Mountain Range.

The Truong Son - Ho Chi Minh Trail spanned nearly 17,000km, including five vertical routes along the Truong Son Range and 21 horizontal ones connecting strategic areas, fuel pipelines, and communication lines, among many others. The system of arteries served as not only a strategic military transportation and logistics network but also a fierce battlefront, vividly demonstrating the solidarity in combat among Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia.

As part of the activities commemorating the trail's 65th anniversary, between May 15 and 17, representatives of the former pioneering youths and youth union members held a programme in the provinces to express gratitude to the war veterans and former pioneering youths who once performed duties along the legendary trail./.

Tien Giang's anti-IUU efforts pay off

Since 2022, the Mekong Delta province of Tien Giang has recorded no cases of illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing, thanks to the locality's dissemination efforts, according to Director of the provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Development Nguyen Van Man.

Tien Giang is home to 1,305 fishing vessels with over 9,460 fishermen. At present, the awareness of ship owners and fishermen has been increased.

In Go Cong Dong district which houses 704 fishing vessels, to combat IUU fishing, local border guard stations have coordinated with relevant agencies to step up dissemination and training for organisations and individuals on the provisions of Vietnamese and international fisheries laws.

Lieutenant Colonel Nguyen Huu Nham, Chief of Office of the provincial Border Guard Command, said that the Command has directed border guard stations and flotillas to intensify disseminations and provide leaflets to remind ship owners and fishermen to comply with the law when going to sea, avoid violating regulations against IUU fishing, and uphold responsibility in protecting sovereignty over the country's sea and islands as well as the marine ecological environment.

According to the provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, in the first quarter of 2024, it collaborated with the provincial Border Guard Command, the Naval Region 2 Command, the Coast Guard Region 3 Command, and other relevant agencies to hold two sessions to raise awareness of IUU fishing regulations for nearly 250 fishermen. Additionally, 600 information materials and 1,000 national flags were distributed to them.

So far, all the fishing boats have been equipped with the vessel monitoring systems./.

Outpouring of support eases burden for Vietnamese impacted by Warsaw fire

A wave of solidarity has brought relief to Vietnamese nationals affected by the devastating fire at the Marywilska shopping centre in Warsaw, Poland.

As of May 14, about 6.5 billion VND (270,000 USD) was raised to support the victims.

The Vietnamese Embassy in Poland played a pivotal role in coordinating the support efforts. Immediately following the fire, the embassy collaborated with Vietnamese associations in Poland to launch fundraising initiatives and distribute emergency food aid to those impacted.

A dedicated fund was formally established during a meeting on May 12 between embassy officials, association leaders, and representatives of the Vietnamese community at Marywilska. This fund will provide direct financial assistance to the fire-affected small businesses.

Several Polish Government agencies, non-Governmental organisations, and citizens have also reached out to the embassy, expressing their willingness to offer various forms of support.

A notable gesture came from the Poland-Vietnam Friendship Association, whose executive board conveyed their regards and donated 5,000 PLN (1,270 USD) during a meeting with embassy leaders on May 14.

In response to the call for support, Vietnamese embassies and communities in neighbouring countries like the Czech Republic, Germany, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria also initiated fundraising activities./.

Local authorities in PhÃº YÃªn Province are searching for two construction workers who went missing while traveling by boat on the Ba River on Wednesday night.

According to the PhÃº HÃ²a District Police Office, at around 7 p.m. on Wednesday, six male construction workers working on a sub-project of the ChÃ­ Tháº¡nh - VÃ¢n Phong section of the North-South Expressway project took a boat from VÄ©nh PhÃº hamlet in the district to TÃ¢y HÃ²a District.

When they reached the construction site for the ÄÃ  Ráº±ng Bridge, the boat collided with the bridge and capsized.

Three individuals survived: Mai ChÃ­ ThÃ nh, 45, Nguyá»n VÄn HuÃª, 32, and LÃª Kim VÃ ng, 29.

Three others drowned: Nguyá»n Cá»­u Äá»ng, 34, Nguyá»n Máº¡nh NguyÃªn, 31, and LÃª Äá»©c CÆ°á»ng, 46. NguyÃªn died after being taken to PhÃº YÃªn Provincial General Hospital for treatment. The other two individuals remain missing.

Da Nang's health care service to go digital

The central city has approved the 'smart' health care development project in 2025-30, promising all hospitals and health care centres we go digital in procedures, examinations and treatments.

The city said the project will be receiving total fund of VNÄ488.95 billion (US$19.56 million) for building data and infrastructure.

By 2025, all hospitals and health centres will be using digital medical records and cashless payment, offering online medical check-ups and examinations and medical consultancy or using database of patients and national database-connected ID cards.

The 'smart' health system will provide facilities for doctors giving medical consultancy to patients with online medical examination and treatment.

It also includes global positioning system (GPS) tracking of ambulances for doctors providing first aid instructions on the way to hospital.

Deputy director of the city's health department VÃµ Thu TÃ¹ng said the city's health data will be connected with the national health data centre, supporting doctors with patient's medical records nationwide.

The 'smart' health care system would start using AI Robot in treatment and examination in 2030 as well as medical training, he said.

TÃ¹ng said doctors will use digital images or online photos instead of checking films in examination of patients.

Last year, the city put into operation the first Intelligent Operation Centre (IOC), starting the first service of the 'smart' city plan, allowing local people and businesses to apply for paperwork from home via the city's online public one-stop service.

The system has helped speed up the procedure schedule, saving $44.2 million and cutting 20 per cent of other costs in manpower payment.

A total fund of VNÄ2.14 trillion ($95 million) has been allocated for the 'smart' city plan in 2030-45, in which information technology and communication will play a key role in the digitalisation process.

Viá»t Nam-Denmark cooperate for a sustainable agriculture

The Danish Minister for Food, Agriculture and Fisheries, Jacob Jensen, is leading a high-level delegation to visit Viá»t Nam on 14-16 May 2024.

Together with a group of Danish agri-food companies with advanced technology and know-how on sustainability and green transition, the aim of the minister's visit is to intensify high-level policy dialogue with Vietnamese counterparts with a focus on a more sustainable food production and a resource efficient supply chain.

Viá»t Nam and Denmark have developed a close and long- term bilateral relation on food safety. Since 2017, the bilateral cooperation has concentrated on facilitating co-operation within feed and food safety. The co-operation is a crucial part of the Green Strategic Partnership launched by the two Prime Ministers last November, where the two countries have committed to promote green transition and green growth, supporting Viá»t Nam in building a green economy and fulfilling the country's commitment to achieve net-zero emission by 2050.

The SSC Food programme between Viá»t Nam and Denmark has been implemented by the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration (DVFA) and the Vietnamese Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD). The first phase of the programme focused on improving framework conditions for animal feed production through capacity development of government officials and on the legislative framework for prudent use of veterinary drugs. In phase 2, which ran from April 2020 to April 2024, the main themes of cooperation are enhancing capacity across various stages of the food chain from farm to fork, combating anti-microbial resistance (AMR), feed control and traceability and recall of unsafe food.

During his visit, Minister Jensen has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Vietnamese Minister for Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) LÃª Minh Hoan extending the government-to-government co-operation. For the coming years, the co-operation will have increased focus on the green transition of food and agricultural production, aiming to promote a more sustainable and resilient food system.

Jensen said: ""Denmark's green transition in sustainable food production has led to the development of strong, innovative methods and approaches throughout the value chain, which boost production yield and improve product quality but at the same time consume less water and energy.

""We look forward to sharing these insights and inspire further collaboration with our Vietnamese partners. Our agreement is a strong testament to our fruitful cooperation where the two ministries do not only share common needs and interests but more importantly a common goal and vision: a sustainable and resilient food system.""

During his visit, the Danish Minister for Food, Agriculture and Fisheries also made a keynote speech at a workshop on Antimicrobial Resistance in agriculture and aquaculture. Antimicrobial resistance is a big threat to public health and human health nowadays. Therefore, this has been an important track of the Strategic Sector Co-operation Food programme.

The minister's visit to Viá»t Nam this time, the second Danish high-level visit within just two months, has been also accompanied by a group of Danish companies and producers who own world leading's solutions in food production and processing, storages, optimising the use of food and agriculture resources, drainage and water techniques.

Viá»t Nam is an attractive destination for Danish businesses in the agricultural sector. At present, Denmark has been one of the EU countries with the highest export per capita to Viá»t Nam and the agri-food sector constitutes approximately half of the total Danish exports to Viá»t Nam.

""Viá»t Nam has become an important and attractive market for Danish businesses and investors,"" Jensen said.

""Although Viá»t Nam and Denmark are geographically very far from each other, we are facing many of the same challenges and we have to continue working together to find ways to use resources effectively. In a smart way to increase competitiveness and sustainability.""

During his visit in the South of Viá»t Nam, the minister will visit Food Bank Vietnam, an important partner for the efforts to combat food waste and food loss. He will also pay site visits to a catfish aqua-farm in Tiá»n Giang and an aqua-feed factory in Báº¿n Tre, where close partnerships between Vietnamese and Danish research institutions and companies promotes the use of new green technologies and solutions for a sustainable aquaculture production in Viá»t Nam.

On his last day of the visit, he will deliver a keynote speech at the seminar on ""Sustainable agri-food production - Danish innovative technologies and financing opportunities"". The seminar will provide a forum to connect and facilitate exchange of experiences, technologies, financing and business opportunities between authorities, local decision-makers, sector managers as well as Danish and Vietnamese entrepreneurs.

20-year-old woman arrested for running fraudulent charity scheme

She collected VNÄ140 million and used the money for her personal expenses, according to investigators.

The police recommend that people should verify the legitimacy of donation requests to avoid scams.

Basket, brocade weaving of S'tiÃªng people recognised as National Intangible Cultural Heritage

Basket weaving and brocade weaving of the S'tiÃªng people has been included in the National Intangible Cultural Heritage list by the Ministry of Culture, Sports, and Tourism in 2023 and 2024.

BÃ¬nh PhÆ°á»c Province Department of Culture, Sports, and Tourism on May 15 held a ceremony at BÃ¹ Gia Máº­p National Park to announce the inclusion of the traditional crafts of basket weaving and brocade weaving of the S'tiÃªng people in the National Intangible Cultural Heritage list.

BÃ¬nh PhÆ°á»c is known as a region where many ethnic groups live together. Among them, the S'tiÃªng people are the second-largest ethnic group in the province, with nearly 97,000 people residing in 11 districts, towns, and cities of the province.

With this population size and long history, the S'tiÃªng community has created its own unique and distinctive cultural identity, including the traditional crafts of basket weaving and brocade weaving.

The basket weaving and brocade weaving crafts of the S'tiÃªng people are traditional crafts accumulated and developed over many generations, demonstrating the skill and creativity of S'tiÃªng artisans.

To create baskets and brocade products, the artisans must have talent, skills, and a thorough understanding of techniques.

Additionally, they must know how to identify and properly exploit natural materials such as tree leaves and bark to create dyeing materials and weaving patterns.

These techniques and knowledge reflect the accumulation, creativity, and refinement over time to produce unique products of the S'tiÃªng people in BÃ¬nh PhÆ°á»c Province.

At the announcement ceremony, Nguyá»n Kháº¯c VÄ©nh, deputy director of the Department of Culture, Sports, and Tourism of BÃ¬nh PhÆ°á»c Province, said that the inclusion of the basket weaving and brocade weaving crafts of the S'tiÃªng people in the National Intangible Cultural Heritage list not only honours the historical and cultural values of these traditional crafts but also recognises the efforts of local authorities and the dedication of the S'tiÃªng artisans and community in preserving and promoting the value of these crafts.

VÄ©nh suggested that relevant authorities should continue protecting and promoting the intangible cultural heritage value of basket weaving and brocade weaving.

The provincial museum should continue researching and collecting more information to clarify the value and significance of these crafts, providing documentation and guidance to local communities, which are the heritage bearers, to effectively preserve and promote the cultural heritage.

Localities should promote traditional craft training, improve skills, create high-quality products rich in cultural identity, prioritise access to funding for households maintaining the craft to expand and develop production.

Policies should encourage and support skilled basket weavers and brocade weavers, establish craft villages as community tourism sites and form basket weaving and brocade weaving cooperatives to promote and introduce products to a broader audience of tourists.

JERUSALEM (AP) -- The Israeli military says it found the bodies of three Israeli hostages in Gaza, including German-Israeli Shani Louk. A photo of Shani's twisted body in the back of a pickup truck ricocheted around the world and brought to light the scale of the Oct. 7 attack on communities in southern Israel. The military on Friday identified the other two bodies found as those of a 28-year-old woman, Amit Buskila, and a56-year-old man, Itzhak Gelerenter. Military spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said all three were killed by Hamas at the Nova music festival, an outdoor dance party near the Gaza border, and their bodies taken into the Palestinian territory.

Trucks are rolling across a new US pier into Gaza. But challenges remain to getting enough aid in

WASHINGTON (AP) -- Trucks carrying badly needed aid for the Gaza Strip have rolled across a newly built U.S. pier and into the besieged enclave for the first time. Friday's shipment is the first in an operation that American military officials anticipate could scale up to 150 truckloads a day. It comes as Israeli restrictions on border crossings and heavy fighting hindered the delivery of food and other supplies seven months into the Israel-Hamas war. But the U.S. and aid groups warn that the floating pier project is not a substitute for land deliveries that could bring in all the food, water and fuel needed in Gaza. Before the war, more than 500 truckloads entered the territory on an average day.

Hezbollah introduces new weapons and tactics against Israel as war in Gaza drags on

In recent days, Hezbollah has used a drone equipped with missiles to attack an Israeli post as well as an explosive drone to hit its deepest target so far since the clashes began seven months ago. With Israeli troops marching into Rafah and Hezbollah saying the fighting will not stop along the Lebanon border until the war in Gaza ends, tens of thousands of displaced Israelis and Lebanese are not expected to return home soon.

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin says Moscow's offensive on Ukraine's Kharkiv aims to create a buffer zone but that there are no plans to capture the city. Meanwhile, Ukraine says it will allow prisoners to join the army's depleted ranks. Putin has said in China that Moscow has launched attacks in the Kharkiv region, in response to the Ukrainian shelling of Russia's Belgorod region.

Taking presidential debates out of commission's hands virtually guarantees fewer viewers

NEW YORK (AP) -- The two planned presidential debates between Joe Biden and Donald Trump that were swiftly organized this week are good news for CNN and ABC News. But the arrangement virtually guarantees they will be among the least-watched general election debates ever. The two campaigns organized them without the Commission on Presidential Debates, which seeks the biggest audience possible on all networks. ABC says it will make its debate, scheduled for Sept. 10, available to other television networks and streamers to simulcast. CNN hasn't yet said whether it will do the same for its June 27 debate. It's also not certain how many other networks will carry them.

ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Former President Donald Trump has attended his son's high school graduation in Florida on a day off from his New York hush money trial and is heading to Minnesota for a Republican fundraiser.

No Republican presidential candidate has won Minnesota since Richard Nixon in 1972. But Trump came close to flipping the state in 2016, when he fell 1.5 percentage points short of Democrat Hillary Clinton.

70 years after Brown v. Board, America is both more diverse -- and more segregated

Seventy years after the Supreme Court's Brown v. Board of Education ruling, the impact of the decision is still up for debate. Have Americans truly ended segregation in fact, not just in law?

JERUSALEM (AP) -- The Israeli military says it found the bodies of three Israeli hostages in Gaza, including German-Israeli Shani Louk. A photo of Shani's twisted body in the back of a pickup truck ricocheted around the world and brought to light the scale of the Oct. 7 attack on communities in southern Israel. The military on Friday identified the other two bodies found as those of a 28-year-old woman, Amit Buskila, and a56-year-old man, Itzhak Gelerenter. Military spokesman Rear Adm.

Trucks are rolling across a new US pier into Gaza. But challenges remain to getting enough aid in

WASHINGTON (AP) -- Trucks carrying badly needed aid for the Gaza Strip have rolled across a newly built U.S. pier and into the besieged enclave for the first time. Friday's shipment is the first in an operation that American military officials anticipate could scale up to 150 truckloads a day. It comes as Israeli restrictions on border crossings and heavy fighting hindered the delivery of food and other supplies seven months into the Israel-Hamas war. But the U.S. and aid groups warn that the floating pier project is not a substitute for land deliveries that could bring in all the food, water and fuel needed in Gaza. Before the war, more than 500 truckloads entered the territory on an average day.

Hezbollah introduces new weapons and tactics against Israel as war in Gaza drags on

BEIRUT (AP) -- Lebanon's militant Hezbollah group is introducing new tactics and weapons against Israel as the war in Gaza drags on and Israeli troops enter parts of the southern city of Rafah. In recent days, Hezbollah has used a drone equipped with missiles to attack an Israeli post as well as an explosive drone to hit its deepest target so far since the clashes began seven months ago.

HOUSTON (AP) -- Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo says it could take ""weeks"" for power to be restored in some parts of Houston following fierce storms.

Officials warned residents that it would be a slow cleanup and that some residents should brace to be without electricity for days, if not longer.

Putin says Russia wants a buffer zone in Ukraine's Kharkiv but has no plans to capture the city

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin says Moscow's offensive on Ukraine's Kharkiv aims to create a buffer zone but that there are no plans to capture the city. Meanwhile, Ukraine says it will allow prisoners to join the army's depleted ranks. Putin has said in China that Moscow has launched attacks in the Kharkiv region, in response to the Ukrainian shelling of Russia's Belgorod region. Russian authorities say a massive Ukrainian drone attack on Crimea has caused power cutoffs in the city of Sevastopol and set a refinery ablaze in southern Russia. Friday's drone raids marked Kyiv's attempt to strike back during Russia's offensive in northeastern Ukraine.

Taking presidential debates out of commission's hands virtually guarantees fewer viewers

NEW YORK (AP) -- The two planned presidential debates between Joe Biden and Donald Trump that were swiftly organized this week are good news for CNN and ABC News. But the arrangement virtually guarantees they will be among the least-watched general election debates ever. The two campaigns organized them without the Commission on Presidential Debates, which seeks the biggest audience possible on all networks. ABC says it will make its debate, scheduled for Sept. 10, available to other television networks and streamers to simulcast. CNN hasn't yet said whether it will do the same for its June 27 debate. It's also not certain how many other networks will carry them.

""China's strategy is to undermine EU unity while, at the same time, increasing its clout in separate Member States,"" the weekly observes. It specifies that two of Xi's European destinations - Serbia and Hungary, ""remain reliably pro-China inclined on a continent where, as public opinion polls show, China's reputation has worsened."" The Chinese President's tour did not result in breakthroughs on trade, the war in China and other issues that have soured EU-Chinese relations in recent years. Only a long list of agreements were signed on new joint projects which China says it will finance. In a bid to drive a wedge between the EU and the US, Beijing promotes the idea of European strategic autonomy, Capital notes. The hope is probably that the EU may act as a counterweight of the perceived American ""hostility"" towards China. Xi is trying to persuade the EU leaders not to follow suit after the US in restricting the import of electric vehicles and other high-tech Chinese products. ""China is drawn by the Western Balkans because of their geostrategic location and proximity to the EU markets and views Serbia as a strategic European transport hub,"" the weekly points out. Before his arrival in Hungary, Xi praised Orban's Government for pursuing an ""independent"" foreign policy and ""resisting"" the great powers' policy. In a separate item, Capital writes that two-way trade between Bulgaria and China has been soaring over the last two decades, with Beijing invariably running a surplus. China ranks as Bulgaria's sixth largest import market, while Bulgarian exports to China is just a fifth of the trade flow in the opposite direction. At just EUR 150 million in 2023 and less than BGN 1.2 billion over the last ten years, Chinese investments in Bulgaria are ""negligibly low,"" the weekly notes.

Trud frontpages its coverage of Russian President Vladimir Putin to China, borrowing the headline from a BBC report: ""Xi and Putin Want Political Solution to Ukraine Crisis.""

Interviewed on Bulgarian National Radio (BNR) Friday morning, political scientist Vladimir Shopov said: ""We are witnessing the shaping of a very clear strategic axis including not only China and Russia but also countries like Iran and North Korea."" ""The deepening asymmetry in the relations between Russia and China, however, becomes particularly visible and already meets with negative reactions in certain circles in Moscow,"" the interviewee observed. He stressed that this partnership ""guarantees Vladimir Putin's survival."" ""From now on, the EU does not have the luxury to be a bystander merely interpreting developments. Europe will have to identify a new tool kit to respond to potential threats,"" Shopov concluded.

ROBERT FICO'S ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT

Journalist Petar Karaboev said on bTV Friday morning that ""Slovakia is a country fraught with contradictions. It is deeply divided - thanks to Robert Fico."" ""The focus [of reactions to the attack] should be on whether Slovaks, their State, political system, media and legality will bridge the gap, because they are still on the brink and looking into the abyss,"" he commented. According to the interviewee, the assassination attempt against Fico ""is catalyzing the polarization in the 5 million strong country.""

THE HOME SCENE

A signed comment in Capital Weekly describes the recent meeting of Movement for Rights and Freedoms (MRF) Co-chair Delyan Peevski with the ambassadors of European countries to Bulgaria as ""his first success since his installation at the head of the MRF: the Western ambassadors who, until recently, shunned him, are now legitimating him."" ""In fact, this is a routine event: the ambassadors' corps often meets with the leaderships of parliamentary groups,"" the author says. ""For Peevski & Co., however, the presence in the same room with the representatives of the Western countries in Sofia is an important part of his new image, which says that while he may be sanctioned for corruption by the US and Britain, the rest have no choice. They will pretend as if nothing has happened, they will be seeing him, having themselves photographed with him, and voters will draw their conclusion and vote for him.""

Bulgarian Helsinki Committee Co-chair Adela Kachaunova argued in a BNR interview Friday morning that ""persons sanctioned for corruption must not be legitimated after spending too many years in politics. They have given every cause for concern, but the European partners do not show any signs of distancing themselves [from such persons], no clear position at all. These things are indicative and very important."" In her opinion, the European partners ""apparently do not see the true faces of [Bulgarian] politicians sufficiently clearly or are reluctant to see them."" Kachaunova is skeptical about the effectiveness of ad hoc prosecutor Daniela Taleva and raised the question about the resources available to her for her investigations.

In an analysis in www.segabg.com, Svetoslav Terziev argues that journalists-turned-politicians disgrace the media landscape. ""Petar Volgin, Elena Yoncheva, Ivo Hristov, Nikolay Barekov, Anton Hekimyan have cashed in on their professional prestige and will not regain it,"" the author writes.

* * *

Interviewed on the bTV morning show, Petar Volgin, who until recently hosted a show on National Radio and is now running for the European Parliament as a candidate of Vazrazhdane, said that, if elected, he will insist on fewer migrants in Bulgaria and the continued operation of the coal-fired power plants. His foremost priority will be to counter the desire of some of the large European countries to impose qualified majority for important decision making. ""I don't want Europe to become a space without freedom,"" Volgin commented.

JUSTICE

On two full inside pages, 24 Chasa has interviewed Deputy Sofia City Prosecutor Desislava Petrova. ""The entire jurist community does not approve of the draft Judicial System Act. The universal idea of the bill is to put prosecutors under political control, and to make this idea publicly palatable, it has been insinuated persistently that the prosecution service does not work. The draft establishes political control over prosecutors by means of an entirely politically dominated Supreme Prosecutorial Council, where the entire personnel management power is concentrated. This will lead to never ending disciplinary proceedings against prosecutors, to pressuring them until they are replaced by new obedient people who do not prioritize their independence,"" Petrova comments. She argues that a refusal to institute or a dismissal of criminal proceedings is not an indication that the prosecution service is idle, considering that the court reversed just 0.087% of such refusals last year. Replying to a question, the interviewee says that ""we expect the legislative pathology to be withdrawn and the bill to be reconsidered in its entirety, responsibly and with concern for its real consequences, with consideration for the arguments of all stakeholders.""

ELECTION CAMPAIGN FUNDING

Telegraph has checked the Bulgarian National Audit Office register of funding for the election campaign and found that just BGN 46,000 have been raised so far for the European Parliament election. Out of five cash contributions, three have been made by Daniel Lorer of Continue the Change - Democratic Bulgaria (CC-DB), totalling BGN 39,000 (declared as proceeds from the sale of real estate). The contributions for the national parliamentary elections approximate BGN 264,000, of which some BGN 67,000 have come from supporters and over BGN 197,000 from the MP candidates themselves. The largest single contribution was made by former regional development minister Andrei Tsekov, who is running on the CC-DB list in Blagoevgrad: BGN 30,000 (salary savings). Traditionally, GERB-UDF and MRF do not raise campaign donations. Vazrazhdane has not reported any, either. CC-DB have raised the largest amount: nearly BGN 140,000. Donations for the Socialist Party are nearly BGN 28,000, and those for There Is Such a People a little over BGN 10,000.

VOTING ABROAD

As many as 12,942 or more than half of the 27,707 applications for voting abroad in the European Parliament elections, and 4,257 applications out of a total of 38,393 for voting abroad in the national parliamentary elections have been rejected by the Central Election Commission, 24 Chasa reports, referring to the Commission's website. The reasons are missing or mistaken particulars or applicants who are not qualified voters. The largest number of applications have been submitted in Turkey: 25,537 for MPs and just 39 for MEPs. Traditionally, a large number of voters will also exercise their franchise in Germany, Spain and the UK.

NORTH MACEDONIA

Skopje-based freelance journalist Bojan Stojkovski writes in a two-page analysis in Capital Weekly that the conservative VMRO-DPMNE that won both the parliamentary and presidential elections in North Macedonia is coming back to power much stronger than before and with a leadership that is almost cleansed of its problematic past. The author sees an indication that the new government is willing to do what it has been doing before: play a ""wait-and-see"" game, just as at the time of Nikola Gruevski in the disputes with Greece and Bulgaria. ""I don't think VMRO-DPMNE have a clear idea how to handle the constitutional amendments and European integration. Or, if they do, they don't communicate it clearly to the public,"" Eurothink brain trust Executive Director Dimitar Nikolovski told Capital. He nevertheless expects the constitutional revisions to be included in the coalition agreement with VLEN and to be adopted within a year after the elections. ""This will follow the awareness that the EU negotiating framework cannot possibly be revised,"" the expert comments. ""Just as before, Bulgaria and the Bulgarians - in the Republic of North Macedonia and in general, have been the convenient justification for the unwillingness or inability of the Macedonian political elite to start the country's tangible Europeanization,"" Skopje-based journalist Atanas Velickov told the weekly.

www.dnevnik.bg has rounded up the opinions of observers in Skopje and Sofia while a new cabinet in North Macedonia is expected to be formed and parliamentary elections in Bulgaria are to be held on June 9. Former deputy foreign minister Lyubomir Kyuchukov does not expect Skopje to withdraw unilaterally from the treaties with Sofia or Athens. ""A review of North Macedonia's treaties with Greece and Bulgaria is practically impossible because neither of these two countries would accept this,"" he argues. According to Macedonian analyst Petar Arsovski, ""VMRO-DPMNE and the country's new President actually believe that the negotiating framework [for EU accession] is acceptable. I don't think they will make an attempt to reject the negotiating framework. But I believe they need political motivation. They need to say that they will change something, be it cosmetic and insignificant. It may be some symbolic statement that these are the final terms. But even such cosmetic concession may prove a challenge."" Kyuchukov is adamant: ""Until the Bulgarians are included in North Macedonia's Constitution, the country will simply not start actual negotiations on EU membership. Brussels has already ripened to the idea of splitting Albania from North Macedonia [in the EU accession process]. The problem is that this may have a definite adverse impact on the region's stability and may cause serious ethnic tensions and political destabilization of North Macedonia itself.""

COUNTER-CORRUPTION REFORM

In a two-page analysis contributed to Capital Weekly, Andrey Yankulov, senior legal expert at the non-governmental Anti-Corruption Fund, argues that the Commission for Anti-Corruption and Illegal Assets Forfeiture, which was established by GERB in 2018, ""turned into a tool of harassment and racketeering of business and political opponents. The counter-corruption reform practically cemented this completely discredited commission in its existing name complement for an indefinite period of time, promoting its Chair Anton Slavchev to head of both [the newly set up Commission for Anti-Corruption (CAC) and Commission for Illegal Assets Forfeiture] and, moreover, vesting the two bodies with more powers than before."" ""The ultimate paradox is that these two commissions with an identical complement are already two distinct legal persons, have separate administrations, separate budgets and separate BULSTAT codes,"" the expert writes, recalling that, under the law, a new complement of the CAC had to be elected by January 8, 2024 but an election procedure was never initiated. ""The blocked election of a complement of the new CAC is one of the four reforms that Brussels regards as incomplete, which is a hurdle to the second payment under the [National] Recovery [and Resilience] Plan,"" Yankulov explains.

POWER SUPPLY

A two-page signed article in Capital Weekly predicts that the postponement of the liberalization of the wholesale electricity market will result in a 3-4% hike of household electricity as from July 1 because, instead of being charged at exchange prices, this power supply sector will continue to be rated at prices fixed by the Energy and Water Regulatory Commission (EWRC), which factor in the expensive electricity supplied by State-owned Maritsa East 2 TPP with its high production costs. The deficit in the Electricity System Security Fund (ESSF) is expected to reach BGN 550 million by the end of June. The Finance Ministry will try to close the gap - again on taxpayers money, the author notes.

For its part, Trud reports that the Kozloduy N-Plant will withdraw its request for a 30% rise of the price of its electricity and will submit a new proposal on Monday. ""Before the EWRC adopts a decision on household electricity prices from July 1, the Government will take measures to offset the deficit in the ESSF without this affecting the prices paid by households,"" caretaker Energy Minister Vladimir Malinov is quoted as saying.

TELECOMMUNICATIONS

24 Chasa runs a page-long interview with Communications Regulations Commission (CRC) Chairman Ivan Dimitrov, who describes the Bulgarian electronic communications market as ""exceedingly dynamic and steadily growing, one of the most stable and important economic sectors, with a huge and booming volume"". In 2022 the market was worth BGN 3.4 billion, up 7% from 2021. The BGN 654 million invested in it in 2022 was an increase of 15%, year on year. At the end of 2023, the CRC granted authorizations for the use of radio spectrum frequencies in the 700 MHz and 800 MHz range, which is used for high-speed connectivity in more sparsely populated and outlying locations, where building a fixed network is economically unprofitable, Dimitrov explains.

The top story in Trud says that electricity distribution companies have asked the EWRC to introduce a charge for access to the grid for properties which do not consume electricity, like vacant apartments and weekend houses.

DEFENCE INDUSTRY

TEREM-HOLDING Executive Director Kalin Dimitrov told Telegraph that the plant is starting to manufacture kamikaze drones. The unmanned combat aerial vehicles cost some BGN 2,000 but are capable of destroying tanks worth EUR 10-15 million, Dimitrov explained. The project for making cheap, low-tech drones is implemented in partnership with a thoroughly experienced Ukrainian company which provides the know-how. After a presentation before the Land Forces at the beginning of this year, assembly of the first batch is in progress. The holding is also developing a series of specialized munitions for drones, which will be mass-produced. They can hit targets at a distance of 10-15 km. The CEO said that work is underway on mastering the manufacture of 155 mm artillery shells. The first batch is ready, and serial production is forthcoming.

BOMB SQUAD

The main front-page story in Telegraph, continued on two full inside pages, tells about the work of the bomb squad of the Specialized Counterterrorism Commando. The bomb disposal experts are alerted on an average 15 occasions monthly. They respond to alerts or for routine checks of embassies, homes, football matches and other crowd events. Most reports concern abandoned suspicious suitcases, bags and other luggage. Quite a few of the reports are about ammunition like grenades stolen from defence industry plants or military facilities. In 99% of the cases, the luggage items do not contain an explosive. While there are no gender eligibility requirements for joining the team, the squad is all-male, says its commander, Chief Inspector Stiliyan Chochev. Asked what kind of improvised explosive devices are made by Bulgarians, he answers: ""The simplest and cheapest, using what they can steal. For some time now, however, they have been using IED-making directions they find online."" Chochev recalls a case in 2023, when a flight bound from Germany to Turkey made an emergency landing in Sofia because a laptop forgotten on a passenger seat was suspected to be a blast trigger. The laptop was removed to a safe location and was disposed of by a controlled explosion.

MISSING PERSONS

24 Chassa frontpages a report according to which 274 missing person reports have been filed since the beginning of 2024, and 200 of them are searched for internationally. The number is large because it includes people who went missing in previous years but remain lost. Interpol Yellow Notices have been issued for 147 Bulgarians: 35 women and 112 men. Of the 796 people who disappeared in Bulgaria in 2023, 639 have been found, and the remaining 157 continue to be searched for in 2024. Between January 1 and 31, 2022, a record 769 missing persons reports were filed and 680 persons were declared found. The respective figures for 2021 were 265 and 200 and, for 2020, 183 and 137.

BULGARIAN SCHOOLS ABROAD

On two full inside pages, Telegraph has interviewed Mimi Nicheva, Principal of the Sts Cyril and Methodius Sunday School in Athens, which recently marked its 20th birthday. Nicheva acknowledges the ""adequate and timely"" assistance of the Bulgarian State in the person of the Ministry of Education and Science and Bulgaria's Embassy in Greece. The functioning of the school is financed by the Ministry, while the pupils' parents pay small tuition fees. The institution also relies on sponsors. Replying to a question, the interviewee says that the main challenges facing Bulgarian educational institutions abroad is the growing number of children who do not speak Bulgarian, the lack of a clear mechanism for enrolling children left outside the system, the increasing difficulties in finding qualified teachers, and the Bulgarian history and geography textbooks that are too complicated for expat children. The principal says that there are four Bulgarian Sunday schools in Athens with a combined enrolment of some 600. About 50 graduates of her school have continued their studies in Bulgaria.

BULGARIAN FOLK ENSEMBLES ABROAD

Duma carries a two-page interview with Association of Bulgarian Folk Ensembles Abroad Chair Radoslava Nedyalkova, who says that the Association was established in November 2016 and now has 36 affiliates paying membership dues. Otherwise, there are more than 200 such ensembles in Europe and over 200 in North America.

Draft bill passed - The Chamber of Deputies approved a draft bill aimed at revitalising the housing and construction sector. The bill, which includes a mix of fiscal and non-fiscal measures, received significant support, passing with 42 votes in favour and 18 against.

The package is designed to address current challenges within the sector by providing incentives to private individuals, the construction industry, and investors, intending to stimulate the market and secure jobs.

Criticism - Despite its approval, the bill faced substantial criticism from several MPs who argue it falls short in promoting social equity and affordability.

MP Paulette Lenert of the Luxembourg Socialist Workers' Party (LSAP) highlighted that similar investment-heavy strategies in the past have failed to produce affordable housing and criticised the bill for providing tax breaks without sufficient conditions to ensure affordability.

MP FranÃ§ois Bausch of The Greens also expressed concerns, stating that the bill primarily benefits those who have already profited significantly, rather than addressing the needs of those struggling with housing affordability.

A step in the right direction - Housing Minister Claude Meisch of the Democratic Party (DP) defended the bill against these criticisms, pointing out that the current economic climate, marked by high interest rates, necessitates such measures. He emphasised the social nature of the bill, stating that for every euro spent on stimulating the market, three euros are allocated for purchasing affordable housing.

Meisch also stressed the importance of a proactive land policy, which he believes has been neglected by previous governments. MP Marc Goergen of the Pirate Party acknowledged the bill's shortcomings for tenants but expressed optimism that it marks the beginning of a more comprehensive housing policy.

The clock is ticking - The parliamentary committee has addressed the issue of extending the operating time for the Cattenom nuclear power plant, which began operations in the 1980s and was initially intended to run for 40 years. As this period is coming to an end, discussions are underway regarding its future.

The Cattenom plant, located just across the French border, is now the twelfth largest nuclear power plant in the world, and its potential extension has significant implications for the region.

Closure in doubt - The Greens, led by MP FranÃ§ois Bausch, along with most other political parties, are advocating for applying pressure on France to close the Cattenom plant, similar to the closure of the Fessenheim plant, which was influenced by pressure from Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg.

Environmental Minister Serge Wilmes emphasised Luxembourg's strong political stance on the issue, but expressed doubts that French President Emmanuel Macron would agree to close Cattenom, as France is currently focusing on expanding its nuclear capabilities.

This reflects a shift from the previous administration under FranÃ§ois Hollande, which negotiated the closure of Fessenheim amid heightened concerns following the Fukushima disaster.

Energy goals - In addition to the nuclear plant discussion, the committee also covered topics related to energy efficiency. The European Union is planning to raise energy efficiency targets for member states with ambitious goals, but Luxembourg is unlikely to meet these new targets in the short term due to limited voting capacity.

Forecast confirmed - The National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies (STATEC) has projected a significant 60% rise in electricity prices and a 17% increase in gas prices by 2025. Encevo's General Director, Claude Seywert, this week confirmed these forecasts, noting that while gas prices would see minimal changes, electricity consumers could face substantial increases ranging between 40-50% if no subsidies or phase-out strategies are implemented.

This anticipated price hike underscores the potential financial impact on consumers following the lifting of price caps.

Future aspirations - Encevo's medium-term strategy places a strong emphasis on expanding its renewable energy portfolio, with significant investments in wind and solar energy projects, both within the national market and the Greater Region.

The company is also exploring the role of hydrogen as a key component of its future energy mix. These initiatives are aimed at reducing dependency on traditional energy sources, enhancing sustainability, and positioning Encevo at the forefront of the transition to a more renewable and resilient energy infrastructure.

Robust market position - Encevo experienced sustainable growth in 2023, highlighted by a net profit increase to â¬171 million and revenues climbing by 1.6% to surpass â¬5 billion. This financial success was underpinned by record-high investments of â¬336 million, predominantly channelled into enhancing network infrastructure and advancing renewable energy projects.

The robust financial performance enabled Encevo to distribute dividends to its shareholders, reflecting the company's solid market position and strategic investments.

Serious condition - Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico's condition has stabilised but remains serious after a shooting incident in Handlova, described by the government as a political assault. The attack occurred as Fico was engaging with the public after a meeting, and he underwent a five-hour surgery at Banska Bystrica hospital.

The incident has drawn global condemnation and raised concerns about increasing political polarisation and potential violence, especially with the European parliament elections approaching.

Motives in question - The suspect, a 71-year-old writer from Levice, was identified and detained at the scene. Known for founding the DUHA Literary Club and his involvement in anti-violence initiatives, he has no history of aggression despite holding a legally registered firearm.

His son expressed confusion over his father's actions, noting that while his father did not support Fico politically, there was no indication of personal animosity that could have motivated the attack.

Breaking point - The attack on Fico has exacerbated fears of political violence in Slovakia, a country already experiencing significant political tension. Analysts worry about further radicalisation among individuals and politicians, with the attack seen as a potential catalyst for more violence. The incident has also highlighted the deep divisions within Slovak society, with citizens and political figures calling for an end to the hatred and polarisation that have marked recent political discourse.

Deal reached - Geert Wilders' far-right PVV Freedom Party has successfully negotiated a coalition government in the Netherlands after six months of complex discussions, although Wilders himself will not serve as prime minister. This agreement marks a significant moment as it is the first time Wilders' party will participate in the Dutch government.

The negotiations were fraught with challenges, including opposition from within the coalition to Wilders' potential leadership, engendering his reluctant decision to step aside from his prime ministerial ambitions.

Asylum and immigration - The newly formed coalition plans to implement a partially technocratic government, with an equal mix of politicians and non-politicians, a model not seen in the Netherlands for over a century.

A major focus of the coalition agreement is on enacting the strictest anti-asylum policies in Dutch history, aiming to control immigration more rigorously. The coalition also intends to seek an opt-out from EU asylum policies, similar to the Danish model, although this process is expected to be lengthy and complex, requiring negotiations with the European Commission.

'Constructive' EU partner - Ronald Plasterk, a former education and interior minister, is currently the main candidate for the prime ministerial role, given his involvement in the coalition talks.

The agreement also includes a proposal to consider moving the Dutch embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a highly sensitive issue due to its implications for Israeli-Palestinian relations.

Additionally, the coalition has committed to maintaining the Netherlands' role as a ""constructive"" EU partner and supporting Ukraine, while remaining flexible on climate goals if current policies do not yield the desired results.",today.rtl.lu,news,RTL Today,,0.2941176470588236,453636298,4,https://www.rtl.lu/sassets/rtl2008.lu/nt/p/2024/05/17/10/1691834046dbb9b3606713735b54aa8b.gif,

Department of Public Information . News and Media Division . New York

15 May 2024

The following is a near-verbatim transcript of today's noon briefing by Farhan Haq, Deputy Spokesman for the Secretary-General.

In a short while, I will be joined here by the Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Sudan, Clementine Nkweta-Salami.

She will provide you with an update on the humanitarian situation in the country.

Tomorrow, at 12:30 p.m., there will be a briefing here by the Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) to launch the World Economic Situation and Prospects as of mid-2024.

The report will update the global and regional economic forecasts released in January and will be available at desapublications.un.org.

The briefers will be Shantanu Mukherjee, DESA's Director of Economic Analysis and Policy Division, along with Hamid Rashid, DESA's Chief of the Global Economic Monitoring Branch in the Economic Analysis and Policy Division.

**Slovakia

The Secretary-General strongly condemns the shocking attack carried out today against the Prime Minister of Slovakia, Robert Fico.

The Secretary-General's thoughts are with the Prime Minister and his loved ones at this difficult moment.

**Oman

The Secretary-General met in Muscat today with Sayyid Badr bin Hamad bin Hamood Albusaidi, Foreign Minister of the Sultanate of Oman.

The Secretary-General recognized Oman's leadership in promoting dialogue and multilateral cooperation in the region and beyond, including in Yemen. The Secretary-General and the Foreign Minister also discussed developments in Gaza, as well as ongoing developments in Yemen.

Later that morning, the Secretary-General met with His Majesty Sultan Haitham bin Tarik, Sultan of Oman. The Secretary-General thanked the Sultan for his active personal commitment to promoting dialogue and diplomacy throughout the region and beyond. Among other issues of mutual concern, the Secretary-General and the Sultan discussed efforts in Gaza to secure an immediate ceasefire, the release of hostages and delivery of humanitarian aid.

And yesterday in Oman, the Secretary-General visited the National Museum of Oman and the Youth Centre of Muscat, which works in partnership with UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) and World Intellectual Property Organization.

**Occupied Palestinian Territory

Turning to the situation in Gaza, our colleagues from the UN Relief and Works Agency -- UNRWA -- say that as of today, some 600,000 people -- a quarter of Gaza's population -- have been displaced from Rafah since 6 May, as the Israeli ground operation there continues.

The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) says ground incursions and heavy fighting also continue to be reported in Deir al Balah, in central Gaza, as well as in Jabaliya, in northern Gaza.

Many of the families now on the move once again have already been displaced repeatedly since October.

Regardless of whether they move or stay, civilians in Gaza must be protected. All parties must respect international humanitarian law at all times. This also means civilians' essential needs -- including food, shelter, water and health -- must be met, wherever they are.

Access to critical health services in Gaza continues to shrink as additional evacuation orders are issued and military operations intensify.

According to our partners working on the health response, the Indonesian Field Hospital in Rafah is out of service as of today. There are now eight functional field hospitals, including one just established by the International Committee of the Red Cross, in coordination with the Palestine Red Crescent Society, to help address the overwhelming scale of needs in Rafah.

And we have received questions about a video that seems to show armed militant activity at a compound belonging to the UN Relief and Works Agency, UNRWA.

UNRWA is unable to verify the authenticity or the content of this video and does not have any information on the timing or the exact location of the video.

The Agency says that it is likely that the video is from an UNRWA warehouse in Rafah that was evacuated the week of 6 May following the evacuation orders from the Israeli authorities. UNRWA staff were informed to depart the facility for their safety. Flour and UNRWA vehicles were left in the facility when it was abandoned.

UNRWA condemns the use of UN facilities by any party to the conflict for military purposes. It has repeatedly called for independent investigation and accountability for the blatant disregard of UN staff lives, premises and operations.

We reiterate our call on all parties to the conflict to respect the sanctity and neutrality of UN installations.

**Ukraine

Turning to Ukraine, the Humanitarian Coordinator there, Denise Brown, is visiting Kharkiv City and yesterday condemned the unrelenting attacks, both in the city and the region.

On 14 May alone, repeated strikes in Kharkiv City and across the region have injured civilians, including children, as well as damaging a school and numerous homes. This is according to the authorities and our humanitarian partners.

Since 10 May, humanitarian organizations have been assisting people who fled to Kharkiv City in search of safety as evacuations from border and front-line communities in the Kharkiv Region continue.

We, along with our partners, have supported hundreds of people with transportation, accommodation, distribution of hot meals and ready-to-eat food packages. We also pre-registered people for cash assistance and provided mental health and psychological consultations.

Ms. Brown has approved the release of $3.75 million from the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund to strengthen the ongoing response.

**Security Council

And yesterday afternoon, as you know, the Security Council held a meeting on the maintenance of peace and security of Ukraine.

Briefing Council members, Lisa Doughten, the Director of Financing and Partnerships Division of the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, noted that relentless hostilities continue in communities along the north-eastern border with the Russian Federation and on the front line.

She added that strikes have also been reported inside the Russian Federation, reportedly also resulting in several civilian casualties and damage to residential homes and other civilian infrastructure.

Ms. Doughten said the intensification in hostilities is making the delivery of humanitarian assistance more dangerous.

Nevertheless, she said, the UN and its humanitarian partners are doing everything we can to reach people in need of support, despite the enormous tasks.

**Central African Republic

Our peacekeeping colleagues in the Central African Republic are telling us that the Head of the UN Mission, MINUSCA, Valentine Rugwabiza, met yesterday with key local officials, prefectures and mayors in Bangui, following the national conference we mentioned on Monday -- on the seasonal migration of cattle and people.

She reiterated our commitment to support the implementation of the recommendations made at this conference.

Ms. Rugwabiza said that the heaviest consequences of conflicts and crime linked to this seasonal migration are borne by the civilian population, as well as revenue losses for the State.

**Nigeria

Turning to Nigeria, our team there, along with the Government and our partners, have launched a $306 million appeal to support 2.8 million people in the country's north-east.

The region -- comprising the states of Borno, Adamawa and Yobe -- is facing a food security and a nutrition crisis during this lean season, which runs from May to September.

The crisis is primarily due to continued conflict and insecurity combined with the impacts of climate change.

The prices of staple foods, such as beans and maize, have increased by 300 to 400 per cent over the past year.

According to the Government, some 4.8 million people in these three states are estimated to be facing food insecurity, the highest level in seven years.

The Humanitarian Coordinator in Nigeria, Mohamed Malick Fall, released $11 million from the Nigeria Humanitarian Fund to kick start the response, and he called for additional resources.

**Rwanda

The Secretary-General welcomes the announcement by the Office of the Prosecutor of the International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals that all fugitives indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) for crimes committed during the 1994 Genocide against the Tutsi in Rwanda have now been accounted for.

All fugitives indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia have been accounted for since 2011.

He commends the efforts of the International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals to complete this important part of its functions in pursuit of international justice.

**Burundi

In Burundi, our team there, led by Resident Coordinator Violet Kakyomya, is providing support to people impacted by recent floods and landslides.

These natural disasters have left over 300,000 people in need of humanitarian aid, with 36,000 displaced in the country.

Our team is assisting with health services including mobile clinics, access to sexual and reproductive health and gender-based violence services. It is also assessing the immediate needs of people living with HIV/AIDS. Additionally, educational materials and supplies are being distributed to restore damaged schools, while child protection services are being provided, along with water, sanitation and hygiene kits, emergency shelters and food assistance through cash-based transfers to support immediate needs.

**Haiti

Turning to Haiti, we have an update on the assistance provided by our colleagues in the country.

On Monday and Tuesday, the World Food Programme (WFP) distributed close to 10,000 hot meals to about 5,000 people displaced in the Port-au-Prince metropolitan area.

IOM (International Organization for Migration) also distributed water to two sites hosting displaced people and provided health services through a mobile clinic in one site in Port-au-Prince.

Following assessments in Gressier -- after the violent incidents there that we mentioned -- WFP, the World Food Programme, is planning to begin hot meal distributions in this community tomorrow.

In the capital, WFP started to transition from hot meals distributions to cash-based transfers for the displaced. So far, more than 37,000 people received cash. In the coming weeks, WFP is planning to provide cash assistance to over 95,000 displaced people.

In addition to this, WFP continued food distributions in CitÃ© Soleil.

Over 65,000 people have received food since last Friday, and the agency's goal is to reach 95,000 people by the end of this week.

As part of its school meal programmes, WFP has reached 195,000 school children throughout Haiti.

**Brazil

In Brazil, our team -- led by the Resident Coordinator, Silvia Rucks -- has deployed expertise in humanitarian settings to support the national and local government response to the floods, especially considering the needs of at-risk groups on the ground as heavy rains still batter the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul and temperatures fall as winter advances.

The UN team is also providing hygiene kits, mattresses, blankets, cooking supplies, water purifiers, emergency housing units, food and water to the affected population.

While the emergency response is under way, the UN team also stands ready to work with national authorities on planning for rebuilding.

**Darien Gap

And our colleagues at the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) today said there has been a significant increase in the number of children migrating through the Darien Gap.

UNICEF estimates that 160,000 children could cross the route this year, up 34 per cent from 113,000 in 2023.

UNICEF said that child migration through the jungle of the Darien Gap has become a protracted crisis, with many people who make the crossing likely to require critical humanitarian assistance.

Of the 30,000 children on the move so far this year, nearly 2,000 of them were unaccompanied or separated from their families. The number of unaccompanied and separated children tripled in comparison to the same period in 2023.

I would like to state for the record that, yesterday evening, the Secretary-General designated James Swan of the United States as his Acting Special Representative for Somalia and Head of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Somalia (UNSOM).

Mr. Swan will act as Special Representative for a temporary period following the departure of Catriona Laing of the United Kingdom, to whom the Secretary-General is grateful for her dedicated service in UNSOM and Somalia at a challenging time.

Mr. Swan is an experienced diplomat with a long career in African countries facing complex political transitions. Most recently, he served as Special Representative for Somalia and Head of UNSOM from 2019 to 2022.

Prior to that, he served in the United States Government as Ambassador to the Democratic Republic of the Congo from 2013 to 2016, Special Representative for Somalia from 2011 to 2013, and Ambassador to Djibouti from 2008 to 2011.

**Day of Families

And last, today is the International Day of Families.

This day highlights that families and family-oriented policies and programmes are vital for the achievement of many of the Sustainable Development Goals.

Any questions for me before we get to our guest? Yes, Edie?

**Questions and Answers

Question: Thank you, Farhan. Is there any update on the number of displacements from the north or anywhere else in Gaza?

Deputy Spokesman: Not officially. There's some rough figures of maybe something like in the neighbourhood of 100,000 people being displaced from the north, but you can't really hold me to that, because the situation is a fairly fluid one.

Question: And is there any update on the negotiations between the United Nations, the United States and others on UN participation in the distribution of aid coming from Cyprus via the US pier?

Deputy Spokesman: Yes. Once we've come to a conclusion of that, we'll certainly let you know, but the discussions are ongoing.

Amelie?

Question: Thanks, Farhan. I have a question about New Caledonia. The French Government declared a state of emergency after several days of riots that left at least four people dead. Any comment from the Secretary-General on the situation? Any worries?

Deputy Spokesman: Well, on the basic situation, you will have seen what we said in the past about New Caledonia and that stands. But obviously, we would want extreme care to be taken regarding demonstrations because, as you know, we want all peaceful protests to be allowed to continue safely.

Yes, Dezhi?

Question: Okay. A follow-up on the UNRWA alleged video with the Hamas fighters. You just said that UNRWA is not able to verify the authenticity or the content of video, and you don't have the timing and any more information. Well, Times of Israel reported that according to IDF (Israel Defence Forces), they were spotted on Saturday at UNRWA's logistics centre in East Rafah. You said most likely it's evacuation on 6 May. Which means there should not be any UN vehicles in that compound.

Deputy Spokesman: No. As I pointed out, the UNRWA personnel had to obey an evacuation order to leave that compound. When they did that, they left behind flour and some of the vehicles.

Question: So, it could be, there are no UN staff but only the vehicles with the fighters? I'm sorry.

Deputy Spokesman: That's a possibility. This would need to be investigated further. And certainly, UNRWA is open to receiving all relevant information about this. [cross talk]

Question: But hasn't UNRWA received any from IDF?

Deputy Spokesman: Well, not at this stage. I mean, they've seen the video, and from what they've seen, the video has many different cuts, which suggests to them, on first glance, that this is a montage of different clips, which may not be taken at the same time. They would need more information.

Question: Yeah. But according to the video, I'm now looking at the video. There are people with the blue jackets. It seems like UN staff there, right?

Deputy Spokesman: All I can tell you is, again, the site that it appears to be seems to be one that was evacuated the week of 6 May.

Question: Thank you, Farhan. Regarding the Indonesian Field Hospital that you said is now out of service, MSF or Doctors Without Borders, three days ago, said they could no longer work there. So, is there something new or is this like the official shutdown of it?

Deputy Spokesman: This is the official confirmation of that. I mean, we try to hold out as long as we can, given the needs on the ground. But at some point, it's simply impossible.

Question: Thank you. And regarding the DSS (Department of Safety and Security) staff member that was killed early Monday, are the Israeli authorities cooperating with the UN and the questions that you guys have with them?

Deputy Spokesman: Yeah. As far as I'm aware, yes, we're receiving cooperation in terms of our follow-up. Basically, there's a small team of security experts who are doing a review. And as far as I'm aware, they've received cooperation with their tasks.

Yes, Dulcie?

Question: Okay, thanks. I just want to go back over the numbers of dead in Gaza because there are still some confusing media reports. Including one saying that normally the UN relies on the Gaza Ministry of Health for its numbers, but also that recently it relied on the Government Media Office for its numbers. So, which is it? Because it's pretty confusing.

Deputy Spokesman: It's the Ministry of Health. The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs tries to get its information from the Ministry of Health. I believe there was a period when, for whatever reason, given the conditions on the ground, the Ministry of Health was unresponsive. And so, they got different figures from the media office, but that was a short period. It's back to, as it was, at the start of the war, the Ministry of Health, which is the party we've relied on in previous circumstances, as well.

Question: Okay. You also said last week, however, that the UN works with partners on the ground to cross-check these numbers. So, who would that be with?

Deputy Spokesman: Well, there are also other non-governmental organizations on the ground. And so, we try to make sure that the numbers are coordinated. The difficulty for us, particularly for us as the UN, is simply being able to verify a lot of this first-hand, given the nature of the fighting.

Question: So, if I could just ask then, some of the headlines are saying that there's been a reduction in the overall numbers of dead.

Deputy Spokesman: There is a reduction in the numbers of identified bodies.

Question: Thank you, Farhan. Can you give us an update on the status of the border crossings and whether any food or water or fuel is getting in anywhere in Gaza?

Deputy Spokesman: Yes. I can, to a certain extent. What I can say is that the Erez crossing has been closed since 9 May. There have been some commodities who have come in through a new opening at Zikim, Z-I-K-I-M, in the north-west. Kerem Shalom is technically open, but it's not logistically viable and it's not safe to access Kerem Shalom. So, things have not been moving there. And regarding Rafah, as you know, there's fighting there. So that makes use of Rafah difficult over all of the last days. Fuel imports have stopped since the Rafah operation began, with only some limited exceptions.

Gabriel and then Dezhi.

Question: Thank you, Farhan. Regarding the 600,000... roughly 600,000 Palestinians that have been displaced since 6 May, have the Israeli authorities been coordinating with you at all or with UN at all on safe passage for these people, where they will go, will they get any care or is there any coordination whatsoever?

Deputy Spokesman: Our basic point of view is that there's no place safe for them to go to. Different sites that have been suggested like Al Muwasi, we've pointed out, are places that don't have access to running water, to electricity, to basic services that are needed to keep that large number of people alive. So, there are many issues in terms of their displacement.

Dezhi?

Question: Yes. The Israeli Prime Minister, [Benjamin] Netanyahu, said that there's no humanitarian crisis in Gaza's southern city, Rafah. He said that hasn't been materialized or nor will it be materialized. Does the UN believe there's a humanitarian crisis?

Deputy Spokesman: You've heard all the things we've been saying over the past seven months, right?

Question: Yes. Does that count as a humanitarian crisis?

Deputy Spokesman: If that doesn't count as a humanitarian crisis, I don't know what words would apply.

Question: So, the Prime Minister is lying?

Deputy Spokesman: I'm not accusing anyone of lying. I'm saying that we've made clear what the facts on the ground are.

Question: Maybe you have different standard?

Deputy Spokesman: You've heard different experts, our leading people dealing with feeding people, talk about how, by the end of this very month, a million people can face famine. Would that strike you as a humanitarian crisis or not?

And with that, let me turn to our guest. Hold on one second, please.",globalsecurity.org,news,GlobalSecurity.org,John Pike,-0.02745098039215688,453633844,4,,

Amsterdam - 17 May 2024 - Photon Energy N.V. (WSE: PEN, ""Photon Energy Group"", the ""Group"" or the ""Company"") announces financial results for the first quarter of 2024.

""The first quarter of 2024 was marked by our continued efforts to make our business model more resilient to further economic and geopolitical fluctuations. First of all, we have managed to complete the rebalancing of our IPP portfolio which, as of 1 April 2024, represents a nearly 50/50 split between the support scheme mechanism, or FIT, and a merchant model, selling on day-ahead spot prices. Transitioning to a more balanced portfolio between the two schemes is a strategic move, especially given the declining energy prices in the CEE region and current geopolitical uncertainties. In May 2024, we finally signed a project refinancing agreement for EUR 15 million with EBRD. This funding will undoubtedly provide a significant boost to the Group's expansion plans in Romania and the development of the capacity market offerings. Looking ahead, we believe that the achievements of this first quarter will not be undermined as they help us to leverage the strength of our business model and recover the overall growth and profitability of the Group in 2024. With the above changes in place, we feel more confident that we can promise a more positive trajectory for our Group's business in the coming quarters,"" said Georg Hotar, CEO of Photon Energy Group.

First Quarter 2024 and Recent Operational Highlights

In the first quarter, Photon Energy Group's consolidated revenues amounted to EUR 17.375 million, compared to EUR 19.280 million a year earlier, marking a decrease of 9.9% YoY.

Revenues from electricity generation reached EUR 3.746 million, a contraction of 9.7% YoY, primarily due to lower average realized electricity prices, which declined by 23.1% YoY, from EUR 173 / MWh in Q1 2023 to EUR 133 / MWh in Q1 2024. Although electricity generation increased to 30.2 GWh, up by 24.2% YoY, it was still insufficient to offset the impact of falling electricity prices.

Other revenues of the Group also decreased from EUR 15.129 million in Q1 2023 to EUR 13.629 million in the reporting period, down by 9.9% YoY, mainly due to weaker trading volumes of PV components. Other segments performed better than a year ago, particularly Photon Energy's New Energy division, which saw its external revenues increase by 120.5% YoY.

The Group's consolidated EBITDA of EUR 0.783 million more than doubled YoY, compared to EUR 0.330 million in Q1 2023. EBIT improved slightly to EUR -1.425 million, compared to EUR -1.569 million a year earlier. The Group's operating profitability was negatively impacted by the contraction of margins in the energy generation segment, lower volumes of PV component trading, higher personnel costs, and other expenses.

Depreciation increased to EUR 2.113 million from EUR 1.952 million a year earlier, attributable to the addition of new power plants in Romania. Interest expenses rose by 8.5% YoY, totaling EUR 2.678 million. The Group recorded a net loss of EUR -1.321 million, compared to a loss of EUR -4.170 million in Q1 2023.

Amsterdam - 17 May 2024 - Photon Energy N.V. (WSE: PEN, ""Photon Energy Group"", the ""Group"" or the ""Company"") announces financial results for the first quarter of 2024.

""The first quarter of 2024 was marked by our continued efforts to make our business model more resilient to further economic and geopolitical fluctuations. First of all, we have managed to complete the rebalancing of our IPP portfolio which, as of 1 April 2024, represents a nearly 50/50 split between the support scheme mechanism, or FIT, and a merchant model, selling on day-ahead spot prices. Transitioning to a more balanced portfolio between the two schemes is a strategic move, especially given the declining energy prices in the CEE region and current geopolitical uncertainties. In May 2024, we finally signed a project refinancing agreement for EUR 15 million with EBRD. This funding will undoubtedly provide a significant boost to the Group's expansion plans in Romania and the development of the capacity market offerings. Looking ahead, we believe that the achievements of this first quarter will not be undermined as they help us to leverage the strength of our business model and recover the overall growth and profitability of the Group in 2024. With the above changes in place, we feel more confident that we can promise a more positive trajectory for our Group's business in the coming quarters,"" said Georg Hotar, CEO of Photon Energy Group.

First Quarter 2024 and Recent Operational Highlights

In the first quarter, Photon Energy Group's consolidated revenues amounted to EUR 17.375 million, compared to EUR 19.280 million a year earlier, marking a decrease of 9.9% YoY.

Revenues from electricity generation reached EUR 3.746 million, a contraction of 9.7% YoY, primarily due to lower average realized electricity prices, which declined by 23.1% YoY, from EUR 173 / MWh in Q1 2023 to EUR 133 / MWh in Q1 2024. Although electricity generation increased to 30.2 GWh, up by 24.2% YoY, it was still insufficient to offset the impact of falling electricity prices.

Other revenues of the Group also decreased from EUR 15.129 million in Q1 2023 to EUR 13.629 million in the reporting period, down by 9.9% YoY, mainly due to weaker trading volumes of PV components. Other segments performed better than a year ago, particularly Photon Energy's New Energy division, which saw its external revenues increase by 120.5% YoY.

The Group's consolidated EBITDA of EUR 0.783 million more than doubled YoY, compared to EUR 0.330 million in Q1 2023. EBIT improved slightly to EUR -1.425 million, compared to EUR -1.569 million a year earlier. The Group's operating profitability was negatively impacted by the contraction of margins in the energy generation segment, lower volumes of PV component trading, higher personnel costs, and other expenses.

Depreciation increased to EUR 2.113 million from EUR 1.952 million a year earlier, attributable to the addition of new power plants in Romania. Interest expenses rose by 8.5% YoY, totaling EUR 2.678 million. The Group recorded a net loss of EUR -1.321 million, compared to a loss of EUR -4.170 million in Q1 2023. Other comprehensive income amounted to EUR 0.213 million, negatively impacted by foreign currency translation losses. Total comprehensive income for the first quarter of 2024 amounted to EUR -1.108 million.

The Company has published the full-year 2024 guidance, expecting revenues within the range of EUR 90-100 million, up by at least 27% compared to the last year, and EBITDA within the range of EUR 16-18 million, more then triple compared to EUR 3.7 million in 2023.

Electric vehicles 100%. Steel and Aluminum 25%. The purpose is to destroy China's economy. The reason? China continues trade with Russia.

If Russia wins the war with Ukraine there are fallouts: ego - front and center, the race to devalue the dollar will gain significant speed, America's hegemony is built on wars. Losing wars is typically a nonplus given the US funds both sides. In this case, funding Russia is not available -

The Position being held by these non-economist lawyers and bankers is that America manufacturing needs to be competitive. Why? Because American prices can't compete, therefore everyone must manufacture according America pricing. Which is significantly higher already due to the price of transportation and labor. According to the Directive, Biden claims American workers can only compete if China price matches...

When enacting tariffs, the loser in this scenario is American consumers who will now experience inflation ranging from 25% to 100%. The hardest hit will be everything electronic; cars, electric vehicles, appliances, cell phones, electricity, and Renewable Energy! Everything green will now be unaffordable. Simultaneously, the Intel chip making plant in Ohio has announced they are behind schedule and the plant may not be up and working until - 2030.

Very few Chinese EV's are actually sold in America, in fact very few EV's are sold in America as dealerships post losses and sit on billions in unsold inventory. According to the NYT, the industry 'fears a flood of China's EV's'... The reason? The one company that is poised to ship Chinese EV's to the US and Europe is Stellantis. The cost of the car is $10,000 and according to Elon Musk - the car is stellar! When the Federal Government is thru - Stellantis will be lucky to sell the car for $35,000 - taking away its competitive edge. Altering the entire concept of Free Trade.

Headquartered in Amsterdam, Stellantis was formed in 2021 thru the merger of Fiat and the French PSA Group. The Chair of Stellantis is John Elkann, the heir to the Gianni Agnelli family. He is NOT happy. His planned expansion of sales has just been gnashed. Leading to an 11.5% in share value.

While the EV market is the media focus - the steel and aluminum, and semiconductor tariffs will have the most egregious impact. These costs directly affect the Green Market of solar, and windmills, but will also impact construction, cars, infrastructure - including bridges, and military equipment. These tariffs are then absorbed by consumers and Taxpayers.

Right on cue, Mike Johnson declares that the Biden Handlers are wholly responsible for Inflation due to a government spending crisis - like the $95 billion Johnson approved.

Why would the handlers want to destroy the economies of The West?

The John Birch Society knew at its creation that a shadow government was controlling the FBI and CIA to convert the power of government to stakeholder elites and communists. The power of control needs to be autocratic. Founded in 1958, the John Birch Society is labeled anticommunist, right wing, radical, far right, libertarian, and a threat to democracy. John Birch was an intelligence officer in WWII who was shot by the Communist factions of Mao. He believed that communists in the Soviet Union and China were the greatest threat on earth. Robert Welch, jr, was the founder of the John Birch Society and stated:

""Both the U.S. and Soviet governments are controlled by the same furtive conspiratorial cabal of internationalists, greedy bankers, and corrupt politicians. If left unexposed, the traitors inside the U.S. government would betray the country's sovereignty to the United Nations for a collectivist New World Order, managed by a 'one-world socialist government'"".

The Society once included the Koch Brothers who left sometime in the 1970's. Everything America is fighting for today can be traced to the Birch Society warning us of the Communist agenda - secularism, big government, unlimited autocratic power, and a One World Economic Forum Government. As the Kabbalist collective plan is being shredded, they are ramping up their Agenda looking for disintegration wherever they can get it.

Somewhat of a last hurrah.

This is NOT about China or Russia or Ukraine - this is about ensuring and maintaining an autocratic control over those countries currently occupied, including America.

As the PM of Slovakia learned today, assassination is the outcome of a nonconformist ideology that does not align with the Kabbalah. Whistleblowers are targets of assassination for nonconformist ideology. And inventors who attempt to intervene in the allowed arena of Kabbalah industries are assassinated.

The Economist has called the elections in India - Modi Fatigue. The intentional insertion of Modi's opponent, Arvind Kejriwal, was financed by The Ford Foundation, which is a CIA construct - a left wing protÃ©gÃ© of the Kabbalah. In addition, Harper Collins published Kejriwal's book Swaraj which increased his assets by Rs 1,34,57, 504 crore - or 60%.

Modi is not anti-Russia enough for the CIA and needs to go out quietly - either via the elections or via the same means as the PM of Slovakia.

May 16 (Interfax) - Ukraine's power system is experiencing a major power shortage for most of the day, with hourly blackouts expected in all regions from 12:00 a.m. on Thursday, Ukrainian media quoted NEC Ukrenergo as saying on social media.

The company's dispatch center informed the distribution system operators of the consumption limits for each region, it said.

The distribution system operators said on social media they suspended hourly blackout schedules from 9 a.m. and could introduce them from 4 p.m. until the end of the day.

In particular, Lvovoblenergo, Rovnooblenergo, Poltavaoblenergo, Nikolayevoblenergo, as well as DTEK, whose distribution system operators are operating in Kiev, and in the Kiev, Odessa, and Dnepropetrovsk regions and in the Kiev-controlled part of Donetsk region, have already said that there will be no schedules until 4:00 pm.

At the same time, CEO of Yasno supplier Sergei Kovalenko said the power supply was not stable.

""Yesterday evening, Ukrenergo revealed the limits that would allow us to work in line with the schedules, but subsequently they were adjusted several more times. In the morning, we hopelessly failed to meet the limits, so emergency blackouts were applied,"" Kovalenko said.

Ukraine persistently lacks power generation capacity and imports to meet the current level of consumption, he said, adding that he hoped for sparing electricity consumption to go through the evening peak without emergency blackouts, just with hourly schedules.

Due to the increase in consumption on Wednesday, emergency blackouts of industrial and household consumers in all Ukrainian regions had to be extended until 11:40 p.m. They were originally scheduled from 7:25 p.m. to 10:00 p.m., Ukrenergo said.

At the same time, the emergency aid from the European Union countries has already been used from 12:00 a.m. to 1:00 a.m. on Thursday, Ukrenergo said. Meanwhile, the Energy Ministry said the aid would be also used during the evening peak hours and called for tight savings.

Electricity is being imported from Romania, Slovakia, Poland, Hungary, and Moldova in the total amount of 23,500 MWh, nearly reaching Wednesday's record high of 23,700 MWh. The maximum imports reaching 1,653 MW in some hours, which is close to 1,700 MWh, the maximum technical capacity of electricity supply from Europe to Ukraine and Moldova.

In total, 446 communities throughout Ukraine had no electricity for various reasons this morning, Ukrenergo said.",interfax.com,news,interfax.com,,-0.1294117647058823,453579860,10,,

Jill and I are praying for a swift recovery, and our thoughts are with his family and the people of Slovakia. We condemn this horrific act of violence. Our Embassy is in close touch with the government of Slovakia and ready to assist.""

Russia's ground attacks in the Kharkiv region in this past week are a plain reminder of what its war is fundamentally about: a territorial pursuit with average Ukrainians paying the costs. These operations, which Ukraine is valiantly withstanding, come after weeks of strikes meant to cripple Ukrainian cities and Kharkiv in particular.

On the night of May 7th, Russia fired more than 70 missiles and drones in its relentless large-scale barrage against Ukraine's critical infrastructure. According to the Ukrainian Air Force, Russia used these weapons to target the country's power system, striking energy generation and transmission facilities in six oblasts throughout the country.

The May 7 attacks were the fifth such bombardment in two months. Here's what Amnesty International had to say about them, ""in what may be cumulatively one of Russia's most destructive series of strikes on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, several power facilities were attacked, resulting in further suffering and disruption to Ukrainian civilians. Deliberately attacking civilian infrastructure, such as power stations and electricity supplies, and causing overwhelming harm to civilians is a violation of international humanitarian law."" This is all part of an escalation by the Kremlin to wield energy as a weapon.

As in previous assaults, Russia tried to permanently damage Ukraine's infrastructure, hitting difficult-to-repair gas storage facilities and power generation assets. Ukraine's main private energy operator confirmed three thermal power plants were seriously damaged. State grid operator Ukrenergo warned of rolling emergency blackouts as a result of the May 7th strikes.

This salvo is a stark reminder of what President Putin seeks to achieve through force - to break the spirit of the Ukrainian people. These attacks on Ukraine's electricity generation capacity follow two winters in which Russia sought to weaponize winter to freeze Ukraine into submission. Now, Russia appears to be trying to paralyze the country through the deprivation of basic necessities year-round. Take a moment to think about what this means for the people of Ukraine. No running water. No sanitation. No access to essential medical services.

In Kharkiv, one of Russia's strikes on the local energy supply crippled the city's air raid siren, a wartime necessity to protect civilians. The mayor of Kharkiv said Russia was trying to make Kharkiv ""uninhabitable.""

Yet, the residents of Kharkiv and civilians across Ukraine show their undaunted determination to carry on with life despite the destruction and the precautionary nationwide blackouts to conserve energy. Ordinary citizens and businesses, from cafes to hairdressers to factories, are finding ways to survive this siege, proving the remarkable resilience of the Ukrainian people.",osce.usmission.gov,news,U.S. Mission to the OSCE,,-0.3568627450980392,453548786,10,https://osce.usmission.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/37/AP24132640533121.jpg,eng-9568376

Simson also said that ""Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania will become fully integrated into the EU's internal electricity market and gain full control of their electricity networks. This will increase the energy security of the whole region"".

The three Baltic countries agreed to set ""early 2025"" as the deadline for synchronisation with Europe's continental grid.

The European Union has invested more than â¬1.2 billion in subsidies for the project.

""Synchronisation is the most monumental energy independence project in the Baltic States and it is in its final phase,"" the Latvian electricity transmission system operator, JSC 'Augstsprieguma tÄ«kls' (AST) told Euractiv.

The Estonian, Latvian, and Lithuanian electricity systems were integrated into the IPS/UPS transmission network during the Soviet occupation. This network, which is largely managed by Moscow, supplies 280 million customers with electricity, mainly in the former USSR countries and Central Asia.

In 2007, the then prime ministers of the three Baltic states agreed a strategic objective of joining the European continental grid. On 20 June 2019, these three countries and the European Commission signed a political roadmap to achieve synchronisation.

Riga, Tallinn, and Vilnius have put an end to their electrical isolation by building new interconnecting transmission wires with Finland, Poland, and Sweden. However, their electricity networks remain synchronised with the Russian and Belarusian systems (commonly known as the 'BRELL ring').

In contrast, the EU countries of Central and Eastern Europe - Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Slovakia, which had all also been part of the Soviet bloc until 1991 - already synchronised their systems with the continental European grid (CEN) between 1995 and 2004.

Synchronisation with the EU grid is planned via the existing transmission line between Lithuania and Poland (LitPol Link) and a future submarine cable between the two countries. Technical equipment must also be deployed, to guarantee the overall stability and security of the electricity system.

Latvian electricity transmission network operator AST told Euractiv the project is 'in the final phase of work', with the installation this month of three 'synchronous condensers' in each of the Baltic countries and the reconstruction by June of the two interconnections between Latvia and Estonia.

In July 2022 Lithuania's Vice-Minister of Energy Albinas ZananaviÄius announced the country's intention to speed up the transition process and leave the BRELL transmission system before 2025.

Vilnius successfully conducted an isolated operation test of the country's electricity system in April 2023, proving they are capable of joining the synchronous network of continental Europe (UCTE) as early as this year.

However, Estonia and Latvia require more time, and Lithuanian authorities have agreed to wait until all three countries are ready before achieving full synchronisation with the European grid.

In March 2022, the Ukrainian and Moldovan grids were synchronised with the European power system. While the 'emergency synchronisation' could be completed rapidly after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the move was based on preparatory technical work which began in 2017.",euractiv.com,news,EurActiv.com,,0.1215686274509804,453528107,34,https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/shutterstock_1434482111-1-800x450.jpg,eng-9576905

Rosie is still doing well recovering between chemo sessions. Her next one is next Monday. Ruby came home this morning. They had her temperature back to normal about three hours after they started pushing fluids and I headed home for the night. She's drinking, can hold a squat, her temp is normal, but she's a bit zonked out. For obvious reasons given what she went through yesterday. I want to thank everyone for the good thoughts, well wishes, and prayers. Both the ongoing ones for Rosie and the ones last night and today for Ruby.

By now you've seen this. I want to thank Cole and TaMara for doing this, as well as Watergirl who I've been informed helped out behind the scenes. I really appreciate it. And I want to thank everyone that has already donated or is considering donating.

Given the events of yesterday afternoon and evening, I'm going to keep tonight's update shorter as I'm fried. Not as tired as Ruby, but tired nonetheless.

While I was drafting this update, air raid alerts went up over Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia Oblasts.

The Russians have (re)added Kherson to its target list.

Russian forces attacked 10 communities in Sumy Oblast on May 15, killing one civilian and injuring another, the Sumy Oblast Military Administration reported.

The communities of Khotin, Bilopillia, Krasnopillia, Velyka Pysarivka, Nova Sloboda, Esman, Shalyhyne, Druzhbivka, Seredyna-Buda, and Znob-Novhorodske were targeted.

The town of Esman and surrounding areas were attacked with mortars, multiple launch rocket systems, and artillery. One woman was killed in the shelling, according to regional authorities. In the Druzhbivka community, one civilian was injured in the shelling. No details were provided on the extent of the victims' injuries.

Throughout the day, Russia assailed the border communities with mortar, artillery, rocket launcher, and drone attacks. The community of nova Sloboda saw six mines dropped over the past 24 hours.

In total,183 explosions were recorded in 37 separate attacks on the region.

Sumy Oblast borders Russia's Bryansk, Kursk, and Belgorod oblasts. Russian strikes against Sumy Oblast have become increasingly destructive in recent months. Amid intensified attacks, Ukrainian authorities ordered increased evacuations from the region.

Dear Ukrainians!

All day long our military and the Ministry of Defense have been delivering reports. Our attention is constantly focused on the frontline, on all combat zones. In the Kharkiv region -- the areas near the border, the city of Vovchansk -- our defensive actions continue. Over the course of the day our Defense and Security Forces of Ukraine -- all units involved -- have managed to partially stabilize the situation. The occupier, who entered the Kharkiv region, is being destroyed with all available means. Artillery, drones, and our infantry are working quite accurately. I thank all those who are in their positions now. The same attention is paid to all other directions. Especially to the Pokrovsk direction in the Donetsk region, as well as to the Kupyansk direction in the Kharkiv region. We clearly see how the occupier is trying to distract our forces and make our combat work less concentrated. We are reacting to this exactly as we should -- we must have the means to retaliate against the enemy in every direction. Our Ukrainian result, our strength, depends on every soldier, every sergeant, and every officer who is directly in their positions, in combat, on the frontline: the full accomplishment of combat tasks in the current conditions should disrupt the Russian offensive plans. Throughout the day there were also reports on the internal situation: security, the elimination of the consequences of Russian strikes. Today there was a brutal attack on Kherson, Russian aerial bombs... Dnipro -- there was a Russian missile attack... Kharkiv, Mykolaiv, and Sumy regions... Our rescuers of SES of Ukraine had a lot of work today. I thank every rescue team for their consistent promptness. I thank all the states that also help us, always promptly and always efficiently, -- help our people and our state. The world has the strength, it has the weapons, it has the ability to force Russia into peace -- into a just peace. And to succeed in this, absolutely everything must be done now to ensure that the Russian offensive and the Russian attempt to expand the war fails.

And one more thing.

Today there was an appalling attack on the Prime Minister of Slovakia, Robert Fico. This is a totally unacceptable act of violence. I wish Mr. Prime Minister a speedy recovery, and it is important that the attacker be held accountable for his actions. No form of violence, and especially political violence, should ever be a part of people's existence.

Glory to all who defend life! I thank all those who defend Ukraine!

Glory to Ukraine!

IMHO, this could have worked out much better if the secretary had first announced an outstanding aid package for Ukraine and a major U.S. administration shift toward the use of U.S. provided weapons against important military targets in the Russian territory - and then had this gig in Kyiv.

Two and a half more months until Ukraine is properly reprovisioned.

Night

What happened today - the power outage in the population - was, unfortunately, a matter of time.

The last few weeks have been full of dissonance. Despite the shelling, you and I had no idea how difficult the situation was. At the same time, we lost most of the shunting generation. But energy experts 24/7 came up with schemes to make sure that we do not feel the last attacks of the enemy. And they succeeded. I want to say that real heroes work at Ukrenergo and DTEK. And sometimes we don't see it, but they are the ones who, staying in their places even during shelling and risking their lives, do everything possible so that we are with the light.

However, not today. The deficit has not gone away, imports have physical limits, and the demand for a commodity called electricity is increasing significantly because of the low temperature. Today it is low, and in summer it is the opposite - due to the load due to the heat.

As a result of shelling, we lost 8 GW of capacity. And first of all, maneuvering capacities such as TPP or hydroelectric power stations. So, a difficult period awaits us. And not so much in the summer, when we will experience these outages, as in the winter.

But no one gives up and everything is already being done to change the situation. Both generation companies and the largest consumers among businesses. Many thanks to them for this.

However, it is very important that our business can work, that we have someone to create GDP, strengthen the army, that people have work. Therefore, it is wrong to transfer the entire deficit to business. If we want to win, we need to create parity between the population and business, so, unfortunately, blackouts are inevitable for you and me.

Of course, maybe right now the energy experts are coming up with a new scheme, how to make the lack of electricity less noticeable, but we have to go through this difficult path. And everyone should understand their responsibility in this matter, and each of us should limit our consumption.

And we will pass this stage, and we will restore everything, we will overcome everything, because the victory will be ours!

@YASN0_ua

This morning, 53-year-old Oleksandr from Vovchansk took his three dogs, documents, canned food, and photo albums and set off for evacuation. He walked 15 km until the police picked him up. He decided to leave the town after a russian tank damaged his house. Vovchansk is devastated, with russian troops constantly attack the town.

ð·Suspilne Kharkiv

Until a few months ago, I was often asked about my opinion on a possible russian offensive on Kharkiv Oblast and whether I thought the city was ready to repel it. I answered that the authorities stated Kharkiv Oblast was reliably fortified, and I could only hope and believe them. Now, I don't believe it.

Here's the machine translation of Deep State's tweet:

ð© Unprepared defense lines 10 km from the state border of Ukraine

ð¼ In continuation of yesterday's topic about IFS. Many accepted the thesis about the commission and the search for the guilty with skepticism. And we will probably agree, because instead of finding the culprits, everything is blamed on ""discrediting"" and hostile IPSO.

ð§± Forced to additionally provide footage of one of the unprepared positions of the VOP 10 km from DKU (in 2023, the nearest enemy SP was at a distance of 15 km), which the fighters shared with us. And here we are not talking about the absence of engineering and fortification structures, but rather about their poor preparation and incompetent approach, which, most likely, was presented to the military and political leadership as ""success"", from which conclusions could even be drawn about the ""final stages of the construction of the IFS"" , in particular, in the Kharkiv region.

ð¤ Looking ahead, let's dispel theses about ""began to arrange"" and ""hostile IPSO"". Other positions of ""fortifications"" have only its name, because they did not begin to be equipped at all. And it seems very strange that 10 km from the state border during 2023-2024 they were able to carry out only the first stage of construction there. Such a negligent approach to the work process played an evil joke in the Ocheretiny district. And only due to the fact that our fighters had to withdraw from their positions, it was possible to avoid losses from light damage by artillery and FPV drones. Fortunately, Muscovites ended up in their place. As for the ""permanent shelling"" thesis, their intensification began closer to the offensive.

ð¤·ð»âï¸ If corruption and unprofessionalism continue to be attributed to IPSO, then we all have big problems with the future. Still, it's worth focusing on the checks...

Reportedly, Russian S-400 radar components in occupied Crimea destroyed last night with a Ukrainian-used ATACMS.

This is far from the first time that Ukraine uses U.S.-provided ATACMS (the use of which has been one giant boogeyman for the last 2 years of war!) against top-priority Russian targets.

And the sky is not falling down on the earth, there's no 'nuclear escalation', no 'WWIII' or whatever else Russian state propaganda and surrender cultists in the West try to intimidate the public with to undermine the support of Ukraine's defense.

What happens in reality, again and again, is Russia losing its top-notch air defense capabilities it uses in its war to exterminate Ukraine.

(Sorry, I accidentally deleted the previous tweet about this)

Regarding tonight's missile strikes on Russian Belbek military airfield:

""10 ATACMS ballistic missiles were fired towards the airfield. It is worth noting that the signal about targets detection was given two minutes before the actual strike.

Losses:

* Airfield fuel and lubricants warehouse;

* Two S-400 air defense missile launchers;

* Radar ""92N6E"";

* MiG-31 damaged;

* 3 MiG-27s damaged.

There is information on the network about damage to 3 Su-27s, without confirmation yet (perhaps they were confused with the MiG).

7 servicemen from units of the 27th mixed aviation division (military unit 46434, Sevastopol) and the 31st air defense division (military unit 03121, Sevastopol) were killed. Another 12 were injured of varying degrees of severity.""

https://t.me/dosye_shpiona/528

/3. Russian claims regarding night strikes on Belbek military airfield in Crimea:

""At night, Ukrainian formations launched a new attack on Crimean airfields. This time the target was Belbek, at which up to 16 ATACMS operational-tactical missiles with a cluster warhead were fired. (Interesting to watch how the Russian claimed number of ATACMS missiles increased from 8 in the early morning to 10 and now to 16)

The sounds of the work of the 31st Air Force and Air Defense divisions were heard by the population of Crimea and Sevastopol around 2 am. Even residents of Chernomorskoe noted flashes and sounds of explosions in the sky. In total, about 13 missiles were shot down on the approaches to Belbek.

Unfortunately, we failed to shoot down one or two missiles. And the results of the hits again became known to the whole world thanks to the publication of video from a surveillance camera on the Internet. How and why this is still possible in the third year of the war has long been a rhetorical question.

As we ourselves and our colleagues have noted more than once, until criminal penalties are introduced for the publication of such videos and photos, Ukrainian formations will have no problem assessing the results of their strikes even without the help of NATO satellites.

It is not entirely clear where the missiles were launched from. Previous raids were from the Berislav area (Kherson region). But, as a rule, the enemy changes positions to prevent detection. And the ATACMS range of 300 km increases the combat capabilities of the Ukrainian Armed Forces.

It is possible that this time the launch was carried out from the Kherson region. However, some of our sources report that the missiles' flight was recorded from the direction of Snake island. So the launchers could be located somewhere near Vilkovo on the border with Romania.""",balloon-juice.com,news,Balloon Juice,Adam L Silverman,0.05098039215686279,453521243,4,https://balloon-juice.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Silverman_On_Security.jpg,eng-9561745

Ukraine has been forced to introduce temporary blackouts across the country, affecting both industry and the local population, as it struggles with the aftermath of Russian strikes, the national power grid operator said.

In a statement on Wednesday morning, Ukrenergo said it had ""implemented controlled emergency shutdowns for industrial and household consumers in all regions of Ukraine,"" adding that critical infrastructure was not affected. It later clarified that the restrictions lasted two to three hours and did not apply to the Kiev-controlled part of Russia's Kherson Region.

""The reason is a significant shortage of electricity in the system due to Russian shelling and an increase in consumption due to the cold weather,"" Ukrenergo said

The operator also warned the public that the blackouts would most likely be in the evening hours due to increased power consumption. In addition, there will be power limitation schedules throughout the day for industrial consumers on Wednesday, Ukrenergo noted.

This came after the operator introduced similar restrictions for industry on Tuesday, which were followed by controlled power cuts in the evening due to a spike in consumption.

To alleviate the pressure, Ukraine is importing energy from neighboring EU countries, including Romania, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, and Moldova, Ukrenergo added. A day earlier, the operator said its repair crews were making every effort to restore power, although in frontline regions the work is constantly hampered by air raid sirens.

The rolling blackouts come after Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmitry Kuleba admitted earlier this month that Russian strikes had damaged half of the country's energy system. The Ukrhydroenergo power generating company said last week that its hydroelectric facilities had suffered ""overwhelming damage.""

Meanwhile, Ukrainian Energy Minister German Galushchenko estimated the combined financial losses from Russian attacks at more than $1 billion, warning that the figure would continue to rise.

Moscow has ramped up strikes on Ukraine's military and energy infrastructure in recent weeks. The Russian Defense Ministry said last month that the strikes were in response to Kiev's attempts to target oil facilities in the country. Moscow reiterated that the attacks are only aimed at Ukrainian military targets and facilities that support their operations and never at the civilian population.",industriesnews.net,news,industriesnews.net,,-0.207843137254902,453514026,1,https://cdn.bignewsnetwork.com/rtc1715778829.jpg,

Full transcript - EON SE (OTC: EONGY ) Q1 2024:

Iris Eveleigh: Hello, everyone. Dear analysts and investors, welcome to our First Quarter 2024 Financial Results Call. Thank you for taking the time to join us today. I'm here with Marc Spieker, for whom this will be the last earnings call as CFO before he takes over his new role as Chief Operating Officer, Commercial. Marc, thank you very much for our successful earnings calls together. At the same time, I'm excited to have Nadia taking over as CFO in June, and I'm looking forward to having her join the earnings calls from our H1 results onwards. As for today's call, as usual, we will leave enough room for your questions after the presentation. With that, over to you, Marc.

Marc Spieker: Thank you, Iris, and a warm welcome from my side as well. I will save my goodbye words for later. Let us straight dive into the Q1 results, and let me start with highlighting the key messages for today. First message, Q1 came out in line with our expectations for all businesses. Key drivers of our slight EBITDA and net income increase, we're investing back earnings growth and strong operational execution more than offsetting the unwind of prior year one-off and timing effects. Second message. Our planned CapEx ramp-up is progressing well. We have accelerated again our spending by almost 25% year-over-year and are well on track in terms of quarterly fill rates across all business segments. Third message, our Q1 economic net debt came in as expected, showing the typical Q1 cash flow seasonality and the final outflows related to the unwinding of the positive one-off working capital effects that we have been reporting to you as of our 2022 results, and I'll come back to that later. Fourth and final message, we have a strong conviction in the relevant and long-term growth path of our Energy Infrastructure Solutions business. To make our ambitions more visible, we are moving the business into a stand-alone segment from this quarter onwards as announced. Finally, our guidance is fully confirmed. On to our Q1 EBITDA development. Our adjusted EBITDA came in at EUR 2.7 billion, up 1% year-over-year despite the lack of significant positive impacts from one-offs that we had seen in the prior year quarter. As expected, our Energy Networks business is slightly down in Q1 due to unwinding positive regulatory account effects of 2023, such as the benefit from lower redispatch costs, as well as slightly higher-than-expected costs from upstream networks in Germany. Additionally, we have changed the accounting for our Slovakian VSE business, to an equity consolidation, which leads to a technical reduction in EBITDA in our Central Eastern Europe business, no impact on net income. All those effects are economically neutral and they were largely offset by strong RAB driven earnings growth across all regions and the positive uplift of regulatory parameters in Sweden. Regarding network losses, Sweden and Slovakia have now completed their recoveries, while additional recoveries are now only happening in Southern Eastern Europe. You may have noted that we have now split our reporting of the CEE and Turkey segment into Central Eastern Europe and Southeastern Europe. This shall give you more transparency on our geographically well-diversified portfolio of networks businesses. The Central Eastern Europe segment covers Czech Republic, Poland and Slovakia. The Southeastern Europe segment includes our activities in Hungary, Romania and Turkey. Moving on to Energy Infrastructure Solutions. New project commissioning is leading to EBITDA growth, as you would expect, supporting our 13% EBITDA accumulated average growth rate target from 2023 to 2028. This development is masked in Q1 by the absence of a positive one-off effect from last year and by changed intra-year maintenance schedule with a stronger focus on Q1 this year. With a change in maintenance schedule, we are partly mitigating also the negative effects from mild weather that we have been observing during the first quarter. In Energy Retail, the significant year-over-year EBITDA increase was primarily driven by positive price adjustments since Q1 last year. Additionally, we benefited from the improvement in our B2B segment in the U.K., which is successfully continuing its margin over volume strategy. Those positive effects were partially offset by the lack of procurement optimization benefits that we had seen in Q1 last year and it's a very favorable commodity price background last year and lower weather-driven volumes in Q1. Corporate Functions and Other segments saw an expected slight EBITDA decline driven by the lower results from our Turkish generation business due to the development of commodity prices also in Turkey. Moving on to our adjusted net income, which showed an increase of 2% which broadly follows the year-over-year EBITDA development. All earnings elements below EBITDA have developed in line with our expectations. The share of minority income sits at around 19% for the first quarter, as expected. And with that, materially below prior year. We expect this share to continue to go down and be lower for the full year as we communicated in our full year 2023 earnings release. Looking at the development of our economic net debt, I would like to highlight 3 points. First, our promised CapEx ramp-up is being executed like clockwork. We increased our Q1 investment spending by close to 25% year-over-year. I can assure you that we continue to be fully focused on ensuring a frictionless ramp up, managing closely our operations and supply chains. So far, we do not see any critical bottleneck on the horizon. Second, we have seen the typical operating cash outflow in Q1, which is driven by our seasonal business patterns in both Energy Retail and Energy Networks, specifically Energy Networks in Germany. As expected, this outflow was slightly amplified by the final unwind of our 2022 one-off working capital benefits. It's a long time ago, not everyone may remember, but our 2022 full year cash conversion set at a very benign 151%, significantly above the 100% we normally target. And as communicated in March for 2024, we are foreseeing a conversion rate of around 90%. And with that, the final reversal of these positive working capital effects from 2022 after 2024, we expect cash conversion to then swing back to the guided 100%. Third message on END, our strong balance sheet position has recently been confirmed by 2 of our rating agencies. We have received a rating upgrade by Standard & Poor's and a full rating confirmation by Moody's (NYSE: MCO ). As communicated before, in line with our commitment to a strong BBB BAA rating, we have additional balance sheet capacity to fund further investments needed for a successful European energy transition if regulatory conditions further improve. Considering the balance sheet, it is also worth highlighting that we have already issued EUR 3.3 billion of bonds in the first quarter. With that, we have already fully covered our funding needs for 2024 and partially already prefunded 2025. Moving on to Energy Infrastructure Solutions. As announced, we will report this business as a stand-alone segment from this quarter onwards. Strategically and with a view to future growth, this segment is all about exploiting the huge business opportunities from decarbonization and to a large extent, electrification of the heating sector. The segment comprises our activities in designing, building, owning, operating and optimizing sustainable energy infrastructure assets for cities and business customers. Our solutions are based on modular standard building blocks, which are configured and digitally connected to fit specific customer needs. Technologically, our offerings include firstly, renewable on and offsite generation assets like photovoltaic and wind. Secondly, gas or biomass-fired heat and power engines. Thirdly, heat pumps and geothermal solutions. Fourthly, waste heat recovery technologies. And finally, high- and low-temperature heating and cooling grids. From a business point of view, we distinguish 2 clusters within Energy Infrastructure Solutions. First cluster is district heating and cooling, which is about running low-carbon heating and cooling networks in urban areas. Second business area is our industrial and commercial solutions business, offering on-site energy infrastructure for industrial and commercial customers. We have decided to also include our U.K. smart metering business in this segment, while technologically, obviously different in nature, it is a quasi-regulated business and hence, of similar nature when it comes to financial visibility and resilience. Let me remind you of some more financial and business characteristics relevant for our Energy Infrastructure Solutions business. Geographically, we are present in 15 countries, the key ones being Germany, Sweden and the U.K. Our pan-European coverage and strong regional anchoring represent a unique advantage to address our customers' needs for locally optimized energy infrastructure. Our strategy to standardize our offerings in a modular way will allow us to scale our solutions. Therefore, out of the EUR 5 billion CapEx plan for the next 5 years, 80% will be dedicated to growth investments. Through long-term contracts with customers, commodity price volatility and inflation are effectively passed through, for instance, via price escalation clauses. We ensure that any new project is targeted to deliver an internal rate of return spread over WACC of between 120 to 350 basis points. Furthermore, our rigorous focus on operational excellence ensures high asset availability. This is supported by digitalization, which helps to steer, monitor and effectively maintain and optimize the fleet of more than 6,000 assets. We expect annual EBITDA growth of 13% on average. Keep in mind that the municipal heat transition across Europe is still at an early stage. So there is more -- much more to come, but too soon for us to quantify what the impact will be over time. Let me close today's presentation with Slide 8 what you essentially should take away from us today. First, extremely solid Q1 outturn supports our expected earnings delivery for 2024. Second, our investment ramp-up is progressing well, which fully underpins the delivery of our midterm organic growth targets. Third, our balance sheet remains very healthy. We will continue to focus on delivering an attractive total shareholder return based on value creative organic growth and an annually growing dividend per share. And with that, let me move to a personal note. We announced in March that I would be moving on to take over as a Chief Operating Officer, the responsibility for our Energy Infrastructure and Retail Businesses from June onwards this year. We deliver what we promised. So inevitably, today is my last results call as CFO. It has been close to 8 years as CFO in the Board of Management of E.ON, hundreds of roadshows and exactly 30 results calls. I am not going away, but I will be focused on different things going forward. Great news for you is our investors and analysts that with Nadia Jakobi, I have the best successor I can think of. I know that with her, you, your interest and most importantly, your investments will continue to be in safe hands. Dear Iris, I would also like to express my thanks to the best Investor Relations team I can think of. And finally, it has been a privilege for me to represent our company in the capital markets. I'm extremely grateful for so many deep and thoughtful conversations during roadshows and other formats. And a big thank you to all of you for that. Before we get too sentimental, there is still business to be done. So let's move on to our Q&A session.

A - Iris Eveleigh: Thank you very much, Marc. And with that, we will start our Q&A session. Let me remind you all briefly, as you all do know, please stick to 2 questions each so that most of you have the chance to ask the questions. If there's anything we can't answer today, then the IR team is always there to also answer further questions from you. With that, the first question comes from Alberto from Goldman Sachs.

Alberto Gandolfi: Good morning, and Marc, thanks for all the help and all the best. We -- I guess we need to lean on you even more on the execution of all these EUR 20 billion CapEx plan. So congratulations, and thank you once more. Two questions on my side. The first one is a border line very boring, but can I understand, please, in the first quarter, what type of nonrecurring items we have in networks and in customer solutions. I'm trying to go to the underlying earnings power. So as I understand, you released some provisions. The weather was very mild, can you tell us if you booked negative and positive network losses, either recovery or cost? That is the first question. I have the feeling the underlying is stronger. That's why I'm asking. The second question is I've seen a DSO plan that implies that potentially if feasible, which I understand from what you're saying is not, your CapEx plan could be 50% higher than what you presented in March. What underpins the plus 50%. Is it possible you give us a view on what assumptions we would have to flex to have even more investments. Is this driven by power demand, electrification, more renewables, data centers or just to have a fee for written.

Marc Spieker: Yes. So Alberto, let me start with the nonrecurring items. Compared to last year, we had a lot of positive one-offs. In Q1 this year is much less impacted by any one-off effect. If you look at our Energy Networks business, I think the remaining piece that we see here is a mid-double-digit million euro amount of final recovery for network losses essentially relating to 2022. So there's still a minor positive one-off in our Energy Networks business. For Energy Retail, essentially, we talk about weather impact, which you may now call kind of extraordinary one-off or not. It's basically a -- it's a metric risk, which will hit us every year kind of in a positive or negative way in Q1 due to the mild temperatures, actually record mild temperatures. That was the second warmest Q1, I think, during the last 50 years. Not that I recollect that, but what the statistics tell and that was a mid-double-digit million euro negative impact. So across both segments, then it's a wash net nil impact from one-off essentially. Your question to CapEx spend there is very valid. And with that, you're referring to a publication that we have also done about the initial allocation plan, which is kind of an exercise, which is regularly done by the DSO in close alignment with the German regulator, where basically, on a regular basis, we look at what are actually the political targets for renewables build or for development of the energy system. Germany specifically relevant Easter package, and then it's broken down in a technical way. So what are, if you implement those targets as they are written, what would technically have to be done in order then to allow for these targets to be executed. And in that sense, this 50% upside to which you referred to, is to be taken with special care. First of all, it just reconfirms what we have been telling our shareholders also with our full year results that when it comes to our network growth plans, there is room for more if economic conditions are right. And this is what we are working on in that sense, there is no change to our communication in our plans that we will continue to be working with the relevant authorities to make sure that economic incentives are the right ones to support this, which is one of the constraints by the way, which this initial allocation plan does not include, but which by legislation is actually given. Secondly, it is a technical plan, which does not take into account practical constraints. And we have seen these practical constraints, particularly playing a role when it comes to permitting, just to mention one, and it would be unrealistic in our view to now assume that they're technically possible in an unconstrained way can be delivered with all the constraints which we have in a practical way. And in that sense, what you should take away is there is a huge potential for E.ON to further invest and accelerate our investments over time. And as just similar to our results, we also have the financial means to do this if the conditions set by the regulators fit.

Alberto Gandolfi: This is very clear. So if you just allow me a comment. You've done essentially if it's clean for Q1, you've done 36% of the midpoint of your guidance in Q1. So it seems you're leaving an easy rest of the year to Nadia from here.

Marc Spieker: I take this as a statement, which I'm not commenting on. We move on.

Iris Eveleigh: Exactly. So we move on to the next question. Thank you, Alberto. Next question comes from Harry from Exane.

Harry Peter Wyburd: So 2 for me. First, can I dig in a little bit to what's going on in U.K. B2B supply. Why is it that you're earning so much, you made so much in such a short period of time? Do you think this is an industry-wide phenomenon for the whole of the U.K. supply market? Or is it just something that you're doing as E.ON? And can you just help us understand a bit what size of clients are driving this very good performance. Are we talking about much smaller B2B customers or medium-sized, just a bit of color there would be very helpful. And second one is a bit more strategic and a bit of a follow-on from Alberto's questions on the CapEx. Is there any update or view from you on what your partners are doing or what others are doing in the German DNO market in terms of funding. Because I guess, if we're talking about an already upgraded CapEx plan potentially seeing even much more significant, more upside? And how are your partners going to fund this? And might we get into a situation where you're effectively incentivized to put your investment into your fully-owned DNO subsidiaries and not the ones where you've got partners because, of course, if your partners aren't putting capital in, it's harder for you to make a good return on your investment.

Marc Spieker: Just on the second one, when you are referring to partner, could you just specify what partners exactly are you referring to? Are you referring to our co-investors on some of the DSO or are you referring to the [indiscernible]? Okay. Good. So let me start with the second question. We see across the board an extremely strong alignment between our interest and the interest of our core investors on a DSO level, which are larger municipalities for a number of our German DSOs and there is a very strong focus on all of our sites to make the energy transition work. And if -- also from a funding point of view to make whatever is there needed and possible also then on the level of the DSO side. And generally, we do not see a particularly constraint on that side or a clash of interest nonesoever. On the I&C business in the U.K., it follows our strategy where we had said that in most markets, we want to exit large B2B customers. So to your question, what are the customers? It's large I&C clients. This is not small, medium enterprises. This is around large industrial and commercial customers. And the U.K. is the only market where we continue to run such a segment at scale. But this is why also strategically, we are very clear on that business, we'll have to be steered on margins and not on volume. So what we have been seeing this business doing is running on a smaller and smaller book and focusing more and more on those customers where we are able then to make a risk-adjusted fair margin if I look at the risk transformation that we're doing for these clients. I don't want to refer and can't refer now to whether that's an industry-wide phenomenon or not. What I can tell you that this is not a one-hit wonder, which has happened now in Q1. It is a development that we have been working for throughout the last 4 years with the continuous effort on managing our customer portfolio in that business.

Iris Eveleigh: Next question comes from Deepa from Bernstein.

Deepa Venkateswaran: And Marc, look forward to meeting you in person for your farewell events. So my 2 questions are actually centered around your German networks. So firstly, if I'm not mistaken, you were still awaiting for some more details on the current regulatory period. I was just wondering if you can update if there's been any change on the efficiency factors or anything. And the second one was looking forward to the next regulatory period, there's obviously a consultation out from the regulator to move to back and reduce the regulatory period. And then there's also the live court case that you have for the current period. So just wondering how you think the negotiations will evolve? And should we assume that if you're successful in the court case, the regulator -- I mean is there quid pro quo between getting a better deal post '29 and leaving some money on the table for existing assets now? Or how would you think of this discussion.

Marc Spieker: So where do we have news and where do we essentially looking at the same time line with no -- is expected no further update. So first of all, what we have seen since the full year results is the publication of the efficiency benchmark. And the good news is that E.ON continues to be very efficient, i.e., 100% efficient operator. And I think that underpins our strategic relevance and the efforts that we are doing and continuously focusing on operational excellence also in our Energy Networks business. There hasn't been a further update on then the general efficiency factor. So -- and that stands on the efficiency front. We have now a public confirmation about what we have been working towards any or as an ambition to be fully efficient and we now need to see how the regulator deals with the general efficiency factor. Still, this has not been published yet. On the consultation, then for the regulatory period starting 2028 for I guess '29 for power, no update essentially, Deepa that is worth relevant sharing here. I think what we continue to look at, first and foremost, is the proposal by the regulator. How to deal with depreciation schedules for existing gas networks. So this was one of the ideas expressed as part of the consultation paper where the regulator also pronounced that they were seeking there a fast solution. So kind of in the pipeline to expect is then a clarification by the regulator on how they intend to deal with existing gas networks, which is obviously also relevant for the energy transition in total. And for a lot of the market players, as you know for us gas networks has a very small share in our RAB but this is from a regulatory point of view, what we would expect to be the upcoming release. I think that's on the regulatory side.

Deepa Venkateswaran: Just the court case could you comment.

Marc Spieker: Court case, also no update. So we haven't seen any -- there hasn't been any specific intervention with the court, no hearing, et cetera. So nothing to update on that side.

Iris Eveleigh: With that, we move on to the questions from Wanda from UBS.

Unidentified Analyst: Marc, all the best, again. Two questions for me. The first one is on your 2024 guidance. I mean, Energy Retail, you had a very strong start into the year. Q1 EBITDA accounts for 50% of the full year guidance. So do you expect any reversal later this year? Or is there any buffer included in the guidance, something similar to what you did at the end of last year. And if there is any buffer, would you be able to quantify it? And the second question is on the UK Retail. In March [indiscernible] launched a discussion paper for the future of price protection, the [indiscernible] collection is upcoming. How do you see the market structure changing as the current one, the price cut doesn't really work.

Marc Spieker: So 2024 guidance, Wanda. I think what I would stress is that we are back basically in normal operations. So while the last 2 years have been very much affected by energy crisis and kind of the relief from the energy crisis. We are now more or less back in normal mode. And I think where we can take confidence from is how well we have managed the first quarter, which has been extremely mild. And this double-digit -- mid double-digit million euro negative impact from weather for the second warmest quarter during the last 50 years. That is a quite good performance. But it's too early now to say at this stage what that means for the remainder of the year. So for our guidance, take that we are managing towards the midpoint as usually. And at this stage, there's nothing that I would flag where we are particularly aggressive or conservative in the way how we have set our guidance. And apart from that, you always know that we deliver what we promise. So -- but the midpoint is what it is at this stage. On U.K. retail, there's not a lot that I would share now in this call except for that what we see is that the U.K. regulator has been much more constructive during the last years reacting to the industry's needs. Think we have also seen this -- of generally seen in Europe, the recognition also of retailers of being a system critical part of the energy value chain. And lastly, what I do see that E.ON specifically is being regarded by politicians and regulators as a company that stands in for the interest of customers and is driving the market to the benefit of the customers. And this gives us also where there are conversations, I think weighted the relevance in being heard in these discussions. And apart from that, it remains what I've said in the past that the U.K. regulation is very little wiggle room now to become worse because if you look at the results, which many of the operators in the U.K. are still achieving, it's not a marketplace where you could now easily just step in as a regulator and believe that U.K. worsening conditions, I think this is still a game about improving conditions to make these operations economically viable.

Iris Eveleigh: With that, next question comes from Rob Pulleyn from Morgan Stanley.

Rob Pulleyn: I have one question, which is quite high level, Marc. And that is, how does E.ON see power demand over time, given, of course, in 2023 it remains significantly lower than we saw precrisis in 2021. Is this structural loss due to industry. What about electrification trends you've spoken about? And also more recently, the data center demand, which we covered on the full year conference call. So I'd love to know what you think is a good suggestion for the medium-term power demand run rate we should be thinking for E.ON from here across the decade.

Marc Spieker: Yes, Rob, it's a very relevant long-term question, but happy to address that. So fundamentally, we are positive about the growth outlook of electricity volumes in our markets. So we expect electricity long term to be on a growth trend. Now when we talk about growth trends in energy, in developed markets, it's never high growth rates, but what we are seeing and expecting is a growth of 1%, 2% annually over time. And with that, of course, electricity will be the key carrier to replace then a number of primary fuels, specifically, you look at transportation, mineral oil , and if you look at heating mineral oil and gas. So growth outlook for electricity long term. And I think that is also important if you allow me that comment. If you look at the impact on affordability of the energy transition and then you should always keep in mind that all of these investments will be spread over time about much more volumes that will be wheeled in the system and increasingly bidirectional. So increasingly, our customers will also provide their power to the system. And so from that end, we are also confident that this will play out in a decent way.

Iris Eveleigh: Next question comes from Piotr from Citi.

Piotr Dzieciolowski: I have 2 questions, really. So firstly, I wanted to ask about the B2B business. Is this just the U.K. situation? Or this is also visible -- I know you don't have exposure, but this is also visible in the German and Benelux market? And why you saw [indiscernible] exclude the option to participate if there are some opportunities. You see the tender where the margin would be extremely high, why wouldn't you participate if the situation is similar in the continent? And second question I wanted to ask about your retail customer. Where are we in the process of passing through the lower falling commodity cost to the end customer deals. So if I were a customer in Germany, what kind of a reduction can I expect for '25, '26 onwards. And that's the question.

Marc Spieker: Yes. Let me start with the second one, Piotr. So as you know, we are not giving a mid-long-term guidance on price development as we are a business that passes on the fundamental costs onto our customers. What we do see is that what is relevant for our customers, it's the commodity piece and it's the network charges. What we've seen for this year is from this essentially a stable price outlook. We have always different customer segments that will be then adjusted. We also have market-by-market different hedging windows, so the impact of that can be from a timing point of view, a bit different. But essentially, for example, look at Germany, we have seen very little price adjustments this year. And this is on the back of lower commodity prices and somewhat increasing network tariffs. So all in all at this stage, limited impact. And then we need to see how commodity prices will develop over time but no further guidance as usual on how we see our end customer tariffs then moving. On the B2B business, we had actually been outspoken on that for the last 3, 4 years that we do not regard large industrial and commercial business as a strategically relevant segment for us. And to your question, therefore, in all other markets, we have moved out of that segment. So we are not running I&C retail businesses in any of the other markets. And the U.K. is the only one, and that is due to the specific situation of the Innogy integration and the Npower piece, which we had there, where we first focused on then kind of moving the E.ON and the Innogy business together on one platform. It is actually from a branding point of view still running on the Npower brand in the U.K. And this is why this is our only material B2B position and hence, no real read across to any other of our markets, at least what would be relevant for us.

Iris Eveleigh: Thank you very much, Marc. And with that, there are no further questions in the round. So I'll take this as a positive that we are delivering what we promised, and we are well on track. If there's anything that comes up after the call, the IR team is always is there to also answer any further questions that may be. With that, yes, I will close today's call.",za.investing.com,news,Investing.com South Africa,Read Earnings Call,0.223529411764706,453513453,13,https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/akapi-images/800x450/1af84873d4affc3cf00a793fcdf317a7_w_800_h_450.jpg,eng-9569582

Marc Spieker is set to move from his role as CFO to Chief Operating Officer, Commercial, with Nadia Jakobi succeeding him as CFO in June.

The company reported a slight increase in EBITDA and net income, attributing the growth to strong operational execution. Planned capital expenditures have increased by 25% from the previous year, in line with the company's investment strategy. E.ON also revealed the reorganization of its Energy Infrastructure Solutions business into a stand-alone segment.

E.ON SE (EOAN) has been making strategic moves, as reflected in their recent financial results call, and the InvestingPro data and tips provide additional context to the company's financial health and market position. According to InvestingPro, E.ON's Market Cap stands at a robust 37.64B USD, indicating the company's significant size and influence in the energy sector. Despite the company's strong market presence, the P/E Ratio is relatively high at 66.96, which may suggest that the stock is trading at a premium compared to its earnings.

InvestingPro Tips highlight that E.ON has raised its dividend for 7 consecutive years and has maintained dividend payments for 33 consecutive years, underscoring the company's commitment to returning value to shareholders -- a positive sign for investors looking for stable income. This is particularly noteworthy as the company transitions leadership roles and continues to invest heavily in capital expenditures.

The company's status as a prominent player in the Multi-Utilities industry is reinforced by its consistent performance and strategic positioning. However, an InvestingPro Tip points out that E.ON may have trouble making interest payments on debt, which is an important consideration for investors, especially when evaluating the company's increased capital expenditures and the potential impact on its financial leverage.

Iris Eveleigh: Hello, everyone. Dear analysts and investors, welcome to our First Quarter 2024 Financial Results Call. Thank you for taking the time to join us today. I'm here with Marc Spieker, for whom this will be the last earnings call as CFO before he takes over his new role as Chief Operating Officer, Commercial. Marc, thank you very much for our successful earnings calls together. At the same time, I'm excited to have Nadia taking over as CFO in June, and I'm looking forward to having her join the earnings calls from our H1 results onwards. As for today's call, as usual, we will leave enough room for your questions after the presentation. With that, over to you, Marc.

Marc Spieker: Thank you, Iris, and a warm welcome from my side as well. I will save my goodbye words for later. Let us straight dive into the Q1 results, and let me start with highlighting the key messages for today. First message, Q1 came out in line with our expectations for all businesses. Key drivers of our slight EBITDA and net income increase, we're investing back earnings growth and strong operational execution more than offsetting the unwind of prior year one-off and timing effects. Second message. Our planned CapEx ramp-up is progressing well. We have accelerated again our spending by almost 25% year-over-year and are well on track in terms of quarterly fill rates across all business segments. Third message, our Q1 economic net debt came in as expected, showing the typical Q1 cash flow seasonality and the final outflows related to the unwinding of the positive one-off working capital effects that we have been reporting to you as of our 2022 results, and I'll come back to that later. Fourth and final message, we have a strong conviction in the relevant and long-term growth path of our Energy Infrastructure Solutions business. To make our ambitions more visible, we are moving the business into a stand-alone segment from this quarter onwards as announced. Finally, our guidance is fully confirmed. On to our Q1 EBITDA development. Our adjusted EBITDA came in at EUR 2.7 billion, up 1% year-over-year despite the lack of significant positive impacts from one-offs that we had seen in the prior year quarter. As expected, our Energy Networks business is slightly down in Q1 due to unwinding positive regulatory account effects of 2023, such as the benefit from lower redispatch costs, as well as slightly higher-than-expected costs from upstream networks in Germany. Additionally, we have changed the accounting for our Slovakian VSE business, to an equity consolidation, which leads to a technical reduction in EBITDA in our Central Eastern Europe business, no impact on net income. All those effects are economically neutral and they were largely offset by strong RAB driven earnings growth across all regions and the positive uplift of regulatory parameters in Sweden. Regarding network losses, Sweden and Slovakia have now completed their recoveries, while additional recoveries are now only happening in Southern Eastern Europe. You may have noted that we have now split our reporting of the CEE and Turkey segment into Central Eastern Europe and Southeastern Europe. This shall give you more transparency on our geographically well-diversified portfolio of networks businesses. The Central Eastern Europe segment covers Czech Republic, Poland and Slovakia. The Southeastern Europe segment includes our activities in Hungary, Romania and Turkey. Moving on to Energy Infrastructure Solutions. New project commissioning is leading to EBITDA growth, as you would expect, supporting our 13% EBITDA accumulated average growth rate target from 2023 to 2028. This development is masked in Q1 by the absence of a positive one-off effect from last year and by changed intra-year maintenance schedule with a stronger focus on Q1 this year. With a change in maintenance schedule, we are partly mitigating also the negative effects from mild weather that we have been observing during the first quarter. In Energy Retail, the significant year-over-year EBITDA increase was primarily driven by positive price adjustments since Q1 last year. Additionally, we benefited from the improvement in our B2B segment in the U.K., which is successfully continuing its margin over volume strategy. Those positive effects were partially offset by the lack of procurement optimization benefits that we had seen in Q1 last year and it's a very favorable commodity price background last year and lower weather-driven volumes in Q1. Corporate Functions and Other segments saw an expected slight EBITDA decline driven by the lower results from our Turkish generation business due to the development of commodity prices also in Turkey. Moving on to our adjusted net income, which showed an increase of 2% which broadly follows the year-over-year EBITDA development. All earnings elements below EBITDA have developed in line with our expectations. The share of minority income sits at around 19% for the first quarter, as expected. And with that, materially below prior year. We expect this share to continue to go down and be lower for the full year as we communicated in our full year 2023 earnings release. Looking at the development of our economic net debt, I would like to highlight 3 points. First, our promised CapEx ramp-up is being executed like clockwork. We increased our Q1 investment spending by close to 25% year-over-year. I can assure you that we continue to be fully focused on ensuring a frictionless ramp up, managing closely our operations and supply chains. So far, we do not see any critical bottleneck on the horizon. Second, we have seen the typical operating cash outflow in Q1, which is driven by our seasonal business patterns in both Energy Retail and Energy Networks, specifically Energy Networks in Germany. As expected, this outflow was slightly amplified by the final unwind of our 2022 one-off working capital benefits. It's a long time ago, not everyone may remember, but our 2022 full year cash conversion set at a very benign 151%, significantly above the 100% we normally target. And as communicated in March for 2024, we are foreseeing a conversion rate of around 90%. And with that, the final reversal of these positive working capital effects from 2022 after 2024, we expect cash conversion to then swing back to the guided 100%. Third message on END, our strong balance sheet position has recently been confirmed by 2 of our rating agencies. We have received a rating upgrade by Standard & Poor's and a full rating confirmation by Moody's (NYSE:MCO). As communicated before, in line with our commitment to a strong BBB BAA rating, we have additional balance sheet capacity to fund further investments needed for a successful European energy transition if regulatory conditions further improve. Considering the balance sheet, it is also worth highlighting that we have already issued EUR 3.3 billion of bonds in the first quarter. With that, we have already fully covered our funding needs for 2024 and partially already prefunded 2025. Moving on to Energy Infrastructure Solutions. As announced, we will report this business as a stand-alone segment from this quarter onwards. Strategically and with a view to future growth, this segment is all about exploiting the huge business opportunities from decarbonization and to a large extent, electrification of the heating sector. The segment comprises our activities in designing, building, owning, operating and optimizing sustainable energy infrastructure assets for cities and business customers. Our solutions are based on modular standard building blocks, which are configured and digitally connected to fit specific customer needs. Technologically, our offerings include firstly, renewable on and offsite generation assets like photovoltaic and wind. Secondly, gas or biomass-fired heat and power engines. Thirdly, heat pumps and geothermal solutions. Fourthly, waste heat recovery technologies. And finally, high- and low-temperature heating and cooling grids. From a business point of view, we distinguish 2 clusters within Energy Infrastructure Solutions. First cluster is district heating and cooling, which is about running low-carbon heating and cooling networks in urban areas. Second business area is our industrial and commercial solutions business, offering on-site energy infrastructure for industrial and commercial customers. We have decided to also include our U.K. smart metering business in this segment, while technologically, obviously different in nature, it is a quasi-regulated business and hence, of similar nature when it comes to financial visibility and resilience. Let me remind you of some more financial and business characteristics relevant for our Energy Infrastructure Solutions business. Geographically, we are present in 15 countries, the key ones being Germany, Sweden and the U.K. Our pan-European coverage and strong regional anchoring represent a unique advantage to address our customers' needs for locally optimized energy infrastructure. Our strategy to standardize our offerings in a modular way will allow us to scale our solutions. Therefore, out of the EUR 5 billion CapEx plan for the next 5 years, 80% will be dedicated to growth investments. Through long-term contracts with customers, commodity price volatility and inflation are effectively passed through, for instance, via price escalation clauses. We ensure that any new project is targeted to deliver an internal rate of return spread over WACC of between 120 to 350 basis points. Furthermore, our rigorous focus on operational excellence ensures high asset availability. This is supported by digitalization, which helps to steer, monitor and effectively maintain and optimize the fleet of more than 6,000 assets. We expect annual EBITDA growth of 13% on average. Keep in mind that the municipal heat transition across Europe is still at an early stage. So there is more -- much more to come, but too soon for us to quantify what the impact will be over time. Let me close today's presentation with Slide 8 what you essentially should take away from us today. First, extremely solid Q1 outturn supports our expected earnings delivery for 2024. Second, our investment ramp-up is progressing well, which fully underpins the delivery of our midterm organic growth targets. Third, our balance sheet remains very healthy. We will continue to focus on delivering an attractive total shareholder return based on value creative organic growth and an annually growing dividend per share. And with that, let me move to a personal note. We announced in March that I would be moving on to take over as a Chief Operating Officer, the responsibility for our Energy Infrastructure and Retail Businesses from June onwards this year. We deliver what we promised. So inevitably, today is my last results call as CFO. It has been close to 8 years as CFO in the Board of Management of E.ON, hundreds of roadshows and exactly 30 results calls. I am not going away, but I will be focused on different things going forward. Great news for you is our investors and analysts that with Nadia Jakobi, I have the best successor I can think of. I know that with her, you, your interest and most importantly, your investments will continue to be in safe hands. Dear Iris, I would also like to express my thanks to the best Investor Relations team I can think of. And finally, it has been a privilege for me to represent our company in the capital markets. I'm extremely grateful for so many deep and thoughtful conversations during roadshows and other formats. And a big thank you to all of you for that. Before we get too sentimental, there is still business to be done. So let's move on to our Q&A session.

A - Iris Eveleigh: Thank you very much, Marc. And with that, we will start our Q&A session. Let me remind you all briefly, as you all do know, please stick to 2 questions each so that most of you have the chance to ask the questions. If there's anything we can't answer today, then the IR team is always there to also answer further questions from you. With that, the first question comes from Alberto from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).

Alberto Gandolfi: Good morning, and Marc, thanks for all the help and all the best. We -- I guess we need to lean on you even more on the execution of all these EUR 20 billion CapEx plan. So congratulations, and thank you once more. Two questions on my side. The first one is a border line very boring, but can I understand, please, in the first quarter, what type of nonrecurring items we have in networks and in customer solutions. I'm trying to go to the underlying earnings power. So as I understand, you released some provisions. The weather was very mild, can you tell us if you booked negative and positive network losses, either recovery or cost? That is the first question. I have the feeling the underlying is stronger. That's why I'm asking. The second question is I've seen a DSO plan that implies that potentially if feasible, which I understand from what you're saying is not, your CapEx plan could be 50% higher than what you presented in March. What underpins the plus 50%. Is it possible you give us a view on what assumptions we would have to flex to have even more investments. Is this driven by power demand, electrification, more renewables, data centers or just to have a fee for written.

Marc Spieker: Yes. So Alberto, let me start with the nonrecurring items. Compared to last year, we had a lot of positive one-offs. In Q1 this year is much less impacted by any one-off effect. If you look at our Energy Networks business, I think the remaining piece that we see here is a mid-double-digit million euro amount of final recovery for network losses essentially relating to 2022. So there's still a minor positive one-off in our Energy Networks business. For Energy Retail, essentially, we talk about weather impact, which you may now call kind of extraordinary one-off or not. It's basically a -- it's a metric risk, which will hit us every year kind of in a positive or negative way in Q1 due to the mild temperatures, actually record mild temperatures. That was the second warmest Q1, I think, during the last 50 years. Not that I recollect that, but what the statistics tell and that was a mid-double-digit million euro negative impact. So across both segments, then it's a wash net nil impact from one-off essentially. Your question to CapEx spend there is very valid. And with that, you're referring to a publication that we have also done about the initial allocation plan, which is kind of an exercise, which is regularly done by the DSO in close alignment with the German regulator, where basically, on a regular basis, we look at what are actually the political targets for renewables build or for development of the energy system. Germany specifically relevant Easter package, and then it's broken down in a technical way. So what are, if you implement those targets as they are written, what would technically have to be done in order then to allow for these targets to be executed. And in that sense, this 50% upside to which you referred to, is to be taken with special care. First of all, it just reconfirms what we have been telling our shareholders also with our full year results that when it comes to our network growth plans, there is room for more if economic conditions are right. And this is what we are working on in that sense, there is no change to our communication in our plans that we will continue to be working with the relevant authorities to make sure that economic incentives are the right ones to support this, which is one of the constraints by the way, which this initial allocation plan does not include, but which by legislation is actually given. Secondly, it is a technical plan, which does not take into account practical constraints. And we have seen these practical constraints, particularly playing a role when it comes to permitting, just to mention one, and it would be unrealistic in our view to now assume that they're technically possible in an unconstrained way can be delivered with all the constraints which we have in a practical way. And in that sense, what you should take away is there is a huge potential for E.ON to further invest and accelerate our investments over time. And as just similar to our results, we also have the financial means to do this if the conditions set by the regulators fit.

Alberto Gandolfi: This is very clear. So if you just allow me a comment. You've done essentially if it's clean for Q1, you've done 36% of the midpoint of your guidance in Q1. So it seems you're leaving an easy rest of the year to Nadia from here.

Marc Spieker: I take this as a statement, which I'm not commenting on. We move on.

Iris Eveleigh: Exactly. So we move on to the next question. Thank you, Alberto. Next question comes from Harry from Exane.

Harry Peter Wyburd: So 2 for me. First, can I dig in a little bit to what's going on in U.K. B2B supply. Why is it that you're earning so much, you made so much in such a short period of time? Do you think this is an industry-wide phenomenon for the whole of the U.K. supply market? Or is it just something that you're doing as E.ON? And can you just help us understand a bit what size of clients are driving this very good performance. Are we talking about much smaller B2B customers or medium-sized, just a bit of color there would be very helpful. And second one is a bit more strategic and a bit of a follow-on from Alberto's questions on the CapEx. Is there any update or view from you on what your partners are doing or what others are doing in the German DNO market in terms of funding. Because I guess, if we're talking about an already upgraded CapEx plan potentially seeing even much more significant, more upside? And how are your partners going to fund this? And might we get into a situation where you're effectively incentivized to put your investment into your fully-owned DNO subsidiaries and not the ones where you've got partners because, of course, if your partners aren't putting capital in, it's harder for you to make a good return on your investment.

Marc Spieker: Just on the second one, when you are referring to partner, could you just specify what partners exactly are you referring to? Are you referring to our co-investors on some of the DSO or are you referring to the [indiscernible]? Okay. Good. So let me start with the second question. We see across the board an extremely strong alignment between our interest and the interest of our core investors on a DSO level, which are larger municipalities for a number of our German DSOs and there is a very strong focus on all of our sites to make the energy transition work. And if -- also from a funding point of view to make whatever is there needed and possible also then on the level of the DSO side. And generally, we do not see a particularly constraint on that side or a clash of interest nonesoever. On the I&C business in the U.K., it follows our strategy where we had said that in most markets, we want to exit large B2B customers. So to your question, what are the customers? It's large I&C clients. This is not small, medium enterprises. This is around large industrial and commercial customers. And the U.K. is the only market where we continue to run such a segment at scale. But this is why also strategically, we are very clear on that business, we'll have to be steered on margins and not on volume. So what we have been seeing this business doing is running on a smaller and smaller book and focusing more and more on those customers where we are able then to make a risk-adjusted fair margin if I look at the risk transformation that we're doing for these clients. I don't want to refer and can't refer now to whether that's an industry-wide phenomenon or not. What I can tell you that this is not a one-hit wonder, which has happened now in Q1. It is a development that we have been working for throughout the last 4 years with the continuous effort on managing our customer portfolio in that business.

Iris Eveleigh: Next question comes from Deepa from Bernstein.

Deepa Venkateswaran: And Marc, look forward to meeting you in person for your farewell events. So my 2 questions are actually centered around your German networks. So firstly, if I'm not mistaken, you were still awaiting for some more details on the current regulatory period. I was just wondering if you can update if there's been any change on the efficiency factors or anything. And the second one was looking forward to the next regulatory period, there's obviously a consultation out from the regulator to move to back and reduce the regulatory period. And then there's also the live court case that you have for the current period. So just wondering how you think the negotiations will evolve? And should we assume that if you're successful in the court case, the regulator -- I mean is there quid pro quo between getting a better deal post '29 and leaving some money on the table for existing assets now? Or how would you think of this discussion.

Marc Spieker: So where do we have news and where do we essentially looking at the same time line with no -- is expected no further update. So first of all, what we have seen since the full year results is the publication of the efficiency benchmark. And the good news is that E.ON continues to be very efficient, i.e., 100% efficient operator. And I think that underpins our strategic relevance and the efforts that we are doing and continuously focusing on operational excellence also in our Energy Networks business. There hasn't been a further update on then the general efficiency factor. So -- and that stands on the efficiency front. We have now a public confirmation about what we have been working towards any or as an ambition to be fully efficient and we now need to see how the regulator deals with the general efficiency factor. Still, this has not been published yet. On the consultation, then for the regulatory period starting 2028 for I guess '29 for power, no update essentially, Deepa that is worth relevant sharing here. I think what we continue to look at, first and foremost, is the proposal by the regulator. How to deal with depreciation schedules for existing gas networks. So this was one of the ideas expressed as part of the consultation paper where the regulator also pronounced that they were seeking there a fast solution. So kind of in the pipeline to expect is then a clarification by the regulator on how they intend to deal with existing gas networks, which is obviously also relevant for the energy transition in total. And for a lot of the market players, as you know for us gas networks has a very small share in our RAB but this is from a regulatory point of view, what we would expect to be the upcoming release. I think that's on the regulatory side.

Deepa Venkateswaran: Just the court case could you comment.

Marc Spieker: Court case, also no update. So we haven't seen any -- there hasn't been any specific intervention with the court, no hearing, et cetera. So nothing to update on that side.

Iris Eveleigh: With that, we move on to the questions from Wanda from UBS.

Unidentified Analyst: Marc, all the best, again. Two questions for me. The first one is on your 2024 guidance. I mean, Energy Retail, you had a very strong start into the year. Q1 EBITDA accounts for 50% of the full year guidance. So do you expect any reversal later this year? Or is there any buffer included in the guidance, something similar to what you did at the end of last year. And if there is any buffer, would you be able to quantify it? And the second question is on the UK Retail. In March [indiscernible] launched a discussion paper for the future of price protection, the [indiscernible] collection is upcoming. How do you see the market structure changing as the current one, the price cut doesn't really work.

Marc Spieker: So 2024 guidance, Wanda. I think what I would stress is that we are back basically in normal operations. So while the last 2 years have been very much affected by energy crisis and kind of the relief from the energy crisis. We are now more or less back in normal mode. And I think where we can take confidence from is how well we have managed the first quarter, which has been extremely mild. And this double-digit -- mid double-digit million euro negative impact from weather for the second warmest quarter during the last 50 years. That is a quite good performance. But it's too early now to say at this stage what that means for the remainder of the year. So for our guidance, take that we are managing towards the midpoint as usually. And at this stage, there's nothing that I would flag where we are particularly aggressive or conservative in the way how we have set our guidance. And apart from that, you always know that we deliver what we promise. So -- but the midpoint is what it is at this stage. On U.K. retail, there's not a lot that I would share now in this call except for that what we see is that the U.K. regulator has been much more constructive during the last years reacting to the industry's needs. Think we have also seen this -- of generally seen in Europe, the recognition also of retailers of being a system critical part of the energy value chain. And lastly, what I do see that E.ON specifically is being regarded by politicians and regulators as a company that stands in for the interest of customers and is driving the market to the benefit of the customers. And this gives us also where there are conversations, I think weighted the relevance in being heard in these discussions. And apart from that, it remains what I've said in the past that the U.K. regulation is very little wiggle room now to become worse because if you look at the results, which many of the operators in the U.K. are still achieving, it's not a marketplace where you could now easily just step in as a regulator and believe that U.K. worsening conditions, I think this is still a game about improving conditions to make these operations economically viable.

Iris Eveleigh: With that, next question comes from Rob Pulleyn from Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS).

Rob Pulleyn: I have one question, which is quite high level, Marc. And that is, how does E.ON see power demand over time, given, of course, in 2023 it remains significantly lower than we saw precrisis in 2021. Is this structural loss due to industry. What about electrification trends you've spoken about? And also more recently, the data center demand, which we covered on the full year conference call. So I'd love to know what you think is a good suggestion for the medium-term power demand run rate we should be thinking for E.ON from here across the decade.

Marc Spieker: Yes, Rob, it's a very relevant long-term question, but happy to address that. So fundamentally, we are positive about the growth outlook of electricity volumes in our markets. So we expect electricity long term to be on a growth trend. Now when we talk about growth trends in energy, in developed markets, it's never high growth rates, but what we are seeing and expecting is a growth of 1%, 2% annually over time. And with that, of course, electricity will be the key carrier to replace then a number of primary fuels, specifically, you look at transportation, mineral oil, and if you look at heating mineral oil and gas. So growth outlook for electricity long term. And I think that is also important if you allow me that comment. If you look at the impact on affordability of the energy transition and then you should always keep in mind that all of these investments will be spread over time about much more volumes that will be wheeled in the system and increasingly bidirectional. So increasingly, our customers will also provide their power to the system. And so from that end, we are also confident that this will play out in a decent way.

Iris Eveleigh: Next question comes from Piotr from Citi.

Piotr Dzieciolowski: I have 2 questions, really. So firstly, I wanted to ask about the B2B business. Is this just the U.K. situation? Or this is also visible -- I know you don't have exposure, but this is also visible in the German and Benelux market? And why you saw [indiscernible] exclude the option to participate if there are some opportunities. You see the tender where the margin would be extremely high, why wouldn't you participate if the situation is similar in the continent? And second question I wanted to ask about your retail customer. Where are we in the process of passing through the lower falling commodity cost to the end customer deals. So if I were a customer in Germany, what kind of a reduction can I expect for '25, '26 onwards. And that's the question.

Marc Spieker: Yes. Let me start with the second one, Piotr. So as you know, we are not giving a mid-long-term guidance on price development as we are a business that passes on the fundamental costs onto our customers. What we do see is that what is relevant for our customers, it's the commodity piece and it's the network charges. What we've seen for this year is from this essentially a stable price outlook. We have always different customer segments that will be then adjusted. We also have market-by-market different hedging windows, so the impact of that can be from a timing point of view, a bit different. But essentially, for example, look at Germany, we have seen very little price adjustments this year. And this is on the back of lower commodity prices and somewhat increasing network tariffs. So all in all at this stage, limited impact. And then we need to see how commodity prices will develop over time but no further guidance as usual on how we see our end customer tariffs then moving. On the B2B business, we had actually been outspoken on that for the last 3, 4 years that we do not regard large industrial and commercial business as a strategically relevant segment for us. And to your question, therefore, in all other markets, we have moved out of that segment. So we are not running I&C retail businesses in any of the other markets. And the U.K. is the only one, and that is due to the specific situation of the Innogy integration and the Npower piece, which we had there, where we first focused on then kind of moving the E.ON and the Innogy business together on one platform. It is actually from a branding point of view still running on the Npower brand in the U.K. And this is why this is our only material B2B position and hence, no real read across to any other of our markets, at least what would be relevant for us.

Iris Eveleigh: Thank you very much, Marc. And with that, there are no further questions in the round. So I'll take this as a positive that we are delivering what we promised, and we are well on track. If there's anything that comes up after the call, the IR team is always is there to also answer any further questions that may be. With that, yes, I will close today's call.",uk.investing.com,news,Investing.com UK,,0.4823529411764707,453513417,13,https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/LYNXMPEBBR0PM_L.jpg,

Marc Spieker is set to move from his role as CFO to Chief Operating Officer, Commercial, with Nadia Jakobi succeeding him as CFO in June.

The company reported a slight increase in EBITDA and net income, attributing the growth to strong operational execution. Planned capital expenditures have increased by 25% from the previous year, in line with the company's investment strategy. E.ON also revealed the reorganization of its Energy Infrastructure Solutions business into a stand-alone segment.

E.ON SE (EOAN) has been making strategic moves, as reflected in their recent financial results call, and the InvestingPro data and tips provide additional context to the company's financial health and market position. According to InvestingPro, E.ON's Market Cap stands at a robust 37.64B USD, indicating the company's significant size and influence in the energy sector. Despite the company's strong market presence, the P/E Ratio is relatively high at 66.96, which may suggest that the stock is trading at a premium compared to its earnings.

InvestingPro Tips highlight that E.ON has raised its dividend for 7 consecutive years and has maintained dividend payments for 33 consecutive years, underscoring the company's commitment to returning value to shareholders -- a positive sign for investors looking for stable income. This is particularly noteworthy as the company transitions leadership roles and continues to invest heavily in capital expenditures.

The company's status as a prominent player in the Multi-Utilities industry is reinforced by its consistent performance and strategic positioning. However, an InvestingPro Tip points out that E.ON may have trouble making interest payments on debt, which is an important consideration for investors, especially when evaluating the company's increased capital expenditures and the potential impact on its financial leverage.

Iris Eveleigh: Hello, everyone. Dear analysts and investors, welcome to our First Quarter 2024 Financial Results Call. Thank you for taking the time to join us today. I'm here with Marc Spieker, for whom this will be the last earnings call as CFO before he takes over his new role as Chief Operating Officer, Commercial. Marc, thank you very much for our successful earnings calls together. At the same time, I'm excited to have Nadia taking over as CFO in June, and I'm looking forward to having her join the earnings calls from our H1 results onwards. As for today's call, as usual, we will leave enough room for your questions after the presentation. With that, over to you, Marc.

Marc Spieker: Thank you, Iris, and a warm welcome from my side as well. I will save my goodbye words for later. Let us straight dive into the Q1 results, and let me start with highlighting the key messages for today. First message, Q1 came out in line with our expectations for all businesses. Key drivers of our slight EBITDA and net income increase, we're investing back earnings growth and strong operational execution more than offsetting the unwind of prior year one-off and timing effects. Second message. Our planned CapEx ramp-up is progressing well. We have accelerated again our spending by almost 25% year-over-year and are well on track in terms of quarterly fill rates across all business segments. Third message, our Q1 economic net debt came in as expected, showing the typical Q1 cash flow seasonality and the final outflows related to the unwinding of the positive one-off working capital effects that we have been reporting to you as of our 2022 results, and I'll come back to that later. Fourth and final message, we have a strong conviction in the relevant and long-term growth path of our Energy Infrastructure Solutions business. To make our ambitions more visible, we are moving the business into a stand-alone segment from this quarter onwards as announced. Finally, our guidance is fully confirmed. On to our Q1 EBITDA development. Our adjusted EBITDA came in at EUR 2.7 billion, up 1% year-over-year despite the lack of significant positive impacts from one-offs that we had seen in the prior year quarter. As expected, our Energy Networks business is slightly down in Q1 due to unwinding positive regulatory account effects of 2023, such as the benefit from lower redispatch costs, as well as slightly higher-than-expected costs from upstream networks in Germany. Additionally, we have changed the accounting for our Slovakian VSE business, to an equity consolidation, which leads to a technical reduction in EBITDA in our Central Eastern Europe business, no impact on net income. All those effects are economically neutral and they were largely offset by strong RAB driven earnings growth across all regions and the positive uplift of regulatory parameters in Sweden. Regarding network losses, Sweden and Slovakia have now completed their recoveries, while additional recoveries are now only happening in Southern Eastern Europe. You may have noted that we have now split our reporting of the CEE and Turkey segment into Central Eastern Europe and Southeastern Europe. This shall give you more transparency on our geographically well-diversified portfolio of networks businesses. The Central Eastern Europe segment covers Czech Republic, Poland and Slovakia. The Southeastern Europe segment includes our activities in Hungary, Romania and Turkey. Moving on to Energy Infrastructure Solutions. New project commissioning is leading to EBITDA growth, as you would expect, supporting our 13% EBITDA accumulated average growth rate target from 2023 to 2028. This development is masked in Q1 by the absence of a positive one-off effect from last year and by changed intra-year maintenance schedule with a stronger focus on Q1 this year. With a change in maintenance schedule, we are partly mitigating also the negative effects from mild weather that we have been observing during the first quarter. In Energy Retail, the significant year-over-year EBITDA increase was primarily driven by positive price adjustments since Q1 last year. Additionally, we benefited from the improvement in our B2B segment in the U.K., which is successfully continuing its margin over volume strategy. Those positive effects were partially offset by the lack of procurement optimization benefits that we had seen in Q1 last year and it's a very favorable commodity price background last year and lower weather-driven volumes in Q1. Corporate Functions and Other segments saw an expected slight EBITDA decline driven by the lower results from our Turkish generation business due to the development of commodity prices also in Turkey. Moving on to our adjusted net income, which showed an increase of 2% which broadly follows the year-over-year EBITDA development. All earnings elements below EBITDA have developed in line with our expectations. The share of minority income sits at around 19% for the first quarter, as expected. And with that, materially below prior year. We expect this share to continue to go down and be lower for the full year as we communicated in our full year 2023 earnings release. Looking at the development of our economic net debt, I would like to highlight 3 points. First, our promised CapEx ramp-up is being executed like clockwork. We increased our Q1 investment spending by close to 25% year-over-year. I can assure you that we continue to be fully focused on ensuring a frictionless ramp up, managing closely our operations and supply chains. So far, we do not see any critical bottleneck on the horizon. Second, we have seen the typical operating cash outflow in Q1, which is driven by our seasonal business patterns in both Energy Retail and Energy Networks, specifically Energy Networks in Germany. As expected, this outflow was slightly amplified by the final unwind of our 2022 one-off working capital benefits. It's a long time ago, not everyone may remember, but our 2022 full year cash conversion set at a very benign 151%, significantly above the 100% we normally target. And as communicated in March for 2024, we are foreseeing a conversion rate of around 90%. And with that, the final reversal of these positive working capital effects from 2022 after 2024, we expect cash conversion to then swing back to the guided 100%. Third message on END, our strong balance sheet position has recently been confirmed by 2 of our rating agencies. We have received a rating upgrade by Standard & Poor's and a full rating confirmation by Moody's (NYSE:MCO). As communicated before, in line with our commitment to a strong BBB BAA rating, we have additional balance sheet capacity to fund further investments needed for a successful European energy transition if regulatory conditions further improve. Considering the balance sheet, it is also worth highlighting that we have already issued EUR 3.3 billion of bonds in the first quarter. With that, we have already fully covered our funding needs for 2024 and partially already prefunded 2025. Moving on to Energy Infrastructure Solutions. As announced, we will report this business as a stand-alone segment from this quarter onwards. Strategically and with a view to future growth, this segment is all about exploiting the huge business opportunities from decarbonization and to a large extent, electrification of the heating sector. The segment comprises our activities in designing, building, owning, operating and optimizing sustainable energy infrastructure assets for cities and business customers. Our solutions are based on modular standard building blocks, which are configured and digitally connected to fit specific customer needs. Technologically, our offerings include firstly, renewable on and offsite generation assets like photovoltaic and wind. Secondly, gas or biomass-fired heat and power engines. Thirdly, heat pumps and geothermal solutions. Fourthly, waste heat recovery technologies. And finally, high- and low-temperature heating and cooling grids. From a business point of view, we distinguish 2 clusters within Energy Infrastructure Solutions. First cluster is district heating and cooling, which is about running low-carbon heating and cooling networks in urban areas. Second business area is our industrial and commercial solutions business, offering on-site energy infrastructure for industrial and commercial customers. We have decided to also include our U.K. smart metering business in this segment, while technologically, obviously different in nature, it is a quasi-regulated business and hence, of similar nature when it comes to financial visibility and resilience. Let me remind you of some more financial and business characteristics relevant for our Energy Infrastructure Solutions business. Geographically, we are present in 15 countries, the key ones being Germany, Sweden and the U.K. Our pan-European coverage and strong regional anchoring represent a unique advantage to address our customers' needs for locally optimized energy infrastructure. Our strategy to standardize our offerings in a modular way will allow us to scale our solutions. Therefore, out of the EUR 5 billion CapEx plan for the next 5 years, 80% will be dedicated to growth investments. Through long-term contracts with customers, commodity price volatility and inflation are effectively passed through, for instance, via price escalation clauses. We ensure that any new project is targeted to deliver an internal rate of return spread over WACC of between 120 to 350 basis points. Furthermore, our rigorous focus on operational excellence ensures high asset availability. This is supported by digitalization, which helps to steer, monitor and effectively maintain and optimize the fleet of more than 6,000 assets. We expect annual EBITDA growth of 13% on average. Keep in mind that the municipal heat transition across Europe is still at an early stage. So there is more -- much more to come, but too soon for us to quantify what the impact will be over time. Let me close today's presentation with Slide 8 what you essentially should take away from us today. First, extremely solid Q1 outturn supports our expected earnings delivery for 2024. Second, our investment ramp-up is progressing well, which fully underpins the delivery of our midterm organic growth targets. Third, our balance sheet remains very healthy. We will continue to focus on delivering an attractive total shareholder return based on value creative organic growth and an annually growing dividend per share. And with that, let me move to a personal note. We announced in March that I would be moving on to take over as a Chief Operating Officer, the responsibility for our Energy Infrastructure and Retail Businesses from June onwards this year. We deliver what we promised. So inevitably, today is my last results call as CFO. It has been close to 8 years as CFO in the Board of Management of E.ON, hundreds of roadshows and exactly 30 results calls. I am not going away, but I will be focused on different things going forward. Great news for you is our investors and analysts that with Nadia Jakobi, I have the best successor I can think of. I know that with her, you, your interest and most importantly, your investments will continue to be in safe hands. Dear Iris, I would also like to express my thanks to the best Investor Relations team I can think of. And finally, it has been a privilege for me to represent our company in the capital markets. I'm extremely grateful for so many deep and thoughtful conversations during roadshows and other formats. And a big thank you to all of you for that. Before we get too sentimental, there is still business to be done. So let's move on to our Q&A session.

A - Iris Eveleigh: Thank you very much, Marc. And with that, we will start our Q&A session. Let me remind you all briefly, as you all do know, please stick to 2 questions each so that most of you have the chance to ask the questions. If there's anything we can't answer today, then the IR team is always there to also answer further questions from you. With that, the first question comes from Alberto from Goldman Sachs.

Alberto Gandolfi: Good morning, and Marc, thanks for all the help and all the best. We -- I guess we need to lean on you even more on the execution of all these EUR 20 billion CapEx plan. So congratulations, and thank you once more. Two questions on my side. The first one is a border line very boring, but can I understand, please, in the first quarter, what type of nonrecurring items we have in networks and in customer solutions. I'm trying to go to the underlying earnings power. So as I understand, you released some provisions. The weather was very mild, can you tell us if you booked negative and positive network losses, either recovery or cost? That is the first question. I have the feeling the underlying is stronger. That's why I'm asking. The second question is I've seen a DSO plan that implies that potentially if feasible, which I understand from what you're saying is not, your CapEx plan could be 50% higher than what you presented in March. What underpins the plus 50%. Is it possible you give us a view on what assumptions we would have to flex to have even more investments. Is this driven by power demand, electrification, more renewables, data centers or just to have a fee for written.

Marc Spieker: Yes. So Alberto, let me start with the nonrecurring items. Compared to last year, we had a lot of positive one-offs. In Q1 this year is much less impacted by any one-off effect. If you look at our Energy Networks business, I think the remaining piece that we see here is a mid-double-digit million euro amount of final recovery for network losses essentially relating to 2022. So there's still a minor positive one-off in our Energy Networks business. For Energy Retail, essentially, we talk about weather impact, which you may now call kind of extraordinary one-off or not. It's basically a -- it's a metric risk, which will hit us every year kind of in a positive or negative way in Q1 due to the mild temperatures, actually record mild temperatures. That was the second warmest Q1, I think, during the last 50 years. Not that I recollect that, but what the statistics tell and that was a mid-double-digit million euro negative impact. So across both segments, then it's a wash net nil impact from one-off essentially. Your question to CapEx spend there is very valid. And with that, you're referring to a publication that we have also done about the initial allocation plan, which is kind of an exercise, which is regularly done by the DSO in close alignment with the German regulator, where basically, on a regular basis, we look at what are actually the political targets for renewables build or for development of the energy system. Germany specifically relevant Easter package, and then it's broken down in a technical way. So what are, if you implement those targets as they are written, what would technically have to be done in order then to allow for these targets to be executed. And in that sense, this 50% upside to which you referred to, is to be taken with special care. First of all, it just reconfirms what we have been telling our shareholders also with our full year results that when it comes to our network growth plans, there is room for more if economic conditions are right. And this is what we are working on in that sense, there is no change to our communication in our plans that we will continue to be working with the relevant authorities to make sure that economic incentives are the right ones to support this, which is one of the constraints by the way, which this initial allocation plan does not include, but which by legislation is actually given. Secondly, it is a technical plan, which does not take into account practical constraints. And we have seen these practical constraints, particularly playing a role when it comes to permitting, just to mention one, and it would be unrealistic in our view to now assume that they're technically possible in an unconstrained way can be delivered with all the constraints which we have in a practical way. And in that sense, what you should take away is there is a huge potential for E.ON to further invest and accelerate our investments over time. And as just similar to our results, we also have the financial means to do this if the conditions set by the regulators fit.

Alberto Gandolfi: This is very clear. So if you just allow me a comment. You've done essentially if it's clean for Q1, you've done 36% of the midpoint of your guidance in Q1. So it seems you're leaving an easy rest of the year to Nadia from here.

Marc Spieker: I take this as a statement, which I'm not commenting on. We move on.

Iris Eveleigh: Exactly. So we move on to the next question. Thank you, Alberto. Next question comes from Harry from Exane.

Harry Peter Wyburd: So 2 for me. First, can I dig in a little bit to what's going on in U.K. B2B supply. Why is it that you're earning so much, you made so much in such a short period of time? Do you think this is an industry-wide phenomenon for the whole of the U.K. supply market? Or is it just something that you're doing as E.ON? And can you just help us understand a bit what size of clients are driving this very good performance. Are we talking about much smaller B2B customers or medium-sized, just a bit of color there would be very helpful. And second one is a bit more strategic and a bit of a follow-on from Alberto's questions on the CapEx. Is there any update or view from you on what your partners are doing or what others are doing in the German DNO market in terms of funding. Because I guess, if we're talking about an already upgraded CapEx plan potentially seeing even much more significant, more upside? And how are your partners going to fund this? And might we get into a situation where you're effectively incentivized to put your investment into your fully-owned DNO subsidiaries and not the ones where you've got partners because, of course, if your partners aren't putting capital in, it's harder for you to make a good return on your investment.

Marc Spieker: Just on the second one, when you are referring to partner, could you just specify what partners exactly are you referring to? Are you referring to our co-investors on some of the DSO or are you referring to the [indiscernible]? Okay. Good. So let me start with the second question. We see across the board an extremely strong alignment between our interest and the interest of our core investors on a DSO level, which are larger municipalities for a number of our German DSOs and there is a very strong focus on all of our sites to make the energy transition work. And if -- also from a funding point of view to make whatever is there needed and possible also then on the level of the DSO side. And generally, we do not see a particularly constraint on that side or a clash of interest nonesoever. On the I&C business in the U.K., it follows our strategy where we had said that in most markets, we want to exit large B2B customers. So to your question, what are the customers? It's large I&C clients. This is not small, medium enterprises. This is around large industrial and commercial customers. And the U.K. is the only market where we continue to run such a segment at scale. But this is why also strategically, we are very clear on that business, we'll have to be steered on margins and not on volume. So what we have been seeing this business doing is running on a smaller and smaller book and focusing more and more on those customers where we are able then to make a risk-adjusted fair margin if I look at the risk transformation that we're doing for these clients. I don't want to refer and can't refer now to whether that's an industry-wide phenomenon or not. What I can tell you that this is not a one-hit wonder, which has happened now in Q1. It is a development that we have been working for throughout the last 4 years with the continuous effort on managing our customer portfolio in that business.

Iris Eveleigh: Next question comes from Deepa from Bernstein.

Deepa Venkateswaran: And Marc, look forward to meeting you in person for your farewell events. So my 2 questions are actually centered around your German networks. So firstly, if I'm not mistaken, you were still awaiting for some more details on the current regulatory period. I was just wondering if you can update if there's been any change on the efficiency factors or anything. And the second one was looking forward to the next regulatory period, there's obviously a consultation out from the regulator to move to back and reduce the regulatory period. And then there's also the live court case that you have for the current period. So just wondering how you think the negotiations will evolve? And should we assume that if you're successful in the court case, the regulator -- I mean is there quid pro quo between getting a better deal post '29 and leaving some money on the table for existing assets now? Or how would you think of this discussion.

Marc Spieker: So where do we have news and where do we essentially looking at the same time line with no -- is expected no further update. So first of all, what we have seen since the full year results is the publication of the efficiency benchmark. And the good news is that E.ON continues to be very efficient, i.e., 100% efficient operator. And I think that underpins our strategic relevance and the efforts that we are doing and continuously focusing on operational excellence also in our Energy Networks business. There hasn't been a further update on then the general efficiency factor. So -- and that stands on the efficiency front. We have now a public confirmation about what we have been working towards any or as an ambition to be fully efficient and we now need to see how the regulator deals with the general efficiency factor. Still, this has not been published yet. On the consultation, then for the regulatory period starting 2028 for I guess '29 for power, no update essentially, Deepa that is worth relevant sharing here. I think what we continue to look at, first and foremost, is the proposal by the regulator. How to deal with depreciation schedules for existing gas networks. So this was one of the ideas expressed as part of the consultation paper where the regulator also pronounced that they were seeking there a fast solution. So kind of in the pipeline to expect is then a clarification by the regulator on how they intend to deal with existing gas networks, which is obviously also relevant for the energy transition in total. And for a lot of the market players, as you know for us gas networks has a very small share in our RAB but this is from a regulatory point of view, what we would expect to be the upcoming release. I think that's on the regulatory side.

Deepa Venkateswaran: Just the court case could you comment.

Marc Spieker: Court case, also no update. So we haven't seen any -- there hasn't been any specific intervention with the court, no hearing, et cetera. So nothing to update on that side.

Iris Eveleigh: With that, we move on to the questions from Wanda from UBS.

Unidentified Analyst: Marc, all the best, again. Two questions for me. The first one is on your 2024 guidance. I mean, Energy Retail, you had a very strong start into the year. Q1 EBITDA accounts for 50% of the full year guidance. So do you expect any reversal later this year? Or is there any buffer included in the guidance, something similar to what you did at the end of last year. And if there is any buffer, would you be able to quantify it? And the second question is on the UK Retail. In March [indiscernible] launched a discussion paper for the future of price protection, the [indiscernible] collection is upcoming. How do you see the market structure changing as the current one, the price cut doesn't really work.

Marc Spieker: So 2024 guidance, Wanda. I think what I would stress is that we are back basically in normal operations. So while the last 2 years have been very much affected by energy crisis and kind of the relief from the energy crisis. We are now more or less back in normal mode. And I think where we can take confidence from is how well we have managed the first quarter, which has been extremely mild. And this double-digit -- mid double-digit million euro negative impact from weather for the second warmest quarter during the last 50 years. That is a quite good performance. But it's too early now to say at this stage what that means for the remainder of the year. So for our guidance, take that we are managing towards the midpoint as usually. And at this stage, there's nothing that I would flag where we are particularly aggressive or conservative in the way how we have set our guidance. And apart from that, you always know that we deliver what we promise. So -- but the midpoint is what it is at this stage. On U.K. retail, there's not a lot that I would share now in this call except for that what we see is that the U.K. regulator has been much more constructive during the last years reacting to the industry's needs. Think we have also seen this -- of generally seen in Europe, the recognition also of retailers of being a system critical part of the energy value chain. And lastly, what I do see that E.ON specifically is being regarded by politicians and regulators as a company that stands in for the interest of customers and is driving the market to the benefit of the customers. And this gives us also where there are conversations, I think weighted the relevance in being heard in these discussions. And apart from that, it remains what I've said in the past that the U.K. regulation is very little wiggle room now to become worse because if you look at the results, which many of the operators in the U.K. are still achieving, it's not a marketplace where you could now easily just step in as a regulator and believe that U.K. worsening conditions, I think this is still a game about improving conditions to make these operations economically viable.

Iris Eveleigh: With that, next question comes from Rob Pulleyn from Morgan Stanley.

Rob Pulleyn: I have one question, which is quite high level, Marc. And that is, how does E.ON see power demand over time, given, of course, in 2023 it remains significantly lower than we saw precrisis in 2021. Is this structural loss due to industry. What about electrification trends you've spoken about? And also more recently, the data center demand, which we covered on the full year conference call. So I'd love to know what you think is a good suggestion for the medium-term power demand run rate we should be thinking for E.ON from here across the decade.

Marc Spieker: Yes, Rob, it's a very relevant long-term question, but happy to address that. So fundamentally, we are positive about the growth outlook of electricity volumes in our markets. So we expect electricity long term to be on a growth trend. Now when we talk about growth trends in energy, in developed markets, it's never high growth rates, but what we are seeing and expecting is a growth of 1%, 2% annually over time. And with that, of course, electricity will be the key carrier to replace then a number of primary fuels, specifically, you look at transportation, mineral oil, and if you look at heating mineral oil and gas. So growth outlook for electricity long term. And I think that is also important if you allow me that comment. If you look at the impact on affordability of the energy transition and then you should always keep in mind that all of these investments will be spread over time about much more volumes that will be wheeled in the system and increasingly bidirectional. So increasingly, our customers will also provide their power to the system. And so from that end, we are also confident that this will play out in a decent way.

Iris Eveleigh: Next question comes from Piotr from Citi.

Piotr Dzieciolowski: I have 2 questions, really. So firstly, I wanted to ask about the B2B business. Is this just the U.K. situation? Or this is also visible -- I know you don't have exposure, but this is also visible in the German and Benelux market? And why you saw [indiscernible] exclude the option to participate if there are some opportunities. You see the tender where the margin would be extremely high, why wouldn't you participate if the situation is similar in the continent? And second question I wanted to ask about your retail customer. Where are we in the process of passing through the lower falling commodity cost to the end customer deals. So if I were a customer in Germany, what kind of a reduction can I expect for '25, '26 onwards. And that's the question.

Marc Spieker: Yes. Let me start with the second one, Piotr. So as you know, we are not giving a mid-long-term guidance on price development as we are a business that passes on the fundamental costs onto our customers. What we do see is that what is relevant for our customers, it's the commodity piece and it's the network charges. What we've seen for this year is from this essentially a stable price outlook. We have always different customer segments that will be then adjusted. We also have market-by-market different hedging windows, so the impact of that can be from a timing point of view, a bit different. But essentially, for example, look at Germany, we have seen very little price adjustments this year. And this is on the back of lower commodity prices and somewhat increasing network tariffs. So all in all at this stage, limited impact. And then we need to see how commodity prices will develop over time but no further guidance as usual on how we see our end customer tariffs then moving. On the B2B business, we had actually been outspoken on that for the last 3, 4 years that we do not regard large industrial and commercial business as a strategically relevant segment for us. And to your question, therefore, in all other markets, we have moved out of that segment. So we are not running I&C retail businesses in any of the other markets. And the U.K. is the only one, and that is due to the specific situation of the Innogy integration and the Npower piece, which we had there, where we first focused on then kind of moving the E.ON and the Innogy business together on one platform. It is actually from a branding point of view still running on the Npower brand in the U.K. And this is why this is our only material B2B position and hence, no real read across to any other of our markets, at least what would be relevant for us.

Iris Eveleigh: Thank you very much, Marc. And with that, there are no further questions in the round. So I'll take this as a positive that we are delivering what we promised, and we are well on track. If there's anything that comes up after the call, the IR team is always is there to also answer any further questions that may be. With that, yes, I will close today's call.",investing.com,news,Investing.com,,0.4823529411764707,453513188,13,https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/LYNXMPEBBR0PM_L.jpg,eng-9569582

The following is a near-verbatim transcript of today's noon briefing by Farhan Haq, Deputy Spokesman for the Secretary-General.

In a short while, I will be joined here by the Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Sudan, Clementine Nkweta-Salami.

She will provide you with an update on the humanitarian situation in the country.

Tomorrow, at 12:30 p.m., there will be a briefing here by the Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) to launch the World Economic Situation and Prospects as of mid-2024.

The report will update the global and regional economic forecasts released in January and will be available at desapublications.un.org.

The briefers will be Shantanu Mukherjee, DESA's Director of Economic Analysis and Policy Division, along with Hamid Rashid, DESA's Chief of the Global Economic Monitoring Branch in the Economic Analysis and Policy Division.

**Slovakia

The Secretary-General strongly condemns the shocking attack carried out today against the Prime Minister of Slovakia, Robert Fico.

The Secretary-General's thoughts are with the Prime Minister and his loved ones at this difficult moment.

**Oman

The Secretary-General met in Muscat today with Sayyid Badr bin Hamad bin Hamood Albusaidi, Foreign Minister of the Sultanate of Oman.

The Secretary-General recognized Oman's leadership in promoting dialogue and multilateral cooperation in the region and beyond, including in Yemen. The Secretary-General and the Foreign Minister also discussed developments in Gaza, as well as ongoing developments in Yemen.

Later that morning, the Secretary-General met with His Majesty Sultan Haitham bin Tarik, Sultan of Oman. The Secretary-General thanked the Sultan for his active personal commitment to promoting dialogue and diplomacy throughout the region and beyond. Among other issues of mutual concern, the Secretary-General and the Sultan discussed efforts in Gaza to secure an immediate ceasefire, the release of hostages and delivery of humanitarian aid.

And yesterday in Oman, the Secretary-General visited the National Museum of Oman and the Youth Centre of Muscat, which works in partnership with UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) and World Intellectual Property Organization.

**Occupied Palestinian Territory

Turning to the situation in Gaza, our colleagues from the UN Relief and Works Agency -- UNRWA -- say that as of today, some 600,000 people -- a quarter of Gaza's population -- have been displaced from Rafah since 6 May, as the Israeli ground operation there continues.

The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) says ground incursions and heavy fighting also continue to be reported in Deir al Balah, in central Gaza, as well as in Jabaliya, in northern Gaza.

Many of the families now on the move once again have already been displaced repeatedly since October.

Regardless of whether they move or stay, civilians in Gaza must be protected. All parties must respect international humanitarian law at all times. This also means civilians' essential needs -- including food, shelter, water and health -- must be met, wherever they are.

Access to critical health services in Gaza continues to shrink as additional evacuation orders are issued and military operations intensify.

According to our partners working on the health response, the Indonesian Field Hospital in Rafah is out of service as of today. There are now eight functional field hospitals, including one just established by the International Committee of the Red Cross, in coordination with the Palestine Red Crescent Society, to help address the overwhelming scale of needs in Rafah.

And we have received questions about a video that seems to show armed militant activity at a compound belonging to the UN Relief and Works Agency, UNRWA.

UNRWA is unable to verify the authenticity or the content of this video and does not have any information on the timing or the exact location of the video.

The Agency says that it is likely that the video is from an UNRWA warehouse in Rafah that was evacuated the week of 6 May following the evacuation orders from the Israeli authorities. UNRWA staff were informed to depart the facility for their safety. Flour and UNRWA vehicles were left in the facility when it was abandoned.

UNRWA condemns the use of UN facilities by any party to the conflict for military purposes. It has repeatedly called for independent investigation and accountability for the blatant disregard of UN staff lives, premises and operations.

We reiterate our call on all parties to the conflict to respect the sanctity and neutrality of UN installations.

**Ukraine

Turning to Ukraine, the Humanitarian Coordinator there, Denise Brown, is visiting Kharkiv City and yesterday condemned the unrelenting attacks, both in the city and the region.

On 14 May alone, repeated strikes in Kharkiv City and across the region have injured civilians, including children, as well as damaging a school and numerous homes. This is according to the authorities and our humanitarian partners.

Since 10 May, humanitarian organizations have been assisting people who fled to Kharkiv City in search of safety as evacuations from border and front-line communities in the Kharkiv Region continue.

We, along with our partners, have supported hundreds of people with transportation, accommodation, distribution of hot meals and ready-to-eat food packages. We also pre-registered people for cash assistance and provided mental health and psychological consultations.

Ms. Brown has approved the release of $3.75 million from the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund to strengthen the ongoing response.

**Security Council

And yesterday afternoon, as you know, the Security Council held a meeting on the maintenance of peace and security of Ukraine.

Briefing Council members, Lisa Doughten, the Director of Financing and Partnerships Division of the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, noted that relentless hostilities continue in communities along the north-eastern border with the Russian Federation and on the front line.

She added that strikes have also been reported inside the Russian Federation, reportedly also resulting in several civilian casualties and damage to residential homes and other civilian infrastructure.

Ms. Doughten said the intensification in hostilities is making the delivery of humanitarian assistance more dangerous.

Nevertheless, she said, the UN and its humanitarian partners are doing everything we can to reach people in need of support, despite the enormous tasks.

**Central African Republic

Our peacekeeping colleagues in the Central African Republic are telling us that the Head of the UN Mission, MINUSCA, Valentine Rugwabiza, met yesterday with key local officials, prefectures and mayors in Bangui, following the national conference we mentioned on Monday -- on the seasonal migration of cattle and people.

She reiterated our commitment to support the implementation of the recommendations made at this conference.

Ms. Rugwabiza said that the heaviest consequences of conflicts and crime linked to this seasonal migration are borne by the civilian population, as well as revenue losses for the State.

**Nigeria

Turning to Nigeria, our team there, along with the Government and our partners, have launched a $306 million appeal to support 2.8 million people in the country's north-east.

The region -- comprising the states of Borno, Adamawa and Yobe -- is facing a food security and a nutrition crisis during this lean season, which runs from May to September.

The crisis is primarily due to continued conflict and insecurity combined with the impacts of climate change.

The prices of staple foods, such as beans and maize, have increased by 300 to 400 per cent over the past year.

According to the Government, some 4.8 million people in these three states are estimated to be facing food insecurity, the highest level in seven years.

The Humanitarian Coordinator in Nigeria, Mohamed Malick Fall, released $11 million from the Nigeria Humanitarian Fund to kick start the response, and he called for additional resources.

**Rwanda

The Secretary-General welcomes the announcement by the Office of the Prosecutor of the International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals that all fugitives indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) for crimes committed during the 1994 Genocide against the Tutsi in Rwanda have now been accounted for.

All fugitives indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia have been accounted for since 2011.

He commends the efforts of the International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals to complete this important part of its functions in pursuit of international justice.

**Burundi

In Burundi, our team there, led by Resident Coordinator Violet Kakyomya, is providing support to people impacted by recent floods and landslides.

These natural disasters have left over 300,000 people in need of humanitarian aid, with 36,000 displaced in the country.

Our team is assisting with health services including mobile clinics, access to sexual and reproductive health and gender-based violence services. It is also assessing the immediate needs of people living with HIV/AIDS. Additionally, educational materials and supplies are being distributed to restore damaged schools, while child protection services are being provided, along with water, sanitation and hygiene kits, emergency shelters and food assistance through cash-based transfers to support immediate needs.

**Haiti

Turning to Haiti, we have an update on the assistance provided by our colleagues in the country.

On Monday and Tuesday, the World Food Programme (WFP) distributed close to 10,000 hot meals to about 5,000 people displaced in the Port-au-Prince metropolitan area.

IOM (International Organization for Migration) also distributed water to two sites hosting displaced people and provided health services through a mobile clinic in one site in Port-au-Prince.

Following assessments in Gressier -- after the violent incidents there that we mentioned -- WFP, the World Food Programme, is planning to begin hot meal distributions in this community tomorrow.

In the capital, WFP started to transition from hot meals distributions to cash-based transfers for the displaced. So far, more than 37,000 people received cash. In the coming weeks, WFP is planning to provide cash assistance to over 95,000 displaced people.

In addition to this, WFP continued food distributions in CitÃ© Soleil.

Over 65,000 people have received food since last Friday, and the agency's goal is to reach 95,000 people by the end of this week.

As part of its school meal programmes, WFP has reached 195,000 school children throughout Haiti.

**Brazil

In Brazil, our team -- led by the Resident Coordinator, Silvia Rucks -- has deployed expertise in humanitarian settings to support the national and local government response to the floods, especially considering the needs of at-risk groups on the ground as heavy rains still batter the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul and temperatures fall as winter advances.

The UN team is also providing hygiene kits, mattresses, blankets, cooking supplies, water purifiers, emergency housing units, food and water to the affected population.

While the emergency response is under way, the UN team also stands ready to work with national authorities on planning for rebuilding.

**Darien Gap

And our colleagues at the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) today said there has been a significant increase in the number of children migrating through the Darien Gap.

UNICEF estimates that 160,000 children could cross the route this year, up 34 per cent from 113,000 in 2023.

UNICEF said that child migration through the jungle of the Darien Gap has become a protracted crisis, with many people who make the crossing likely to require critical humanitarian assistance.

Of the 30,000 children on the move so far this year, nearly 2,000 of them were unaccompanied or separated from their families. The number of unaccompanied and separated children tripled in comparison to the same period in 2023.

I would like to state for the record that, yesterday evening, the Secretary-General designated James Swan of the United States as his Acting Special Representative for Somalia and Head of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Somalia (UNSOM).

Mr. Swan will act as Special Representative for a temporary period following the departure of Catriona Laing of the United Kingdom, to whom the Secretary-General is grateful for her dedicated service in UNSOM and Somalia at a challenging time.

Mr. Swan is an experienced diplomat with a long career in African countries facing complex political transitions. Most recently, he served as Special Representative for Somalia and Head of UNSOM from 2019 to 2022.

Prior to that, he served in the United States Government as Ambassador to the Democratic Republic of the Congo from 2013 to 2016, Special Representative for Somalia from 2011 to 2013, and Ambassador to Djibouti from 2008 to 2011.

**Day of Families

And last, today is the International Day of Families.

This day highlights that families and family-oriented policies and programmes are vital for the achievement of many of the Sustainable Development Goals.

Any questions for me before we get to our guest? Yes, Edie?

**Questions and Answers

Question: Thank you, Farhan. Is there any update on the number of displacements from the north or anywhere else in Gaza?

Deputy Spokesman: Not officially. There's some rough figures of maybe something like in the neighbourhood of 100,000 people being displaced from the north, but you can't really hold me to that, because the situation is a fairly fluid one.

Question: And is there any update on the negotiations between the United Nations, the United States and others on UN participation in the distribution of aid coming from Cyprus via the US pier?

Deputy Spokesman: Yes. Once we've come to a conclusion of that, we'll certainly let you know, but the discussions are ongoing.

Amelie?

Question: Thanks, Farhan. I have a question about New Caledonia. The French Government declared a state of emergency after several days of riots that left at least four people dead. Any comment from the Secretary-General on the situation? Any worries?

Deputy Spokesman: Well, on the basic situation, you will have seen what we said in the past about New Caledonia and that stands. But obviously, we would want extreme care to be taken regarding demonstrations because, as you know, we want all peaceful protests to be allowed to continue safely.

Yes, Dezhi?

Question: Okay. A follow-up on the UNRWA alleged video with the Hamas fighters. You just said that UNRWA is not able to verify the authenticity or the content of video, and you don't have the timing and any more information. Well, Times of Israel reported that according to IDF (Israel Defence Forces), they were spotted on Saturday at UNRWA's logistics centre in East Rafah. You said most likely it's evacuation on 6 May. Which means there should not be any UN vehicles in that compound.

Deputy Spokesman: No. As I pointed out, the UNRWA personnel had to obey an evacuation order to leave that compound. When they did that, they left behind flour and some of the vehicles.

Question: So, it could be, there are no UN staff but only the vehicles with the fighters? I'm sorry.

Deputy Spokesman: That's a possibility. This would need to be investigated further. And certainly, UNRWA is open to receiving all relevant information about this. [cross talk]

Question: But hasn't UNRWA received any from IDF?

Deputy Spokesman: Well, not at this stage. I mean, they've seen the video, and from what they've seen, the video has many different cuts, which suggests to them, on first glance, that this is a montage of different clips, which may not be taken at the same time. They would need more information.

Question: Yeah. But according to the video, I'm now looking at the video. There are people with the blue jackets. It seems like UN staff there, right?

Deputy Spokesman: All I can tell you is, again, the site that it appears to be seems to be one that was evacuated the week of 6 May.

Question: Thank you, Farhan. Regarding the Indonesian Field Hospital that you said is now out of service, MSF or Doctors Without Borders, three days ago, said they could no longer work there. So, is there something new or is this like the official shutdown of it?

Deputy Spokesman: This is the official confirmation of that. I mean, we try to hold out as long as we can, given the needs on the ground. But at some point, it's simply impossible.

Question: Thank you. And regarding the DSS (Department of Safety and Security) staff member that was killed early Monday, are the Israeli authorities cooperating with the UN and the questions that you guys have with them?

Deputy Spokesman: Yeah. As far as I'm aware, yes, we're receiving cooperation in terms of our follow-up. Basically, there's a small team of security experts who are doing a review. And as far as I'm aware, they've received cooperation with their tasks.

Yes, Dulcie?

Question: Okay, thanks. I just want to go back over the numbers of dead in Gaza because there are still some confusing media reports. Including one saying that normally the UN relies on the Gaza Ministry of Health for its numbers, but also that recently it relied on the Government Media Office for its numbers. So, which is it? Because it's pretty confusing.

Deputy Spokesman: It's the Ministry of Health. The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs tries to get its information from the Ministry of Health. I believe there was a period when, for whatever reason, given the conditions on the ground, the Ministry of Health was unresponsive. And so, they got different figures from the media office, but that was a short period. It's back to, as it was, at the start of the war, the Ministry of Health, which is the party we've relied on in previous circumstances, as well.

Question: Okay. You also said last week, however, that the UN works with partners on the ground to cross-check these numbers. So, who would that be with?

Deputy Spokesman: Well, there are also other non-governmental organizations on the ground. And so, we try to make sure that the numbers are coordinated. The difficulty for us, particularly for us as the UN, is simply being able to verify a lot of this first-hand, given the nature of the fighting.

Question: So, if I could just ask then, some of the headlines are saying that there's been a reduction in the overall numbers of dead.

Deputy Spokesman: There is a reduction in the numbers of identified bodies.

Question: Thank you, Farhan. Can you give us an update on the status of the border crossings and whether any food or water or fuel is getting in anywhere in Gaza?

Deputy Spokesman: Yes. I can, to a certain extent. What I can say is that the Erez crossing has been closed since 9 May. There have been some commodities who have come in through a new opening at Zikim, Z-I-K-I-M, in the north-west. Kerem Shalom is technically open, but it's not logistically viable and it's not safe to access Kerem Shalom. So, things have not been moving there. And regarding Rafah, as you know, there's fighting there. So that makes use of Rafah difficult over all of the last days. Fuel imports have stopped since the Rafah operation began, with only some limited exceptions.

Gabriel and then Dezhi.

Question: Thank you, Farhan. Regarding the 600,000... roughly 600,000 Palestinians that have been displaced since 6 May, have the Israeli authorities been coordinating with you at all or with UN at all on safe passage for these people, where they will go, will they get any care or is there any coordination whatsoever?

Deputy Spokesman: Our basic point of view is that there's no place safe for them to go to. Different sites that have been suggested like Al Muwasi, we've pointed out, are places that don't have access to running water, to electricity, to basic services that are needed to keep that large number of people alive. So, there are many issues in terms of their displacement.

Dezhi?

Question: Yes. The Israeli Prime Minister, [Benjamin] Netanyahu, said that there's no humanitarian crisis in Gaza's southern city, Rafah. He said that hasn't been materialized or nor will it be materialized. Does the UN believe there's a humanitarian crisis?

Deputy Spokesman: You've heard all the things we've been saying over the past seven months, right?

Question: Yes. Does that count as a humanitarian crisis?

Deputy Spokesman: If that doesn't count as a humanitarian crisis, I don't know what words would apply.

Question: So, the Prime Minister is lying?

Deputy Spokesman: I'm not accusing anyone of lying. I'm saying that we've made clear what the facts on the ground are.

Question: Maybe you have different standard?

Deputy Spokesman: You've heard different experts, our leading people dealing with feeding people, talk about how, by the end of this very month, a million people can face famine. Would that strike you as a humanitarian crisis or not?

Hello, everyone. Dear analysts and investors, welcome to our First Quarter 2024 Financial Results Call. Thank you for taking the time to join us today. I'm here with Marc Spieker, for whom this will be the last earnings call as CFO before he takes over his new role as Chief Operating Officer, Commercial. Marc, thank you very much for our successful earnings calls together. At the same time, I'm excited to have Nadia taking over as CFO in June, and I'm looking forward to having her join the earnings calls from our H1 results onwards. As for today's call, as usual, we will leave enough room for your questions after the presentation.

Thank you, Iris, and a warm welcome from my side as well. I will save my goodbye words for later. Let us straight dive into the Q1 results, and let me start with highlighting the key messages for today. First message, Q1 came out in line with our expectations for all businesses. Key drivers of our slight EBITDA and net income increase, we're investing back earnings growth and strong operational execution more than offsetting the unwind of prior year one-off and timing effects.

Second message. Our planned CapEx ramp-up is progressing well. We have accelerated again our spending by almost 25% year-over-year and are well on track in terms of quarterly fill rates across all business segments.

Third message, our Q1 economic net debt came in as expected, showing the typical Q1 cash flow seasonality and the final outflows related to the unwinding of the positive one-off working capital effects that we have been reporting to you as of our 2022 results, and I'll come back to that later.

Fourth and final message, we have a strong conviction in the relevant and long-term growth path of our Energy Infrastructure Solutions business. To make our ambitions more visible, we are moving the business into a stand-alone segment from this quarter onwards as announced. Finally, our guidance is fully confirmed.

On to our Q1 EBITDA development. Our adjusted EBITDA came in at EUR 2.7 billion, up 1% year-over-year despite the lack of significant positive impacts from one-offs that we had seen in the prior year quarter. As expected, our Energy Networks business is slightly down in Q1 due to unwinding positive regulatory account effects of 2023, such as the benefit from lower redispatch costs, as well as slightly higher-than-expected costs from upstream networks in Germany. Additionally, we have changed the accounting for our Slovakian VSE business, to an equity consolidation, which leads to a technical reduction in EBITDA in our Central Eastern Europe business, no impact on net income.

All those effects are economically neutral and they were largely offset by strong RAB driven earnings growth across all regions and the positive uplift of regulatory parameters in Sweden. Regarding network losses, Sweden and Slovakia have now completed their recoveries, while additional recoveries are now only happening in Southern Eastern Europe. You may have noted that we have now split our reporting of the CEE and Turkey segment into Central Eastern Europe and Southeastern Europe. This shall give you more transparency on our geographically well-diversified portfolio of networks businesses. The Central Eastern Europe segment covers Czech Republic, Poland and Slovakia. The Southeastern Europe segment includes our activities in Hungary, Romania and Turkey.

Moving on to Energy Infrastructure Solutions. New project commissioning is leading to EBITDA growth, as you would expect, supporting our 13% EBITDA accumulated average growth rate target from 2023 to 2028. This development is masked in Q1 by the absence of a positive one-off effect from last year and by changed intra-year maintenance schedule with a stronger focus on Q1 this year. With a change in maintenance schedule, we are partly mitigating also the negative effects from mild weather that we have been observing during the first quarter. In Energy Retail, the significant year-over-year EBITDA increase was primarily driven by positive price adjustments since Q1 last year. Additionally, we benefited from the improvement in our B2B segment in the U.K., which is successfully continuing its margin over volume strategy.

Those positive effects were partially offset by the lack of procurement optimization benefits that we had seen in Q1 last year and it's a very favorable commodity price background last year and lower weather-driven volumes in Q1. Corporate Functions and Other segments saw an expected slight EBITDA decline driven by the lower results from our Turkish generation business due to the development of commodity prices also in Turkey.

Moving on to our adjusted net income, which showed an increase of 2% which broadly follows the year-over-year EBITDA development. All earnings elements below EBITDA have developed in line with our expectations. The share of minority income sits at around 19% for the first quarter, as expected. And with that, materially below prior year. We expect this share to continue to go down and be lower for the full year as we communicated in our full year 2023 earnings release. Looking at the development of our economic net debt, I would like to highlight 3 points.

First, our promised CapEx ramp-up is being executed like clockwork. We increased our Q1 investment spending by close to 25% year-over-year. I can assure you that we continue to be fully focused on ensuring a frictionless ramp up, managing closely our operations and supply chains. So far, we do not see any critical bottleneck on the horizon.

Second, we have seen the typical operating cash outflow in Q1, which is driven by our seasonal business patterns in both Energy Retail and Energy Networks, specifically Energy Networks in Germany. As expected, this outflow was slightly amplified by the final unwind of our 2022 one-off working capital benefits. It's a long time ago, not everyone may remember, but our 2022 full year cash conversion set at a very benign 151%, significantly above the 100% we normally target. And as communicated in March for 2024, we are foreseeing a conversion rate of around 90%. And with that, the final reversal of these positive working capital effects from 2022 after 2024, we expect cash conversion to then swing back to the guided 100%.

Third message on END, our strong balance sheet position has recently been confirmed by 2 of our rating agencies. We have received a rating upgrade by Standard & Poor's and a full rating confirmation by Moody's. As communicated before, in line with our commitment to a strong BBB BAA rating, we have additional balance sheet capacity to fund further investments needed for a successful European energy transition if regulatory conditions further improve. Considering the balance sheet, it is also worth highlighting that we have already issued EUR 3.3 billion of bonds in the first quarter. With that, we have already fully covered our funding needs for 2024 and partially already prefunded 2025.

Moving on to Energy Infrastructure Solutions. As announced, we will report this business as a stand-alone segment from this quarter onwards. Strategically and with a view to future growth, this segment is all about exploiting the huge business opportunities from decarbonization and to a large extent, electrification of the heating sector. The segment comprises our activities in designing, building, owning, operating and optimizing sustainable energy infrastructure assets for cities and business customers. Our solutions are based on modular standard building blocks, which are configured and digitally connected to fit specific customer needs.

Technologically, our offerings include firstly, renewable on and offsite generation assets like photovoltaic and wind. Secondly, gas or biomass-fired heat and power engines. Thirdly, heat pumps and geothermal solutions. Fourthly, waste heat recovery technologies. And finally, high- and low-temperature heating and cooling grids. From a business point of view, we distinguish 2 clusters within Energy Infrastructure Solutions. First cluster is district heating and cooling, which is about running low-carbon heating and cooling networks in urban areas. Second business area is our industrial and commercial solutions business, offering on-site energy infrastructure for industrial and commercial customers.

We have decided to also include our U.K. smart metering business in this segment, while technologically, obviously different in nature, it is a quasi-regulated business and hence, of similar nature when it comes to financial visibility and resilience. Let me remind you of some more financial and business characteristics relevant for our Energy Infrastructure Solutions business. Geographically, we are present in 15 countries, the key ones being Germany, Sweden and the U.K. Our pan-European coverage and strong regional anchoring represent a unique advantage to address our customers' needs for locally optimized energy infrastructure. Our strategy to standardize our offerings in a modular way will allow us to scale our solutions.

Therefore, out of the EUR 5 billion CapEx plan for the next 5 years, 80% will be dedicated to growth investments. Through long-term contracts with customers, commodity price volatility and inflation are effectively passed through, for instance, via price escalation clauses. We ensure that any new project is targeted to deliver an internal rate of return spread over WACC of between 120 to 350 basis points. Furthermore, our rigorous focus on operational excellence ensures high asset availability. This is supported by digitalization, which helps to steer, monitor and effectively maintain and optimize the fleet of more than 6,000 assets. We expect annual EBITDA growth of 13% on average. Keep in mind that the municipal heat transition across Europe is still at an early stage. So there is more -- much more to come, but too soon for us to quantify what the impact will be over time.

Let me close today's presentation with Slide 8 what you essentially should take away from us today. First, extremely solid Q1 outturn supports our expected earnings delivery for 2024. Second, our investment ramp-up is progressing well, which fully underpins the delivery of our midterm organic growth targets. Third, our balance sheet remains very healthy. We will continue to focus on delivering an attractive total shareholder return based on value creative organic growth and an annually growing dividend per share. And with that, let me move to a personal note.

We announced in March that I would be moving on to take over as a Chief Operating Officer, the responsibility for our Energy Infrastructure and Retail Businesses from June onwards this year. We deliver what we promised. So inevitably, today is my last results call as CFO. It has been close to 8 years as CFO in the Board of Management of E.ON, hundreds of roadshows and exactly 30 results calls. I am not going away, but I will be focused on different things going forward. Great news for you is our investors and analysts that with Nadia Jakobi, I have the best successor I can think of. I know that with her, you, your interest and most importantly, your investments will continue to be in safe hands.

Dear Iris, I would also like to express my thanks to the best Investor Relations team I can think of. And finally, it has been a privilege for me to represent our company in the capital markets. I'm extremely grateful for so many deep and thoughtful conversations during roadshows and other formats. And a big thank you to all of you for that. Before we get too sentimental, there is still business to be done. So let's move on to our Q&A session.

Thank you very much, Marc. And with that, we will start our Q&A session. Let me remind you all briefly, as you all do know, please stick to 2 questions each so that most of you have the chance to ask the questions. If there's anything we can't answer today, then the IR team is always there to also answer further questions from you. With that, the first question comes from Alberto from Goldman Sachs.

Alberto Gandolfi

Good morning, and Marc, thanks for all the help and all the best. We -- I guess we need to lean on you even more on the execution of all these EUR 20 billion CapEx plan. So congratulations, and thank you once more. Two questions on my side. The first one is a border line very boring, but can I understand, please, in the first quarter, what type of nonrecurring items we have in networks and in customer solutions. I'm trying to go to the underlying earnings power. So as I understand, you released some provisions. The weather was very mild, can you tell us if you booked negative and positive network losses, either recovery or cost? That is the first question. I have the feeling the underlying is stronger. That's why I'm asking.

The second question is I've seen a DSO plan that implies that potentially if feasible, which I understand from what you're saying is not, your CapEx plan could be 50% higher than what you presented in March. What underpins the plus 50%. Is it possible you give us a view on what assumptions we would have to flex to have even more investments. Is this driven by power demand, electrification, more renewables, data centers or just to have a fee for written.

Marc Spieker

Yes. So Alberto, let me start with the nonrecurring items. Compared to last year, we had a lot of positive one-offs. In Q1 this year is much less impacted by any one-off effect. If you look at our Energy Networks business, I think the remaining piece that we see here is a mid-double-digit million euro amount of final recovery for network losses essentially relating to 2022. So there's still a minor positive one-off in our Energy Networks business.

For Energy Retail, essentially, we talk about weather impact, which you may now call kind of extraordinary one-off or not. It's basically a -- it's a metric risk, which will hit us every year kind of in a positive or negative way in Q1 due to the mild temperatures, actually record mild temperatures. That was the second warmest Q1, I think, during the last 50 years. Not that I recollect that, but what the statistics tell and that was a mid-double-digit million euro negative impact.

So across both segments, then it's a wash net nil impact from one-off essentially. Your question to CapEx spend there is very valid. And with that, you're referring to a publication that we have also done about the initial allocation plan, which is kind of an exercise, which is regularly done by the DSO in close alignment with the German regulator, where basically, on a regular basis, we look at what are actually the political targets for renewables build or for development of the energy system. Germany specifically relevant Easter package, and then it's broken down in a technical way. So what are, if you implement those targets as they are written, what would technically have to be done in order then to allow for these targets to be executed. And in that sense, this 50% upside to which you referred to, is to be taken with special care.

First of all, it just reconfirms what we have been telling our shareholders also with our full year results that when it comes to our network growth plans, there is room for more if economic conditions are right. And this is what we are working on in that sense, there is no change to our communication in our plans that we will continue to be working with the relevant authorities to make sure that economic incentives are the right ones to support this, which is one of the constraints by the way, which this initial allocation plan does not include, but which by legislation is actually given.

Secondly, it is a technical plan, which does not take into account practical constraints. And we have seen these practical constraints, particularly playing a role when it comes to permitting, just to mention one, and it would be unrealistic in our view to now assume that they're technically possible in an unconstrained way can be delivered with all the constraints which we have in a practical way. And in that sense, what you should take away is there is a huge potential for E.ON to further invest and accelerate our investments over time. And as just similar to our results, we also have the financial means to do this if the conditions set by the regulators fit.

Alberto Gandolfi

This is very clear. So if you just allow me a comment. You've done essentially if it's clean for Q1, you've done 36% of the midpoint of your guidance in Q1. So it seems you're leaving an easy rest of the year to Nadia from here.

Marc Spieker

I take this as a statement, which I'm not commenting on. We move on.

Iris Eveleigh

Exactly. So we move on to the next question. Thank you, Alberto. Next question comes from Harry from Exane.

Harry Peter Wyburd

So 2 for me. First, can I dig in a little bit to what's going on in U.K. B2B supply. Why is it that you're earning so much, you made so much in such a short period of time? Do you think this is an industry-wide phenomenon for the whole of the U.K. supply market? Or is it just something that you're doing as E.ON? And can you just help us understand a bit what size of clients are driving this very good performance.

Are we talking about much smaller B2B customers or medium-sized, just a bit of color there would be very helpful. And second one is a bit more strategic and a bit of a follow-on from Alberto's questions on the CapEx. Is there any update or view from you on what your partners are doing or what others are doing in the German DNO market in terms of funding. Because I guess, if we're talking about an already upgraded CapEx plan potentially seeing even much more significant, more upside? And how are your partners going to fund this? And might we get into a situation where you're effectively incentivized to put your investment into your fully-owned DNO subsidiaries and not the ones where you've got partners because, of course, if your partners aren't putting capital in, it's harder for you to make a good return on your investment.

Marc Spieker

Just on the second one, when you are referring to partner, could you just specify what partners exactly are you referring to? Are you referring to our co-investors on some of the DSO or are you referring to the [indiscernible]? Okay. Good.

So let me start with the second question. We see across the board an extremely strong alignment between our interest and the interest of our core investors on a DSO level, which are larger municipalities for a number of our German DSOs and there is a very strong focus on all of our sites to make the energy transition work. And if -- also from a funding point of view to make whatever is there needed and possible also then on the level of the DSO side. And generally, we do not see a particularly constraint on that side or a clash of interest nonesoever. On the I&C business in the U.K., it follows our strategy where we had said that in most markets, we want to exit large B2B customers. So to your question, what are the customers? It's large I&C clients. This is not small, medium enterprises.

This is around large industrial and commercial customers. And the U.K. is the only market where we continue to run such a segment at scale. But this is why also strategically, we are very clear on that business, we'll have to be steered on margins and not on volume. So what we have been seeing this business doing is running on a smaller and smaller book and focusing more and more on those customers where we are able then to make a risk-adjusted fair margin if I look at the risk transformation that we're doing for these clients. I don't want to refer and can't refer now to whether that's an industry-wide phenomenon or not. What I can tell you that this is not a one-hit wonder, which has happened now in Q1. It is a development that we have been working for throughout the last 4 years with the continuous effort on managing our customer portfolio in that business.

And Marc, look forward to meeting you in person for your farewell events. So my 2 questions are actually centered around your German networks. So firstly, if I'm not mistaken, you were still awaiting for some more details on the current regulatory period. I was just wondering if you can update if there's been any change on the efficiency factors or anything.

And the second one was looking forward to the next regulatory period, there's obviously a consultation out from the regulator to move to back and reduce the regulatory period. And then there's also the live court case that you have for the current period. So just wondering how you think the negotiations will evolve? And should we assume that if you're successful in the court case, the regulator -- I mean is there quid pro quo between getting a better deal post '29 and leaving some money on the table for existing assets now? Or how would you think of this discussion.

Marc Spieker

So where do we have news and where do we essentially looking at the same time line with no -- is expected no further update. So first of all, what we have seen since the full year results is the publication of the efficiency benchmark. And the good news is that E.ON continues to be very efficient, i.e., 100% efficient operator. And I think that underpins our strategic relevance and the efforts that we are doing and continuously focusing on operational excellence also in our Energy Networks business. There hasn't been a further update on then the general efficiency factor. So -- and that stands on the efficiency front. We have now a public confirmation about what we have been working towards any or as an ambition to be fully efficient and we now need to see how the regulator deals with the general efficiency factor. Still, this has not been published yet.

On the consultation, then for the regulatory period starting 2028 for I guess '29 for power, no update essentially, Deepa that is worth relevant sharing here. I think what we continue to look at, first and foremost, is the proposal by the regulator. How to deal with depreciation schedules for existing gas networks. So this was one of the ideas expressed as part of the consultation paper where the regulator also pronounced that they were seeking there a fast solution. So kind of in the pipeline to expect is then a clarification by the regulator on how they intend to deal with existing gas networks, which is obviously also relevant for the energy transition in total. And for a lot of the market players, as you know for us gas networks has a very small share in our RAB but this is from a regulatory point of view, what we would expect to be the upcoming release. I think that's on the regulatory side.

Court case, also no update. So we haven't seen any -- there hasn't been any specific intervention with the court, no hearing, et cetera. So nothing to update on that side.

Iris Eveleigh

With that, we move on to the questions from Wanda from UBS.

Unidentified Analyst

Marc, all the best, again. Two questions for me. The first one is on your 2024 guidance. I mean, Energy Retail, you had a very strong start into the year. Q1 EBITDA accounts for 50% of the full year guidance. So do you expect any reversal later this year? Or is there any buffer included in the guidance, something similar to what you did at the end of last year. And if there is any buffer, would you be able to quantify it? And the second question is on the UK Retail. In March [indiscernible] launched a discussion paper for the future of price protection, the [indiscernible] collection is upcoming. How do you see the market structure changing as the current one, the price cut doesn't really work.

Marc Spieker

So 2024 guidance, Wanda. I think what I would stress is that we are back basically in normal operations. So while the last 2 years have been very much affected by energy crisis and kind of the relief from the energy crisis. We are now more or less back in normal mode. And I think where we can take confidence from is how well we have managed the first quarter, which has been extremely mild. And this double-digit -- mid double-digit million euro negative impact from weather for the second warmest quarter during the last 50 years. That is a quite good performance. But it's too early now to say at this stage what that means for the remainder of the year. So for our guidance, take that we are managing towards the midpoint as usually. And at this stage, there's nothing that I would flag where we are particularly aggressive or conservative in the way how we have set our guidance.

And apart from that, you always know that we deliver what we promise. So -- but the midpoint is what it is at this stage. On U.K. retail, there's not a lot that I would share now in this call except for that what we see is that the U.K. regulator has been much more constructive during the last years reacting to the industry's needs. Think we have also seen this -- of generally seen in Europe, the recognition also of retailers of being a system critical part of the energy value chain. And lastly, what I do see that E.ON specifically is being regarded by politicians and regulators as a company that stands in for the interest of customers and is driving the market to the benefit of the customers.

And this gives us also where there are conversations, I think weighted the relevance in being heard in these discussions. And apart from that, it remains what I've said in the past that the U.K. regulation is very little wiggle room now to become worse because if you look at the results, which many of the operators in the U.K. are still achieving, it's not a marketplace where you could now easily just step in as a regulator and believe that U.K. worsening conditions, I think this is still a game about improving conditions to make these operations economically viable.

Iris Eveleigh

With that, next question comes from Rob Pulleyn from Morgan Stanley.

Rob Pulleyn

I have one question, which is quite high level, Marc. And that is, how does E.ON see power demand over time, given, of course, in 2023 it remains significantly lower than we saw precrisis in 2021. Is this structural loss due to industry. What about electrification trends you've spoken about? And also more recently, the data center demand, which we covered on the full year conference call. So I'd love to know what you think is a good suggestion for the medium-term power demand run rate we should be thinking for E.ON from here across the decade.

Marc Spieker

Yes, Rob, it's a very relevant long-term question, but happy to address that. So fundamentally, we are positive about the growth outlook of electricity volumes in our markets. So we expect electricity long term to be on a growth trend. Now when we talk about growth trends in energy, in developed markets, it's never high growth rates, but what we are seeing and expecting is a growth of 1%, 2% annually over time.

And with that, of course, electricity will be the key carrier to replace then a number of primary fuels, specifically, you look at transportation, mineral oil, and if you look at heating mineral oil and gas. So growth outlook for electricity long term. And I think that is also important if you allow me that comment. If you look at the impact on affordability of the energy transition and then you should always keep in mind that all of these investments will be spread over time about much more volumes that will be wheeled in the system and increasingly bidirectional. So increasingly, our customers will also provide their power to the system. And so from that end, we are also confident that this will play out in a decent way.

I have 2 questions, really. So firstly, I wanted to ask about the B2B business. Is this just the U.K. situation? Or this is also visible -- I know you don't have exposure, but this is also visible in the German and Benelux market? And why you saw [indiscernible] exclude the option to participate if there are some opportunities. You see the tender where the margin would be extremely high, why wouldn't you participate if the situation is similar in the continent? And second question I wanted to ask about your retail customer. Where are we in the process of passing through the lower falling commodity cost to the end customer deals. So if I were a customer in Germany, what kind of a reduction can I expect for '25, '26 onwards. And that's the question.

Marc Spieker

Yes. Let me start with the second one, Piotr. So as you know, we are not giving a mid-long-term guidance on price development as we are a business that passes on the fundamental costs onto our customers. What we do see is that what is relevant for our customers, it's the commodity piece and it's the network charges. What we've seen for this year is from this essentially a stable price outlook. We have always different customer segments that will be then adjusted. We also have market-by-market different hedging windows, so the impact of that can be from a timing point of view, a bit different. But essentially, for example, look at Germany, we have seen very little price adjustments this year. And this is on the back of lower commodity prices and somewhat increasing network tariffs.

So all in all at this stage, limited impact. And then we need to see how commodity prices will develop over time but no further guidance as usual on how we see our end customer tariffs then moving. On the B2B business, we had actually been outspoken on that for the last 3, 4 years that we do not regard large industrial and commercial business as a strategically relevant segment for us. And to your question, therefore, in all other markets, we have moved out of that segment. So we are not running I&C retail businesses in any of the other markets. And the U.K. is the only one, and that is due to the specific situation of the Innogy integration and the Npower piece, which we had there, where we first focused on then kind of moving the E.ON and the Innogy business together on one platform.

It is actually from a branding point of view still running on the Npower brand in the U.K. And this is why this is our only material B2B position and hence, no real read across to any other of our markets, at least what would be relevant for us.

Iris Eveleigh

In this regard, Slovakia is dependent on their import from abroad.

This may soon change as the company INO-HUB Energy plans to build a new plant producing batteries for energy storage in KysuckÃ© NovÃ© Mesto, northern Slovakia. It will include a scientific research centre. The investment is worth approximately â¬5.5 million. The plant is to be constructed in an industrial part of the town that has long been in disrepair.

According to papers submitted for an environmental impact assessment, the batteries are intended as backup sources of electricity in the event of power outages or lack of a transmission network, as well as commercial use, among other things. Their capacity is to be 2,400 kWh.

The project should create job opportunities for 90 people, of which 51 will be manual labourers and 39 will work in administration and laboratories. Construction should begin in the first quarter of 2025, with the operation starting the following year.

The goal of the company is to introduce a sustainable solution that will have no negative impact on the environment and be an alternative to lithium, lead and other batteries. In addition, the operation of the plant will use renewable sources.

The batteries for energy storage were developed in cooperation with the University of Pavel Jozef Å afÃ¡rik in KoÅ¡ice and the Technical University in KoÅ¡ice.",spectator.sme.sk,news,spectator.sme.sk,"Jana LiptÃ¡kovÃ¡, Beata BalogovÃ¡, Jozef RynÃ­k",0.1607843137254903,453493005,10,https://artemis.smedata.sk/smedata/bundles/smeartemisweb/spectator/images/spectator-default-photo.png?r=268ec,

NEW YORK (AP) -- Americans unexpectedly paused their spending in April from March as inflation continued to sting and elevated interest rates made taking on debt more burdensome. Retail sales were unchanged, coming in well below economists' expectations, and the figure followed a revised 0.6% pace in March, according to Commerce Department data released Wednesday. It rose 0.9% in February. That comes after sales fell 1.1% in January, dragged down in part by inclement weather. Excluding gas prices and auto sales, retail sales fell 0.1%.

Senators urge $32 billion in emergency spending on AI after finishing yearlong review

WASHINGTON (AP) -- A bipartisan group of four senators led by Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is recommending that Congress spend at least $32 billion over the next three years to develop artificial intelligence and put safeguards around it. The group writes in a report released Wednesday the U.S. needs to ""harness the opportunities and address the risks"" of the quickly developing technology. The senators say they sometimes disagreed on the best paths forward but they eventually found consensus on policy recommendations included in the 33-page report because they felt the stakes were so high.

Billionaire Frank McCourt says he's putting together a consortium to buy TikTok

Billionaire businessman and real estate mogul Frank McCourt says he's putting together a consortium to purchase TikTok's U.S. business. The announcement posted Wednesday on the website of McCourt's Project Liberty initiative adds to the number of investors hoping to benefit from a new federal law that requires TikTok's China-based parent company to sell the popular platform or face a ban. Other investors, including former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, have expressed a desire to purchase TikTok. However, TikTok's parent company ByteDance has already said it's not planning to sell the platform. The Chinese government is unlikely to approve a sale, especially not one with the recommendation engine that powers the videos that populates users' feeds.

Labor laws largely exclude nannies. Some are banding together to protect themselves

NEW YORK (AP) -- Nannies, housekeepers, and home care workers are excluded from many federal workplace protections in the United States, and the private, home-based nature of the work means abuse tends to happen behind closed doors. Domestic workers, who make less than half of what a typical worker makes and are disproportionately women and immigrant women, are especially vulnerable to workplace violations and discrimination, experts say. Even in the 11 states with laws on the books that protect domestic workers, those often go unenforced. But nannies across the nation are lobbying lawmakers for better protections and training their peers on how to exercise their rights.

Justice Department says Boeing violated deal that avoided prosecution after 737 Max crashes

WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department has determined that Boeing violated a settlement that allowed the company to avoid criminal prosecution after two deadly crashes involving its 737 Max aircraft. It is now up to the Justice Department to weigh whether to file charges against the aircraft maker. Glenn Leon, the head of the fraud section of the Justice Department's criminal division, says Boeing failed to make changes to prevent it from violating federal anti-fraud laws -- a condition of the 2021 settlement. It is not clear whether the government will prosecute the manufacturing giant. Prosecutors will tell the court no later than July 7 how they plan to proceed.

Stock market today: Wall Street rises toward records after inflation finally slows

NEW YORK (AP) -- U.S. stocks are rising toward records with hope that inflation is heading back in the right direction. The S&P 500 was 0.9% higher Wednesday and above its all-time high set in March. The Nasdaq composite was adding to its own record and up 1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 270 points. A report showing a slowdown in inflation is raising expectations for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates this year. But a stall in spending growth at U.S. retailers is keeping the gains in check. GameStop and other meme stocks are giving up some of their huge gains from the week's start.

Morocco's automotive industry shifts gears to prep for electric vehicle era

TANGIERS, Morocco (AP) -- Morocco has grown its automotive industry from virtually non-existent to Africa's largest in less than two decades. The North African kingdom supplies more cars to Europe than China, India or Japan, and has the capacity to produce 700,000 vehicles a year. Moroccan officials are determined to maintain the country's role as a car-making juggernaut by competing for electric vehicle projects. But whether one of Africa's few industrialization success stories can stay competitive as worldwide auto production transitions to EVs and increasingly relies on automation remains to be seen. Morocco's industry and trade minister says the government is focused on offering more than cheap labor to foreign automakers that are looking for outsourcing destinations.

CNX plans $1.5B hydrogen fuels plant at Pittsburgh airport, but wants federal tax credit to build it

HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -- Natural gas producer CNX Resources says it plans to build a $1.5 billion facility at Pittsburgh's airport to make hydrogen-based fuels. But, in its plan unveiled Wednesday, it says it will only build it if President Joe Biden's administration allows coal mine methane to qualify for hydrogen production tax credits. Biden's administration is deciding how to tailor billions in tax credits. CNX said the facility would remove coal mine methane from the atmosphere and blend it with natural gas to produce hydrogen-based airline fuel. Climate change activists say producing hydrogen from fossil fuels, instead of from carbon-free electricity, would undermine the purpose of the hydrogen program to displace fossil fuels.

These latest improvements are a further indication that Tachyum's ProdigyÂ® hardware continues to mature through its development stages prior to its public release.

UEFI replaces the traditional BIOS as a next-generation interface between the operating system and platform firmware. It is used during startup to initialize the hardware and load the OS. Additionally, UEFI determines device boot priority and allows users to customize hardware and software settings. With this latest release, menus and submenus, screens and options received upgrades for better functionality and an improved user experience.

In conjunction with the advancement to beta, Tachyum released a user manual that provides details about how to access and use the UEFI, which is embedded in the system flash on all Prodigy platforms. The manual explains each of the UEFI menus, how to configure UEFI parameters and how to save new configurations. The documents are intended for users who install, maintain, troubleshoot and administer Prodigy platforms.

RAID's ability to store data across multiple hard drives (HDDs) or solid-state drives (SSDs) allows for the protection of data in case of a drive failure by creating redundancy and improving performance. Tachyum's approach to this virtual disk technology provides:

""We continue to see impressive advancements in the capabilities and functionality of Prodigy at every level of development,"" said Dr. Radoslav Danilak, founder and CEO of Tachyum. ""Moving UEFI from alpha to beta allows a better look and polishing of the UEFI. RAID 1 was added to provide a RAID boot without the need for expensive NVMe SSD RAID cards, helping to bring Prodigy-enabled systems to datacenter-level class. All of these moves, including the expectation that we will have a release candidate available next quarter, further signifies that we are nearing production of the Prodigy Universal Processor.""

As a Universal Processor offering industry-leading performance for all workloads, Prodigy-powered data center servers can seamlessly and dynamically switch between computational domains (such as AI/ML, HPC, and cloud) with a single homogeneous architecture. By eliminating the need for expensive dedicated AI hardware and dramatically increasing server utilization, Prodigy reduces CAPEX and OPEX significantly while delivering unprecedented data center performance, power, and economics. Prodigy integrates 192 high-performance custom-designed 64-bit compute cores, to deliver up to 4.5x the performance of the highest-performing x86 processors for cloud workloads, up to 3x that of the highest performing GPU for HPC, and 6x for AI applications.

A video demonstration of RAID 1 UEFI boot on a Prodigy emulation system is available for viewing at https://youtu.be/ZksczIDoDZ8 .

Tachyum is transforming the economics of AI, HPC, public and private cloud workloads with Prodigy, the world's first Universal Processor. Prodigy unifies the functionality of a CPU, a GPU, and a TPU in a single processor to deliver industry-leading performance, cost and power efficiency for both specialty and general-purpose computing. As global data center emissions continue to contribute to a changing climate, with projections of their consuming 10 percent of the world's electricity by 2030, the ultra-low power Prodigy is positioned to help balance the world's appetite for computing at a lower environmental cost. Tachyum recently received a major purchase order from a US company to build a large-scale system that can deliver more than 50 exaflops performance, which will exponentially exceed the computational capabilities of the fastest inference or generative AI supercomputers available anywhere in the world today. When complete in 2025, the Prodigy-powered system will deliver a 25x multiplier vs. the world's fastest conventional supercomputer - built just this year - and will achieve AI capabilities 25,000x larger than models for ChatGPT4. Tachyum has offices in the United States and Slovakia.

It rose 0.9% in February. That comes after sales fell 1.1% in January, dragged down in part by inclement weather. Excluding gas prices and auto sales, retail sales fell 0.1%.

Senators urge $32 billion in emergency spending on AI after finishing yearlong review

WASHINGTON (AP) -- A bipartisan group of four senators led by Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is recommending that Congress spend at least $32 billion over the next three years to develop artificial intelligence and also put safeguards around it. The group wrote in a new report released Wednesday that the U.S. needs to ""harness the opportunities and address the risks"" of the quickly developing technology. The group says they sometimes disagreed on the best paths forward, but that they eventually found consensus on policy recommendations included in the 33-page report because they felt that the stakes were so high.

Billionaire Frank McCourt says he's putting together a consortium to buy TikTok

Billionaire businessman and real estate mogul Frank McCourt says he's putting together a consortium to purchase TikTok's U.S. business. The announcement posted Wednesday on the website of McCourt's Project Liberty initiative adds to the number of investors hoping to benefit from a new federal law that requires TikTok's China-based parent company to sell the popular platform or face a ban. Other investors, including former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, have expressed a desire to purchase TikTok. However, TikTok's parent company ByteDance has already said it's not planning to sell the platform. The Chinese government is unlikely to approve a sale, especially not one with the recommendation engine that powers the videos that populates users' feeds.

Labor laws largely exclude nannies. Some are banding together to protect themselves

NEW YORK (AP) -- Nannies, housekeepers, and home care workers are excluded from many federal workplace protections in the United States, and the private, home-based nature of the work means abuse tends to happen behind closed doors. Domestic workers, who make less than half of what a typical worker makes and are disproportionately women and immigrant women, are especially vulnerable to workplace violations and discrimination, experts say. Even in the 11 states with laws on the books that protect domestic workers, those often go unenforced. But nannies across the nation are lobbying lawmakers for better protections and training their peers on how to exercise their rights.

Justice Department says Boeing violated deal that avoided prosecution after 737 Max crashes

WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department has determined that Boeing violated a settlement that allowed the company to avoid criminal prosecution after two deadly crashes involving its 737 Max aircraft. It is now up to the Justice Department to weigh whether to file charges against the aircraft maker. Glenn Leon, the head of the fraud section of the Justice Department's criminal division, says Boeing failed to make changes to prevent it from violating federal anti-fraud laws -- a condition of the 2021 settlement. It is not clear whether the government will prosecute the manufacturing giant. Prosecutors will tell the court no later than July 7 how they plan to proceed.

Stock market today: S&P 500 flirts with its record after inflation slows

NEW YORK (AP) -- U.S. stocks are rising toward records with hope that inflation is heading back in the right direction. The S&P 500 was 0.5% higher Wednesday and flirting with its all-time high set in March. The Nasdaq composite was adding to its own record and up 0.5%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 134 points. A report showing a slowdown in inflation is raising expectations for the Federal Reserve to cut its main interest rate this year, pushing Treasury yields lower. But a stall in spending by U.S. households tired after years of high inflation is keeping the gains in check.

Morocco's automotive industry shifts gears to prep for electric vehicle era

TANGIERS, Morocco (AP) -- Morocco has grown its automotive industry from virtually non-existent to Africa's largest in less than two decades. The North African kingdom supplies more cars to Europe than China, India or Japan, and has the capacity to produce 700,000 vehicles a year. Moroccan officials are determined to maintain the country's role as a car-making juggernaut by competing for electric vehicle projects. But whether one of Africa's few industrialization success stories can stay competitive as worldwide auto production transitions to EVs and increasingly relies on automation remains to be seen. Morocco's industry and trade minister says the government is focused on offering more than cheap labor to foreign automakers that are looking for outsourcing destinations.

CNX plans $1.5B hydrogen fuels plant at Pittsburgh airport, but wants federal tax credit to build it

HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -- Natural gas producer CNX Resources says it plans to build a $1.5 billion facility at Pittsburgh's airport to make hydrogen-based fuels. But, in its plan unveiled Wednesday, it says it will only build it if President Joe Biden's administration allows coal mine methane to qualify for hydrogen production tax credits. Biden's administration is deciding how to tailor billions in tax credits. CNX said the facility would remove coal mine methane from the atmosphere and blend it with natural gas to produce hydrogen-based airline fuel. Climate change activists say producing hydrogen from fossil fuels, instead of from carbon-free electricity, would undermine the purpose of the hydrogen program to displace fossil fuels.

May 13 (Interfax) - The European gas market has replaced most of the Russian gas it used to receive with U.S. liquefied natural gas, but Europe has also been saved by extraordinarily mild winters, lower gas consumption by industry and increased use of renewable energy. However, European gas analysts believe the crisis is now over, and, faced by reduced supply flexibility and a recovery in consumption, infrastructure constraints and competition from Asia for LNG, as well as uncertainty over the continued transit of Russian gas through Ukraine, every cubic meter of gas could count in the event of a cold winter.

Cara MacDonald, head of LNG & Clean-Fuel Supply and Origination at RWE AG, said at the Flame gas conference at the end of April that Europe had been able to withstand the past two heating seasons thanks to mild weather and a demand side response. ""Europe had much milder weather, especially in the winter of 2022-2023, which cooled consumption and allowed storage to fill up. Additionally, due to high gas prices, we have seen demand destruction in Europe, while in Asia, this meant more fuel switching,"" she said.

""But is the crisis over? Things could change in the coming winters, especially if there is no flexibility in LNG supplies. The only answer may be continued demand side response,"" MacDonald said, although she believes this might not save the situation.

""Yes, we coped by reducing demand, but can we do it again? When I look at demand side signals, I see that the market will become tighter,"" she said, adding that there was limited supply flexibility and any incident at an LNG plant could tighten the balance.

Glenn Vinvand Kviljo, head of trading at Equinor, also said the European market faced uncertainty in the coming winter after two mild winters: ""Will there be another mild winter, or we will get back to the normal, cold winter? We cannot sit back and relax,"" he said.

Chief analyst at Uniper Energy, Gregor Pett, warned that despite the fact that the market has been more bearish in recent weeks and months, this was mainly associated with a weak economy, air temperatures, high storage and others. ""But for most market participants, this is a fragile balance, and at any time the situation can turn around [...] and there could be a repeat of the crisis. It's not over, it's far from over,"" he said.

""It is difficult to foresee what will happen in terms of supply and demand. It depends on many things, including the weather. We can have a very mild winter, so gas demand in Europe will be low. If it's an extremely cold winter the demand will be higher than in the past two years and a lower supply could be a problem,"" a representative of a European gas trader told Interfax in an interview.

""If there was an outage of the production from Norway or hurricanes in the U.S. - there are many events which can happen and which can bring to a very tight situation in Europe where each Bcm of supply is important,"" the trader said, adding that a very hot summer could also cause demand to spike.

He said that current gas prices in Europe include a risk premium since all these factors were difficult to predict. ""And each player has an own opinion if prices are fair or not. Currently the market is pricing in, I would say, a normal cold winter, but the winter can be different,"" the trader said.

Europe has reduced gas consumption by about 20% over the past two years to approximately 330 billion cubic meters due to high gas prices (27 EU countries), as well as the energy transition drive, while some industrial demand for gas has been lost forever, some participants believe. However, there are signs of demand recovering.

Cheniere Energy said in a presentation that gas consumption in Europe was now below the 2017-2021 average. It fell 19% in the region's six biggest economies, with consumption in industry down 22% (between 18% and 23%), in energy - 14% (between 8% and 25%), in other sectors - 21% (between 17% and 28%).

Uniper Energy's Pett said Europe has lost a very large amount of industrial production due to high prices, but ""we expect a lot of industrial demand to return to the market."" However, most gas analysts were unable to say to what extent demand might return.

Gautam Mukherjee, head of gas analytics at BP, said it was necessary to look at sectors. For example, in industry, gas is being replaced by heat pumps; in the energy sector, on the one hand, there is more renewable energy, but on the other hand, coal is being replaced. Overall, he said, Europe has had very weak economic results over the past two years, so not only has demand for gas fallen, but demand for electricity has also been very low. And Europe's economy is expected to recover in the coming years, so demand for gas in both the power industry and other industry will increase.

Uniper Energy's Pett said the difference in consumption in a mild and normal winter for northwestern Europe was 30 billion cubic meters, and last winter was ""extraordinarily mild.""

Given the demand and uncertainty over the weather, gas market participants are concerned about whether the contract for Russian gas transit through Ukraine will be extended, and if not, whether LNG can replace it. Europe has lost over 100 billion cubic meters of pipeline gas supplies from Russia over the past two years, but supplies through Ukraine and TurkStream continue to some extent.

Andrei Prokofiev, head of Division for Cooperation with Clients at Gas Transmission System Operator of Ukraine (GTSOU), said that both the transit deal and the agreement between Gazprom and GTSOU would expire at the end of the year. ""As the Ukrainian authorities and European Commission have said many times, Ukraine is not going to negotiate with Russia on this matter - no direct agreements. What does this mean from a practical point of view? Not having an agreement between operators means we'll not be putting any capacity up for at auction,"" he said.

""This is like the situation on our border with Romania, where we have interconnectors - Tekovo, Mediesu Aurit. ""There is infrastructure, a tariff, but we cannot come to an agreement with the Romanian TSO due to technical problems. And neither we nor Romania are offering capacity,"" Prokofiev said.

Last year, Europe bought about 135 bcm of LNG, almost half of it from the United States. However, industry participants say that there will be a limited supply of LNG on the market in 2024-2026. Marco Saalfrank, head of trading for continental Europe at Axpo, estimates that the market will be tight in Europe in 2026-2027 because Europe will need to pay high prices to attract LNG. In addition, there will be high volatility in the market because Europe has lost its flexibility (for supply), he said.

There is an opinion that higher gas prices for Europe will become a new reality. Andrew Walker of Cheniere Marketing said that Europe, as the largest market for US LNG exports, has not traditionally been tied to spot prices in Asia, where the market is tight, as it relies on pipeline supplies. However, now Europe is more tied to Asian prices. ""So now this is a bit of a new reality for Europe, so Europe will probably have to get used to higher prices,"" he said.

Patrick Dugas, head of LNG trading at TotalEnergies, said that before the conflict in Ukraine, Europe was a balancing market where any cargo could find a home. However, then the paradigm changed, and Europe became a premium market like Asia. ""I think in the coming months and years we will see competition for LNG between the two basins, European and Asian,"" he said.

Dugas also said that the European market has become characterized by volatility and uncertainty. ""Every time there is a supply problem, it creates volatility in the market [...] and to solve these two problems, we need flexibility,"" he said.

The TotalEnergies trader said not to forget about the recovery in China, which imported 20 million tonnes of LNG in the first quarter, which is 4 million tonnes more than the previous year. ""So recovery in demand in China and possibly Europe will be the two main themes in the market over the next few years,"" he said.

""There really is a maximum amount of LNG on the market now. And if there is no increase in supply with growing demand in Asia, Europe will not be able to fill the balance with liquefied natural gas,"" a spokesperson from RWE said.

However, LNG sellers need assurances that their products will be in demand in the long term. Landon Larson, marketing director for American LNG producer Sempra Infrastructure, said that European companies are now buying LNG, but Europe has announced decarbonization goals, and this puts pressure on investment decisions for the second wave of LNG projects, raising questions about whether or not the projects will be able to sell their LNG, and about their financial sustainability. At the same time, many believe that Europe has set unrealistic goals for its energy transition, at least where timing is concerned.

Meanwhile, the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden has already suspended the issuance of new licenses for LNG exports, intending to assess the extent to which Europe is focused on LNG purchases, or if it will still move away from using fossil fuels.

Axpo's Saalfrank said that there are risks in signing long-term contracts. Therefore, Europe is going to reduce gas consumption; in addition, one cannot exclude ""the risk that Russian gas will return to the European market in 10-20 years,"" he said.

Another risk relates to price: gas purchases tied to oil or linked to Henry Hub spot pricing is sold at a TTF price in Europe, so such price risks are not easily hedged in long-term contracts. In addition, the trader said, there is a regulatory risk (on carbon regulation). ""So, 3-4 years ago, Ireland and France refused to buy American LNG because it is produced in shale deposits,"" he said.

Nicola Duffin, head of LNG supply at Ineos Energy Trading, said that Ineos had the advantage of being a private company and is not under pressure from shareholders to divest from fossil fuels. ""We are realistic and understand that we will need gas for the next 20 years. Other companies may agree with this, but they are not allowed to,"" she noted. In order to enter into a long-term agreement for the purchase of LNG, you need to be ""relatively large and have a huge amount of money,"" Duffin said. It is difficult for small companies to operate in the LNG market.

Gulfstream LNG CEO Vivek Chandra said that traders help grow the LNG business by becoming intermediaries, for example, with countries like Sri Lanka that cannot enter into long-term contracts. Asia, especially China and India, are much more active in purchasing LNG, as they consider it a transition fuel, he said. In addition, we should not forget about the Middle East; for example, Kuwait has become an active buyer, as well as African countries.

But infrastructure is no less of a risk. Laurent Hamou of Gas Infrastructure Europe (GIE) said the gas infrastructure utilization in Europe has been at record levels over the past two years and this means that ""in the coming years we cannot afford any disruptions. Any problem will be very noticeable, and we have a limited number of suppliers and less flexibility.""

""Everyone says that everything is fine - there's spare capacity at LNG terminals in Europe. But I believe that, on the contrary, we need to increase capacity and give the market more flexibility. Let's see what happens in the next two years. Our contract for gas through Ukraine might come to an end, there might be some recovery in demand, and I'm sure we'll need more LNG terminals,"" he said.

Hamou said there was a regional discrepancy in Europe in this regard - for example, Spanish terminals were operating at normal levels, while infrastructure in south-eastern Europe, for example, the terminal in Greece, as well as infrastructure in Germany, were operating at a totally unusual level.

Halting gas transit through Ukraine will result in even bigger restrictions, but we need to think about all European consumers. ""If French consumers paid the German price for gas like in 2022, they would be paying 5 billion euros more. This is a lot of money. You need geographical flexibility, time flexibility and supply flexibility. Any accident will affect prices,"" Hamou said.

Hungary is heavily reliant on Ukrainian transit. ""Yes, some new infrastructure is being built, but it is not yet clear how it will work. There is a lot of infrastructure in the north and south, but gas needs to be delivered to the center,"" he said.

Thomas Thorkildsen, chief commercial officer at Hoegh LNG, in his presentation cited the degree of exposure of some European countries to Russian gas. Croatia gets 81% of its gas from Russia (1.4 bcm), Austria - 75% (5.6 bcm), Hungary - 62% (6.2 bcm), Slovakia - 57% (2.4 bcm), Serbia - 61% (2.1 bcm) Greece - 39% (2 bcm) and the Czech Republic - 35% (2.6 bcm).

Half of this gas enters the EU through Ukraine, the transit agreement ends at the end of 2024, and this must be borne in mind, he said.

A trader at Hungary's MVM CEEnergy told Interfax that the company was now buying 10-11 LNG cargoes, equivalent to 1 bcm of gas, at the Krk terminal in Croatia. The capacity booking contract is valid until 2027, and the company plans to bid at auctions for new capacity. But any increase in purchases will depend how LNG competes with pipeline supplies. Hungary is also counting on potentially higher production within the EU, in particular the Neptun project offshore Romania, which ExxonMobil could put on line in 2026-2027.

But the MVM CEEnergy trader said that although there is enough regasification capacity, pipeline tariffs across Europe might be too high to justify buying LNG.

GTSOU's Prokofiev echoed this. He said European markets were highly segmented and it was difficult to transport LNG from Greece to Slovakia, Austria or Germany. The issue of capacity can be resolved, for example, there is capacity in Ukraine. ""But due to the tariff policies of some countries, this sometimes does not make economic sense. For example, the cost of storage in Germany, likewise in Austria, the anticipated increase in tariffs in Slovakia, make the problem more difficult. And this needs to be resolved, at least at the government level,"" he said, adding that since everyone protected their own market, perhaps a decision at the level of the European Commission is needed.

Prokofiev also said that last year about 2.5 billion cubic meters of gas were pumped into Ukrainian underground gas storage facilities by non-residents and another 0.6-0.7 bcm remained there. At the same time, the capacity of Ukrainian underground gas storage facilities is more than 10 bcm, which could cover a potential interruption of gas supplies to Europe.

Market participants believe that even more LNG terminals need to be built. Ineos Energy Trading's Duffin said Europe needed a huge amount of imported capacity by 2028. She said Northwestern Europe, under normal weather conditions, would have to import an additional 46 bcm of gas as LNG - demand is growing due to the switch from coal to gas, and internal production is falling.

But demand might also fall, so it might make more sense to use floating storage regasification units. But Duffin said it should be remembered that FSRUs are more expensive, do not last forever and they do not have operational flexibility. ""So if governments put an end to subsidies and companies stop paying, they will go to other countries where they are needed more quickly. And I see that in Europe people soon forgot about this and are perhaps not taking it as seriously as they should,"" she said.

Hoegh LNG's Thorkildsen said the company currently owned 10 FSRUs, and a further three LNG tankers that can be converted into FSRUs, which usually takes up to 18 months, but there have been precedents where this happened within five months. He said a new FSRU costs about $500 million and that all shipyards were now booked until 2028.

Hoegh LNG estimates that in 2022 the order for new LNG vessels broke all records and amounted to 145 units, with 68 in 2023 and 44 tankers in 2024. At the same time, 10 gas carriers have already been built in 2024, another 60 are expected, with plans to build 86 tankers in 2025, 84 in 2026, 73 in 2027 and 26 in 2028.The LNG fleet is currently about 600 tankers, excluding FSRUs, which are mainly used as terminals.

The company's FSRUs operate under long-term contracts - half of them in Europe (three in Germany and one in each of France and Lithuania). But Thorkildsen said China was the only market that plans to increase regasification capacity to 200 bcm from the current 100 bcm. Other growing markets, such as Italy, Malaysia, Germany, India, Indonesia, Thailand and Bangladesh, where LNG demand is forecast to grow, are not making decisions to build regasification facilities.

He said Germany was the exception among European countries. But given the announced growth in imports and planned commissioning of regasification capacities, their utilization will reach 63% in 2025-2028 and 82% by 2029, which corresponds to the situation with capacity utilization in north-west Europe in 2022, when there was chaos and high prices. Utilization of LNG terminals in Germany will exceed 90% after 2030, reaching 95% in 2033.

In Italy it is even worse - utilization of its regasification capacity will reach 94% in 2024, and this will no longer be enough from 2027, given the planned import of LNG. ""This doesn't look like energy security,"" Thorkildsen said.

According to Hoegh LNG, 40% of gas consumed in Europe in 2024 will be LNG - about 175 bcm of approximately 420 bcm consumed, while 119 bcm will be supplied by gas pipelines from Norway, 22 bcm by the gas pipeline from Russia, and 67 bcm will be produced in the EU and the UK.

A drop in Russian gas supplies is expected after 2024 as the transit contract with Ukraine expire; supplies from North Africa and Azerbaijan will remain largely at the same level; imports from Norway will decrease from 108 bcm in 2029 to 81 bcm in 2034 and 58 bcm in 2039; and Europe's own production will decrease to 60 bcm.

LNG supplies are expected to increase initially to 203 bcm in 2029, accounting for half of consumption, but as consumption falls to approximately 330 bcm in 2039, LNG purchases will also fall, to 157 bcm, Hoegh LNG says in its presentation.

The European Union is currently discussing a ban on imports of Russian LNG. Last year, Europe purchased about 18 bcm of LNG from Russia, with about 1 bcm of this redirected to Asian markets.

However, market participants believe European politicians will most likely postpone the embargo until 2027, when new LNG projects go on line for world markets.",interfax.com,news,interfax.com,,-0.1058823529411764,453481330,7,,eng-9563546

Ukraine has been forced to introduce temporary blackouts across the country, affecting both industry and the local population, as it struggles with the aftermath of Russian strikes, the national power grid operator said.

In a statement on Wednesday morning, Ukrenergo said it had ""implemented controlled emergency shutdowns for industrial and household consumers in all regions of Ukraine,"" adding that critical infrastructure was not affected. It later clarified that the restrictions lasted two to three hours and did not apply to the Kiev-controlled part of Russia's Kherson Region.

""The reason is a significant shortage of electricity in the system due to Russian shelling and an increase in consumption due to the cold weather,"" Ukrenergo said

The operator also warned the public that the blackouts would most likely be in the evening hours due to increased power consumption. In addition, there will be power limitation schedules throughout the day for industrial consumers on Wednesday, Ukrenergo noted.

This came after the operator introduced similar restrictions for industry on Tuesday, which were followed by controlled power cuts in the evening due to a spike in consumption.

To alleviate the pressure, Ukraine is importing energy from neighboring EU countries, including Romania, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, and Moldova, Ukrenergo added. A day earlier, the operator said its repair crews were making every effort to restore power, although in frontline regions the work is constantly hampered by air raid sirens.

The rolling blackouts come after Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmitry Kuleba admitted earlier this month that Russian strikes had damaged half of the country's energy system. The Ukrhydroenergo power generating company said last week that its hydroelectric facilities had suffered ""overwhelming damage.""

Meanwhile, Ukrainian Energy Minister German Galushchenko estimated the combined financial losses from Russian attacks at more than $1 billion, warning that the figure would continue to rise.

Moscow has ramped up strikes on Ukraine's military and energy infrastructure in recent weeks. The Russian Defense Ministry said last month that the strikes were in response to Kiev's attempts to target oil facilities in the country. Moscow reiterated that the attacks are only aimed at Ukrainian military targets and facilities that support their operations and never at the civilian population.",europesun.com,news,europesun.com,,-0.2235294117647059,453478690,1,https://cdn.bignewsnetwork.com/rtc1715778829.jpg,

WASHINGTON (AP) -- Led by lower food and auto prices, inflation in the United States cooled slightly last month after three elevated readings, likely offering a tentative sigh of relief for officials at the Federal Reserve as well as President Joe Biden's re-election team. Consumer prices rose 0.3% from March to April, down slightly from 0.4% the previous month. Measured year-over-year, inflation ticked down from 3.5% to 3.4%. And a measure of underlying inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, fell to the lowest level in three years. Inflation had been unexpectedly high in the first three months of this year after having steadily dropped in the second half of 2023.

Retail sales were unchanged in April from March as inflation and interest rates curb spending

NEW YORK (AP) -- Americans unexpectedly paused their spending in April from March as inflation continued to sting and elevated interest rates made taking on debt more burdensome. Retail sales were unchanged, coming in well below economists' expectations, and the figure followed a revised 0.6% pace in March, according to Commerce Department data released Wednesday. It rose 0.9% in February. That comes after sales fell 1.1% in January, dragged down in part by inclement weather. Excluding gas prices and auto sales, retail sales fell 0.1%.

Senators urge $32 billion in emergency spending on AI after finishing yearlong review

WASHINGTON (AP) -- A bipartisan group of four senators led by Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is recommending that Congress spend at least $32 billion over the next three years to develop artificial intelligence and also put safeguards around it. The group wrote in a new report released Wednesday that the U.S. needs to ""harness the opportunities and address the risks"" of the quickly developing technology. The group says they sometimes disagreed on the best paths forward, but that they eventually found consensus on policy recommendations included in the 33-page report because they felt that the stakes were so high.

Labor laws largely exclude nannies. Some are banding together to protect themselves

NEW YORK (AP) -- Nannies, housekeepers, and home care workers are excluded from many federal workplace protections in the United States, and the private, home-based nature of the work means abuse tends to happen behind closed doors. Domestic workers, who make less than half of what a typical worker makes and are disproportionately women and immigrant women, are especially vulnerable to workplace violations and discrimination, experts say. Even in the 11 states with laws on the books that protect domestic workers, those often go unenforced. But nannies across the nation are lobbying lawmakers for better protections and training their peers on how to exercise their rights.

Justice Department says Boeing violated deal that avoided prosecution after 737 Max crashes

WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department has determined that Boeing violated a settlement that allowed the company to avoid criminal prosecution after two deadly crashes involving its 737 Max aircraft. It is now up to the Justice Department to weigh whether to file charges against the aircraft maker. Glenn Leon, the head of the fraud section of the Justice Department's criminal division, says Boeing failed to make changes to prevent it from violating federal anti-fraud laws -- a condition of the 2021 settlement. It is not clear whether the government will prosecute the manufacturing giant. Prosecutors will tell the court no later than July 7 how they plan to proceed.

Billionaire Frank McCourt says he's putting together a consortium to buy TikTok

Billionaire businessman and real estate mogul Frank McCourt says he's putting together a consortium to purchase TikTok's U.S. business. The announcement posted Wednesday on the website of McCourt's Project Liberty initiative adds to the number of investors hoping to benefit from a new federal law that requires TikTok's China-based parent company to sell the popular platform or face a ban. Other investors, including former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, have expressed a desire to purchase TikTok. However, TikTok's parent company ByteDance has already said it's not planning to sell the platform. The Chinese government is unlikely to approve a sale, especially not one with the recommendation engine that powers the videos that populates users' feeds.

Stock market today: S&P 500 heads toward a record after inflation finally slows

NEW YORK (AP) -- U.S. stocks are rising toward records with hope that inflation is finally heading back in the right direction. The S&P 500 was 0.6% higher Wednesday and on track to beat its all-time high set in March. The Nasdaq composite was adding to its own record and up 0.7%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 206 points. A report showing a slowdown in inflation is raising expectations for the Federal Reserve to cut its main interest rate this year, pushing Treasury yields lower. But a stall in spending by U.S. households tired after years of high inflation is keeping the gains in check.

CNX plans $1.5B hydrogen fuels plant at Pittsburgh airport, but wants federal tax credit to build it

HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -- Natural gas producer CNX Resources says it plans to build a $1.5 billion facility at Pittsburgh's airport to make hydrogen-based fuels. But, in its plan unveiled Wednesday, it says it will only build it if President Joe Biden's administration allows coal mine methane to qualify for hydrogen production tax credits. Biden's administration is deciding how to tailor billions in tax credits. CNX said the facility would remove coal mine methane from the atmosphere and blend it with natural gas to produce hydrogen-based airline fuel. Climate change activists say producing hydrogen from fossil fuels, instead of from carbon-free electricity, would undermine the purpose of the hydrogen program to displace fossil fuels.

Slovakia plans to build a new nuclear reactor

BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) -- Slovakia's government approved a plan to build another nuclear reactor in a country that relies heavily on nuclear electricity generation. The government said Wednesday that a new reactor, with an expected output of 1,200 megawatts, is to be built at the Jaslovske Bohunice nuclear plant, where the utility Slovenske Elektrarne currently operates two nuclear units. Slovakia generates over 50% of its electricity at two nuclear plants. The decision reflects recent nuclear expansion in Central and Eastern Europe, where the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary are also planning new reactors.

The historic city marked the 104th anniversary of its union with Greece with a military and student parade that was attended by government and local officials as well as representatives of the Orthodox Church.

However, the raising of the Greek flag was the highlight of the day.

The capital of the Evros regional unit is the largest city in Greek Thrace and the region of Eastern Macedonia and Thrace, with a population of over 70,000 and is an important port and commercial center for northeastern Greece.

The turbulent modern history of Alexandroupolis

During the Russo-Turkish War (1877-1878), it was briefly captured by the Russians. Ottoman rule ended with the First Balkan War, when the city was captured by Bulgaria in 1912. In the Second Balkan War, Greece took control of the city. With the Treaty of Bucharest (10 August 1913), the city returned back to Bulgaria.

With the defeat of Bulgaria in World War I, the city came under Greek control for the second time. In 1920, the city was renamed to honor the King of Greece, Alexander. With the Treaty of Lausanne in 1923, Alexandroupolis became an official part of Greece.

A central attraction and symbol of the city is the Lighthouse (recognized as a cultural heritage monument in 2013) located on the city's promenade (Megalou Alexandrou Street).

It was built in 1850 and started operating in 1880, built on the western side of the city's harbor to facilitate the coasting of local sailors who traveled to the area of Hellespont.

It is on a cylindrical pedestal and is 27 meters from the average sea level and 18 meters from the ground, making it one of the tallest lighthouses in Greece. It operates with electricity and its distinctive feature is its light beam reaching 24 nautical miles (approximately 44 km) and three white blinks every 15 seconds.

Greek city becomes US, NATO and energy hub

The port of Alexandroupolis plays a vital role in the military presence of the US and NATO in Greece, especially since the Russian invasion of Ukraine. NATO and US forces use the Greek city as a transit and logistic spot for troops that move to central Europe for training and exercises.

In addition, Alexandroupoli is becoming an energy hub for the Balkans and Eastern Europe. The floating storage regasification unit (FSRU) at Alexandroupolis received the first shipment of liquefied natural gas (LNG) in February.

The FSRU is connected to the 28-kilometer-long high-pressure subsea and onshore gas transmission pipeline, which, once operational, will deliver natural gas to the Greek Transmission System (NNGTS) and onwards to the final consumers in Greece, Bulgaria, Romania, North Macedonia, Serbia and further to Moldova and Ukraine to the East and Hungary and Slovakia to the West.",greekreporter.com,news,GreekReporter.com,Tasos Kokkinidis,-0.1058823529411764,453473520,1,https://greekreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/largest-Greek-flag_Alexandroupoli_Credit-e-evros-TV.jpg,

Bratislava: Slovakia's government approved a plan on Wednesday to build another nuclear reactor in a country that relies heavily on nuclear electricity generation. The new reactor, with an expected output of 1,200 megawatts, is to be built at the Jaslovske Bohunice nuclear plant, where the utility Slovenske Elektrarne currently operates two nuclear units.

May 15 (Interfax) - Emergency power cuts may again be introduced for industrial consumers and households in Ukraine if electricity consumption grows during peak hours from 6:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m., Ukrainian media outlets said, citing a statement published by the Ukrenergo power grid operator on social media on Wednesday.

At the same time, the power supply reduction schedules for industrial enterprises, initially due to last throughout Wednesday, have been shortened and are now in effect from midnight to 10:00 a.m. and from 4:00 p.m. to midnight.

According to Ukrenergo, there is a considerable power shortage throughout the day due to today's drop in air temperatures. Emergency assistance from European Union countries was used to cover it from midnight to 7:00 a.m. on Wednesday. Ukraine also expects to import an all-time high of 23,692 MWh of electricity from Romania, Slovakia, Poland, Hungary and Moldova on Wednesday versus 21,070 MWh on Tuesday. Maximum capacity reaches 1,628 MW in certain hours, nearing the 1,700 MWh technical capacity for electricity imports by Ukraine and Moldova from Europe, it said.

Ukrenergo has called on consumers to use electricity sparingly throughout the day, especially in peak hours from 7:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. and from 6:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m., the company's press service told journalists.

YASNO electricity supplier CEO Sergei Kovalenko, in turn, said on social media that it is wrong to make businesses bear the brunt of the power shortages, because it is highly important to enable enterprises to continue to function and produce GDP.

A total of 418 populated localities across Ukraine remained without electricity for various reasons on Wednesday morning, Ukrenergo said.

As reported, Ukrenergo introduced emergency power cuts for industrial consumers and households on Tuesday evening and on Wednesday morning due to electricity shortages after power consumption grew following a drop in air temperatures. Almost day-to-day supply reduction schedules have been in effect for industrial enterprises since May 8. Power shortages have been covered by imports and daily lengthy emergency assistance from neighboring countries.",interfax.com,news,interfax.com,,-0.192156862745098,453470181,19,,eng-9567972

In a statement on Wednesday morning, Ukrenergo said it had ""implemented controlled emergency shutdowns for industrial and household consumers in all regions of Ukraine,"" adding that critical infrastructure was not affected. It later clarified that the restrictions lasted two to three hours and did not apply to the Kiev-controlled part of Russia's Kherson Region.

""The reason is a significant shortage of electricity in the system due to Russian shelling and an increase in consumption due to the cold weather,"" Ukrenergo said

The operator also warned the public that the blackouts would most likely be in the evening hours due to increased power consumption. In addition, there will be power limitation schedules throughout the day for industrial consumers on Wednesday, Ukrenergo noted.

This came after the operator introduced similar restrictions for industry on Tuesday, which were followed by controlled power cuts in the evening due to a spike in consumption.

To alleviate the pressure, Ukraine is importing energy from neighboring EU countries, including Romania, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, and Moldova, Ukrenergo added. A day earlier, the operator said its repair crews were making every effort to restore power, although in frontline regions the work is constantly hampered by air raid sirens.

The rolling blackouts come after Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmitry Kuleba admitted earlier this month that Russian strikes had damaged half of the country's energy system. The Ukrhydroenergo power generating company said last week that its hydroelectric facilities had suffered ""overwhelming damage.""

Meanwhile, Ukrainian Energy Minister German Galushchenko estimated the combined financial losses from Russian attacks at more than $1 billion, warning that the figure would continue to rise.

Moscow has ramped up strikes on Ukraine's military and energy infrastructure in recent weeks. The Russian Defense Ministry said last month that the strikes were in response to Kiev's attempts to target oil facilities in the country. Moscow reiterated that the attacks are only aimed at Ukrainian military targets and facilities that support their operations and never at the civilian population.",rt.com,news,RT,,-0.1686274509803921,453470163,1,https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2024.05/article/66449fa985f5402a30558023.jpg,eng-9567972

WASHINGTON (AP) -- It's perhaps the biggest question swirling around the U.S. economy right now: Is inflation stuck at an elevated level -- or will last year's steady decline resume sometime soon? On Wednesday, the government will issue the latest monthly inflation report, a set of figures that will be scrutinized by economists, Wall Street traders and Federal Reserve officials for any insight into that question. Analysts estimate that year-over-year inflation dipped from 3.5% in March to 3.4% in April. Measured from March to April, consumer prices are expected to have risen 0.4%, the same as in the previous month.

Senators urge $32 billion in emergency spending on AI after finishing yearlong review

WASHINGTON (AP) -- A bipartisan group of four senators led by Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is recommending that Congress spend at least $32 billion over the next three years to develop artificial intelligence and also put safeguards around it. The group wrote in a new report released Wednesday that the U.S. needs to ""harness the opportunities and address the risks"" of the quickly developing technology. The group says they sometimes disagreed on the best paths forward, but that they eventually found consensus on policy recommendations included in the 33-page report because they felt that the stakes were so high.

Labor laws largely exclude nannies. Some are banding together to protect themselves

NEW YORK (AP) -- Nannies, housekeepers, and home care workers are excluded from many federal workplace protections in the United States, and the private, home-based nature of the work means abuse tends to happen behind closed doors. Domestic workers, who make less than half of what a typical worker makes and are disproportionately women and immigrant women, are especially vulnerable to workplace violations and discrimination, experts say. Even in the 11 states with laws on the books that protect domestic workers, those often go unenforced. But nannies across the nation are lobbying lawmakers for better protections and training their peers on how to exercise their rights.

Justice Department says Boeing violated deal that avoided prosecution after 737 Max crashes

WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department has determined that Boeing violated a settlement that allowed the company to avoid criminal prosecution after two deadly crashes involving its 737 Max aircraft. It is now up to the Justice Department to weigh whether to file charges against the aircraft maker. Glenn Leon, the head of the fraud section of the Justice Department's criminal division, says Boeing failed to make changes to prevent it from violating federal anti-fraud laws -- a condition of the 2021 settlement. It is not clear whether the government will prosecute the manufacturing giant. Prosecutors will tell the court no later than July 7 how they plan to proceed.

CNX plans $1.5B hydrogen fuels plant at Pittsburgh airport, but wants federal tax credit to build it

HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -- Natural gas producer CNX Resources says it plans to build a $1.5 billion facility at Pittsburgh's airport to make hydrogen-based fuels. But, in its plan unveiled Wednesday, it says it will only build it if President Joe Biden's administration allows coal mine methane to qualify for hydrogen production tax credits. Biden's administration is deciding how to tailor billions in tax credits. CNX said the facility would remove coal mine methane from the atmosphere and blend it with natural gas to produce hydrogen-based airline fuel. Climate change activists say producing hydrogen from fossil fuels, instead of from carbon-free electricity, would undermine the purpose of the hydrogen program to displace fossil fuels.

Stock market today: Global markets follow Wall Street higher ahead of key inflation update

HONG KONG (AP) -- World stocks have advanced after a rally on Wall Street took the Nasdaq composite to a record high. U.S. futures were lower while oil prices gained.

Slovakia plans to build a new nuclear reactor

BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) -- Slovakia's government approved a plan to build another nuclear reactor in a country that relies heavily on nuclear electricity generation. The government said Wednesday that a new reactor, with an expected output of 1,200 megawatts, is to be built at the Jaslovske Bohunice nuclear plant, where the utility Slovenske Elektrarne currently operates two nuclear units. Slovakia generates over 50% of its electricity at two nuclear plants. The decision reflects recent nuclear expansion in Central and Eastern Europe, where the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary are also planning new reactors.

Wholesale price increases accelerated in April as inflation remains sticky

WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. wholesale prices rose sharply last month, a sign that stubbornly high inflation may persist after three elevated readings in consumer prices to start the year. The Labor Department said Tuesday that its producer price index -- which tracks price changes before they reach consumers -- climbed 0.5% from March to April, after it dipped 0.1% the previous month. Measured year over year, producer prices rose by 2.2% in April, up from 1.8% in March and the biggest increase in a year.

Fed's Powell downplays potential for a rate hike despite higher price pressures

WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday that the central bank is unlikely to raise its key interest rate in response to signs of stubborn inflation and underscored his view that price increases would soon start to cool again. Yet Powell, during a panel discussion in Amsterdam, said his confidence that inflation will ease ""is not as high as it was"" because price increases have been persistently hot in the first three months of this year. Powell stressed that the Fed's preferred approach was to keep its benchmark rate at its current two-decade peak rather than increase it.

WASHINGTON (AP) -- It's perhaps the biggest question swirling around the U.S. economy right now: Is inflation stuck at an elevated level -- or will last year's steady decline resume sometime soon? On Wednesday, the government will issue the latest monthly inflation report, a set of figures that will be scrutinized by economists, Wall Street traders and Federal Reserve officials for any insight into that question. Analysts estimate that year-over-year inflation dipped from 3.5% in March to 3.4% in April. Measured from March to April, consumer prices are expected to have risen 0.4%, the same as in the previous month.

Senators urge $32 billion in emergency spending on AI after finishing yearlong review

WASHINGTON (AP) -- A bipartisan group of four senators led by Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is recommending that Congress spend at least $32 billion over the next three years to develop artificial intelligence and also put safeguards around it. The group wrote in a new report released Wednesday that the U.S. needs to ""harness the opportunities and address the risks"" of the quickly developing technology. The group says they sometimes disagreed on the best paths forward, but that they eventually found consensus on policy recommendations included in the 33-page report because they felt that the stakes were so high.

Labor laws largely exclude nannies. Some are banding together to protect themselves

NEW YORK (AP) -- Nannies, housekeepers, and home care workers are excluded from many federal workplace protections in the United States, and the private, home-based nature of the work means abuse tends to happen behind closed doors. Domestic workers, who make less than half of what a typical worker makes and are disproportionately women and immigrant women, are especially vulnerable to workplace violations and discrimination, experts say. Even in the 11 states with laws on the books that protect domestic workers, those often go unenforced. But nannies across the nation are lobbying lawmakers for better protections and training their peers on how to exercise their rights.

Justice Department says Boeing violated deal that avoided prosecution after 737 Max crashes

WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department has determined that Boeing violated a settlement that allowed the company to avoid criminal prosecution after two deadly crashes involving its 737 Max aircraft. It is now up to the Justice Department to weigh whether to file charges against the aircraft maker. Glenn Leon, the head of the fraud section of the Justice Department's criminal division, says Boeing failed to make changes to prevent it from violating federal anti-fraud laws -- a condition of the 2021 settlement. It is not clear whether the government will prosecute the manufacturing giant. Prosecutors will tell the court no later than July 7 how they plan to proceed.

""From 06:00, consumption increased again due to the decrease in temperature. The available volumes of imports, emergency aid, and consumption restrictions were not enough to overcome it. Therefore, from 6:40 a.m. to 08:30 a.m., the Ukrenergo Dispatch Center implemented controlled emergency shutdowns for industrial and household consumers in all regions of Ukraine, with the exception of the Kherson region. As of 9:30 a.m., emergency shutdowns have been canceled, power supply to consumers has been restored,"" the message says.

Emergency shutdowns are possible

According to ""Ukrenergo"", if consumption increases in the evening hours of maximum consumption from 06:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m., ""Ukrenergo"" predicts the introduction of emergency shutdowns of household and industrial consumers.

Also today from midnight to 10:00 a.m. and from 04:00 to 12:00 p.m. there will be capacity limitation schedules for industrial consumers.

Yesterday, May 14, to overcome the deficit in the energy system, at the request of ""Ukrenergo"" the emergency supply of electricity to Ukraine was activated from 00:00 to 07:00 a.m. and from 11:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. from the power systems of Romania, Poland, and Slovakia. Also, from 11:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m., at the request of the Polish power system operator, the Ukrainian power system received excess electricity.

Today emergency aid from EU countries was applied from 00:00 to 07:00 a.m..

It is also noted that on the morning of May 15, 418 settlements were cut off.

Due to hostilities, there are new blackouts in the Donetsk, Sumy, and Kharkiv regions.

As a reminder, on May 14, from 09:00 p.m. to 00:00, controlled emergency power outages were implemented in all regions of Ukraine due to a significant shortage of electricity in the system. Controlled emergency shutdowns were also applied throughout Ukraine on the morning of May 15.",censor.net,news,Ð¦ÐµÐ½Ð·Ð¾Ñ.ÐÐÐ¢,,-0.1764705882352942,453461295,10,https://images.cnscdn.com/a/6/d/5/a6d5929cf21fe95d2c1ffd0bbaecface/1024x538.jpg,eng-9567972

Ukrenergo and the energy ministry have said negotiations on the increase are ongoing.

SAVING POWER

Russian missile and drone attacks on Ukraine's energy sector have intensified since March, dealing significant damage and causing blackouts in many regions.

The attacks have caused more than $1 billion of damage to the sector, said Ukrainian energy minister German Galushchenko, and led to the loss of 8,000 Mwh of generating capacity from the energy system.

Ukraine consumes up to 19,000 Mwh at peak of consumption in winter.

Ukraine's DTEK said this week it lost about 90% of its power generation capacity due to Russian missile attacks in recent weeks.

The ministry asked residents and industries to reduce power consumption ""to reduce the load on the power system, as well as to use imports as much as possible to ensure that outages are avoided and the power system is more resilient.""

Ukrenergo imposed emergency power cuts this morning but then cancelled restrictions.

The EU's gross domestic product (GDP) remained stable, registering just a small increase (0.2% in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared with the same quarter of 2022).

This information comes from data on quarterly estimates for greenhouse gas emissions by economic activity published by Eurostat today. Quarterly estimates of greenhouse gas emissions complement quarterly socio-economic data, such as GDP or employment. This article presents a handful of findings from the more detailed Statistics Explained article on quarterly greenhouse gas emissions.

In the fourth quarter of 2023, the economic sectors responsible for the largest reductions compared with the fourth quarter of 2022 were electricity and gas supply (- 17.2%) and manufacturing (-3.1%). Emissions by households remained almost stable.

In the fourth quarter of 2023, greenhouse gas emissions are estimated to have decreased in 22 EU countries, when compared with the same quarter of 2022.

The largest reductions in greenhouse gases are estimated for Estonia (-23.0%), Bulgaria (-17.0%) and Finland (-9.0%).

Out of the 22 EU members that are estimated to have decreased their emissions, 10 also recorded a decline in their GDP (Estonia, Finland, Sweden, Germany, Austria, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, The Netherlands and Luxembourg). Hungary maintained the GDP at the same level while decreasing emissions. The other 11 EU countries (Bulgaria, Belgium, Czechia, Denmark, Italy, Spain, France, Poland, Portugal, Romania and Croatia) are estimated to have managed to decrease emissions while growing their GDP.

Increases in emissions are estimated for Malta (+7.7%), Slovenia (+5.6%), Cyprus (+2.3%), Slovakia (1.7%) and Greece (+0.3%).

Russian attacks and unseasonably cold weather have caused a ""significant capacity deficit"" in Ukraine's power system, leading to blackouts and energy restrictions for consumers across the country, the Energy Ministry reported on May 15.

Since the start of 2024, Russia has launched five large-scale attacks against Ukraine's energy infrastructure, causing over $1 billion worth of damage.

The Energy Ministry said that the shortage, which is expected to continue during the evening, caused emergency power cuts on the morning of May 15 and the previous evening.

Ukraine received an emergency supply of electricity over the past day from neighboring Poland, Romania, and Slovakia, the Energy Ministry said.

The ministry asked consumers to reduce the use of energy-intensive appliances during the peak evening hours.

Ukrenergo, Ukraine's state-owned energy operator, warned on the evening of May 14 that restrictions on energy supply had been introduced due to a ""significant power shortage.""

Ukrenergo said that the restrictions on industrial energy consumers will continue for the rest of the day, but added that the supply of power to critical infrastructure will not be restricted.

Russia carried out the last large-scale attack overnight on May 8, targeting energy infrastructure in central and western regions. An attack in April destroyed the Trypillia Thermal Power Plant, the main electricity supplier to Kyiv, Zhytomyr, and Cherkasy oblasts.

Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko warned on May 13 that as a result of the attacks, Ukraine may not only face not only a ""difficult winter,"" but also issues with the electricity supply this summer.

This was reported by the press service of the ECU, noting that according to the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine Resolution No. 1127 of October 27, 2023, in the case of planned energy supply restrictions, such measures do not apply to enterprises that use imported electricity.

For this, the share of imported electricity in a specific hour of consumption should be at least 30% (in the period from October to April - at least 50%).

In connection with the shortage of electricity in the power system, EKU is currently negotiating with large industrial consumers regarding the conclusion of contracts for targeted imports.

In addition, EKU continues to increase the volume of electricity imports from EU countries to support the energy system. In May, the company started importing electricity from Poland, thus expanding the list of supplier countries to four, including Romania, Slovakia and Hungary.

According to NEC ""Ukrenergo"", the volume of electricity imports from Europe registered a record growth. Over the past two days, in particular on May 13, EKU imported the largest daily amount of electricity for the entire period of its activity.

However, due to a significant shortage of electricity, the system operator is forced to continue using capacity limitation schedules for industrial consumers. Today, May 14, the capacity limit schedules will be in effect from 4:00 PM to 7:00 AM on May 15.

""EKU provides Ukrainian enterprises with imported electricity, helping them to avoid losses due to interruptions in energy supply,"" noted EKU General Director Vitaly Butenko.",e-news.com.ua,news,Elcomart,,0.1137254901960785,453451635,28,http://e-news.com.ua/img/news%2F2024%2F05%2F2%5B418418%5D%28100x60%29.jpeg,eng-9567972

Everything indicates that the European Central Bank (ECB) will lower interest rates at the next meeting in June. This has meant that some banks have anticipated this movement and have been cutting the profitability of the deposits they offered, although slightly. In fact, it is now practically impossible to find deposits above 4% APR.

If this movement is confirmed, ""banks could reduce the returns on the fixed terms they sell,"" they point out from the financial comparator HelpMyCash. However, that does not mean that ""there are still attractive offers on deposits, which exceed 3.5% APR,"" explain the experts, who recommend ""that if you are interested in taking out a deposit, do so as soon as possible to take advantage of the remunerations that ""they offer.""

HelpMyCash has selected the best options within the best deposits of the moment so that the most conservative savers can take advantage of them.

For those looking for a deposit with a longer term and a juicy remuneration, they have alternatives that exceed 3.50% APR. In other words, they can be the solution for anyone who wants to take advantage of these interests.

Here the Privatbanka 1-year Deposit stands out, at 3.70% APR, insured by the FGD of Slovakia and which allows you to invest a minimum of 5,000 euros. And if the incentive of your interest was not enough, it is currently giving new customers up to 100 euros depending on the amount contracted if this is their first savings product with Raisin.

Other options are Novum Bank's one-year fixed terms, which offers a 3.60% APR, as well as Banca Progetto and Haitong, all of which require a minimum deposit of 10,000 euros. All of them have the guarantee of the Deposit Guarantee Fund of the respective country.

Currently, if you are looking for high profitability without committing for a long time, a short-term deposit is the most interesting alternative. Precisely, those with terms of three months are the most profitable, such as the MyInvestor Deposit at 4% APR. Of course, it requires a minimum investment of 10,000 euros and, in addition, investing 150 euros in your robo-advisor.

Another option is the 3-month Facto Deposit. In this case, although the remuneration is 3.80% APR, the minimum capital to hire it falls to 5,000 euros. In both cases they have the protection of the Spanish and Italian Deposit Guarantee Fund respectively, which protects up to 100,000 euros per holder and account.

Remunerated accounts can also be an alternative. ""These accounts have been positioned, and it seems that they will continue to do so in the coming months, as an ideal product for both savings and everyday use,"" HelpMyCash highlights.

Unlike deposits, the money invested is always available and they offer additional benefits such as cashback on purchases, return of receipts or additional free products.

The Trade Republic Savings Account offers a 4% APR for balances of up to 50,000 euros and with extra benefits such as 1% cashback on your debit card. On the other hand, the Revolut Flexible Account, which is a Monetary Fund, promises an expected return of up to 3.97%, with a very low risk index, and even if you want to enter the world of investment , allows you to do it from just one euro.

The Sabadell Online Account, for its part, is marketed with a return of 6% TIN during the first three months, followed by a 2% TIN (3.06% APR) for the first 20,000 euros, with the possibility of obtaining up to 600 gross euros the first year. In addition, it returns 3% on electricity and gas bills and offers free debit and credit cards.

Finally, the Welcome Evo Smart Account offers a profitability of 2.85% APR for balances of up to 30,000 euros, without commissions or conditions, with the extra option of opening a deposit at the same interest, withdrawing money abroad at no cost and cashback on purchases.",usanews.net,news,USANews Press Release Network,,0.2941176470588236,453435027,1,https://www.usanews.net/images/haberler/2024/05/_525d6.png,

The Kyiv Independent is reposting it with permission.

Cabinet appoints new acting CEO for Ukrspyrt. On May 3, Stanislav Banchuk was appointed to the position. On May 6, Ukrspyrt confirmed Banchuk's appointment, with no further details.

Banchuk previously had a legal practice in Kyiv. A person by that name was deputy regional prosecutor of Chernivtsi Oblast until 2014 according to Ekonomichna Pravda (EP).

According to YouControl, Banchuk founded Standart Law Firm LLC, Gaztekhkom LLC, Novitni Energetychni Systemy LLC, P.E.G.O. Trading House, Voga Resources LLC, and SpetsOil LLC, which specialize in oil and gas trading.

On March 1, Vitaliy Koval, head of the State Property Fund of Ukraine (SPFU), wrote that the privatization of distilleries was in the home stretch, with the fund planning to privatize 17 more Ukrspyrt facilities in 2024.

According to Koval, the SPFU had run 115 online auctions of Ukrspyrt assets and 54 auctions had resulted in sales. The sum of prices went from Hr 1.25 billion ($31.5 million) to Hr 3.01 billion ($75.9 million) during the auctions.

As we wrote in January 2022 in Issue 63, acting CEO of Ukrspyrt Serhiy Bleskun resigned. After that, the Cabinet of Ministers temporarily assigned Vitaliy Zhadobin as the new acting CEO.

On Nov. 11, 2022, the Cabinet appointed Ivan Kucherenko as Ukrspyrt's new acting CEO.

Ukrspyrt last had a permanent CEO in 2014, and the company has since been led by various ""acting"" CEOs.

Detention order issued for SPFU's former head who allegedly embezzled millions. On May 8, the High Anti-Corruption Court (HACC) ordered detention for the former head of the SPFU, Dmytro Sennychenko, who is wanted internationally.

According to the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office (SAPO), Sennychenko headed a criminal group that embezzled more than Hr 500 million ($12.6 million) from state-owned enterprises, including Odesa Portside Plant (OPZ) and United Mining and Chemical Company (UMCC), and laundered Hr 10 billion ($252 million) in 2019-2021.

As we reported in Issue 80, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) and SAPO said that they exposed a criminal group run by Sennychenko in March 2023. See Issue 80 for more detail.

Sennychenko headed the SPFU from September 2019 to February 2022. He filed his resignation letter in November 2021, but the Verkhovna Rada only approved his resignation on Feb. 17, 2022.

As we wrote in Issue 83, the suspects in this case, including Sennychenko, were placed on the wanted list in April 2023.

In November 2023, we wrote that NABU and SAPO updated suspicions against all members of the criminal group allegedly led by Sennychenko. They are now also suspected of legalizing criminal proceeds of over Hr 10 billion ($252 million).

See our Issues 80, 83, and 114 for more detail on this case.

Ukrainian energy facilities struck again. On May 8, the Energy Ministry reported that Russia damaged Ukraine's energy infrastructure, including transmission facilities in Poltava, Kirovohrad, Zaporizhzhia, Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk, and Vinnytsia oblasts.

There were no casualties or injuries. Power engineers worked together with the State Emergency Service to eliminate the consequences, the ministry added.

In addition to damage to generation infrastructure, equipment at one of Ukrenergo's facilities in central Ukraine was also damaged, the company said.

Due to the power shortages caused by the massive attack, Ukrenergo was forced to impose restrictions on power supply to industry and businesses during evening peak hours.

Ukrenergo also imports electricity from Romania, Slovakia, Poland, Hungary, and Moldova, but according to the company's CEO Volodymyr Kudrytskyi, this is not enough to cover the deficit.

Rinat Akhmetov's DTEK, Ukraine's largest private energy holding, reported that Russia attacked three of its thermal power plants again, severely damaging equipment.

On May 9, Ukrhydroenergo reported that two hydroelectric power plants (HPPs) were out of operation due to the attack. [The company has a total of ten HPPs.

""Today, all hydroelectric power generation has suffered crucial damages. The destroyed equipment requires considerable efforts to repair and restore and significant financial resources,"" the company said.

On June 6, Ukrhydroenergo reported that the Kakhovka HPP was destroyed beyond restoration after the Russians set off a massive explosion in the engine room. See our Issue 91 for more detail.

Russian missiles attacked Ukraine's largest HPP, the Dnipro HPP in Zaporizhzhia, on March 22. See Issue 124 for more detail.

During another missile attack, on March 29, the Kaniv and Dniester HPPs were deliberately targeted by Russian forces. See Issue 125 for more detail.

After every Russian mass missile attack on Ukraine's vital infrastructure, emergency outages take place, lasting for days due to the ongoing repair works. During such outages, people in Ukraine are often left without electricity, heating, water supply, or access to mobile phone networks.

Ukraine faced the largest Russian missile and drone attack on its energy facilities on March 22. See Issue 124 for more detail.

A week later, Ukrenergo faced yet another Russian missile and drone attack. See more in Issue 125.

On April 11, Ukraine faced the third Russian attack on its energy facilities in one month. The Trypillia Thermal Power Plant (TPP) in Kyiv oblast was destroyed. See Issue 127 for detail.

On April 27, Ukraine faced another Russian attack on its energy infrastructure. See Issue 129 for more.

The Cabinet keeps low electricity tariffs for households until the end of May 2024. On April 26, the Cabinet of Ministers extended public service obligations (PSOs) for another month, from April 30 - May 31. The price for households will remain Hr 2.64 ($0.07) per kWh.

Energoatom and Ukrhydroenergo were granted the right to sell electricity on market terms from Oct. 1, 2021. Under the new PSO model, the proceeds were used to compensate electricity providers for the difference between the regulated household tariffs (at that time, Hr 1.44/kWh and Hr 1.68/kWh depending on the volume of consumption) and market prices.

Since October 2021, the Cabinet of Ministers has repeatedly extended the PSO mechanism to keep electricity tariffs for households unchanged until the end of the previous heating season. The PSO mechanism was in place until April 30, 2023.

On May 30, 2023, the Cabinet approved an increase in the electricity tariff for households to Hr 2.64/kWh from June 1, 2023.

As we reported in Issue 115, in January, the PSO model had been extended until April 30. The government made this decision to reduce the financial burden on households due to the difficult economic situation caused by the full-scale war. As a result, the electricity price for households would continue to be Hr 2.64 per kWh.

According to Deputy Energy Minister Svitlana Hrynchuk, the Cabinet of Ministers is discussing the possibility of raising electricity tariffs, as resources are needed for the next heating season. No decision has been made yet, she said.

As we reported in our earlier issues, the low electricity tariff has consistently caused financial challenges for Ukrainian energy SOEs:

As we wrote in April, Naftogaz left the current gas tariff for households unchanged for at least another year. See Issue 129 for detail.

Ukrenergo reports a Hr 400 million profit in 2023 (audited); financial statements on the LSE website. On May 3, Ukrenergo reported its financial results for 2023, ending the year with a revenue of Hr 83 billion ($2.1 billion).

The company's financial statements, including the independent auditor's report, were published on the website of the London Stock Exchange (LSE).

On May 10, the company also held a briefing where CEO Volodymyr Kudrytskyi commented on Ukrenergo's key indicators in 2023.

The company made a profit of Hr 377 million ($9.5 million) in 2023. In 2022, Ukrenergo posted a loss of Hr 6 billion ($151 million)

Despite the Russian shelling of the infrastructure and the difficult situation in the energy system, the value of Ukrenergo's assets increased by almost Hr 45 billion ($1.1 billion), Kudrytskyi said.

In addition, the company paid Hr 2.4 billion ($60 million) in taxes and dividends to the state in 2023.

Kudrytskyi also said that the company paid off Hr 24 billion ($605 million) in debts in 2023 and the first quarter of 2024.

As we wrote in November 2023, the electricity market had a chain of debts of ""everyone to everyone"" worth Hr 60 billion ($1.5 billion). See Issue 110 for more detail.

German government grants 45 million euros ($48.7 million) to restore and protect energy infrastructure. On May 9, Ukrenergo signed an agreement with the German Development Bank KfW.

According to Ukrenergo's CEO Volodymyr Kudrytskyi, this will pay for a high-voltage line that will increase the stability of Ukraine's connection to the European grid. The aid will also pay for high-voltage equipment and restoring facilities in central Ukraine after Russian attacks.

In total, with KfW's support, Ukrenergo has attracted more than 177 million euros ($191 million) in loans and grants for the restoration and development of the electricity transmission network since Russia's invasion, the company added.

As we reported in Issue 128, Ukrenergo received nearly 1 million euros ($1.1 million) worth of energy equipment from German partners.

Naftogaz Group says its 2023 audited net profit is Hr 23 billion; financial statements not yet available. On May 7, Naftogaz Group reported that it made Hr 23.1 billion ($583 million) in consolidated net profit in 2023, a significant rebound from its Hr 79.1 billion ($1.9 billion) loss in 2022.

The company said that its consolidated financial statements were confirmed by an independent auditor, approved by the supervisory board on May 3, and sent to the Cabinet for approval.

The financial statements were not publicly available at the time of writing.

Note that the law on the functioning of the financial sector during martial law allows, in particular, joint-stock companies not to publish financial statements.

In pursuance of this law, the National Securities and Stock Market Commission (NSSMC), as a regulator, adopted a decision according to which joint-stock companies must disclose their annual and interim information (which includes financial statements) for 2021-2023 during 90 days after the end of martial law.

Until this provision of the above law is lifted, state-owned joint-stock companies, such as Naftogaz, Ukrnafta, and others, will have a legal ground not to disclose their financial statements.

Under normal circumstances, according to the NSSMC's disclosure regulation, joint-stock companies must disclose annual financial statements for 2023 as part of their annual disclosure by April 30.

At the same time, the law does not prevent such disclosure (including financial statements) by SOEs, as this would be customarily done in best corporate governance practice.

We are not aware of any objective reasons, including those related to martial law, for the above exemption to continue to exist. The lack of annual reports leads to opaqueness of SOEs, including making it impossible to analyze or understand their performance.

When SOEs or their management report selected financial indicators or trends, no objective analysis of such reports or SOEs' performance altogether is possible.

Countries with developed capital markets have rules regulating the disclosure of sensitive (insider) information by public companies. Among other things, shareholders, other investors, or the public may not be misled by selective or delayed disclosure of such information.

The profitability of the business lines was driven by significantly improved financial results of the Group's companies, Naftogaz added without providing any details.

The company also said that most of the profit will go into dividends to the state. The Cabinet set the individual dividend pay-out ratio for Naftogaz at 95%. See SOE Weekly's Issue 118.

It is also unclear whether or how Ukrnafta's financial performance is incorporated in Naftogaz's financial statements.

As we reported in Issue 121, Ukrnafta is to pay the state a total of Hr 8 billion ($202 million) in dividends for 2023. Ukrnafta's audited financial statements for 2022 or 2023 were also not available at the time of writing.

Meanwhile, the former CEO of the Gas Transmission System Operator of Ukraine (GTSOU) Serhiy Makogon questioned the data. He said that buffer gas was Naftogaz's major source of profit in the first six months of 2023, according to the company's (unaudited) reporting for that period.

Apparently, this means that Naftogaz was now able to sell the buffer gas from underground storages, which it could not sell earlier.

Buffer gas is the volume of gas that is necessary to ensure the stable operation of underground storages, including maintaining the necessary pressure that allows normal gas take-off.

Naftogaz CEO interviewed. Naftogaz CEO Oleksiy Chernyshov spoke to Forbes Ukraine this week. We selected key segments:

On Naftogaz's financial performance in 2023 and forecasts for 2024:

As we reported in Issue 126, Ukrnafta earned almost Hr 24 billion ($605 million) in net profit in 2023.

It is unclear how Ukrnafta's dividends would be paid to the state and Naftogaz; see previous item.

As a result of the attack, the tracks at Kherson railway station were damaged, and the movement of Train No. 121/122 (Kyiv-Kherson-Kyiv) was temporarily restricted. Later that day, railway workers completed repairs to the track damaged by the shelling, the company said.

As we reported earlier, Ukrzaliznytsia's civilian infrastructure in and around Dnipro was also shelled by Russian troops on April 19. See Issue 128 for more detail.

Confiscated PentoPack Plant up for auction at Hr 203 million ($5.1 million), the State Property Fund's (SPFU) press office reported on May 6. It was confiscated from Russian-Greek businessman Ivan Savvidi.

The online auction is scheduled for May 31.

According to the SPFU, PentoPack is one of the leading producers of packaging for meats and sausages. It produces multilayer synthetic shrink wrap using modern technologies, including printing with UV, water, and alcohol inks.

PentoPack's products are used in more than thirty countries around the world. In Ukraine, the company does business with Rud, Globino, and Myasna Gildiya.

PentoPack retained 193 jobs and has no wage or state budget arrears. The company plans to enter new markets for packaging materials for the dairy industry, fish processing, and animal feed packaging, the SPFU added.

""This is an extremely attractive investment asset. It is not just about production facilities, but about a well-established profitable business in a promising segment of the food industry. The new owner would have all the opportunities for further growth and development,"" SPFU head Vitaliy Koval said.

As we reported in Issue 122, the SPFU declared its privatization plans for PentoPack in early March.

Ukrnafta and ARMA seek permission to manage Tatneft's assets. On May 6, Ukrnafta and the Asset Recovery and Management Agency (ARMA), applied for a merger clearance to manage Russian Tatneft Group's assets in Poltava and Kharkiv oblasts. These include petrol stations, oil depots, and other commercial property - a total of 110 units.

Most of them are in rundown condition, and some petrol stations have been destroyed, and they need to be rebuilt from scratch, Ukrnafta said. As of today, about 15 of the 70 Tatneft petrol stations are operational. The situation is similar with idle oil depots, Ukrnafta added.

ARMA declared its plans to transfer Tatneft filling stations to Ukrnafta's management ten months ago (see Issue 99), and the Cabinet transferred them on Aug. 15, 2023 (see Issue 100).

It is unclear why ARMA and Ukrnafta had not applied for merger clearance earlier, and how the assets have been maintained in the meantime.

Ukrnafta said that it would assess these assets on a case-by-case basis to calculate the required level of investment and the timing of their return.

ARMA and Ukrnafta are finalizing the asset management agreement.

As we reported earlier, Ukrnafta also manages the assets of the Glusco group. On March 14, the Antimonopoly Committee of Ukraine allowed Ukrnafta to take over the management of Glusco's assets - see Issue 123. On March 15, Ukrnafta and ARMA said that they signed acts of acceptance for the transfer of Glusco assets - see Issue 124.

May 14 (Interfax) - A total of 421 communities across Ukraine were cut off from power supply for various reasons as of the morning of May 14, Ukrainian media have reported with reference to the national power grid operator Ukrenergo's social media post.

Power supply restrictions on industrial consumers will be applied from 4:00 p.m. May 14 to 7:00 a.m. May 15, it said.

""Consumption restriction is an essential measure to maintain stable power system operations,"" Ukrenergo said.

The day before, restrictions were expected to be applied starting from 5:00 p.m.

Consumption in the national energy system is growing as the temperature dropped, Ukrenergo said. In particular, consumption grew 4.5% as of 9:30 a.m. on Tuesday from the same time on Monday, and the consumption peak on Monday evening was 4% higher than that on the previous working day, May 10, it said.

""Considerable electricity shortage persists in the energy system for most of the day,"" Ukrenergo said.

To cover shortage in the power system, emergency power supplies to Ukraine from the Romanian, Polish, and Slovak energy systems were activated at Ukrenergo's request from 0:01 a.m. to 7:00 a.m. and from 10:00 a.m. to 11:59 p.m. on May 13. Ukraine also accepted emergency assistance from European Union countries from 0:01 a.m. to 7:00 a.m. on May 14.

On Tuesday, Ukraine is expected to import a total of 21,072 MWh of electricity from Romania, Slovakia, Poland, Hungary, and Moldova, with transmission capacity reaching 1,463 MW during certain hours.

The ministry said seven drones and four guided missiles were shot down over Russia-occupied Crimea, eight drones were destroyed over Kursk and four drones were intercepted over the Lipetsk region.

The focus of the Ukrainian attack was the Belgorod region, which borders Ukraine. The Russian defense ministry said it destroyed 12 drones and 12 guided missiles over Belgorod.

The attack in Belgorod came a day after a Ukrainian missile attack killed at least 15 people and injured more than 30 others, the regional governor said Monday.

Ukrainian energy

Ukraine's energy ministry said Monday it planned to import 19,484 megawatt hours of electricity, which would break a record set in late March, in response to the mounting damage Russian attacks have inflicted on the country's power grid.

The imports are coming from multiple allies, including Poland, Romania and Slovakia.

German Galushchenko, Ukraine's energy minister, urged consumers Monday to reduce their energy use, citing significant losses in generating capacity due to Russian attacks.

During the past week, those attacks have included damage to three Ukrainian thermal power plants.

Galushchenko also cautioned that people should begin preparing for what could be a difficult winter.

Kharkiv fighting

More than 4,000 people have fled from areas around Ukraine's northeastern Kharkiv region since Friday, when Russia launched a surprise counteroffensive, according to regional governor Oleg Syniehubov.

Using artillery and mortar fire, Russian forces have been pounding towns and villages in the area.

At least one Ukrainian unit has withdrawn from the Kharkiv region as Russian forces take over areas in the so-called contested ""gray zones"" along the Russian border.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Sunday battles were raging across parts of the border in the Kharkiv region, where thousands were displaced after a Russian offensive.

Factors Influencing the Market

Increased awareness of the harmful impact of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions on the environment will drive the global expansion of biomass-producing plants. The production of biogas fuel helps to eliminate the problem of dumpsites and landfills. As a result, it will benefit the global biogas industry.

The market is likely to emerge as an alternative to traditional fuels such as diesel and petrol, providing considerable prospects for future growth. In 2019, nearly 220 million kWh of electricity was developed through biogas. Apart from that, around 1 billion kWh of electricity was produced.

Growth in the number of biogas applications will contribute to the growth of the global biogas market during the study period. Further, the rising demand for biofuel from automobiles will also benefit the global biogas market during the study period. On the contrary, high installation costs associated with biogas may limit the growth of the market.

The growing urban population and rising disposable income will also be opportunistic for the global biogas market during the analysis period.

Regional Analysis

The Asia-Pacific biogas market is forecast to hold the highest market share, owing to the large population of the region. Europe is forecast to hold the second-largest share due to stringent government regulations aimed at controlling carbon emissions. Germany, Italy, France, and Switzerland will emerge as the large biogas-producing countries during the analysis time frame. Apart from that, other countries like Belgium, Slovakia, Hungary, and the Czech Republic are also increasing biogas production levels, which will contribute to the growth of the market. The rapid industrial growth and rising awareness of the benefits of renewable energy will drive this regional market forward.

The ministry said seven drones and four guided missiles were shot down over Russia-occupied Crimea, eight drones were destroyed over Kursk and four drones were intercepted over the Lipetsk region.

The focus of the Ukrainian attack was the Belgorod region, which borders Ukraine. The Russian defense ministry said it destroyed 12 drones and 12 guided missiles over Belgorod.

The attack in Belgorod came a day after a Ukrainian missile attack killed at least 15 people and injured more than 30 others, the regional governor said Monday.

Ukrainian energy

Ukraine's energy ministry said Monday it planned to import 19,484 megawatt hours of electricity, which would break a record set in late March, in response to the mounting damage Russian attacks have inflicted on the country's power grid.

The imports are coming from multiple allies, including Poland, Romania and Slovakia.

German Galushchenko, Ukraine's energy minister, urged consumers Monday to reduce their energy use, citing significant losses in generating capacity due to Russian attacks.

During the past week, those attacks have included damage to three Ukrainian thermal power plants.

Galushchenko also cautioned that people should begin preparing for what could be a difficult winter.

Kharkiv fighting

More than 4,000 people have fled from areas around Ukraine's northeastern Kharkiv region since Friday, when Russia launched a surprise counteroffensive, according to regional governor Oleg Syniehubov.

Using artillery and mortar fire, Russian forces have been pounding towns and villages in the area.

At least one Ukrainian unit has withdrawn from the Kharkiv region as Russian forces take over areas in the so-called contested ""gray zones"" along the Russian border.

By collaborating with Emobility Solutions, GreenWay, and Petrol who share our vision of a future characterized by emission-free mobility, we are poised to bring this shared vision to fruition.""

In total, the partners plan to invest 130 million euros in high-power charging infrastructure, with the European Union providing a total grant of 34.45 million euros. The project is due to be completed by October 2026.

The Cross-E installations will adhere to the European Commission's Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation (AFIR), which guarantees open access to charging infrastructure. All sites will therefore be accessible to the public 24/7 and will support roaming and freely accessible payment methods such as NFC, credit cards and app-based payments. The installation of charging stations specifically for heavy-duty commercial vehicles in selected markets will also provide insights for a broader installation in all project partners and countries.

Janos Ungar, Chief Executive Officer of Emobility Solutions, added: ""We believe that regional CEF projects like CROSS-E are the foundations towards a green, sustainable and reliable zero emission road transportation. Emobility Solutions has a decade of experience in European electric mobility infrastructure development, and it is an honour being able to represent Hungary in this cooperation, as we know that still a lot of work must be done to increase the number of high-power chargers along the highways, while maximising the utilization of the renewable energy. With the CROSS-E project our aim is to showcase best practices for developing high-power charging HUBs in a smart way, with minimum dependence on the grid by utilizing local PV production and energy storage solutions.""",electrive.com,news,electrive.com,,0.2784313725490195,453308309,1,https://www.electrive.com/media/2024/05/allego-cross-border-electric-charging-afif-cross-e.jpeg,eng-9560429

Bart Biebuyck, CEO of Green Energy Park with over 20 years of experience in the hydrogen industry, discusses how his company will do things differently.

Hydrogen is a somewhat elusive molecule to be used as fuel. While it is an extremely efficient and emissionless fuel, the sticking point has been the lack of infrastructure to support it, i.e. industries using hydrogen fuel, amount being produced, etc., as well as the emissions created in its production.

The Innovation Platform's Matt Brundrett sat down with Bart Biebuyck to talk about Green Energy Park, and what he thinks will be a future that will solve these issues in both hydrogen production, and supply and distribution. Bart, with his vast experience in the hydrogen industry, expands on his headship of a public private partnership with the European Commission, and explains how they will lead the way forward.

Green Energy Park is a vertically integrated company that focuses on the production of hydrogen and ammonia in the upstream. Then, in the midstream, bringing that to different consumers in the distribution channel, and finally in the downstream, delivering to the gate of companies. We strongly believe that being vertically integrated is the best way to create a sustainable, viable, and economical hydrogen economy because the hydrogen economy is not yet mature, so there are too many variables. Being completely vertically integrated is, in our opinion, the way forward.

And this is precisely what we are doing with Green Energy Park. That's why we are starting to build the world's largest hydrogen and ammonia production facility in Brazil; then, we will bring its product to various ports worldwide. We are in talks with several ports in Europe. We have our own European import terminal on the Croatian island of Krk. This is where we have the Green Energy Park Krk, and the other ports we are working with are in the UK, north and northwest Europe, and the Middle East and the Far East.

From there, we are in discussion with various customers that we will bring hydrogen and ammonia to. They are located in northern Italy, south Germany, Austria, the Balkan countries, Croatia, Hungary, and Slovakia. This is where we believe we must gradually build a sustainable hydrogen economy. Of course, more energy parks will be built in the future, and we are already in discussion with other locations worldwide about setting up similar hydrogen production facilities.

In Brazil, we found all the elements required to make what I believe will be the world's most affordable hydrogen and ammonia. We have a 100% green grid, a free trade zone, and a very close location to our brand-new port. We're going to operate the export terminal in the state of PiauÃ­. On top of that, we have excellent support from the local government, which believes in hydrogen and has a hydrogen strategy.

Furthermore, many Brazilian developers have concrete plans to produce renewable energy from solar and wind, but do not find off takers as the grid already 100% green. We will enable them and receive electricity and renewables at a very sharp price. We also have access to fresh water as we are very close to a river. All those elements together mean we can produce hydrogen and ammonia at a very affordable price.

We also have a lot of land there; around 800 hectares of free trade zone for ourselves, and we will use around 310 hectares. That leaves space open for off-takers of the ammonia and hydrogen locally. I'm sure there might be other locations of interest in the future. But for the moment, we feel that all the elements are there in PiauÃ­ to make a sustainable business case for hydrogen.

The development will be across four phases. The first phase will construct a 1.8-gigawatt electrolyser starting operation in 2028. Then phase 2 will add another 1.8 gigawatts in 2030, another 1.8 gigawatts in 2032, and finally, we will add 5.4 gigawatts in 2035. The entire project will be fully operational by then, and will be a demonstration of how to make hydrogen economical.

We will produce around 2.4 million tonnes of hydrogen, leading to more than 10 million tonnes of ammonia, depending on the conversion rate and technology we use. We will deliver most of that to Europe because Europe is hungry for energy and needs to go green. Today, there are relatively few renewables available in Europe, so we need to bring these renewable electrons to Europe, which will be one of the biggest off-takers.

We are also looking to the UK, as they, too, are very energy-hungry. The Middle East may also be an exciting area to look at. It is generally believed that the Middle East will always export energy, and so far, they have done so, but I'm not sure that will always be the case. They will be competitive in their export of renewable energy versus other parts of the world. So, I could envision that the Middle East might import energy in the future and use it to create other added-value products. And then there is also the Far East. If you look at Japan, South Korea, Singapore, etc., they also need a lot of energy, especially renewable energy, so we are also looking at these markets.

Globally, there is a race to address climate targets. We need new technologies and a lot of renewables. We cannot decarbonise our entire society by electricity alone; we will also need molecules. There aren't many projects worldwide, at least at such a scale, that will produce a lot of green molecules, so to reach the government's 2035, 2040, 2050, etc. targets, current income streams are not enough if we want to become net zero. We will need to build many facilities to create green molecules and truly implement them as a part of decarbonisation pathways.

There are a lot of industries that cannot use electricity very easily and will need to use molecules for energy. A lot of the time, those are also the industries that are putting out a lot of emissions. If you look only at the steel industry, 7% of global CO2 emissions come from steel. Our project fits wonderfully with all of the aforementioned targets and will help governments' achieve their targets. Furthermore, our project is now part of the Global Gateway initiative. This is the European initiative undertaken by the EU Member States and the European Commission to build closer relationships with countries in Latin America and countries in Africa. Last year, the President of the European Commission went to Brazil and, in June, announced that they would invest in Brazil, including the hydrogen value chain. Thus, we are now one of the projects that are part of that hydrogen value chain in Brazil.

We are currently discussing the financial support we will receive under that framework. Other facilities are in operation in Brazil because of the innovation there. As such, we are also looking at funds that can help with the engineering activity we must undertake. Ultimately, we aim to deliver a hydrogen or ammonia price that is competitive with today's fossil-fuel-based prices once the project is completed and operational.

I strongly believe that we need to go in that direction and show that it's economical and viable. This is why, together with Green Energy Park's top-down team, including an engineering company, an EPCM company, and a solid financial company with a lot of experience, we have developed a business model, new engineering, and a new way of financing. It's quite an innovative business model, which is also part of our IP. When we explain that business model to various banks, be it private or institutional, they all love this new business model.

That's why I feel there is traction in the financial world. We have received a great deal of enthusiasm when discussing and demonstrating our method to build a viable and economical hydrogen economy. I have even had several people tell me I've cracked the code. Today, one of the biggest issues is that many projects do not reach FID because they have various issues with their business model.

We worked hard here because we have an in-house engineering company with one of the brightest engineers in Process Engineering, tank engineering, etc. Combined with brilliant people in the financial world, they came up with that very interesting model that got a lot of traction when tested in the financial world. And so, yes, we're likely to get a lot of development funding, but I think our new approach convinces many investors. I believe this is what was necessary. We cannot keep it business as usual and do things like we always have. You need to innovate, not only in engineering but also financially.

There's already a massive market for ammonia. Today, a lot of grey ammonia is being used worldwide; almost 200 million tonnes of ammonia consumption worldwide. However, this is from fossil-fuel-based ammonia. Of course, this needs to go green. I think there's not such a big problem with import/export or handling because the world knows how to deal with ammonia. There are a lot of skilled people and companies who know what to do, and that is part of our joint venture. They have built several ammonia terminals, including the biggest ammonia tank in operation in the world. The challenge is, of course, what do you do with the hydrogen? Making ammonia from hydrogen is a known technology. However, converting back to hydrogen is still a challenge, and technology is still being developed.

We believe our technology is quite innovative for ammonia cracking. Our cracking technology can also solve issues with exporting to different customers. Bringing hydrogen to your import terminal and then to the customer is challenging.

We all know that building a hydrogen economy will take a decade, if not more, before everything is in place. Plus, not all the big companies, or even small and medium enterprises, are located next to the backbone. A lot of work is still needed to bring the hydrogen to each of those companies. But with our technology and solutions, we have created a way to get hydrogen to companies' gates in a financially affordable way.

Green Energy Park Krk (GEPK) is a unique import facility. Krk is a Croatian island on the north side of the Adriatic Sea, the closest location to south Germany and northern Italy. GEPK is a 156-hectare brownfield plot that used to be an external chemical plant, which we can now use for the green energy future.

From GEPK, we can supply northern Italy, Austria, south Germany, the Balkan regions, and local markets like Croatia and Slovenia. At the moment, most European projects focus on Antwerp, Rotterdam, Hamburg, and those ports. But south-central Europe is not as well supplied. So with Krk, which is uniquely located, we can supply those regions; there's a lot of interest.

Many companies are interested in supplying or sourcing green molecules from GEPK. What is beautiful is that our facility is also a port. We have 16m of natural depth; this is very important because ships carrying ammonia are heavier and need at least 14.5m of depth. We don't need to dredge, as it's a deep natural port. Furthermore, the port is in the Bay of Rijeka, meaning the waves are very moderate; there is no significant movement of sand or silt. This is also good for the shipments in terms of loading and unloading the shipping, as the ships do not rock much.

We also have a natural gas pipeline that is already hydrogen-ready. Once the Croatian government decides to stop natural gas and switch to hydrogen, we can immediately inject it from our side because the gas pipeline starts and runs on our side. Therefore, GEPK is already a part of the European hydrogen economy. In the future, there will also be a direct rail connection to the other side and the possibility of a pipeline going towards the refineries on the other side of the bay. So there are a lot of potential off-takers in the neighbourhood, as well as the potential to get hydrogen in large volumes off the island to major regions like northern Italy and south Germany.

I've already worked in the hydrogen industry for more than 20 years. I started my career at Toyota Motor Europe on the design team for the first Toyota hydrogen car, the Mirai. I worked with my team on the Mirai for more than seven years, ensuring it was ready for the European market. I also built, the first hydrogen refuelling station in Belgium, over ten years ago. At that time, there was little talk about hydrogen power and little knowledge among hydrogen authorities. A lot of education was needed for all different stakeholders. But we built it, and it's still operational today.

After we launched the Mirai and opened the hydrogen refuelling station, I had the opportunity to go to the European Commission to be the head of the world's biggest hydrogen and fuel cell research programme. And so I was heading a â¬2.4bn research programme for seven years. I think we financed more than 1,100 companies in the field of hydrogen fuel cells; a total of around 360 projects in the meantime received funds. It was an exciting environment to work in because you saw all the latest technology, which technology works, which technology needs some development before it works, etc., so I learned a lot.

For me, it was essential to demonstrate how to make the hydrogen economy a reality. Every week, I saw companies coming up with projects and PowerPoints. But if you look at the latest IEA report, there are probably around 1,400 projects worldwide in hydrogen and fuel cells, and only 3.6% get FID; it made me a bit sad. However, I also embraced the challenge to show the world how we can realise a hydrogen economy. To achieve this, after leaving the European Commission in May last year, I started Green Energy Park Global with my team, who truly are the best of the best.

With a big, well-known engineering company, a well-known EPC company and somebody who saw everything in the financial world, together we set out to show the world how we can reach climate goals because to reach the 1.5 degrees climate target in 2050, we need to build about 6,000 gigawatts-worth of electrolysers to produce all the hydrogen and ammonia, or methanol that we need to decarbonise our economy. That's a huge amount. Currently, the biggest electrolyser in operation in Europe is 20 megawatts, a fraction of what we need. And we have just 25 years to build 6,000 gigawatts of renewables and electrolysers, a massive challenge for humanity.

I want to contribute by showing a way forward and making hydrogen an economically viable case. And I'm thrilled that we succeeded. Of course, a lot still needs to be built, but as I said before, we are checking our model and designs because our engineers have already started designing a large part of our plot. When we show it to strategic partners, companies that have worked for years in this field, or investment banks, they say it's fantastic. One CTO of a large company said: ""Every day, I see presentations, and every week, some developers and companies show me their plans on hydrogen and ammonia. But this is my first time seeing something that might actually work."" I think it's clear that we are on the right track to deliver a method that can accelerate the entire hydrogen industry and reach the 6,000 gigawatts required by 2050.",innovationnewsnetwork.com,news,Innovation News Network,Megan Traviss,0.3098039215686275,453302617,7,https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/ZAKARAS1-29179-shutterstock_Deemerwha-studio_2311223577.jpg,eng-9561767

Source: Ukraine's Ministry of Energy

Details: The Ukrainian energy sector continues to be in a difficult situation.

Over the past 24 hours, the power system's needs were covered by its own generation, commercial imports and emergency aid from Poland, Romania and Slovakia. The volume of emergency aid increased from less than 1% to about 2% of the daily consumption of the power system.

Due to the electricity shortage, restrictions are planned for industrial consumers.

Imports are expected to rise to 19,484 megawatt hours (Mwh), beating the record of 18,649 Mwh at the end of March after the first wave of Russian attacks on Ukraine's energy sector.

""The power system has been experiencing a significant electricity shortage for most of the day,"" national power grid operator Ukrenergo said on the Telegram messaging app.

""The reason for this is large-scale damage to Ukrainian power plants, which means they cannot produce as much electricity as before the attack.""

The ministry said that, with the country facing a significant deficit in the system, it plans to import power from Romania, Slovakia, Poland, Hungary and Moldova on Monday.

The grid operator said that emergency assistance from the European Union had already been provided from midnight to this morning, adding that power curbs for industrial consumers are expected this evening.

""Restricting consumption is a necessary measure to maintain the stability of the power system after the fifth targeted missile attack on power plants this year,"" the operator said.

Last week's combined attack on Ukrainian energy infrastructure caused serious damage at three thermal power plants, piling more pressure on the country's power grid.

Russian missile and drone attacks on Ukraine's energy sector have intensified since March, dealing significant damage and causing blackouts in many regions.

The attacks have resulted in more than $1 billion of damage to the sector, said Ukrainian energy minister German Galushchenko.

Thermal and hydropower facilities as well as power transmission systems bore the brunt of the attacks, resulting in the loss of about 80% of Ukraine's thermal power generation capacity and increasing reliance on its three nuclear power plants, which produce about 50% of the country's electricity.

Join us in this fight.

Russia attacked 106 infrastructure facilities in nine regions in Ukraine over the last day, the Defense Ministry's Military Media Center reported on May 12.

Various weapons were used in the attacks and 107 settlements were targeted. Thousands of households in seven oblasts are suffering power outages due to Russian attacks, the Energy Ministry reported.

In the last 24 hours, 1,146 customers in Kharkiv Oblast lost power, alongside 4,600 households in Donetsk Oblast, 2,418 households in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, 450 in Mykolaiv Oblast, 510 in Sumy Oblast, 25,800 in Kherson Oblast, and 1,500 customers in Chernihiv Oblast.

While some settlements have been reconnected as of May 12, thousands still face blackouts. The situation is worse in Donetsk Oblast where 47,700 customers are disconnected from the power grid.

Russia also launched a mass attack on energy infrastructure on May 8 in central and western regions of Ukraine, the fifth attack against Ukraine's power network since the start of the year.

At least two hydroelectric power plants were forcibly decommissioned as a result of the attack.

Ukraine's state-owned energy operator Ukrenergo warned on May 10 that the country was facing a ""significant shortage of electricity.""

Ukraine received an emergency electricity supply from Poland, Romania, and Slovakia, the Energy Ministry reported on May 11.

Kyiv city officials began reducing evening street lighting, Serhii Popko, the head of the Kyiv City Military Administration, announced on May 9.

Ukraine's state-owned energy operator, Ukrenergo, imposed power supply restrictions on industry and business between 6 p.m. and midnight.

""Now it's time, if we want to survive in the twenty-first century, to try to find a balance between technology and ecology, between education and awareness also,"" Jarre tells me, pointing out that scientists and artists are both disruptors who think outside the box.

Starmus, which kicks off tomorrow (May 12) in Slovakia, was co-founded under the auspice of music and science, by Queen guitarist/astrophysicist Brian May and astrophysicist Garik Israelian. Jarre is leading a huge, free outdoor concert to put the spotlight on this year's event, which will feature some of the greatest minds in the world, led by a keynote from the revered Dr. Jane Goodall.

Joining Goodall will be Nobel laureate/physicist Steven Chu (one of nine Nobel laureate speakers at this year's symposium), musician/writer/artist and more Laurie Anderson, astronaut Charlie Duke, sociologist Mary Kaldor and many others.

I spoke with Jarre about what Starmus means to him, working with May, his feelings on AI and much, much more.

Steve Baltin: What does it mean for you to be involved with Starmus and all of the great thinkers involved?

Jean-Michel Jarre: It is a great honor, of course, for me for me to be associated with the Starmus Festival and all of the brilliant minds that will gather in Bratislava to share their knowledge and vision. We gather with Brian May and Garik Israelian, the co-founders of Starmus, like 15 years ago. I was playing at the Royal Albert Hall in London, and at the end of the show somebody knocked at my door and said, ""There are two astro physicists, they would like to see you."" Then came Brian May and another guy I didn't know. I thought it was a new member of Queen probably. They said they went to the show and discussed the project, Starmus, and would I be interested in being part of the project. I said, ""Yes, of course, I'm really happy to be a part of this advisory board of Starmus with the idea, from the beginning, beyond any political mandates, I think our planet needs to think outside the box, to think the future outside the box, to think the future maybe in a more disruptive way."" Scientists, artists and some entrepreneurs, it's part of our DNA, to think differently and in these dark days, I truly think that gathering scientists, artists and some entrepreneurs could bring something different and maybe contribute a positive path for future generations.

Baltin: Great artists, from Joni Mitchell and Miles Davis to David Bowie, have always been disruptive. As have great thinkers, like Martin Luther King and Jane Goodall, so it makes sense to bring them together, especially politicians right now are not getting things done. Someone needs to.

Jarre: Exactly right. We're all saying this, not in an arrogant way, but just to think about an alternative. As you say, politics, generally speaking, at the moment, we can admit it's a kind of failure. It doesn't work for lots of different reasons, not necessarily because of individuals, but a system that we all created through years and generations. Now it's time, if we want to survive in the twenty-first century, to try to find a balance between technology and ecology, between education and awareness also. When we are talking about a disruptive approach, what I really like as a concept, for scientists, for artists, what makes a scientist? Finding something. What makes an artist? Creating something specific. It's speaking outside the box with what we call, for music, style. We can recognize instantly Miles Davis sound, and you have millions of people playing the trumpet. What is this? It's because he is using the instrument in a disruptive way. So why not apply this concept to politics in the Greek sense of the word?

Baltin: The idea of a conference like this is to create and maintain optimism that things can still change for the better. What gives you hope right now?

Jarre: I would say, first of all, that we have to be optimistic by subversion today. Because we are in times, more than ever, everybody is thinking yesterday was better and tomorrow is going to be worse. It's probably in the human DNA to think that because we know at one moment, we are not going to be part of the future for obvious reasons, our limited time on the planet. Then we necessarily have an instinctive dark vision of the future. We have to take note, technology being quicker and faster, people are scared about innovation. We should not be scared about innovation; we should grab innovation. Technology is neutral, it's all depending how you use it. The invention of fire, fire is pretty dangerous but it also allowed us to evolve. Like electricity is also pretty dangerous, but it also gave us lots of comfort and progress. Like today, AI. AI is going to be one of the subjects. I think, for me, AI is an extension of my imagination. But, of course, at the same time we should set up rules. Rules are not limiting freedom; rules are giving us access to freedom. The difference between democracy and chaos are rules. It's because I have a driver's license that I can drive freely on the road in the world. Each time we are confronted with a new tool, a new technology we are thinking at the time about how to use this and to settle the rules. This is one of the topics we are going to discuss at Starmus.

Baltin: Talk about your role at this year's festival.

Jarre: I'm really honored and pleased to set up this huge outdoor concert for the kickoff of Starmus because this kind of a series of symposiums needs to put a spotlight on and this big concert and staging, welcoming Brian May with me on stage, has this ambition to attract the youth, to attract the media worldwide. We have to attract people and music is a very good medium for that. This concert is quite innovative, I worked a lot with AI on the visual point of view. I think there is a real parallel between the creative process and AI. I also think music and science have a lot in common and this is one of the messages. I do think, for me, music is the soul of geometry, the soul of mathematics.",forbes.com,news,Forbes,,0.4352941176470588,453177083,1,https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/664026ce6b43f1a4fc86816a/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds,

At a time when the dominant narrative around cash is that its demise is all but inevitable, as well as broadly desirable, the 2024 payment report by Sweden's Riksbank may offer a cautionary tale.

In October last year, in More Good News for Cash in Europe, More Bad News for Digital Dollar in US, we reported that recent developments suggest that the trend away from cash and toward purely digital-only payment systems may not be quite as smooth or as seamless as some may have wished or expected. One of the developments we highlighted in that report was growing concern among central bankers and politicians in Sweden, one of Europe's most cashless economies, about the unintended consequences of driving cash out of the economy:

Even by late 2020, Sweden had less cash in circulation than just about anywhere else in the world, at around 1% of gross domestic product, according to the latest available data. That compares with 8% in the U.S. and more than 10% in the euro area. As a recent piece in Interesting Engineering notes, Sweden is already ""officially cashless"":

Cash is never needed, not even for small purchases like hot chocolate at a Christmas market in Stockholm. All vendors have a mobile payment chip-and-PIN card reader like the one offered by Stockholm-based mobile payments company iZettle, or they accept payments through the mobile application Swish. Swishing is perhaps the easiest way of payment for everyone.

The Risks of Going Fully Cashless

But now the country is beginning to realise that an almost exclusively digital payments system comes with significant risks, especially at a time of heightened geopolitical tensions. In time-honoured fashion, the article in the UK Telegraph began with a spot of fearmongering about Vladimir Putin.

""People started to realise that it is very easy for Vladimir Putin to switch everything off,"" BjÃ¶rn Eriksson, a retired police chief, former head of Interpol and leading cash advocate, told the Telegraph. ""At first we were arguing for vulnerable people, the elderly, women in abusive relationships who rely on cash... Now we are talking about national security. And it's not only Putin, it could also be organised crime.""

In 2021, the Riksbank, Sweden's central bank (and the world's oldest), introduced a new directive obliging the country's six largest credit institutions to continue providing their customers with certain basic cash services.

But while that may have meant that people in Sweden can continue to access cash from their local branch, it is becoming increasingly difficult to use it as fewer and fewer retail businesses accept notes and coins.

This is partly due to the greater convenience of handling digital payments while the card processing fees are substantially lower than the US. But it is also because most Swedes, including many pensioners, prefer to use cards or mobile payments. As a baker in Stockholm told the Telegraph, ""the only people who bring cash to the shop are tourists. I feel bad for them because they just take the krona home, where it is useless.""

But even that trend may be reversing. According to Eriksson, a growing number of young people are joining the pro-cash movement -- and mainly over privacy concerns.

Rediscovering the Benefits of Cash

Earlier this week, Heise Online, a German online news service that covers IT, telecommunications, and technology sectors, published a long, in-depth report about the Riksbank's apparent rediscovery of some of the benefits of cash. The article also explores some of the Riksbank's concerns about the potential fragility of a fully cashless payment system, as outlined in its 2024 Payments Report, published in March.

At a time when the dominant narrative around cash -- as espoused by senior bankers, central bankers, big tech and fintech executives, politicians and economists, and of course, their ever-faithful servants in the media -- is that its demise is all but inevitable, even in countries where cash is still King (Germany, Spain, Austria, Mexico, Thailand, Japan...), the Riksbank's report may offer a cautionary tale. From the Heise Online piece (machine translated):

""The Swedish payments market has been digitized rapidly,"" states the Riksbank. Cash and manual payment services have been replaced by cards, mobile phones and internet services. ""As a result, payments have become faster, smoother and cheaper overall,"" which the institute points out is ""a positive development."" However, there are groups in society ""who do not have access to digital payment services or find it difficult to use them and are therefore marginalized"". There are also ""serious fraud problems that could undermine trust in the payment system.""

Digitalization also makes payments ""more vulnerable to cyber attacks and disruptions to the power grid and data communication,"" the bank points out. At the same time, the geopolitical developments of the past few years required ""Sweden to have strong civil defense."" The developments suggested ""that we should concentrate more than before on the challenges of digitalization.""

Put another way, cash does not crash. It does not fail in a power cut or seize up during a cyber attack (though, of course, ATMs might). By contrast, digital payment systems need a stable and continuous internet connection to process transactions. When these connections fail, the result is often chaos. Digital payment outages have caused significant disruption in a host of countries in recent years, including the US, the UK, Australia, Indonesia, Germany, Canada, Spain and Norway. Generally speaking, the more cashless the country, the greater the disruption.

Sweden's Cashless Journey

Sweden is one of the world's most cashless economies. In large part, its abandonment of cash was the result of technological and generational shifts. As payment technologies began to change in the first two decades of this century, most Swedish citizens began to prefer the speed, ease and convenience of digital payments.

They were also nudged heavily in that direction by commercial banks, which by 2016 had made 60% of their branches cashless, as a 2019 Riksbank working paper documents. This made it much more difficult for citizens to access cash and for businesses to deposit it, which in turn accelerated the uptake of digital payments and the abandonment.

Sweden's legal tender laws also made it possible for the Riksbank to withdraw many of Sweden's large denomination notes in circulation. For instance, the value of 1,000-krona notes (worth just over $90) in circulation declined gradually from SEK 48.4 billion in 2001 to SEK 21.4 billion in December 2012. Beginning in 2013, this decline accelerated, plunging to SEK 9.7 billion by December 2013.

After playing a part in the wholesale removal of cash from Sweden's economy, the Riksbank is now trying to reverse some of the damage it has caused. It is not the only Scandinavian central bank to have flagged up the fragility risks of exclusively digital payment systems. In 2022, the Bank of Finland recommended that the use of cash payments be guaranteed by law. Like all Nordic countries, Finland is a largely cash-free economy. But like Sweden, it has begun to see the risks of going too far, too soon.

In March 2022, the central bank initiated a proposal for legislation to ensure a minimal level of cash-paid services. In October of that year, the Head of the Payment Systems Department and Chief Cashier at the Bank of Finland, PÃ¤ivi Heikkinen, even advised households to make sure they have some cash on hand, just in case the country's payments system were to go down. At the time, Finland had just applied to become a NATO member and the government was fretting about the risk of cyber attacks from Russia. In an interview with the national broadcaster, Heikkinen said her intention was not to ""fabricate catastrophic scenarios"" -- before saying that in the worst case scenario, the payments system could go down for a period of weeks.

In Sweden, the Riksbank is already taking countermeasures to try to guarantee a steady supply of cash, the Heise Online article notes:

It is improving the cash supply by setting up new offices where companies can collect and deposit cash. Having such cash depots in more locations across the country would reduce both the costs for businesses and the risk that cash would no longer be usable in the event of a disruption.

This is the only way to ensure ""that everyone can pay"". In general, ""stronger legal protection for cash"" is necessary. Banks should be required to ""accept cash deposits, including coins, from individuals.""

The Riksbank supports its demands with reference to an annual representative survey on the payment habits of Swedes. According to this, ""cash is being used more frequently than before"". Almost half of respondents reported using cash in the past month, an increase of 15 percentage points compared to 2022.

This pro-active approach to bolstering the cash system contrasts sharply with what some central banks and governments are saying and doing in other Western or Western-adjacent countries. As we reported in August, Brazil's Chamber of Deputies is mulling a number of legislative proposals calling for an end to the printing, minting and circulation of physical notes and coins. As the World Economic Forum trumpeted in 2022, Brazilians are adopting digital payments faster than anyone else.

In Australia, the government refuses to legally protect the use of cash in retail settings. The Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, Michele Bullock, has even warned that as the running costs of processing cash for banks and businesses mount as a result of the declining share of consumer payments made using cash, it may become necessary to begin charging people for using cash in retail settings.

Granted, Australia is significantly larger and more sparsely populated than Sweden, making it much harder and more costly to transport money securely to all parts of the country, including remote parts of Queensland, Northern Territory and Western Australia. But whereas the Riksbank is talking about taking on a proactive role, together with other authorities and banks, to ensure that cash can be transported to and from retail outlets at reasonable prices, the RBA is talking about making consumers pay for the privilege of using cash. Meanwhile, Armaguard, Australia's largest currency transport business, servicing around 90% of the cash-in-transit market, is warning of bankruptcy -- unless the banks agree to pay more for its services.

Predictably, Bullock's suggestion that citizens may one day have to fork over extra fees for the privilege of paying with cash -- to protect the banks and retailers from the exorbitant costs of maintaining cash infrastructure -- did not go down well with many Australians. While most citizens are using digital payments for most, if not all, of their purchases, millions still depend on cash in their daily lives.

What's more, the very same Big Four banks Bullock wants to protect from having to part with extra money to fortify Australia's cash network have posted record or near-record profits in recent times, in part because of surging interest rates but also because of the rising fees they charge on card payments. Those same banks received huge sums of cheap debt to tide them over during the COVID-19 pandemic while at the same time closing hundreds of branches and ATMs across the country.

In Sweden, as Heisse Online notes, more and more Swedes see the decline in cash consumption as a negative development -- 44 percent in 2023 compared to 36 percent in the previous year:

The proportion of respondents who believe that they cannot get by without cash in today's society has also increased compared to 2022. This could also be ""an effect of increased crisis awareness due to the war in Ukraine,"" the bankers speculate.

The need to pay in cash in certain situations such as at clubs, in corner shops and at flea markets is also mentioned, the report goes on to say. Some also emphasized that using cash made it easier for them to keep track of their finances. Older people generally find it much more difficult to get by without cash than younger people. In the 2023 survey, half of respondents said they wanted to pay cash but the store did not accept it. In 2022 the corresponding value was only 37 percent...

These numbers suggest that cash may be experiencing a mini-renaissance in Sweden, which would echo similar trends seen in other heavily cashless economies. For example, a recent survey down under by fintech company Waave revealed that as many as 71% of Australians are worried about the economy becoming completely cashless. Those most concerned include Baby Boomers (82%), regional Australians (77%), and lower income households earning less than $100k (75%) -- a reminder of the oft-ignored class-war element of the War on Cash.

It's not hard to see why concerns about the future of cash are on the rise down under. In recent months, three of Australia's Big Four banks have removed over-the-counter cash withdrawals from some of their branches while increasing numbers of businesses, both large and small, are choosing to reject cash payments altogether. In Australia, it is perfectly legal for businesses to refuse to accept cash as long as they inform consumers of their stance before any ""contract"" for the supply of goods or services is entered into.

Aussie cash lovers recently expressed their displeasure with these trends through a ""Draw Out Some Cash Day"" on April 2. According to news.com.au, hoards of people were seen lining up to withdraw cash:

The movement, led by the Cash is King Facebook group, aimed to show banks and retailers there is still a demand for cash amid warnings the country will be ""functionally cashless"" by 2025.

Social media posts show ""massive queues"" of people, both young and old, lining up at various banks around the country, with one woman sharing she waited for up to an hour to get her hands on bank notes.

""All banks I passed today had queues out the door,"" one person wrote on Facebook alongside a picture of people lining up outside a Commonwealth Bank branch.

Governments in other countries, including Ireland, Spain, Slovakia and Austria, are taking pro-active steps to protect the use of cash. Even the European Central Bank has called for a regulatory crackdown on all businesses and public bodies in the Euro Area that refuse to accept cash. At the same time, the ECB is proceeding in its digital euro project from the ""investigation phase"" to the ""preparation phase.""

As I noted at the time, cash is still the most frequently used payment method in the Euro Area, though it is losing ground to cards. Even if, or when, the digital euro is launched, it will presumably coexist with cash for some time, at least until the digital euro gains a strong enough foothold. ECB President Lagarde has said that ""cash is here to stay,"" adding that European citizens ""will have both options: cash and digital cash."" How long it stays that way will remain to be seen. My guess is that if the digital euro does gain a strong foothold, the ECB will begin financially incentivising its use while decentivising the use of cash.

In the UK, meanwhile, cash may even be staging a comeback of sorts after ten consecutive years of falling use. According to both UK Finance, the country's largest bank association, and the British Retail Consortium Group, the most influential retail lobbying group, cash use increased in 2022, for the first time in a decade. Whether this rebound represents a genuine trend reversal or merely a dead cat bounce (apologies, as always, to feline lovers) remains to be seen. But the mere fact that cash use is growing at all despite concerted efforts by the government, banks and retailers to reduce its use is noteworthy.

So, too, is the fact that Sweden's Riksbank is expressing reservations about the resilience of a fully cashless society. After all, the Riksbank was one of the first central banks in Europe to begin aggressively undermining the role of cash in the economy. That said, its U-turn on cash it is not as novel a development as is suggested by the Heise Online article. The Riksbank, the article claims in its introduction, ""is suddenly emphasising the indispensable role of cash in secure, widely available payment systems. This is a change in strategy.""

That is somewhat misleading. As the German financial journalist Norbert HÃ¤ring notes (in German) on his blog, while there has definitely been a sea change in strategy at the Riksbank, that change did not begin just now but rather eight years ago, ""after the central bank, together with Sweden's commercial banks, had done everything they could to undermine the use of cash."" Since early 2016 Sweden's central bank has slowed the march towards a cashless society, as HÃ¤ring reported at the time.

Now, the Riksbank is not just questioning the wisdom of moving to a fully cashless economy at this current moment in time; it is explicitly warning about the potential risks such a move might entail. At the same time, it is working on developing a CBDC -- the so-called e-krona, now in its fourth and final pilot phase, looking at ""how an e-Krona can be used offline for payments if electricity and telecommunications are not working."" Which begs the question: once the e-krona is ready to launch, which will presumably be sooner than most other CBDCs in the West, how will it co-exist with cash? That will have to be the subject of a future article, though readers' suggestions are more than welcome in the meantime.",therussophile.org,news,TheRussophiles,Tyler Durden,-0.02745098039215688,453122602,1,https://i0.wp.com/therussophile.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/cashless.jpg?fit=500%2C284&ssl=1,

At a time when the dominant narrative around cash is that its demise is all but inevitable, as well as broadly desirable, the 2024 payment report by Sweden's Riksbank may offer a cautionary tale.

In October last year, in More Good News for Cash in Europe, More Bad News for Digital Dollar in US, we reported that recent developments suggest that the trend away from cash and toward purely digital-only payment systems may not be quite as smooth or as seamless as some may have wished or expected. One of the developments we highlighted in that report was growing concern among central bankers and politicians in Sweden, one of Europe's most cashless economies, about the unintended consequences of driving cash out of the economy:

Even by late 2020, Sweden had less cash in circulation than just about anywhere else in the world, at around 1% of gross domestic product, according to the latest available data. That compares with 8% in the U.S. and more than 10% in the euro area. As a recent piece in Interesting Engineering notes, Sweden is already ""officially cashless"":

That compares with 8% in the U.S. and more than 10% in the euro area. As a recent piece in Interesting Engineering notes, Sweden is already ""officially cashless"":

Cash is never needed, not even for small purchases like hot chocolate at a Christmas market in Stockholm. All vendors have a mobile payment chip-and-PIN card reader like the one offered by Stockholm-based mobile payments company iZettle, or they accept payments through the mobile application Swish. Swishing is perhaps the easiest way of payment for everyone.

The Risks of Going Fully Cashless

But now the country is beginning to realise that an almost exclusively digital payments system comes with significant risks, especially at a time of heightened geopolitical tensions. In time-honoured fashion, the article in the UK Telegraph began with a spot of fearmongering about Vladimir Putin.

""People started to realise that it is very easy for Vladimir Putin to switch everything off,"" BjÃ¶rn Eriksson, a retired police chief, former head of Interpol and leading cash advocate, told the Telegraph. ""At first we were arguing for vulnerable people, the elderly, women in abusive relationships who rely on cash... Now we are talking about national security. And it's not only Putin, it could also be organised crime.""

In 2021, the Riksbank, Sweden's central bank (and the world's oldest), introduced a new directive obliging the country's six largest credit institutions to continue providing their customers with certain basic cash services.

But while that may have meant that people in Sweden can continue to access cash from their local branch, it is becoming increasingly difficult to use it as fewer and fewer retail businesses accept notes and coins.

This is partly due to the greater convenience of handling digital payments while the card processing fees are substantially lower than the US. But it is also because most Swedes, including many pensioners, prefer to use cards or mobile payments. As a baker in Stockholm told the Telegraph, ""the only people who bring cash to the shop are tourists. I feel bad for them because they just take the krona home, where it is useless.""

But even that trend may be reversing. According to Eriksson, a growing number of young people are joining the pro-cash movement -- and mainly over privacy concerns.

Rediscovering the Benefits of Cash

Earlier this week, Heise Online, a German online news service that covers IT, telecommunications, and technology sectors, published a long, in-depth report about the Riksbank's apparent rediscovery of some of the benefits of cash. The article also explores some of the Riksbank's concerns about the potential fragility of a fully cashless payment system, as outlined in its 2024 Payments Report, published in March.

At a time when the dominant narrative around cash -- as espoused by senior bankers, central bankers, big tech and fintech executives, politicians and economists, and of course, their ever-faithful servants in the media -- is that its demise is all but inevitable, even in countries where cash is still King (Germany, Spain, Austria, Mexico, Thailand, Japan...), the Riksbank's report may offer a cautionary tale. From the Heise Online piece (machine translated):

""The Swedish payments market has been digitized rapidly,"" states the Riksbank. Cash and manual payment services have been replaced by cards, mobile phones and internet services. ""As a result, payments have become faster, smoother and cheaper overall,"" which the institute points out is ""a positive development."" However, there are groups in society ""who do not have access to digital payment services or find it difficult to use them and are therefore marginalized"". There are also ""serious fraud problems that could undermine trust in the payment system.""

Digitalization also makes payments ""more vulnerable to cyber attacks and disruptions to the power grid and data communication,"" the bank points out. At the same time, the geopolitical developments of the past few years required ""Sweden to have strong civil defense."" The developments suggested ""that we should concentrate more than before on the challenges of digitalization.""

Put another way, cash does not crash. It does not fail in a power cut or seize up during a cyber attack (though, of course, ATMs might). By contrast, digital payment systems need a stable and continuous internet connection to process transactions. When these connections fail, the result is often chaos. Digital payment outages have caused significant disruption in a host of countries in recent years, including the US, the UK, Australia, Indonesia, Germany, Canada, Spain and Norway. Generally speaking, the more cashless the country, the greater the disruption.

Sweden's Cashless Journey

Sweden is one of the world's most cashless economies. In large part, its abandonment of cash was the result of technological and generational shifts. As payment technologies began to change in the first two decades of this century, most Swedish citizens began to prefer the speed, ease and convenience of digital payments.

They were also nudged heavily in that direction by commercial banks, which by 2016 had made 60% of their branches cashless, as a 2019 Riksbank working paper documents. This made it much more difficult for citizens to access cash and for businesses to deposit it, which in turn accelerated the uptake of digital payments and the abandonment.

Sweden's legal tender laws also made it possible for the Riksbank to withdraw many of Sweden's large denomination notes in circulation. For instance, the value of 1,000-krona notes (worth just over $90) in circulation declined gradually from SEK 48.4 billion in 2001 to SEK 21.4 billion in December 2012. Beginning in 2013, this decline accelerated, plunging to SEK 9.7 billion by December 2013.

After playing a part in the wholesale removal of cash from Sweden's economy, the Riksbank is now trying to reverse some of the damage it has caused. It is not the only Scandinavian central bank to have flagged up the fragility risks of exclusively digital payment systems. In 2022, the Bank of Finland recommended that the use of cash payments be guaranteed by law. Like all Nordic countries, Finland is a largely cash-free economy. But like Sweden, it has begun to see the risks of going too far, too soon.

In March 2022, the central bank initiated a proposal for legislation to ensure a minimal level of cash-paid services. In October of that year, the Head of the Payment Systems Department and Chief Cashier at the Bank of Finland, PÃ¤ivi Heikkinen, even advised households to make sure they have some cash on hand, just in case the country's payments system were to go down. At the time, Finland had just applied to become a NATO member and the government was fretting about the risk of cyber attacks from Russia. In an interview with the national broadcaster, Heikkinen said her intention was not to ""fabricate catastrophic scenarios"" -- before saying that in the worst case scenario, the payments system could go down for a period of weeks.

In Sweden, the Riksbank is already taking countermeasures to try to guarantee a steady supply of cash, the Heise Online article notes:

It is improving the cash supply by setting up new offices where companies can collect and deposit cash. Having such cash depots in more locations across the country would reduce both the costs for businesses and the risk that cash would no longer be usable in the event of a disruption.

This is the only way to ensure ""that everyone can pay"". In general, ""stronger legal protection for cash"" is necessary. Banks should be required to ""accept cash deposits, including coins, from individuals.""

The Riksbank supports its demands with reference to an annual representative survey on the payment habits of Swedes. According to this, ""cash is being used more frequently than before"". Almost half of respondents reported using cash in the past month, an increase of 15 percentage points compared to 2022.

This pro-active approach to bolstering the cash system contrasts sharply with what some central banks and governments are saying and doing in other Western or Western-adjacent countries. As we reported in August, Brazil's Chamber of Deputies is mulling a number of legislative proposals calling for an end to the printing, minting and circulation of physical notes and coins. As the World Economic Forum trumpeted in 2022, Brazilians are adopting digital payments faster than anyone else.

In Australia, the government refuses to legally protect the use of cash in retail settings. The Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, Michele Bullock, has even warned that as the running costs of processing cash for banks and businesses mount as a result of the declining share of consumer payments made using cash, it may become necessary to begin charging people for using cash in retail settings.

Granted, Australia is significantly larger and more sparsely populated than Sweden, making it much harder and more costly to transport money securely to all parts of the country, including remote parts of Queensland, Northern Territory and Western Australia. But whereas the Riksbank is talking about taking on a proactive role, together with other authorities and banks, to ensure that cash can be transported to and from retail outlets at reasonable prices, the RBA is talking about making consumers pay for the privilege of using cash. Meanwhile, Armaguard, Australia's largest currency transport business, servicing around 90% of the cash-in-transit market, is warning of bankruptcy -- unless the banks agree to pay more for its services.

Predictably, Bullock's suggestion that citizens may one day have to fork over extra fees for the privilege of paying with cash -- to protect the banks and retailers from the exorbitant costs of maintaining cash infrastructure -- did not go down well with many Australians. While most citizens are using digital payments for most, if not all, of their purchases, millions still depend on cash in their daily lives.

What's more, the very same Big Four banks Bullock wants to protect from having to part with extra money to fortify Australia's cash network have posted record or near-record profits in recent times, in part because of surging interest rates but also because of the rising fees they charge on card payments. Those same banks received huge sums of cheap debt to tide them over during the COVID-19 pandemic while at the same time closing hundreds of branches and ATMs across the country.

In Sweden, as Heisse Online notes, more and more Swedes see the decline in cash consumption as a negative development -- 44 percent in 2023 compared to 36 percent in the previous year:

The proportion of respondents who believe that they cannot get by without cash in today's society has also increased compared to 2022. This could also be ""an effect of increased crisis awareness due to the war in Ukraine,"" the bankers speculate.

The need to pay in cash in certain situations such as at clubs, in corner shops and at flea markets is also mentioned, the report goes on to say. Some also emphasized that using cash made it easier for them to keep track of their finances. Older people generally find it much more difficult to get by without cash than younger people. In the 2023 survey, half of respondents said they wanted to pay cash but the store did not accept it. In 2022 the corresponding value was only 37 percent...

These numbers suggest that cash may be experiencing a mini-renaissance in Sweden, which would echo similar trends seen in other heavily cashless economies. For example, a recent survey down under by fintech company Waave revealed that as many as 71% of Australians are worried about the economy becoming completely cashless. Those most concerned include Baby Boomers (82%), regional Australians (77%), and lower income households earning less than $100k (75%) -- a reminder of the oft-ignored class-war element of the War on Cash.

It's not hard to see why concerns about the future of cash are on the rise down under. In recent months, three of Australia's Big Four banks have removed over-the-counter cash withdrawals from some of their branches while increasing numbers of businesses, both large and small, are choosing to reject cash payments altogether. In Australia, it is perfectly legal for businesses to refuse to accept cash as long as they inform consumers of their stance before any ""contract"" for the supply of goods or services is entered into.

Aussie cash lovers recently expressed their displeasure with these trends through a ""Draw Out Some Cash Day"" on April 2. According to news.com.au, hoards of people were seen lining up to withdraw cash:

The movement, led by the Cash is King Facebook group, aimed to show banks and retailers there is still a demand for cash amid warnings the country will be ""functionally cashless"" by 2025.

Social media posts show ""massive queues"" of people, both young and old, lining up at various banks around the country, with one woman sharing she waited for up to an hour to get her hands on bank notes.

""All banks I passed today had queues out the door,"" one person wrote on Facebook alongside a picture of people lining up outside a Commonwealth Bank branch.

Governments in other countries, including Ireland, Spain, Slovakia and Austria, are taking pro-active steps to protect the use of cash. Even the European Central Bank has called for a regulatory crackdown on all businesses and public bodies in the Euro Area that refuse to accept cash. At the same time, the ECB is proceeding in its digital euro project from the ""investigation phase"" to the ""preparation phase.""

As I noted at the time, cash is still the most frequently used payment method in the Euro Area, though it is losing ground to cards. Even if, or when, the digital euro is launched, it will presumably coexist with cash for some time, at least until the digital euro gains a strong enough foothold. ECB President Lagarde has said that ""cash is here to stay,"" adding that European citizens ""will have both options: cash and digital cash."" How long it stays that way will remain to be seen. My guess is that if the digital euro does gain a strong foothold, the ECB will begin financially incentivising its use while decentivising the use of cash.

In the UK, meanwhile, cash may even be staging a comeback of sorts after ten consecutive years of falling use. According to both UK Finance, the country's largest bank association, and the British Retail Consortium Group, the most influential retail lobbying group, cash use increased in 2022, for the first time in a decade. Whether this rebound represents a genuine trend reversal or merely a dead cat bounce (apologies, as always, to feline lovers) remains to be seen. But the mere fact that cash use is growing at all despite concerted efforts by the government, banks and retailers to reduce its use is noteworthy.

So, too, is the fact that Sweden's Riksbank is expressing reservations about the resilience of a fully cashless society. After all, the Riksbank was one of the first central banks in Europe to begin aggressively undermining the role of cash in the economy. That said, its U-turn on cash it is not as novel a development as is suggested by the Heise Online article. The Riksbank, the article claims in its introduction, ""is suddenly emphasising the indispensable role of cash in secure, widely available payment systems. This is a change in strategy.""

That is somewhat misleading. As the German financial journalist Norbert HÃ¤ring notes (in German) on his blog, while there has definitely been a sea change in strategy at the Riksbank, that change did not begin just now but rather eight years ago, ""after the central bank, together with Sweden's commercial banks, had done everything they could to undermine the use of cash."" Since early 2016 Sweden's central bank has slowed the march towards a cashless society, as HÃ¤ring reported at the time.

Now, the Riksbank is not just questioning the wisdom of moving to a fully cashless economy at this current moment in time; it is explicitly warning about the potential risks such a move might entail. At the same time, it is working on developing a CBDC -- the so-called e-krona, now in its fourth and final pilot phase, looking at ""how an e-Krona can be used offline for payments if electricity and telecommunications are not working."" Which begs the question: once the e-krona is ready to launch, which will presumably be sooner than most other CBDCs in the West, how will it co-exist with cash? That will have to be the subject of a future article, though readers' suggestions are more than welcome in the meantime.",zerohedge.com,news,Zero Hedge,,0.2,453115917,1,https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/styles/16_9_max_700/public/2024-05/cashless.JPG?itok=9Wsbr2Y5,

Ukraine received an emergency electricity supply from Poland, Romania, and Slovakia amid an ongoing power shortage following Russia's attacks on energy infrastructure, the Energy Ministry reported on May 11.

Russia launched another large-scale overnight attack on May 8 against energy infrastructure in central and western regions of Ukraine, the fifth attack against Ukraine's power network since the start of the year.

Ukraine's state-owned energy operator Ukrenergo warned on May 10 that the country was facing a ""significant shortage of electricity.""

While Ukraine has so far avoided nationwide power cuts, the Energy Ministry said that a blackout schedule applies to residents in Kharkiv Oblast and to industry in Kryvyi Rih.

Industrial consumers across the country were restricted in their energy use from 6 p.m. on May 10 to 6:30 a.m. on May 11, the Energy Ministry reported.

The ministry predicted another power shortage on May 11 and asked ""consumers to reduce the use of energy-intensive appliances during peak hours"" between 5 p.m. and 10 p.m.

Ukraine is expected to again receive emergency assistance from Poland, Romania, and Slovakia during the evening peak hours.

Over the past day, the emergency supply from abroad constituted ""less than 1% of daily electricity consumption,"" the Energy Ministry said.

Fico also repeatedly expressed his pro-Russian rhetoric. In particular, he insisted that the war was a ""frozen conflict"" and could not be resolved with military aid to Ukraine.

It is worth noting that the Slovak government refused to help Ukraine. In this connection, the country's citizens began to collect funds to purchase ammunition for Ukraine.

Source: wyborcza.pl

The Poles have resumed the border blockade with Ukraine at the Dovhobychuv-Uhryniv checkpoint. However, they are expected to rally only on May 10. The protest is part of another large-scale action of Polish farmers demanding to cancel the European ""green course"" requirements and ban imports of agricultural products from Ukraine.

The State Customs Service announced the blocking of the border. It noted that the announced time of the rally is from 09.00 to 16.00.

""According to the Polish side, today, May 10, from 09:00 to 16:00, a one-day strike will be held in front of the DolhobyczÃ³w-Uhryniv checkpoint in the cargo areas: entry and exit from Ukraine,"" the statement said.

It is emphasized that the protesters do not plan to touch the cars, as they must move freely. As well as buses.

Poles protest not only on the border of Ukraine

On May 10, mass protests took place in the Polish capital Warsaw. Farmers plan to continue the rallies until late in the evening.

According to Radio Svoboda, the protesting farmers claim that the consequences of the ""green course"" will lead to higher electricity and heating prices. They also oppose the upcoming ban on gasoline and diesel cars.

In addition to rejecting the Green Deal, the strikers are demanding a ban on imports of agricultural products from Ukraine. In their opinion, Ukrainian products are allegedly not controlled and do not have certificates, although this is not true.

The border has been unblocked since the end of April

Polish farmers fully unblocked all checkpoints on the border with Ukraine on April 29, when the blockade of the Rava-Ruska-Hrebenne checkpoint was lifted. At the same time, the parties agreed to exchange monthly figures on the transit of agricultural products to monitor the situation.

At the same time, the complete de-blockade of the border already yielded positive results. For example:

Poland receives much more from Ukraine than it gives

Danylo Hetmantsev (""Servant of the People""), Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada Committee on Finance, Taxation and Customs Policy, noted earlier that by blocking the border, the Poles are ""shooting themselves in the foot"" - after all, in 2023 Poland exported $12.3 billion worth of goods to Ukraine and imported $6.6 billion from Ukraine.

""According to the Polish State Statistics Service, in 2023, Ukraine accounted for 3.2% of all merchandise exports from Poland. According to this indicator, we were in 7th place among our trading partners, overtaking the United States and such EU members as Spain, Slovakia, and Hungary. At the same time, the dynamics of growth of Polish exports to Ukraine in 2023 was the highest among the top ten countries that are the largest trading partners,"" the MP emphasized.

Will Other Central Banks Listen? | naked capitalism,"At a time when the dominant narrative around cash is that its demise is all but inevitable, as well as broadly desirable, the 2024 payment report by Sweden's Riksbank may offer a cautionary tale.

In October last year, in More Good News for Cash in Europe, More Bad News for Digital Dollar in US, we reported that recent developments suggest that the trend away from cash and toward purely digital-only payment systems may not be quite as smooth or as seamless as some may have wished or expected. One of the developments we highlighted in that report was growing concern among central bankers and politicians in Sweden, one of Europe's most cashless economies, about the unintended consequences of driving cash out of the economy:

Even by late 2020, Sweden had less cash in circulation than just about anywhere else in the world, at around 1% of gross domestic product, according to the latest available data. That compares with 8% in the U.S. and more than 10% in the euro area. As a recent piece in Interesting Engineering notes, Sweden is already ""officially cashless"":

Cash is never needed, not even for small purchases like hot chocolate at a Christmas market in Stockholm. All vendors have a mobile payment chip-and-PIN card reader like the one offered by Stockholm-based mobile payments company iZettle, or they accept payments through the mobile application Swish. Swishing is perhaps the easiest way of payment for everyone.

The Risks of Going Fully Cashless

But now the country is beginning to realise that an almost exclusively digital payments system comes with significant risks, especially at a time of heightened geopolitical tensions. In time-honoured fashion, the article in the UK Telegraph began with a spot of fearmongering about Vladimir Putin.

""People started to realise that it is very easy for Vladimir Putin to switch everything off,"" BjÃ¶rn Eriksson, a retired police chief, former head of Interpol and leading cash advocate, told the Telegraph. ""At first we were arguing for vulnerable people, the elderly, women in abusive relationships who rely on cash... Now we are talking about national security. And it's not only Putin, it could also be organised crime.""

In 2021, the Riksbank, Sweden's central bank (and the world's oldest), introduced a new directive obliging the country's six largest credit institutions to continue providing their customers with certain basic cash services.

But while that may have meant that people in Sweden can continue to access cash from their local branch, it is becoming increasingly difficult to use it as fewer and fewer retail businesses accept notes and coins.

This is partly due to the greater convenience of handling digital payments while the card processing fees are substantially lower than the US. But it is also because most Swedes, including many pensioners, prefer to use cards or mobile payments. As a baker in Stockholm told the Telegraph, ""the only people who bring cash to the shop are tourists. I feel bad for them because they just take the krona home, where it is useless.""

But even that trend may be reversing. According to Eriksson, a growing number of young people are joining the pro-cash movement -- and mainly over privacy concerns.

Rediscovering the Benefits of Cash

Earlier this week, Heise Online, a German online news service that covers IT, telecommunications, and technology sectors, published a long, in-depth report about the Riksbank's apparent rediscovery of some of the benefits of cash. The article also explores some of the Riksbank's concerns about the potential fragility of a fully cashless payment system, as outlined in its 2024 Payments Report, published in March.

At a time when the dominant narrative around cash -- as espoused by senior bankers, central bankers, big tech and fintech executives, politicians and economists, and of course, their ever-faithful servants in the media -- is that its demise is all but inevitable, even in countries where cash is still King (Germany, Spain, Austria, Mexico, Thailand, Japan...), the Riksbank's report may offer a cautionary tale. From the Heise Online piece (machine translated):

""The Swedish payments market has been digitized rapidly,"" states the Riksbank. Cash and manual payment services have been replaced by cards, mobile phones and internet services. ""As a result, payments have become faster, smoother and cheaper overall,"" which the institute points out is ""a positive development."" However, there are groups in society ""who do not have access to digital payment services or find it difficult to use them and are therefore marginalized"". There are also ""serious fraud problems that could undermine trust in the payment system.""

Digitalization also makes payments ""more vulnerable to cyber attacks and disruptions to the power grid and data communication,"" the bank points out. At the same time, the geopolitical developments of the past few years required ""Sweden to have strong civil defense."" The developments suggested ""that we should concentrate more than before on the challenges of digitalization.""

Put another way, cash does not crash. It does not fail in a power cut or seize up during a cyber attack (though, of course, ATMs might). By contrast, digital payment systems need a stable and continuous internet connection to process transactions. When these connections fail, the result is often chaos. Digital payment outages have caused significant disruption in a host of countries in recent years, including the US, the UK, Australia, Indonesia, Germany, Canada, Spain and Norway. Generally speaking, the more cashless the country, the greater the disruption.

Sweden's Cashless Journey

Sweden is one of the world's most cashless economies. In large part, its abandonment of cash was the result of technological and generational shifts. As payment technologies began to change in the first two decades of this century, most Swedish citizens began to prefer the speed, ease and convenience of digital payments.

They were also nudged heavily in that direction by commercial banks, which by 2016 had made 60% of their branches cashless, as a 2019 Riksbank working paper documents. This made it much more difficult for citizens to access cash and for businesses to deposit it, which in turn accelerated the uptake of digital payments and the abandonment.

Sweden's legal tender laws also made it possible for the Riksbank to withdraw many of Sweden's large denomination notes in circulation. For instance, the value of 1,000-krona notes (worth just over $90) in circulation declined gradually from SEK 48.4 billion in 2001 to SEK 21.4 billion in December 2012. Beginning in 2013, this decline accelerated, plunging to SEK 9.7 billion by December 2013.

After playing a part in the wholesale removal of cash from Sweden's economy, the Riksbank is now trying to reverse some of the damage it has caused. It is not the only Scandinavian central bank to have flagged up the fragility risks of exclusively digital payment systems. In 2022, the Bank of Finland recommended that the use of cash payments be guaranteed by law. Like all Nordic countries, Finland is a largely cash-free economy. But like Sweden, it has begun to see the risks of going too far, too soon.

In March 2022, the central bank initiated a proposal for legislation to ensure a minimal level of cash-paid services. In October of that year, the Head of the Payment Systems Department and Chief Cashier at the Bank of Finland, PÃ¤ivi Heikkinen, even advised households to make sure they have some cash on hand, just in case the country's payments system were to go down. At the time, Finland had just applied to become a NATO member and the government was fretting about the risk of cyber attacks from Russia. In an interview with the national broadcaster, Heikkinen said her intention was not to ""fabricate catastrophic scenarios"" -- before saying that in the worst case scenario, the payments system could go down for a period of weeks.

In Sweden, the Riksbank is already taking countermeasures to try to guarantee a steady supply of cash, the Heise Online article notes:

It is improving the cash supply by setting up new offices where companies can collect and deposit cash. Having such cash depots in more locations across the country would reduce both the costs for businesses and the risk that cash would no longer be usable in the event of a disruption.

This is the only way to ensure ""that everyone can pay"". In general, ""stronger legal protection for cash"" is necessary. Banks should be required to ""accept cash deposits, including coins, from individuals.""

The Riksbank supports its demands with reference to an annual representative survey on the payment habits of Swedes. According to this, ""cash is being used more frequently than before"". Almost half of respondents reported using cash in the past month, an increase of 15 percentage points compared to 2022.

This pro-active approach to bolstering the cash system contrasts sharply with what some central banks and governments are saying and doing in other Western or Western-adjacent countries. As we reported in August, Brazil's Chamber of Deputies is mulling a number of legislative proposals calling for an end to the printing, minting and circulation of physical notes and coins. As the World Economic Forum trumpeted in 2022, Brazilians are adopting digital payments faster than anyone else.

In Australia, the government refuses to legally protect the use of cash in retail settings. The Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, Michele Bullock, has even warned that as the running costs of processing cash for banks and businesses mount as a result of the declining share of consumer payments made using cash, it may become necessary to begin charging people for using cash in retail settings.

Granted, Australia is significantly larger and more sparsely populated than Sweden, making it much harder and more costly to transport money securely to all parts of the country, including remote parts of Queensland, Northern Territory and Western Australia. But whereas the Riksbank is talking about taking on a proactive role, together with other authorities and banks, to ensure that cash can be transported to and from retail outlets at reasonable prices, the RBA is talking about making consumers pay for the privilege of using cash. Meanwhile, Armaguard, Australia's largest currency transport business, servicing around 90% of the cash-in-transit market, is warning of bankruptcy -- unless the banks agree to pay more for its services.

Predictably, Bullock's suggestion that citizens may one day have to fork over extra fees for the privilege of paying with cash -- to protect the banks and retailers from the exorbitant costs of maintaining cash infrastructure -- did not go down well with many Australians. While most citizens are using digital payments for most, if not all, of their purchases, millions still depend on cash in their daily lives.

What's more, the very same Big Four banks Bullock wants to protect from having to part with extra money to fortify Australia's cash network have posted record or near-record profits in recent times, in part because of surging interest rates but also because of the rising fees they charge on card payments. Those same banks received huge sums of cheap debt to tide them over during the COVID-19 pandemic while at the same time closing hundreds of branches and ATMs across the country.

In Sweden, as Heisse Online notes, more and more Swedes see the decline in cash consumption as a negative development -- 44 percent in 2023 compared to 36 percent in the previous year:

The proportion of respondents who believe that they cannot get by without cash in today's society has also increased compared to 2022. This could also be ""an effect of increased crisis awareness due to the war in Ukraine,"" the bankers speculate.

The need to pay in cash in certain situations such as at clubs, in corner shops and at flea markets is also mentioned, the report goes on to say. Some also emphasized that using cash made it easier for them to keep track of their finances. Older people generally find it much more difficult to get by without cash than younger people. In the 2023 survey, half of respondents said they wanted to pay cash but the store did not accept it. In 2022 the corresponding value was only 37 percent...

These numbers suggest that cash may be experiencing something of a renaissance among key segments of Sweden's populations, which echoes similar trends seen elsewhere. For example, a recent survey down under by fintech company Waave revealed that as many as 71% of Australians are worried about the economy becoming completely cashless. Those most concerned include Baby Boomers (82%), regional Australians (77%), and lower income households earning less than $100k (75%) -- a reminder of the oft-ignored class-war element of the War on Cash.

It's not hard to see why concerns about the future of cash are on the rise down under. In recent months, three of Australia's Big Four banks have removed over-the-counter cash withdrawals from some of their branches while increasing numbers of businesses, both large and small, are choosing to reject cash payments altogether. In Australia, it is perfect legal for businesses to refuse to accept cash as long as they inform consumers of their stance before any ""contract"" for the supply of goods or services is entered into.

Aussie cash lovers recently expressed their displeasure with a ""Draw Out Some Cash Day"". According to news.com.au, hoards of people were seen lining up to withdraw cash on April 2:

The movement, led by the Cash is King Facebook group, aimed to show banks and retailers there is still a demand for cash amid warnings the country will be ""functionally cashless"" by 2025.

Social media posts show ""massive queues"" of people, both young and old, lining up at various banks around the country, with one woman sharing she waited for up to an hour to get her hands on bank notes.

""All banks I passed today had queues out the door,"" one person wrote on Facebook alongside a picture of people lining up outside a Commonwealth Bank branch.

Governments in other countries, including Ireland, Spain, Slovakia and Austria, are taking pro-active steps to protect the use of cash. In the UK, meanwhile, cash may even be staging a comeback after ten consecutive years of falling use. According to both UK Finance, the country's largest bank association, and the British Retail Consortium Group, the most influential retail lobbying group, cash use increased in 2022, for the first time in a decade. Whether this rebound represents a genuine trend reversal or merely a dead cat bounce (apologies, as always, to feline lovers) remains to seen. But the mere fact that cash use is growing at all despite concerted efforts by the government, banks and retailers is noteworthy.

So, too, is the fact that Sweden's Riksbank is expressing reservations about the resilience of a fully cashless society. After all, the Riksbank was one of the first central banks in Europe to begin aggressively undermining the role of cash in the economy. That said, its U-turn on cash it is not as novel a development as is suggested by the Heise Online article. The Riksbank, the article claims in its introduction, ""is suddenly emphasising the indispensable role of cash in secure, widely available payment systems. This is a change in strategy.""

That is somewhat misleading. As the German financial journalist Norbert HÃ¤ring notes (in German) on his blog, while there has definitely been a sea change in strategy at the Riksbank, that change did not begin just now but rather eight years ago, ""after the central bank, together with Sweden's commercial banks, had done everything they could to undermine the use of cash."" Since early 2016 Sweden's central bank has slowed the march towards a cashless society, as HÃ¤ring reported at the time.

Now, the Riksbank is not just questioning the wisdom of moving to a fully cashless economy at this current moment in time; it is explicitly warning about the potential risks such a move might entail. At the same time, it is working on developing a CBDC -- the so-called e-krona, now in its fourth and final pilot phase, looking at ""how an e-Krona can be used offline for payments if electricity and telecommunications are not working."" Which begs the question: once the e-krona is ready to launch, which will presumably be sooner than most other CBDCs in the West, how will it co-exist with cash? That will have to be the subject of a future article.",nakedcapitalism.com,news,naked capitalism,Nick Corbishley,0.2,453034155,1,,

Meanwhile, enemy attacks take advantage of a ""window of opportunity"" in order to inflict painful blows on Ukraine's energy sector.

WHICH OF UKRAINE'S ENERGY ASSETS HAVE BEEN TARGETS FOR RUSSIAN STRIKES

The attacks had the consequences as described below:

- On March 22, as part of a massive attack on the Ukrainian energy infrastructure, the Russian Federation targeted and hit a number of significant energy facilities, among them Dniproges (in Zaporizhzhia), Ukraine's largest hydroelectric power plant, and Thermal Power Plant No. 5 (in Kharkiv).

- The next massive attack occurred on April 11, when the Russian Federation launched more than 80 missiles and drones at critical infrastructure facilities in Kharkiv and nearby areas. Approximately at that same time, the Trypillia Thermal Power Plant, located outside of Kyiv, which used to supply power to several Ukrainian oblasts, sustained critical damage from Russia's missile attacks.

- On April 27, the Russians bombarded energy infrastructure assets in the Dnipropetrovsk, Ivano-Frankivsk, and Lviv oblasts. DTEK, Ukraine's biggest private energy supplier, reported that the enemy had inflicted massive strikes on four thermal power plants in Ukraine.

- On May 4, a power substation located in the Dnipropetrovsk Oblast was severely damaged as a result of a Russian attack, and energy facilities in the Kharkiv and Odesa Oblasts have been subject to continuous shelling attacks by Russia.

- Finally, overnight from May 7 to 8, Russia once again launched massive missile attacks on electricity generation and transmission facilities in Poltava, Kirovohrad, Zaporizhzhia, Lviv, and Ivano-Frankivsk Oblasts.

On the morning of May 8, Energy Minister, Herman Halushchenko reported via Facebook that the Energy Ministry is weighing the potentiality of a decision to introduce power blackouts in the regions most affected by Russian shelling attacks. Gas storage facilities also came under fire - the enemy has started shelling them along with other energy assets this year.

As the Cabinet of Ministers reported via its official website, as of May 8, electricity blackouts have been introduced for residents of the Kharkiv Oblast (200,000 consumers) and the city of Kryvyi Rih. ""In the past 24 hours, the consumer needs were covered by domestic generation and commercial imports. Meanwhile, at an urgent request from Poland, Ukraine was supplying electricity to that country in the evening peak hours. Today, at the request of Ukraine, an emergency supply of electricity is being carried out during the morning peak hours from the power systems of Poland, Romania, and Slovakia. In the evening hours, electricity supply limitations can be introduced for consumers.""

Back in March, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal reported that 80% of Ukraine's heat generation capacity has been destroyed. One of these days, Herman Halushchenko published data indicating that the projected losses are estimated to reach up to USD 1 billion and will continue to grow. It's is impossible to predict enemy attacks, but most analysts agree that they will continue, at least for as long as the enemy is in a position to reach out to our major energy facilities.

The impact of Russia meticulously destroying Ukrainian energy infrastructure can already be evaluated in economic terms, as seen in the recently published forecast by the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU). According to the document, electricity shortage will amount to 5-7% on average during the II-IV quarters of 2024, and that's including imports and partial recovery and restoration, and the installation of new generation capacities. The report states among other things: ""Economic recovery will continue, although it will be slow going, primarily due to significant damage done to energy facilities."" The NBU has cut is growth forecast for real GDP, due to the consequences of large-scale attacks, to 3% in 2024 and 4.5-5% in 2025-2026.

WHAT TO GET READY FOR?

In addition to the slowing down in the pace of economic recovery, the electricity shortage is casting doubt on whether Ukraine will be able to make the necessary preparations in time for the start of the new heating season, and to protect the already recovered or yet intact energy infrastructures from new attacks.

Should consumers be prepared for rolling blackouts next winter? Should they be looking for generators or stove-heated country houses? Will the energy system be able not only to restore what was lost, but also to change the Soviet-style approaches with their inclination to gigantism. Big power generating capacities left behind by the Soviet Union in Ukraine turned out to be a weak link amid war. Hitting one power generating facility that is critical to energy supply security of a vast territory isn't too much of a challenge for the enemy. Unfortunately. Can renewable types of energy generation - solar or wind power plants -- help Ukrainians survive the winter months of 2024-25; will the entire system have enough time to adjust and adapt, and will the European energy system support ours in the winter period?

Mykhailo Honchar, an expert in international energy and security relations, president of the Center for Global Studies ""Strategy XXI"", gives a brief, unequivocal answer to the question regarding Ukraine's ability to recover and rebuild its energy-generating capacity in due time. ""We will not have time to do this"", he says, and continues: ""The extent of the damage makes it impossible to build back or restore these facilities to working order. They need to be built from scratch."" However, the expert doesn't think that the extent of the destruction and damage is such as to entail catastrophic consequences for electricity consumers: ""Ukraine's new, unified system continues to operate, despite Russia's efforts to bring it into collapse.""

Olena Pavlenko, director of the ""Dixie Group"" think tank and the founder of the UA Energy website, deliberates about what kinds of assets have higher chances of being recovered or reconstructed. ""Infrastructure assets involved with the power transmission lines run by [the National Power Company] Ukrenergo or [Ukraine's largest hydro power generating company] Ukrhydroenergo, for example, have a better chance to resume operations as usual in time for the start of the new heating season, as funding for such facilities is provided by both donor countries (in substantial amounts) and the Ukrainian government"".

But things are not that good with coal generation, which has suffered severe damages due to Russian aggression. The gas generation industry, the expert believes, is facing severe challenges regarding recovery and restoration: ""International partners are reluctant to provide funding for what involves coal in the first place."" The only scenario, which experts consider somewhat ironically, but hope that it can become a reality, is that Germany, which is phasing out its coal-fired power stations from operation, can help us with equipment. Perhaps we will find out more similar examples. If this is the case, says Ms. Olena, there are chances part of these capacities will be restored.

Restoration of gas generation capacities, Olena Pavlenko explains, could be funded to a substantial extent by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) or the World Bank: ""If four conditions are in place and met, among which are a threat to national security and there are no alternative sources of funding, Ukraine meets all four the criteria to qualify for such funding. Next, the task for the government and diplomats will be to properly conduct these negotiations so that this window of opportunity is opened for us.""

HOW WILL WE BE ABLE TO SURVIVE THE WINTER?

The winter season 2023-24 went without any serious troubles in terms of electricity supply for the Ukrainians located at the home front. However, when forecasting prospects for the new winter season, experts recommend looking at the situation without rose-tinted glasses and keeping in mind the winter season 2022-2023 with its rolling blackouts, at least. Some, Mykhailo Honchar among them, offer an option involving the ""relocation to a country house heated by a wood stove in case of a protracted electricity outage, because nobody rules out the possibility of new Russian attacks and damages"".

Mykhailo Honchar: ""The current stock of power generation capacities is much lower than what it should be to ensure the smooth passage of the heating season 2024-2025. Add to this, we cannot predict new attacks or the damage they can bring along. Nobody doubts the possibility of new attacks. The situation in this regard looks thus: it is necessary to do as much as possible in terms of rebuilding and restoring what can be rebuilt and restored.""

The Russians are going on with the tactics they used in 2022-2023, aimed at destroying Ukraine's energy infrastructure. Whereas in the past they overestimated their ability to do this in one season, they are now taking advantage of the delay in financial aid and the delivery of weapons from Ukraine's partners, seeking to attack and hit what they can reach and adding large generating assets and gas storage facilities to their list of targets. ""After all, no one can guarantee you one hundred percent security,"" the expert explains.

Olena Pavlenko agrees that, although it's impossible to shield each and every large facility from strikes, what can be protected must be protected using all means available: ""The heavy strike the Russians made on our power generating capacities in March came as a wake-up call for many in the West. But a thermal power plant cannot be protected with an anti-drone net. For large objects like this, systemic solutions involving most particularly air defenses are what is needed. And the West seems to have understood this."" But will they be able to find enough air defense systems to cover every strategic object? Ms. Elena's answer is diplomatic: ""I'm sure that everyone will do everything possible to provide cover for yet intact facilities, given the situation where we are now.""

Should we place expectations on Europe's integrated energy system that is currently helping Ukraine withstand peak loads by supplying electricity? ""Regarding emergency assistance from the European energy system, to which we are an integral part from 2022, it may be insufficient. Because we cannot predict the peak consumption, as it depends on the weather conditions as well as on what will remain in operation or will be recovered. It's important to appreciate that aid of some kind will be there. But where the shortage of generation capacities becomes chronic, there will be nothing else left but to limit the consumption of electricity by introducing rolling blackouts"", the expert says.

""We are already using these opportunities in many ways,"" says Olena Pavlenko. ""Yes, in principle, opportunities for electricity importation will be opening up for us if necessary. But we must realize that we will have to pay the European price for the electricity we will buy. Energy will not be free for us, and the European Union, the expert is confident, is already working out options to help Ukraine compensate electricity shortages when and where needed.

But peak-time shortage can be significant. Let's say that Ukraine has the capacity to import up to 2 GW, whereas the shortage caused by shelling attacks in 2023 amounted to 4 GW. Based on these figures, we may not have enough of these capacities.

Olena Pavlenko agrees: ""At peak-consumption hours, this will not suffice even with continuous import. The question is how big the shortage will be. I repeat it again: any predictions can be made knowing the weather forecast and our actual capacity to reconstruct and recover"".

""In the winter of 2022-2023, we were able to restore 3 GW of generation. And that's not bad. If we can find resources and equipment again this year, then, in principle, we will get through the season successfully, although it will be difficult.""

WHAT ARE THE OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO UKRAINE?

""It is estimated that Ukraine will need about $17 billion in investments to fully restore its energy sector,"" Maksym Bevz and Oleh Savycky argue in an article published by Economic Pravda outlet. They argue that, in the current situation, it is the transition to renewable energy and to distributed, smaller generating capacities that would provide a way out. The authors suggest: ""In the face of increased attacks on our energy infrastructure, it is necessary to build distributed, highly maneuverable generating capacities and battery electricity storage facilities to ensure flexibility and sustainability of the energy system and of the investments in distribution networks.""

Olena Pavlenko considers the decentralization of generation capacities to be the only way out of the situation and a highly appropriate solution to reforming the system as a whole. ""This is a very appropriate decision, given the situation we are in now. My opinion is that this process of transition should be controlled, so that it is not some kind of chaotic placement of various objects in different territories, and in the future, heroic efforts to integrate this all into a single grid.""

For the time being, the question remains as to a unified vision of the system as a whole and of its development: ""A lot depends on how we see the further development of the economy. Where will we have large industrial facilities, where do we locate them? A large generator will have to be installed there. Where will the population be? The people have moved to other locations. We expect that people will be stimulated to return. If so, where to? Accordingly, this will also affect the planning of the decentralized system.""

The idea of renewable energy is very good, but Mykhailo Honchar emphasizes two aspects: relatively high cost of battery storage facilities and of installation operations. It will not be possible to find a sufficient amount of such equipment for the entire country, and even less so if the equipment is needed ""earlier than yesterday"". The expert makes mention of another option, which is to ""...use the capabilities of our gas transit system. There are excessive capacities of gas compressor stations, where generators can be installed, and they too could produce additional volumes of shunting power generation for the entire system. But again, this is not the first year they have been talking about it, but nothing has been done.""

The transition to decentralized generation, that is, the creation of small generation facilities, can save the situation, but not everywhere. Mykhailo Honchar continues: ""Basically, such facilities will work on gas; if they are the dispersed throughout regions, it will be a salvation for everyone. In theory, this is correct, but it is also not an issue that will be resolved in a few months. Some regions will have time to purchase or receive a mobile or compact boiler installation in a few months, but some will not have time to do this. It, this boiler installation, still needs to be contracted, because in warehouses in Europe or America, they are not stored in thousands and waiting to be ordered. If we are talking about all of Ukraine, this will take years.

It takes time to implement new technologies and approaches, and, again, it is not measured in months, but in years. And so far for the entire country, the starting point in structural reorganization is not yet visible. Instead, we still rely on nuclear energy. Olena Pavlenko says that there are projects for construction of new nuclear power units, but, again, this is not a matter of the upcoming Fall, but of several years.

Mykhailo Honchar agrees: ""One way or another, our basic generation is atomic, and it will remain so. Currently, we get 70% of our electricity production from nine power units at three nuclear power plants. That is why it is important to ensure they remain operational. To this end, he continues, ""our partners from the ""coalition of the determined"", including France in the first place, should decide to set up a humanitarian mission with a mandate covering the western regions of Ukraine, stretching from the north, along the boundaries of, say, Rivne Nuclear Power Plant (NPP), Khmelnytska NPP, and South Ukrainian NPP, in order to provide air defense for this area, where our main generating and transmission facilities are located. Roughly speaking, everything that flies into this area from the Russian territory -- cruise missiles, drones - must be destroyed by the air forces of those countries that will be ready to do this mission.""

The ability to adapt, to act in concert and in an asymmetric way - this is what wartime conditions require for the energy sector among others - to enable it to withstand the blow and recover in such a way so that the enemy could not deliver destructive strikes in the future. This will preclude hits on large infrastructural targets on the one hand, and will give an opportunity to rebuild Ukraine's energy supply system into a decentralized one, on the other. And this opportunity must be availed of immediately, along with an opportunity to provide maximum protection possible for large targets.

The situation regarding the recovery and restoration of the energy system as shelling attacks never end is impossible to predict. But there must be an understanding that part of the lost capacities will definitely be recovered -- despite the hard times and with joint efforts. What Ukraine will need to do after that happens is to fight, protect infrastructures and hope for a warm winter. The enemy will anyway not be able to break us, because light always prevails over darkness.",ukrinform.net,news,Ukrinform-EN,,-0.2862745098039216,453032794,49,https://static.ukrinform.com/photos/2024_05/thumb_files/630_360_1715173658-319.jpg,eng-9556774

They argue that bloc must not only pay more attention to non-EU operators, but take greater responsibility over its own energy system. What are your views?

The EU's climate agenda is in trouble. The Green Deal, which aims to slash the bloc's carbon emissions by 55% by 2030, had started off promisingly after several major pieces of legislation were adopted, including its ban on the sale of new combustion-powered vehicles from 2035 and new carbon border tax. Increasingly, however, Europeans are rebelling against green restrictions of which they have difficulty seeing the advantages.

Another less reported upon but equally important threat to the bloc's ecological and energy transition comes from the alarming number of Chinese and US companies moving into the EU power sector.

In our book, Energy: How to Recover Our European Ambition (published in French), we shed light on this overlooked issue ahead of European elections that will be critical for the EU's energy strategy, and call on the bloc to carefully weigh up cooperation and competition with sovereignty.

While there currently isn't any quantitative data on China's share in the European energy market, we do know the country detains 80% of the global clean-technology manufacturing capacity in 11 segments, from solar wafers to many lithium-ion battery components.

Taking advantage of the sovereign debt crisis in Europe, Chinese investors first stepped in to acquire substantial stakes in what have long been regarded as ""sovereign"" sectors, such as power transmission and distribution grids, in the early 2010s. Key among those was the world's largest utility company, the State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC), commonly known as the State Grid - the world's fourth-biggest company overall by revenue, behind Walmart, Saudi Aramco and Amazon as of March. Also increasingly present is Three Gorges Corp, responsible for the world's largest hydroelectric power complex.

For instance, in Portugal, Three Gorges Corp. won the bidding for the Portuguese government's 21% stake in EDP-Energias de Portugal SA in 2010. Meanwhile, in Italy, SGCC expanded its presence by collaborating with the Italian government in 2014, acquiring a 35% share in the CDP Reti fund, thereby attaining a blocking minority at the local gas network operator, SNAM, and electricity transmission network operator, Terna. Similarly, in Greece the State Grid made substantial inroads by acquiring a 24% stake in the national electricity transmission network operator from the Greek government in 2016.

While Portugal, Italy, and Greece were primary targets, Chinese investors have also acquired grids in Luxembourg. Last but not least, let's not forget China's green-tech industry has flooded Europe with cheap solar panels and electric vehicles (EVs).

The stakes are all the higher because China is not the only country with ambitions in the EU: The United States is also seeking to benefit from the bloc's poorly thought-out energy strategy.

Russia's war against Ukraine has not weakened the United States' energy dominance in the world, and more specifically in the EU. Indeed, while Russian gas was expected to act as a bridge fuel in the energy transition, particularly for Germany, the EU was quick to adopt sanctions against its long-term trade partner that minimised its dependence. Partly filling the vacant space left by Moscow, the United States has become the leading producer and exporter of LNG to Europe. This development favours US trade while domestic energy costs are kept low, further widening the price gap, with Europe experiencing an energy inflation and undermining its relative competitiveness and attractiveness to energy-intensive industry.

Beyond these energy-supply issues, EU member states are struggling to carve out a common vision, highlighting the challenges of sovereignty and strategic autonomy. European companies, particularly in France, have endeavoured to develop fourth-generation small modular nuclear reactors (SMR), with an attempt to create a European nuclear alliance made in November 2023. But at the same moment, countries such as Italy, Belgium, and Romania have partnered with the American Westinghouse Electric Company to develop lead-cooled fast reactors.

Here again, the coordination gap plays to the advantage of American influence in Europe, as confirmed by John Kerry in September 2023. As part of the international consortium ""Clean Fuel from SMR"", led by American companies, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Poland were selected to participate and will receive support for coal-to-SMR feasibility studies. These EU countries are turning to the Americans to build new nuclear power plants, mainly because of their funding and technical expertise, while the EU continues to block all support for nuclear projects developed on its soil.

The scale of these foreign investments in renewable energies, new nuclear facilities and grid development could come to bear heavily onto the bloc's strategic independence at a time when it's looking to decarbonise.

These investments raise concerns over continental energy security, given the still fragmented nature of Europe's energy landscape:

The main challenge for Europe is ending one dependency without falling into another. To replace imports of fossil fuels (coal, gas, and oil), harmful to the climate, the EU member states must accelerate and coordinate the development of their ""green"" technologies.

These risks demand that the bloc not only pays more attention to non-EU operators, but take greater responsibility over its own energy system. How can it do this, all while pursuing the vision of the ""green, secure and affordable energy supply"" set out in its Green Deal?

For starters, we recommend EU member states work harder on building truly European energy grids. As we move toward decarbonisation, we can expect an array of renewable energies to increasingly power our electricity system. These arrangements will require extensive and interconnected networks on a European scale, which must be consolidated and developed by the EU member states themselves.

A second emergency is green energy financing. In November, the European Climate Neutrality Observatory warned a lack of EU-level public investment in green energy and other advances could lead the bloc to fail to meet its net-zero goals. Rather than take heed of the warning, member states axed the fund earmarked for renewables and clean tech - the Strategic Technologies for Europe Platform (STEP) - to 1.5bn in February. Our book calls for a radical change of strategy, through the creation of a ""European transition savings account"" to attract private savings, on the one hand, and a ""European sovereign fund"" that receives proceeds from carbon-pricing revenues on the other.

Whether these actually come into being will depend on the upcoming European elections. Results leaning toward a higher European ambition could help us see in clean, affordable and secure solutions. At the other end of the spectrum, further veering to the nationalistic right could carry harmful effects for the bloc's economic clout and, paradoxically, sovereignty.",energyindemand.com,news,Energy in Demand - Sustainable Energy - Rod Janssen,Rod Janssen,0.0117647058823529,453032450,7,https://energyindemand.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/icon-04.png?w=240,

Bulgaria and Azerbaijan have a common interest in using their strategic position and advantages to build both energy, transport and digital connectivity, with which to contribute to the security and stability of the entire region and to intensify the exchange between Asia and Europe. This was stated today Head of State Rumen Radev, who is on an official visit to the Republic of Azerbaijan at the invitation of President Ilham Aliyev.

At a ceremony in the Zagulba residence, Rumen Radev and Ilham Aliyev signed a Joint Declaration on strengthening the strategic partnership between Bulgaria and Azerbaijan. According to the Bulgarian head of state, the document is an expression of the significant potential and the mutual desire for the excellent bilateral relations to develop actively for the prosperity of the two friendly countries and peoples.

In the presence of the two presidents, a Memorandum of Understanding was also signed between the state oil company of Azerbaijan SOCAR and Asarel Investment JSC, a contract for joint operation between Bulgaria Air and the Azerbaijan National Airlines on the line Sofia-Baku-Sofia, and the resumed through flights will start operating in the coming months, a Memorandum of Understanding between the Ministry of Innovation and Growth of Bulgaria and the Ministry of Digital Development and Transport of Azerbaijan for cooperation in the field of technological innovation and research and development, which lay the foundation for joint projects and initiatives at government and business level.

In his statement, President Radev highlighted the intensive dialogue at the highest political level between Bulgaria and Azerbaijan, which contributes to the development of a number of initiatives not only bilaterally, but also contributes to the strengthening of Europe's energy security, as well as stability and economic development of the Caucasus and the Black Sea region.

Azerbaijan has become a key partner of Bulgaria in the field of energy and has made a significant contribution to the diversification of natural gas supplies for the Bulgarian economy, Rumen Radev noted. The head of state recalled that in the autumn of 2022, in the presence of President Aliyev, the intersystem gas connection Greece-Bulgaria (IGB) was opened in Sofia, which established the connection with the Southern Gas Corridor and practically changed the energy map of the region. President Radev also pointed to the memorandum of cooperation signed in April 2023 in Sofia between the operators of the gas transmission systems of Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Slovakia and the state oil company of Azerbaijan SOCAR for the transfer of additional quantities of Azeri gas to Europe, based on the Bulgarian initiative Solidarity Ring. As an indicator of the long-term prospects of cooperation between Bulgaria and Azerbaijan in the field of energy, President Radev stated the joint opening with his colleague Aliyev of the SOCAR office in Sofia.

The strategic partnership at the highest level has led to the development and deepening of contacts at the government level, between companies and municipalities from both countries, the head of state also emphasised and highlighted the importance of fostering the trade-economic partnership and the development of connectivity in all its dimensions - energy, transport and digital exchange in the field of high technologies, partnership in innovation, green policies and technologies, environmental protection, tourism, education, science and culture.

Rumen Radev stressed the importance of the agreements signed today between Bulgarian and Azeri companies, which contribute to Azerbaijan's ambition to establish itself as a leading country in the region in terms of environmental protection using modern technologies, including the use of unmanned cargo drones. President Aliyev invited the Bulgarian head of state to participate in the UN climate change summit COP 29, which will be hosted by Azerbaijan.

The rich cultural and historical heritage of Bulgaria and Azerbaijan is a solid basis for the subsequent strengthening of bilateral cultural exchange, the two presidents emphasised at their meeting. In this regard, Rumen Radev noted the importance of the initiative for cooperation between the historical capitals of the two countries, Veliko Tarnovo and Shusha, which arose during the last visit of President Aliyev to Bulgaria, in the field of cultural and historical heritage. Rumen Radev expressed his appreciation for the personal contribution of President Ilham Aliyev to start the projects to not only preserve the cultural heritage of Veliko Tarnovo, but also to popularise it and facilitate access to it.

The President of Azerbaijan emphasised the active political dialogue between Bulgaria and Azerbaijan at the highest level, which, in his words, significantly contributes to the expansion of bilateral relations in all spheres of mutual interest and to the achievement of new successes. The trade exchange between the two countries and the volume of natural gas supplies from Azerbaijan to Bulgaria are increasing annually, Ilham Aliyev pointed out. He pointed to the important role of the Bulgarian side in supplying Azeri gas to the European market and strengthening the security of the energy sector in Europe. The transit of Azeri gas to neighbouring countries takes place through the territory of Bulgaria, and the number of countries that take advantage of this opportunity is increasing, the President of Azerbaijan pointed out. Ilham Aliyev also highlighted the interest of Azerbaijan in deepening the partnership with Bulgaria for the implementation of the project for the so-called green cable for the transmission of green electricity to Europe.

Rumen Radev was welcomed by the head of state of Azerbaijan with an official ceremony, the two presidents held a one-to-one session and led the plenary talks between the delegations of the two countries. The delegation led by the Bulgarian president includes the interim Minister of Energy, the chair of the Bulgaria-Azerbaijan Friendship Group in the National Assembly and business representatives, who also signed a number of bilateral agreements with their partners within the framework of a joint business meeting.

As part of his visit to Azerbaijan, President Rumen Radev also held a meeting with the Speaker of the Parliament of the Republic of Azerbaijan, Prof Sahiba Gafarova. Later in the day, the head of state talked with Bulgarian specialists working in the field of sports in Azerbaijan. In Baku, President Radev laid wreaths at the Heydar Aliyev monument and on the Alley of Martyrs.

Ukraine this week said it uncovered a network of Russian agents in the country who planned to assassinate President Volodymyr Zelensky, including two colonels who worked for the agency in charge of his security.

The Ukrainian domestic intelligence service (SBU) on Tuesday said the two were tasked by Moscow with finding people in Zelensky's security detail who would take the president hostage and later kill him.

The agency they worked for, known as the State Protection Service, oversees security for Ukraine's president as well as ministers and other top officials.

One of the colonels, the SBU said, had purchased weapons and drones for the operation and was recorded in conversation with his handlers at the FSB, the Russian spy agency.

The alleged conspiracy was the latest in a series of foiled Russian plots that Ukrainian authorities said were intended to kill or capture the president, since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. It comes just weeks after Ukrainian and Polish authorities announced the arrest a Polish citizen accused of helping Russia's military intelligence carry out such an assassination plot.

Russia carried out a ""massive"" missile attack on Ukrainian energy infrastructure overnight into Wednesday in the biggest aerial onslaught by Russian forces for weeks.

Russia used 76 air attack weapons in the assault, including 55 missiles and 21 drones launched from Russia and Russian controlled areas, according to Ukrainian Air Force Commander Mykola Oleshchuk. At least 59 weapons were destroyed overnight, he added.

The attacks targeted power generation and transmission facilities in Ukraine's Poltava, Kirovohrad, Zaporizhzhia, Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk and Vinnytsia regions, the country's Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko posted on Telegram.

""The enemy wants to deprive us of the ability to generate and transmit electricity in sufficient quantities. Saving electricity is a contribution of each of us to the victory,"" Halushchenko said.

The EU this week reached a deal to seize profits from Russia's frozen assets to fund weapons and aid for Ukraine within months.

EU senior diplomats meeting on Wednesday agreed a compromise on using the estimated 4.4 billion euros windfall profits to aid Ukraine, smoothing over a dispute about taxation and management costs in Belgium, the country where most of the frozen assets are held.

Euroclear, a clearing house in Brussels, holds 191 billion euros of the 260 billion euros of Russian Central Bank assets that were immobilised by western governments in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022. In February the clearing house reported 4.4 billion euros interest on the Russian funds and forecast that the Belgian government would reap 1.085 billion euros in taxes.

The final amount for Ukraine has yet to be confirmed, but should be available in July.

The EU -- wary of the legal ramifications of seizing the entire cache of Russian assets -- decided it could give the profits to Ukraine, after concluding Moscow had no legal right to these funds.

North Macedonia elected its first woman president Wednesday as the governing Social Democrats suffered historic losses in twin presidential and parliamentary elections. Conservative-backed Gordana Siljanovska-Davkova, a 70-year-old law professor, was declared the winner after receiving nearly 65 per cent support in a presidential runoff. In parliamentary elections, a coalition led by conservative VMRO-DPMNE won 43 per cent of the vote, while the Social Democrat-led coalition that has held power for the least seven years struggled to hold onto second place with 14.8 per cent.

Croatia's ruling conservatives on Wednesday meanwhile agreed to form a coalition with an extreme party, which would push the country further to the right ahead of next month's European parliamentary election. The governing Croatian Democratic Union, or HDZ, and the far-right Homeland Movement reached the agreement weeks after an inconclusive parliamentary vote that has stirred political uncertainty. Croatia's dominant HDZ won most votes at the election but not enough to stay in power on their own.

Chinese President Xi Jinping was in Budapest on Thursday, where he and Hungarian PM Viktor OrbÃ¡n discussed trade, investment and signed a series of cooperation deals. Hungary is currently the only EU country participating in China's Belt and Road infrastructure and investment initiative. Before arriving in Hungary, Xi visited Serbia where he and Serb President Aleksandar VuÄiÄ agreed to follow a ""shared future"". Serbia will also become the first European country in years to enter into a free trade agreement with China when a deal signed last year comes into effect on July 1.

The European Union is poised to close the chapter on its long-running dispute with Poland over democratic backsliding under the previous nationalist government. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Monday the so-called Article 7 procedure, which was launched in 2017 and threatened to strip Warsaw of its voting rights, can be closed. Earlier this year, the commission decided to free up as much as 137 billion euros in blocked aid to Poland after Donald Tusk's government presented a plan to restore judicial independence, the main point of contention with the EU.

Tensions around Georgia's controversial draft ""foreign agents"" law could hit the country's economy and investor confidence, the president of the EBRD Odile Renaud-Basso warned on Tuesday. The draft legislation would require organisations receiving more than 20 per cent of their funding from abroad to register as foreign agents, a requirement opponents attack as authoritarian and Kremlin-inspired. The draft legislation has sparked protests across Georgia while Brussels and Washington have urged Tbilisi to drop it or risk harming its chances of European Union membership and a broader Euro-Atlantic future.

Armenia said on Wednesday that it has stopped making financial contributions to the Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO) after effectively suspending its membership in the Russian-led military alliance. ""Armenia will refrain from signing up to the November 23, 2023, decision on the CSTO budget for 2024 and, thereby, from participating in the financing of the organisation's activities,"" Armenian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Ani Badalian told several media outlets, including Armenia's Public Television.

Police in Slovakia are trying to find out who sent more than 1,000 bomb threats to schools and other institutions on Tuesday. Police teams with sniffer dogs and bomb disposal experts were called out repeatedly across the country. The alerts prompted mass evacuations. Officials said they were treating the threats ""as a particularly serious crime of terrorist attack"". Emails from an anonymous sender reportedly began arriving at 05:00, alleging that explosives were stored in hundreds of schools spanning the country's eight regions.

Romania-based Early Game Ventures (EGV), a venture capital firm, on Thursday announced the launch of a new 60 millions euros fund -- Early Game Ventures Fund II, to invest in early-stage start-ups in CEE. The fund received 30 million euros from the European Investment Fund's Recovery Equity Fund, financed by the National Plan for Recovery and Resilience under the Next Generation EU. The new fund will invest in early-stage technology start-ups with a focus on areas such as cyber security, enterprise software, and AI applications.

It has been a long week. Everyone is, I'm sure worn out. So far, Rosie seems to be tolerating her third chemo treatment much better than her first two. I want to thank everyone for the good thoughts, kind wishes, and prayers for her. Also, there was a misfire with the GoFundMe. Nothing involving what TaMara did, just some back end issues that have to be resolved. Which is why I asked TaMara to pull it down for now. She has and anyone that already donated will be getting a full refund. Thank you all so much, but for now it's not going forward. Should we get the issues resolved, things change, and we put it back up, we'll let everyone know. But I do want anyone who did donate and who is getting a refund to know that I appreciate what you did very, very, very much!

As I have been writing tonight's update, so about the past 20 minutes - it's now 6:50 PM EDT - the air raid alerts have begun to go up over Ukraine. When I started writing around 6:30 PM EDT, air raid alerts were up over Luhansk and Crimea, which is normal as they are always up over Luhansk and Crimea. They were also up over Mykolaiv and Odesa Oblasts. Over the past twenty minutes air raid alerts have gone up over Sumy, Kharkiv, and Donetsk Oblasts.

It's now 7:10 PM EDT and the air raid alerts for Sumy, Kharkiv, and Donetsk Oblasts have been taken down.

The Russians hammered Sumy Oblast again today. And by hammered, I mean attempted to pulverize!

Russian forces attacked Sumy Oblast 302 times in 60 separate attacks throughout the day, firing at 11 communities along the border on May 9, the Sumy Oblast Military Administration reported.

The communities of Bilopillia, Yunakivka, Khotin, Krasnopillia, Velyka Pysarivka, Shalyhyne, Novoslobidske, Seredyna-Buda, Esman, Myropillia, and Putyvl were targeted.

Throughout the day, Russia assailed the border communities with mortar, drone, rockets, and artillery attacks, while dropping explosives from drones onto two of the communities.

No casualties or injuries were reported.

The town of Velyka Pysarivka, located directly on Ukraine-Russia border, with a pre-war population of about 4,000 residents, experienced the bulk of the attacks reported with 67 explosions recorded in the area.

Given the town's proximity to Russia, Velyka Pysarivka has become a main target of attack for Russia over recent months. Much of the community's infrastructure has been destroyed by Russian attacks.

Russian strikes against Sumy Oblast have become increasingly destructive in recent months. Amid intensified attacks, Ukrainian authorities ordered increased evacuations from the region.

Shelling is a daily occurrence for the communities near Ukraine's northeastern border with Russia, with residents in the region's vulnerable border settlements experience multiple attacks per day.

The Russians have not forgotten about and are not finished with Kharkiv:

9 May 2024 - 20:41

Dear Ukrainians!

The key points for today.

I held a meeting with the leadership of the Ukrainian Defense Forces: Commander-in-Chief Syrskyi, Chief of the General Staff Barhylevych, and Defense Minister Umerov. We discussed how to speed up the supply of weapons from our partners and how to act now, with the available forces and means, with the available weapons, to achieve the results we need. We see what the occupier is preparing for. There will be a response. And I thank all our soldiers and commanders, every unit that is effectively operating at the front and destroying the occupier. The Kraken unit of the Defense Intelligence of Ukraine deserves special gratitude for its fighting these days. I am grateful to you, guys! And to everyone who gives Ukraine the result. The result we need so much. Today, I have also appointed Oleksandr Trepak as a new commander of the Special Operations Forces. He is a decent man, a strong warrior, a Hero of Ukraine.

The second for today. The visit of the President of the European Parliament Roberta Metsola to Ukraine. It is very symbolic that today, on Europe Day, our conversation with journalists was interrupted by an air raid alert. This is what the Russian Nazis want to replace life with, not just in Ukraine, but in our entire Europe, wherever their terrorist strikes reach. They will neither intimidate nor break Ukraine, nor will they break all those who bravely and resolutely help us defend life. Madam President of the European Parliament is exactly the kind of leader who has been with us since the first days of this war, and has always supported us as much as we need. Today, we discussed with Roberta what other political and defense steps are needed to ensure that we can truly withstand all the attacks and thwart Russia's offensive and destabilization plans.

Today I would also like to thank all the participants of the Second Summit of Ukrainian and European Communities held here in Kyiv. The countries of the European Union, as well as the United States, were represented. It is very important that there are cooperation agreements between our communities and the communities and companies of partner countries: Germany, Poland, Moldova, Slovakia, Austria, Romania, and the United States. These include the development of healthcare in Ukraine, rehabilitation opportunities in our communities, as well as the development of transport, recovery. I am grateful to all the participants of the Summit - every community, every country that stands with Ukraine, filling each of the agreements reached with real cooperation.

And of course, there was a lot of international communication today. The President of the European Council, Charles Michel. Also, I have just spoken with the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen. We are actively preparing the next stage of rapprochement with the European Union for June - we anticipate the adoption of the negotiating framework and the actual start of negotiations on Ukraine's accession. Our country, our people deserve this. And the European Union needs this step not just politically, as it is the lifeblood of the European Union to be a European project that leaves no one outside the EU, no one who truly professes European values. And I was also pleased today to hear the full support of our European friends for the Peace Summit - I am grateful to every leader who has already confirmed their participation in the Summit and is willing to help us effectively in engaging leaders.

Today, in conversations, I personally invited the Presidents of Moldova, the Czech Republic and Ghana, as well as the Prime Minister of Ireland to the Summit. Of course, we also discussed our bilateral agenda. Moldova - we have obvious common challenges and help each other. The Czech Republic - I expressed my gratitude for the initiative on artillery, and the most important thing now is the full and immediate implementation of the initiative. Ghana - the world relies on the stability and development of Africa. We have recently opened an embassy in Ghana, and this country now has a new accredited ambassador in Kyiv. Together we can add more strength to our parts of the world. Ireland - I thanked them for their support of our state and people, I thanked them for the fact that Ireland is really trying to help us politically, and also in the protection of life - in the demining of our land. And this support will increase - more territory of Ukraine will be cleared of Russian mines and ordnance.

So, this day and this week added support to our warriors, our state, our diplomacy. and to the Peace Summit. Every day in the diplomatic marathon, we are making the Peace Summit and the approach of peace a reality. Thank you to all the leaders who help!

I thank everyone who defends Ukraine and life! I thank everyone who gives us strength!

â¡ï¸Bloomberg: Pentagon blocks Russian military from accessing Starlink in Ukraine.

The U.S. Pentagon is preventing the Russian military from using Starlink internet terminals operated on the battlefield in Ukraine, John Plumb, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Space Policy at the U.S. Department of Defense, said in an interview with Bloomberg on May 9.

https://kyivindependent.com/bloomberg-pentagon-blocks-russian-military-from-accessing-starlink-in-ukraine/

Frankly I'm amazed by this. Here are the details from The Kyiv Independent:

The U.S. Pentagon is preventing the Russian military from using Starlink internet terminals operated on the battlefield in Ukraine, John Plumb, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Space Policy at the U.S. Department of Defense, said in an interview with Bloomberg on May 9.

Starlink, recognized for its superior security compared to cellular or radio signals, is deemed crucial for Ukrainian operations. Last year, the Pentagon reached an agreement with SpaceX to financially support access for the Ukrainian military.

Earlier this year, Ukraine's military intelligence chief told the Wall Street Journal that Russian forces in Ukraine are using thousands of Starlink satellite communications terminals made by Elon Musk's SpaceX.

According to Plumb, the U.S. has become ""heavily involved in working with the government of Ukraine and SpaceX to counter Russian illicit use of Starlink terminals.""

Ukraine heavily depends on Starlink, having reported last year that approximately 42,000 terminals were in operation across the military, hospitals, businesses, and aid organizations.

""At this time we have successfully countered Russian use, but I am certain Russia will continue to try and find ways to exploit Starlink and other commercial communications systems,"" Plumb said. ""It will continue to be a problem, I think we've wrapped our heads around it and found good solutions with both Starlink and Ukraine.""

The American official did not specify what tactics are being used to block Russian access to Starlink terminals inside Ukraine.

Following the publication of Budanov's interview with the WSJ, two Democrats in the U.S. Congress, Jamie Raskin and Robert Garcia, opened an investigation into Elon Musk's SpaceX company, demanding information on Russia's alleged usage of the Starlink satellite internet terminals.

Ukraine's military intelligence said that Russia has allegedly been purchasing Starlink terminals from ""Arab countries,"" citing intercepted communications.

Elon Musk denied that SpaceX had sold Starlink units to Russia and said Starlink would not connect to any devices there.

Both military intelligence and media reports said that Russian forces connected Starlink in occupied Ukraine, not on Russian territory.

Plumb affirmed that SpaceX has become a ""reliable partner"" in Ukraine.

""To me, they're a very reliable partner, and they are also 'innovating at speed,' providing services that are useful to the Defense Department.""

SpaceX began providing the Starlink terminals to Ukraine shortly after the Russian full-scale invasion in February 2022.

The potential/expected Russian spring offensive:

""This used to be an old Soviet radio station, but we have gutted it and installed this equipment given to us by volunteers. We did it all ourselves,"" Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Timchenko, commander of the air-defence unit, says proudly. Plots on the monitor show the flight paths of Russian jets, helicopters and missiles. Lines showing Smerch rockets travelling at 1,400kph (900mph) criss-cross the screen; one heads directly towards the hamlet, but passes overhead. A Russian warplane comes close to the front, releases its bomb and makes a -turn. Less than a minute later the glide bomb (a regular bomb fitted with fins to greatly increase its range) disappears from the screen, exploding well inside Ukraine.

Colonel Timchenko's air-defence unit cannot hit the Russian planes and has no way of intercepting glide bombs. Its job is to warn artillery units and mobile groups operating along the front. Hidden in the brush on a hill a few kilometres from the hamlet, three of the battalion's 250 men huddle around a Strela-10, an old Soviet short-range mobile surface-to-air missile system. Designed to bring down planes, it now hunts Russian drones. In the eight months that Colonel Timchenko has been here his men have shot down 50.

Tall and composed, the commander is a Russian-speaker from Kharkiv. He has been fighting since February 2015, a year after Vladimir Putin first invaded Crimea and the eastern Donbas, supposedly to ""save"" Russian-speakers like him. The war, he says, is not about language, ethnicity or even territory, but a way of life. ""I don't want to be part of Russia. I don't want to go to prison for expressing my opinions. I want my children to grow up in a normal country, maybe not a rich country, but a free country."" An avid reader of Alexander Solzhenitsyn, he does not want to live in a new ""Gulag Archipelago"".

The purpose of the fighting around Chasiv Yar is not to retain every inch of land, but to prevent the Russian army from sweeping across the rest of Ukraine and taking its main cities, including Kharkiv, Dnipro, Odessa and Kyiv. Similarly, Mr Putin is not interested in the Donbas for its territory; he is trying to subjugate Ukraine and end its quest to become part of the European order. Last week Emmanuel Macron, France's president, told The Economist that this order could perish ""much more quickly than we think"". Ukraine is where the fight is taking place.

A year ago, as Ukraine readied for its counter-offensive, just holding its own positions was considered the most pessimistic scenario. Now, as Russia prepares for a fresh push, it is considered the best case. From soldiers to generals, everyone The Economist spoke to over the past week knows that Ukraine lacks the resources to get back to its 1991 borders, as its politicians have promised. ""I suggest to anyone who talks of 1991 borders to come as far as Bakhmut,"" Colonel Timchenko says, referring to a town Ukraine lost a year ago after months of savage fighting.

At stake now is not Ukraine's territorial integrity, but its survival. Slowing Russian forces in the Donbas is crucial. Colonel Pavlo Fedosenko, commander of the 92nd, who helped liberate Kharkiv province in September 2022, is now fighting some 350km south-east of the city. ""Everyone knows that if we don't fight for Kostiantynivka and Druzhkivka [Russia's probable next target], Russian forces will be in Dnipro, Kharkiv, Kryvyi Rih a few weeks later,"" he says. He thinks there is a ""70% chance"" that Russia can occupy the rest of the Donbas region. The question is how long it might take, and how much damage Ukraine can inflict in the process.

Fearing escalation, the West has never given Ukraine all the weapons it needs. After a six-month gap in American supplies caused by Republican obstruction, it has enough ammunition to survive but not to defeat Russia's forces. By the time a new American aid package was approved on April 24th, it was rationing ammunition. Colonel Fedosenko says he was down to five shells a day for his American Paladin howitzers. ""What am I supposed to do with this number of shells? My men were fighting with spades in trenches."" He hopes the $61bn package's effects will be felt in days, as many of the weapons have been pre-positioned in Poland.

Although Russia has the edge in shells and manpower, Colonel Fedosenko feels it may have reached its peak. Only a few weeks ago, he says, Russian infantry backed by ten to 20 armoured vehicles and tanks were launching assaults every two to three hours. Now they attack only every five days or so, using motorcycles and quad bikes to avoid kicking up dust and advancing in small groups to hunt for weak spots.

Some 70% of the Russian soldiers in such assaults are former convicts, says Colonel Fedosenko. He also sees Tajik, Uzbek, Turkmen, Cuban and Somali mercenaries. Many soldiers have never been in combat before. ""Our interceptions suggest they are scraping the barrel, using whoever they can force into battle -- cooks, builders, mechanics, anyone."" He knows that many Russian soldiers have no choice. ""Most of the prisoners I take are guys from small towns and villages. They tell us that either they get killed here or they get killed there if they run."" Some shoot themselves rather than surrender.

For now, however, Russian forces continue to advance. While Ukraine is not collapsing, it is losing about 20 sq km a week. Mr Putin may want to inflict maximum damage before 's 75th anniversary party in July, to humiliate the West and force Ukraine into negotiations. But since he has not advertised his fresh offensive he would not need to admit its failure either.

Meanwhile, Mr Putin is strangling Ukraine's economy by knocking out much of its electricity generation and wearing down the civilian population by bombing cities. Kharkiv, which is already rationing electricity, is being hit by glide bombs almost daily. Yet the city of more than 1m people is keeping calm and carrying on. On a sunny afternoon last week, residents strolled through a park and attendants went on emptying rubbish bins, even as two glide bombs landed with huge explosions less than a kilometre away. Keeping the city functioning and clean is a way to stand up to destruction and chaos.

With around 50,000 fresh Russian troops gathering across the border some 40km away, Kharkiv's commanders know they may be a target in Russia's next push. One scenario would be to isolate the city by cutting the main road to Kyiv. Another would be to move some 10km closer, putting the city's eastern outskirts within artillery range and creating a buffer zone to protect Belgorod, a Russian city that is being hit by Ukrainian drones.

Konstantin Nemichev is the commander of the famous Kraken regiment, a special-forces outfit formed in the early days of the invasion in 2022 that defended Kharkiv. He expects the enemy to attack the province again in mid-May, but reckons they will fail to get near the city. Interviewed outside a ruined school building in the east of town, the site of an intense firefight in 2022 in which invading soldiers were wiped out, the commander says the defence is much stronger now. It has three lines of fortifications and a full brigade to stop the Russians. ""They can move a few kilometres into the province,"" he says, ""but I don't think they can get as far as 10km.""

The Ukrainian armed forces know they have no choice but to fight on. ""We can either fight for Ukraine against Russia, or we will be overrun and forced to fight for Russia against Europe,"" says Oleg Tkach, a lieutenant colonel in the 3rd tank brigade, which defends the Kharkiv region. But this sense of urgency and existential threat, he says, needs to penetrate into the whole of Ukrainian society. ""People need to know the truth,"" he says. And Ukraine needs unity as it enters a new stage of conflict.

I want to reemphasize LTC Tkach's assessment:

""We can either fight for Ukraine against Russia, or we will be overrun and forced to fight for Russia against Europe,"" says Oleg Tkach, a lieutenant colonel in the 3rd tank brigade, which defends the Kharkiv region.

Those, as well as Ukraine's existence as a sovereign state and Ukrainians existence as Ukrainians, are the stakes!

Professor Snyder has posted a new explainer of Russian propaganda. From the Thread Reader App:

President Zelenskyy continues to shake up his senior national security team. From The Kyiv Independent:

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky dismissed the head of Ukraine's State Security Administration (UDO), Serhii Rud, according to a presidential decree published on May 9.

The UDO's main tasks include ensuring the security of the President of Ukraine and high-ranking officials of the state, as well as the protection of administrative buildings and objects of state authorities of Ukraine.

Rud's dismissal comes shortly after the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) claimed to have uncovered a network of Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) agents who were plotting to assassinate President Zelensky and other high-ranking officials in Ukraine. Two colonels of the UDO accused of leaking classified information to Russia were reportedly detained.

The FSB network aimed to find perpetrators among the military close to Zelensky's security, ""who could take the head of state hostage and then kill him.""

Just a few weeks before, SBU officials and Polish law enforcement worked to detain a Polish citizen who allegedly offered to Russia to assassinate President Volodymyr Zelensky.

In late November, Zelensky said in an interview with The Sun that he had survived at least five assassination attempts since the start of Russia's full-scale war.

The Ukrainian president issued several presidential decrees this week mandating changes in senior leadership across Ukraine's government and military.

Dmytro Hereha was reappointed as the commander of Ukraine's Support Forces, and Valerii Zaluzhnyi, the former commander-in-chief of Ukraine's Armed Forces, was formally dismissed from military service. Zaluzhnyi will now serve as Ukraine's ambassador to the U.K.

Russian sources are claiming the Mariupol strike was ATACMS:

A video of the drone attacking the plant in Russian Salavat, Bashkiria, appeared on Russian Telegram channels.

The person who is filming says the drone is very large.

It looks like the drone flew about 1,500 km before it reached its target and hit the oiloil catalytic cracking unit.

Gazprom neftekhim Salavat is one of the largest oil refining and petrochemical production complexes in Russia. It specializes in the production of gasoline, diesel fuel, and other types of petroleum products.

/6. According to Russian media Baza:

""the drone hit the catalytic cracking unit at about one o'clock in the afternoon, local time. Afterwards, employees of the enterprise heard a bang and saw smoke in the area of the Southern entrance. The fire was small, so workers were not evacuated; the plant is operating normally.

According to the head of the Republic of Bashkortostan, Radiy Khabirov, emergency services and heads of law enforcement agencies are now working on the spot. Preliminary, no one was hurt.""

A Ukrainian defence source said the drone attack, which hit an oil refinery in the Russian republic of Bashkortostan, was the SBU security service's work and was carried out at a ""record range"".

The source added that the drone had flown a total distance of 1,500 kilometres.

""The SBU has once again proved it has powerful technological solutions that help to inflict painful blows on the enemy,"" the source said.

Earlier it was reported that Ukrainian drones struck two oil depots in Russia causing large-scale fires.

A Ukrainian intelligence official said that the oil depots were used as transportation hubs to supply troops in the nearby occupied peninsula of Crimea.

Today's live coverage of the war in Ukraine has ended. Thank you for following.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky replaced the commander of his special forces on Thursday, the second time in half a year that he has changed the head of the unit which operates in Moscow-occupied territories.

The dismissal of Colonel Serhiy Lupanchuk and appointment of Brigadier General Oleksandr Trepak in his place was announced in two decrees on the president's website that provided no explanation for the move.

Lord Cameron, the Foreign Secretary, urged fellow Nato members on Thursday to meet pledges to spend two per cent of GDP on defence, saying a tougher foreign policy is needed in a world more dangerous ""than most of us have ever known"".

The Foreign Secretary said that the West was being tested by Iran, Russia and China among others and nations must show courage or allow ""our adversaries (to)...write our future for us"".

""We are in a battle of wills. We all must prove our adversaries wrong - Britain, and our allies and partners around the world,"" Lord Cameron told an audience at the UK's National Cyber Security Centre.

Lord Cameron said nations were not learning the lessons of Russian President Vladimir Putin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine two years ago.

""If Putin's illegal invasion teaches us anything, it must be that doing too little, too late only spurs an aggressor on. This cannot go on. We need to be tougher and more assertive.""

The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier is a war memorial dedicated to the Soviet soldiers killed during World War II.

Each year to mark Victory Day people visit the tomb in the capital of Kyiv to pay their respects.

In the bottom photograph Leonid, 87, whose father died fighting the Nazis, can be seen next to Yuri, 89, whose cousin died fighting at Leningrad.

Valery Zaluzhny has been appointed as Ukraine's new ambassador to the UK.

But who is Mr Zaluzhny?

He served as commander-in-chief of the armed forces before Russia's invasion on February 24 2022, until his dismissal in February, when he was replaced by Oleksandr Syrsky.

He was credited with spearheading some of Ukraine's most successful battles against Russia, including the liberation of Kherson city in November 2022.

Mr Zaluzhny even reached celebrity status, with his image featured in street art, and he was regularly cited as a possible rival to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky given his popularity.

On Wednesday the president officially dismissed Mr Zaluzhny from the military on health grounds.

Ukrainian media reported in March that Mr Zaluzhny had been found unfit for military service during a medical examination in winter.

A Ukrainian drone has struck Russia at a record distance of more than 1,200km (746 miles) from the border, according to Ukrainian officials.

A source told AFP the strike on the refinery in the Russian republic of Bashkortostan was ""the SBU's work"" and was carried out at a ""record range"".

Russia needs to modernise its weapons so it is ""one step ahead"" and will use whatever foreign parts it can get to make them despite sanctions, President Vladimir Putin said.

He made the comments at a meeting with army commanders after his inauguration on Tuesday but the footage was only released by the Kremlin on Thursday as Russia marked the 79th anniversary of victory over Nazi Germany.

Putin said engineers were working ""day and night"" on improving Russia's military technology.

""Modern military technology is changing very fast. If we want to be successful, we always have to be one step ahead,"" he said.

""Our enemy has quite modern means since the whole Western community is working for our enemy,"" he continued.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky appointed former army chief Valeriy Zaluzhnyi ambassador to the United Kingdom on Thursday.

Vladimir Putin said that the ""fate of the motherland"" depends on the soldiers he addressed during his annual speech at the Victory Day parade in Moscow today.

""Dear friends, Russia is now going through a difficult, crucial period. The fate of the Motherland, its future depends on each of us,"" he told the crowd.

Putin has repeatedly framed the current fight against Ukraine as an existential battle against ""Nazism"", a message he reiterated in his address on Thursday.

""We bow our heads before the memory of civilians killed by barbaric shelling and terrorist attacks by neo-Nazis,"" he said.

""Those on the front line, on the line of contact - are our heroes. We bow before your steadfastness and self-sacrifice, selflessness. All Russia is with you,"" he continued.

Ukrainian drones struck two oil depots in Russia causing large-scale fires, Ukrainian intelligence said on Thursday.

The source told Reuters that the oil depots were used as transportation hubs to supply troops in the nearby occupied peninsula of Crimea.

""The SBU will continue to reduce Russia's economic and logistics potential for waging war,"" the source said.

The oil depots were located near the town of Anapa in Russia's southern Krasnodar region.

Vladimir Putin vowed that Russian forces are ""combat ready"" in a speech to mark Victory Day.

""Russia will do everything to avoid a global conflict, but at the same time will not let anyone threaten it. Our strategic forces are always combat-ready,"" he said.

Two hydropower plants in Ukraine were severely damaged and were no longer in operation after Russian bombardments earlier this week, the state energy company Ukrhydroenergo said on Thursday.

""As of today all hydro generation has suffered devastating damage,"" it said in a statement on the Telegram messaging app.

Ukrhydroenergo added that significant financial resources and efforts would be required to repair the damage and restore the plants' operations.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said today that there was nothing unusual in a planned exercise involving the practice deployment of tactical nuclear weapons, according to Russian news agencies.

""There is nothing unusual here, this is planned work,"" Putin said.

He met officers from what the Kremlin calls its special military operation in Ukraine on May 7.

Russia said on Monday it would practise the deployment of tactical nuclear weapons as part of a military exercise after what Moscow said were threats from France, Britain and the United States.

Vladimir Putin hailed the troops fighting in Ukraine for their courage during his annual Victory Day parade today.

The Russian president blasted the West, accusing it of ""fuelling regional conflicts, inter-ethnic and inter-religious strife and trying to contain sovereign and independent centres of global development"".

He added that the Victory Day parade ""unites all generations"".

""We are going forward relying on our centuries-old traditions and feel confident that together we will ensure a free and secure future of Russia,"" he told the crowds on Red Square.

Here are the latest photos from Russia's Victory Day parade in Moscow.

Ukraine plans to double electricity imports on Thursday after a powerful Russian attack on Ukraine's energy system, the energy ministry said.

The imports are expected to rise to 16,699 megawatt hours (Mwh) versus 7,600 Mwh on Wednesday, the ministry said on the Telegram messaging app.

""Today, at Ukraine's request, emergency electricity supplies have already been made from Poland, Romania and Slovakia,"" the ministry said.

Emergency assistance will also be provided during evening peak hours of electricity consumption, it noted.

Two people were killed in Russian shelling overnight in the southern city of Nikopol, Ukraine announced on Thursday.

The majority of 20 drones launched by Moscow overnight were also destroyed, officials added.

Nikopol regularly comes under fire from Russian forces positioned across the Dnipro River.

The river has turned into a front line since late 2022.

""Enemy artillery took the lives of a 62-year-old man and a 65-year-old woman,"" regional governor Sergiy Lysak said.

He published photos of a house with its roof on fire and several damaged buildings.

Ukraine's parliament voted on Thursday to dismiss Deputy Prime Minister Oleksandr Kubrakov, a key government figure who has overseen the wartime reconstruction effort and championed efforts to set up a vital Black Sea shipping lane, Ukrainian lawmaker Yaroslav Zheleznyak said on Telegram.

The 41-year-old's dismissal comes amid plans to break up his powerful ministry into two separate government portfolios.

It was not immediately clear who would replace him.

Victory Day has become a key part of Vladimir Putin's fight against Ukraine, allowing him to rally his citizens and soldiers.

But its roots lay in the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II and the Russian president has long turned it into a pillar of his nearly quarter-century in power.

The victory over Nazi Germany remains the most important and widely revered symbol of the country's prowess and a key element of national identity.

""The Victory Day unites all generations,"" Putin said in a speech at Red Square parade today. ""We are going forward relying on our centuries-old traditions and feel confident that together we will ensure a free and secure future of Russia.""

The Soviet Union lost around 27 million people in World War II., though experts believe the toll could be higher.

Columns of tanks and missiles rolled across Red Square and squadrons of fighter jets roared overhead as medal-bedecked veterans joined Putin to review the parade.

The Russian president blasted the West, accusing it of ""fueling regional conflicts, inter-ethnic and inter-religious strife and trying to contain sovereign and independent centres of global development"".

He added that the Victory Day parade ""unites all generations"".

""We are going forward relying on our centuries-old traditions and feel confident that together we will ensure a free and secure future of Russia,"" he told the crowds on Red Square.

Here are the latest photos from Russia's Victory Day parade in Moscow.

Ukraine plans to double electricity imports on Thursday after a powerful Russian attack on Ukraine's energy system, the energy ministry said.

The imports are expected to rise to 16,699 megawatt hours (Mwh) versus 7,600 Mwh on Wednesday, the ministry said on the Telegram messaging app.

""Today, at Ukraine's request, emergency electricity supplies have already been made from Poland, Romania and Slovakia,"" the ministry said.

Emergency assistance will also be provided during evening peak hours of electricity consumption, it noted.

Two people were killed in Russian shelling overnight in the southern city of Nikopol, Ukraine announced on Thursday.

The majority of 20 drones launched by Moscow overnight were also destroyed, officials added.

Nikopol regularly comes under fire from Russian forces positioned across the Dnipro River.

The river has turned into a front line since late 2022.

""Enemy artillery took the lives of a 62-year-old man and a 65-year-old woman,"" regional governor Sergiy Lysak said.

He published photos of a house with its roof on fire and several damaged buildings.

Ukraine's parliament voted on Thursday to dismiss Deputy Prime Minister Oleksandr Kubrakov, a key government figure who has overseen the wartime reconstruction effort and championed efforts to set up a vital Black Sea shipping lane, Ukrainian lawmaker Yaroslav Zheleznyak said on Telegram.

The 41-year-old's dismissal comes amid plans to break up his powerful ministry into two separate government portfolios.

It was not immediately clear who would replace him.

Victory Day has become a key part of Vladimir Putin's fight against Ukraine, allowing him to rally his citizens and soldiers.

But its roots lay in the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II and the Russian president has long turned it into a pillar of his nearly quarter-century in power.

The victory over Nazi Germany remains the most important and widely revered symbol of the country's prowess and a key element of national identity.

""The Victory Day unites all generations,"" Putin said in a speech at Red Square parade today. ""We are going forward relying on our centuries-old traditions and feel confident that together we will ensure a free and secure future of Russia.""

The Soviet Union lost around 27 million people in World War II., though experts believe the toll could be higher.

Columns of tanks and missiles rolled across Red Square and squadrons of fighter jets roared overhead as medal-bedecked veterans joined Putin to review the parade.

The parade serves as a powerful symbol of the country's ability to prevail against seemingly overwhelming challenges.",ca.news.yahoo.com,news,Yahoo,,0.003921568627450966,452959553,7,https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Sl8Lr4BBoPlugmStBJelxw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03NTA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_telegraph_818/4183bfe90c0e34641e4e8fa02b4b2a99,eng-9553664

The imports are expected to rise to 16,699 megawatt hours (Mwh) versus 7,600 Mwh on Wednesday, the ministry said on the Telegram messaging app.

The planned imports are close to the record high of 18,649 Mwh, which was recorded at the end of March after the first wave of Russian attacks on the Ukrainian energy sector.

The state-run energy company Ukrhydroenergo said Thursday its two hydropower plants were severely damaged earlier this week and were no longer in operation after Russian bombardments.

""As of today all hydro generation has suffered devastating damage,"" it said in a statement on the Telegram messaging app, adding that significant financial resources and efforts would be required to repair the damage and restore the plants' operations.

Ukraine operated 10 hydro power plants prior to the Russian invasion in 2022, which produced about 10% of all Ukrainian electricity.

In 2023, Russian forces blew up the Kakhovska hydropower plant and after latest attacks only seven plants are operating at significantly reduced capacity.

Ukrainian officials have said the country had also lost about 80% of its thermal power generation and now Ukraine has to rely increasingly on its three nuclear power plants, which produce about 60% of its electricity.

Thermal and hydro-electric power generation are needed to keep the levels of supply and consumption balanced during peak hours of energy consumption in the morning and evening.

Emergency Help

""Today, at Ukraine's request, emergency electricity supplies have already been made from Poland, Romania and Slovakia,"" the ministry said.

Emergency assistance will also be provided during evening peak hours of electricity consumption, it noted.

Ukrainian power grid operator Ukrenergo said in a separate statement it expected a significant deficit of electricity for almost the entire day.

""Industrial consumption will be limited from 18:00 to 24:00. With an increase in consumption, emergency shutdowns are possible,"" Ukrenergo said.

Furthermore, the demand is expected to stay the same in 2024 as well. Shifts in fuel prices, along with forward market curves are also some of the factors that are causing this trend of the market. With this, the global coal mining market is expected to rise from $648.04 billion in 2023 to hit $795.76 billion by 2032, at a CAGR of 2.6%, according to Expert Market Research. The demand for coal is expected to continue to exist and drive the market, despite the recent shift to renewables. If this prediction is accurate, this may be a great opportunity to buy coal stocks (see 11 Best Coal Stocks to Buy)

As far as coal mines are concerned, 3 biggest coal mines of the world are North Antelope Rochelle coal mine, Haerwusu coal mine, and Hei Dai Gou coal mine, with coal recoverable reserve totaling 1.7 billion tons, 1.6 billion tons, and 1.5 billion tons, respectively.

With a record 505.4 million tons exported in 2023, an increase of 54 million tons, or 12%, over 2022, Indonesia emerged as the world's largest exporter of thermal coal, according to Reuters. While Indonesia may top as the global exporter, China, with a 2.5% increase in production to 3,942 million tons in 2021, remains the world's largest producer of coal, according to Global Data. Additionally, China, on its own, is responsible for one-third of the coal consumption on global level, according to S&P Global. While 120 countries don't export any coal, among those that do, the one at the bottom of the list is Sweden, exporting only 10 short tons of coal in 2021.

On the other hand, there have been some notable recent developments in the US coal market. The United States produced 140.8 million short tons of coal in the fourth quarter of 2023, a 3.4% decline from the same time in 2022, according to S&P Global. This production has been predicted to see a downtick in coming years, as S&P Global sees 19% fall in 2024, and another 3% in 2025. The consumption of coal is expected to follow this downward trend in the U.S., as well as European regions, as renewable sources of energy are expected to satisfy 90% of any electricity demand by 2025, according to IEA. As the coal market has allocated the concentration of production onto metallurgical coal for industrial consumption, as well as for exports purposes, the industry looks onto stabilization. During this time, however, employment in U.S. coal mines remained relatively steady despite the drop in production, increasing by less than 1% annually on average. You can see the biggest coal mining companies in the US here.

In the realm of coal mining and production, two industry giants are going to be discussed, namely, Peabody Energy Corporation (NYSE:BTU) and Arch Resources, Inc. (NYSE:ARCH).

The mechanism facilitates automatic correction of temporary hardware faults and prevents errant or malevolent software from disrupting system operations.

Available as both a hardware and virtualized time, Prodigy's watchdog is part of a self-healing infrastructure within datacenters. It allows the automatic recovery of servers that hang without human intervention. This functionality is important for organizations with hundreds to thousands of servers.

Prodigy's hardware watchdog timer must be cleared by the operating system based on a programmable timeout value or it will trigger a non-maskable interrupt. The watchdog performs corrective actions by initiating a soft reboot. If unsuccessful, it will attempt to boot the OS on a single core, save the kernel dump and then perform a hard reboot.

For a virtualized environment, the watchdogs are virtualized themselves so that each VM maintains an individual timer.

""At the most basic level, a watchdog is a mechanism that resets a computer if something goes wrong,"" said Dr. Radoslav Danilak, founder and CEO of Tachyum. ""This can encompass detecting any number of issues within the system, making a watchdog that will not only identify the problem but automatically initiate corrective issues is a valuable feature. As we continue to progress towards Prodigy's commercial release, it makes sense that our FPGA performs with watchdogs in place to ensure success of systems that incorporate our Universal Processor chip.""

As a Universal Processor offering industry-leading performance for all workloads, Prodigy-powered data center servers can seamlessly and dynamically switch between computational domains (such as AI/ML, HPC, and cloud) with a single homogeneous architecture. By eliminating the need for expensive dedicated AI hardware and dramatically increasing server utilization, Prodigy reduces CAPEX and OPEX significantly while delivering unprecedented data center performance, power, and economics. Prodigy integrates 192 high-performance custom-designed 64-bit compute cores, to deliver up to 4.5x the performance of the highest-performing x86 processors for cloud workloads, up to 3x that of the highest performing GPU for HPC, and 6x for AI applications.

A video demonstration of a watchdog timer working on a Prodigy FPGA emulation system is available for viewing at https://youtu.be/Vsu5G9jE0Ec.

Tachyum is transforming the economics of AI, HPC, public and private cloud workloads with Prodigy, the world's first Universal Processor. Prodigy unifies the functionality of a CPU, a GPU, and a TPU in a single processor to deliver industry-leading performance, cost and power efficiency for both specialty and general-purpose computing. As global data center emissions continue to contribute to a changing climate, with projections of their consuming 10 percent of the world's electricity by 2030, the ultra-low power Prodigy is positioned to help balance the world's appetite for computing at a lower environmental cost. Tachyum recently received a major purchase order from a US company to build a large-scale system that can deliver more than 50 exaflops performance, which will exponentially exceed the computational capabilities of the fastest inference or generative AI supercomputers available anywhere in the world today. When complete in 2025, the Prodigy-powered system will deliver a 25x multiplier vs. the world's fastest conventional supercomputer - built just this year - and will achieve AI capabilities 25,000x larger than models for ChatGPT4. Tachyum has offices in the United States and Slovakia.

May 8 (Interfax) - As many as 419 populated localities in Ukraine had no power supply for various reasons on Tuesday morning, Ukrainian media said, citing a statement by the Ukrainian Energy Ministry on a social network.

There was no power supply to 5,400 clients in around 90 populated localities in the Sumy region, 1,600 clients in 30 populated localities in the Chernigov region, and 3,800 clients in 52 populated localities in the Kiev-controlled part of the Zaporozhye region, the statement said.

About 102,000 households had no power supply in the Kharkov region, consistent with schedules, on Tuesday, same as on Monday.

Additionally, a thunderstorm and high winds cut power supply to 53 populated localities in the Zhitomir, Sumy and Chernigov regions on Tuesday morning, Ukrenergo said. Some 1,000 clients in seven populated localities, 600 clients in five populated localities, and 4,300 clients in 42 populated localities have no power supply in those regions, respectively. Power supply disrupted by bad weather has resumed to over 10,000 clients in the Kiev region.

Thus, there is no power supply to 472 populated localities across Ukraine.

Renewable energy generation was limited from 10:40 a.m. to 4:05 p.m. on Monday to balance the power grid, and excessive electricity was urgently exported to Poland between 8 a.m. and 10 a.m., the statement said.

At the same time, Ukrenergo asked for saving electricity between 7 p.m. and 10 p.m.

The operator reported further increase in imports. It is planned to import 7,395MW/h from Romania, Slovakia, Poland, Hungary and Moldova in the evening, which is 1.4 times more than on Monday, which, for its part, grew six times compared to Sunday.

Ukrenergo noted that the imports reached 1,668MW in certain hours, close to the 1,700MW technical capacity of electricity imports from Europe to Ukraine and Moldova.",interfax.com,news,interfax.com,,-0.1607843137254902,452780533,7,,

The EU's climate agenda is in trouble. The Green Deal, which aims to slash the bloc's carbon emissions by 55% by 2030, had started off promisingly after several major pieces of legislation were adopted, including its ban on the sale of new combustion-powered vehicles from 2035 and carbon border tax. Increasingly, however, Europeans are rebelling against green restrictions of which they have difficulty seeing the advantages.

The elephants in the room

Another less reported upon but equally important threat to the bloc's ecological and energy transition comes from the alarming number of Chinese and US companies moving into the EU power sector.

In our book, Energy: How to Recover Our European Ambition (published in French), we shed light on this overlooked issue ahead of European elections that will be critical for the EU's energy strategy and call on the bloc to carefully weigh up cooperation and competition with sovereignty.

China eyes Europe's energy sector

While there currently isn't any quantitative data on China's share in the European energy market, we do know the country detains 80% of the global clean-technology manufacturing capacity in 11 segments, from solar wafers to many lithium-ion battery components.

Taking advantage of the sovereign debt crisis in Europe, Chinese investors first stepped in to acquire substantial stakes in what have long been regarded as ""sovereign"" sectors, such as power transmission and distribution grids, in the early 2010s. Key among those was the world's largest utility company, the State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC), commonly known as the State Grid - the world's fourth-biggest company overall by revenue, behind Walmart, Saudi Aramco and Amazon as of March. Also increasingly present is Three Gorges Corp, responsible for the world's largest hydroelectric power complex.

For instance, in Portugal, Three Gorges Corp. won the bidding for the Portuguese government's 21% stake in EDP-Energias de Portugal SA in 2010. Meanwhile, in Italy, SGCC expanded its presence by collaborating with the Italian government in 2014, acquiring a 35% share in the CDP Reti fund, thereby attaining a blocking minority at the local gas network operator, SNAM, and electricity transmission network operator, Terna. Similarly, in Greece the State Grid made substantial inroads by acquiring a 24% stake in the national electricity transmission network operator from the Greek government in 2016.

While Portugal, Italy, and Greece were primary targets, Chinese investors have also acquired grids in Luxembourg. Last but not least, let's not forget China's green-tech industry has flooded Europe with cheap solar panels and electric vehicles (EVs).

US inroads in the EU energy market

The stakes are all the higher because China is not the only country with ambitions in the EU. The United States is also seeking to benefit from the bloc's poorly thought-out energy strategy.

Russia's war against Ukraine has not weakened the United States' energy dominance in the world, and more specifically in the EU. Indeed, while Russian gas was expected to act as a bridge fuel in the energy transition, particularly for Germany, the EU was quick to adopt sanctions against its long-term trade partner that minimised its dependence. Partly filling the vacant space left by Moscow, the United States has become the leading producer and exporter of LNG to Europe. This development favours US trade while domestic energy costs are kept low, further widening the price gap, with Europe experiencing an energy inflation and undermining its relative competitiveness and attractiveness to energy-intensive industry.

Beyond these energy-supply issues, EU member states are struggling to carve out a common vision, highlighting the challenges of sovereignty and strategic autonomy. European companies, particularly in France, have endeavoured to develop fourth-generation small modular nuclear reactors (SMR), with an attempt to create a European nuclear alliance made in November 2023. But at the same moment, countries such as Italy, Belgium, and Romania have partnered with the American Westinghouse Electric Company to develop lead-cooled fast reactors.

Here again, the coordination gap plays to the advantage of American influence in Europe, as confirmed by John Kerry in September 2023. As part of the international consortium ""Clean Fuel from SMR"", led by American companies, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Poland were selected to participate and will receive support for coal-to-SMR feasibility studies. These EU countries are turning to the Americans to build new nuclear power plants, mainly because of their funding and technical expertise, while the EU continues to block all support for nuclear projects developed on its soil.

Cracks in the EU's net-zero goals

The scale of these foreign investments in renewable energies, new nuclear facilities and grid development could come to bear heavily onto the bloc's strategic independence at a time when it's looking to decarbonise.

These investments raise concerns over continental energy security, given the still fragmented nature of Europe's energy landscape:

in the short run, supply issues due to the energy crisis urgently push the EU to turn to other foreign partners (other than Russia) and only shift our energy dependence problem;

in the longer term, faced with Chinese dumping and US protectionism, Europe will have to protect domestic energy manufacturers or grid operators after having long neglected them.

The main challenge for Europe is ending one dependency without falling into another. To replace imports of fossil fuels (coal, gas, and oil), harmful to the climate, the EU member states must accelerate and coordinate the development of their ""green"" technologies.

Toward green sovereignty

These risks demand that the bloc not only pays more attention to non-EU operators, but take greater responsibility over its own energy system. How can it do this, all while pursuing the vision of the ""green, secure and affordable energy supply"" set out in its Green Deal?

For starters, we recommend EU member states work harder on building truly European energy grids. As we move toward decarbonisation, we can expect an array of renewable energies to increasingly power our electricity system. These arrangements will require extensive and interconnected networks on a European scale, which must be consolidated and developed by the EU member states themselves.

A second emergency is green energy financing. In November, the European Climate Neutrality Observatory warned a lack of EU-level public investment in green energy and other advances could lead the bloc to fail to meet its net-zero goals. Rather than take heed of the warning, member states axed the fund earmarked for renewables and clean tech - the Strategic Technologies for Europe Platform (STEP) - to 1.5bn in February. Our book calls for a radical change of strategy, through the creation of a ""European transition savings account"" to attract private savings, on the one hand, and a ""European sovereign fund"" that receives proceeds from carbon-pricing revenues on the other.

Whether these actually come into being will depend on the upcoming European elections. Results leaning toward a higher European ambition could help us seen in clean, affordable and secure solutions. Further veering to the nationalistic right could further jeopardise the bloc's economic clout and, paradoxically, sovereignty.

It was on a backpacking trip to India at the age of 14 that Diana Virgovicova got her first glance at the human cost of water pollution.

Rivers play a vital role in the natural ecosystem and the livelihoods of millions in India, but in the suburbs of Mumbai, Virgovicova observed that these critical waterways ran black, flowing with a hazardous mix of waste chemicals, dyes, and other pollutants. To her, it was immediately obvious that this was more than an environmental reality.

People were using the polluted water for showers, with young girls using the water to wash during their menstrual cycles, which could make them sick.

""I basically decided at that time that I wanted to dedicate my life to solving this problem.""

This experience would eventually lead Virgovicova to start her own company, Xatoms. The Toronto-based startup uses artificial intelligence (AI) and quantum chemistry to discover new molecules the company hopes will be able to help clean water around the world.

Virgovicova, CEO and co-founder of Xatoms, recently spoke to BetaKit about how her company is looking to use emerging technologies to clean the world's most important natural resource.

Virgovicova's passion for the environment took on new urgency after her trip to India. ""I basically decided at that time that I wanted to dedicate my life to solving this problem,"" she added.

After she returned to her home country of Slovakia, Virgovicova contacted a local university and began researching technologies for cleaning pollutants from stagnant water, such as reservoirs, ponds, lakes, individual containers, and slow-flowing rivers. It was during this time she learned about quantum chemistry software, which she says took her three years to gain proficiency in.

Quantum chemistry is a branch of chemistry that uses quantum mechanics to understand and predict the properties of atoms and molecules. It explains chemical behaviour at the molecular level, including bonding, reaction mechanisms, and the electronic structure of materials, by applying principles of quantum physics.

""I wanted to use quantum chemistry to discover a new type of material, which would be able to purify polluted water in a much more affordable and efficient way, so we can reach some of the most vulnerable communities around the world,"" she added.

She created hundreds of photocatalyst models -- which describe how certain materials can use light to speed up chemical reactions -- and at age 17, discovered a molecule that could break down pollutants of an organic nature, such as bacteria, herbicides, and pesticides (the startup is not currently targeting heavy metals), from water when exposed to visible sunlight, without the need for ultraviolet radiation and costly equipment.

Virgovicova said Xatoms is still in the research and development stage, but aims to eventually sell a purification filter for consumers and a water treatment powder for commercial use as early as 2025.

While studying in the United Kingdom, Virgovicova received a Diploma of Excellence at the International Stockholm Junior Water Prize for her initial photocatalyst discovery.

Her next step was to build a startup, which was prompted by her move to Canada. In 2020, Virgovicova was awarded the Lester B. Pearson International Scholarship, which brought her to study computer engineering at the University of Toronto.

""I decided that I wanted to start Xatoms, which would use a combination of quantum chemistry and also our AI, which would be introduced so we could discover new materials much faster, and discover even more efficient ones than I modelled when I was 17,"" she added.

That same year, she added another achievement to her rÃ©sumÃ©: a Cansbridge Fellowship, which sponsors a small number of students studying at Canadian universities with a $10,000 scholarship to pursue a summer internship in Asia.

While completing the fellowship in Asia, Virgovicova met fellow Cansbridge recipients and eventual co-founders: Shirley Zhong, now Xatoms' COO; and Kerem Topalismailoglu, now CTO. All three co-founders are international students with a background in software development.

Virgovicova explained that quantum chemistry is well suited for modelling new molecules because it provides a conceptual framework to understand the behaviour of atoms and molecules at the quantum level.

""[Quantum chemistry] can help show how these matters would react in different types of environments, so you don't have to spend a lot of money on the work in the lab,"" she added.

Xatoms uses AI algorithms to speed up the molecule discovery process by sifting through vast arrays of chemicals and pinpointing potential molecular structures for photocatalysts and other materials. The startup's algorithms focus on achieving three desirable characteristics for molecule candidates: stability, low cost, and low environmental impact.

From there, Xatoms uses AI-powered quantum chemistry calculations to predict candidate molecules' behaviour under different conditions and identify the most suitable molecules for treating water.

The startup is currently working with Alexandra Tavasoli, a professor at the University of British Columbia to develop its water purification filter, which will be coated with its end material. The startup has also secured a partnership with Wavemakers United Foundation, which Virgovicova said will help the startup reach nonprofits in countries like Nigeria, where it is looking to eventually deploy its products.

Once developed, Xatoms plans to sell its powder material directly to water organizations, while its filter will be sold directly to individuals and through NGOs. The startup also plans to license its software for material discovery to small and mid-sized water plants to help them combat specific pollutants.

To ensure the material is safe for human consumption, Virgovicova said Xatoms uses heterogeneous photocatalysts, which allow the catalyst to remain distinct from the water.

""The design of these catalysts ensures they remain immobilized on solid supports or are easily separable after treatment, minimizing their release into the water,"" she added.

Virgovicova highlighted several advantages she anticipates Xatoms' products will offer compared to existing water filtration and purification methods. For one, physical filtration only removes larger particles, while Xatoms' product will also remove viruses.

She also anticipates that the material will be more cost-effective than chlorine tablets and will operate without the need for fuel or electricity, which is required for boiling. ""This is a significant advantage, considering the electricity in rural communities is often unstable,"" she added.

Since launching Xatoms, Virgovicova and her team have achieved several milestones, including Virgovicova becaming one of 36 candidates across Canada to join the NEXT36 cohort. She is also a Canadian delegate for the G20 Young Entrepreneurs' Alliance, a delegation that issued a joint statement last year to the United Nations General Assembly focused on the urgent need for water action. Virgovicova also hosted a TEDx talk focused on water pollution, quantum computing, and AI last year.

To date, Xatoms has raised $180,000 CAD, all through non-dilutive funding. Most of this came from a $100,000 USD grant from the 776 Fellowship, a two-year program for youth entrepreneurs led in part by Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian. Virgovicova said the startup aims to raise its first round of venture funding this year.

One of Xatoms' photocatalysts has already been synthesized, and the startup is applying for a trade secret in order to synthesize more. Xatoms was also recently accepted into the Quantum Stream of Creative Destruction Lab, and has plans to work with SpinUp, a wet lab incubator based at the University of Toronto.

Water pollution is a global issue with significant implications for health, ecosystems, and economies. One 2023 study predicted that by 2100, up to 5.5 billion people could be exposed to polluted water.

Climate change intensifies these challenges by heightening the frequency of droughts and floods, which increases the occurrence of waterborne diseases.

Virgovicova also emphasized the impact of this problem on women and girls. Women often bear the primary responsibility for water collection and caregiving in many societies, she noted, which may limit their education and access to future opportunities. Women also face exposure to pollutants that can have specific impacts on their reproductive health.

""I think what really motivated me to start my journey is the combination of how water pollution is connected to education of women, and how, if we solve this problem and raise awareness about it, we can send more girls to schools and reduce gender inequalities,"" she added. ""If we cannot educate women, then the gender gap is going to get wider.""",betakit.com,news,BetaKit,Isabelle Kirkwood,0.1843137254901961,452772320,4,https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Xatoms.jpg,eng-9541221
