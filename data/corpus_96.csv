Spanish system operator Enagas' supplies of LNG as a marine bunkering fuel from its terminals in Spain and LNG bunkering vessels (LNGBVs) rose to a record high last year, as more capacity and stronger demand boosted throughput.

Enagas supplied about 1.4TWh of LNG as a bunkering fuel in 2023, much more than the 400GWh supplied in 2022 and 300GWh in 2021, according to the firm.

Enagas has expanded its LNG bunkering capacity in recent years, while the cost of LNG as a marine fuel has held much lower than competing alternatives such as marine gas oil (MGO) over the past year, supporting demand for LNG bunkering operations.

The firm fully owns three LNG import terminals in Spain that offer LNG bunkering services -- the Barcelona, Huelva and the Cartagena facilities. Barcelona offers pipe-to-ship (PTS) and ship-to-ship (STS) services, Huelva offers STS services and will soon offer PTS services, while Cartagena offers PTS operations, while Enagas plans to add STS services at the port too, the firm said. Enagas subsidiary Scale Gas co-owns two LNGBVs -- the 5,000m³ Haugesund Knutsen in Barcelona with Norwegian firm Knutsen, and the 12,000m³ Levante LNG in Huelva, alongside UK supplier Peninsula.

Most of the LNG bunkering operations in Spain are carried out in Barcelona, where bunkering volumes similarly rose to an all-time high last year, according to the port authority. The increase to 143,000 m³ of LNG as a bunker fuel across 199 deliveries last year, more than double the previous record posted in 2021 of 65,051m³, was linked largely to the commissioning of the Haugesund Knutsen in 2023.

Enagas partially owns other assets that can offer truck-to-ship operations at the El Musel import terminal and the Sagunto and Bilbao LNG terminals. Bilbao can also provide PTS operations.

Spain aims to build on its presence in the LNG bunkering market, with several planned LNG bunkering projects adding to its already-large LNG import and storage capacity.

Utility Endesa recently advanced plans that were initially announced in 2021 to build a small LNG terminal with 5,000m³ of LNG storage capacity in the Spanish exclave of Melilla in north Africa. Endesa earlier this month requested permits for the project from the local government.

Endesa also has plans for an LNG bunkering project in the port of Algeciras, with an LNG plant comprising four tanks with a combined capacity of 4,000m³. The firm had intended to start offering services earlier this year, but this appears to have been delayed.

Scale Gas also aims to launch an LNGBV in the Canary Islands that it is building at present and aims to start operating in 2026. This LNGBV will also offer bio-LNG bunkering operations.",argusmedia.com,news,Argus Media,,0.07450980392156858,454780934,20,,eng-9606860

The quantity of LNG supplied as fuel by Enagás-managed facilities in 2023 reached 1,359 GWh, marking a more than fourfold increase compared to 2021 (300 GWh).

The increased utilization of LNG has enabled the prevention of over 74,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent emissions, as well as virtually eliminating emissions of sulfur and nitrogen oxides (SOx and NOx), thereby enhancing air quality within port surroundings.

Enagás has enacted holistic measures by modifying its terminals and constructing supply barges through its subsidiary Scale Gas, establishing itself as the European operator boasting the highest combined loading capacity.

This advancement stems from the efficacy of public-private partnerships seen in projects like CORE LNGas hive and LNGhive2, jointly funded by the European Commission. Spearheaded by Puertos del Estado and overseen by Enagás, these endeavors have established an integrated, secure, and effective logistics framework for LNG fuel supply across the Iberian Peninsula.

The regasification terminal operated by Enagás in Barcelona is capable of facilitating direct bunkering operations (pipe to ship, PTS). Since the commencement of operations by the Haugesund Knutsen, a vessel jointly owned by Knutsen and Scale Gas, in Barcelona in early 2023, the terminal has also facilitated LNG fuel supply through small vessels (ship to ship, STS). Through bunkering operations at the Port of Barcelona, emissions equivalent to 63,000 tonnes of CO2 have already been prevented.

Following the initiation of operations of the Levante LNG vessel, jointly owned by Peninsula and Scale Gas, the volume loaded at the Enagás plant in Huelva during the first four months of 2024 surged by 82% compared to the total supply in 2023. This terminal facilitates LNG loading onto STS supply barges and is slated to soon commence PTS operations. Furthermore, Scale Gas is constructing a third LNG and BioLNG supply vessel, backed by the Spanish Government's support through Next Generation funds, which is set to primarily operate in the Canary Islands starting from 2026.

The Enagás terminal in Cartagena, a frontrunner in Europe for providing PTS services, will soon expand its offerings to include STS operations.

Apart from the three regasification terminals wholly owned by Enagás, the company's majority-owned terminals in Spain also offer bunkering services: El Musel in Gijón, Saggas in Sagunto, and BBG in Bilbao provide Truck to Ship (TTS) services, with BBG additionally offering PTS services.",chemanalyst.com,news,chemanalyst.com,,0.3411764705882352,454671823,28,,eng-9600991

Spanish Enagas company has solidified its standing as a premier European operator in the decarbonization of maritime transport through the supply of liquefied natural gas (LNG) for bunkering, Trend reports via the company.

In 2023, Enagas-operated plants achieved a remarkable milestone, loading 1,359 GWh of LNG as fuel, a more than fourfold increase from the 300 GWh recorded in 2021.

This surge in LNG usage has significantly reduced emissions, preventing over 74,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent and nearly eliminating sulphur and nitrogen oxides (SOx and NOx) emissions, thus enhancing air quality in port areas.

The success stems from public-private partnerships like CORE LNGas hive and LNGhive2, co-funded by the European Commission. These initiatives, spearheaded by Puertos del Estado and coordinated by Enagas, have established a comprehensive and efficient logistics chain for LNG fuel supply on the Iberian Peninsula.

The Enagas regasification terminal in Barcelona now supports direct bunkering operations (pipe to ship, PTS) and, since early 2023, has facilitated ship-to-ship (STS) LNG fuel supply through the Haugesund Knutsen vessel, co-owned by Knutsen and Scale Gas. These efforts in the Port of Barcelona alone have prevented 63,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent emissions.

Further advancements were seen with the Levante LNG vessel, co-owned by Peninsula and Scale Gas. In the first four months of 2024, LNG volumes loaded at the Enagas plant in Huelva soared by 82 percent compared to total 2023 supply. This terminal now loads LNG onto STS supply barges and will soon commence PTS operations. Additionally, Scale Gas, supported by Spanish Government's Next Generation funds, is constructing a third LNG and BioLNG supply vessel set to operate primarily in the Canary Islands from 2026.

The Cartagena terminal, a pioneer in Europe for offering PTS services, will soon extend its capabilities to include STS operations. Enagas's wholly owned terminals, along with majority-owned terminals in El Musel (Gijon), Saggas (Sagunto), and BBG (Bilbao), also provide essential Truck to Ship (TTS) services, with BBG additionally offering PTS.

Global law firm Clifford Chance has advised Hanseatic Energy Hub GmbH in relation to the financing of the development, construction and operation of Germany's first land-based terminal for liquefied gases. The total investment volume amounts to approx. €1.6 billion. By reaching financial close, Hanseatic Energy Hub GmbH has achieved a major milestone. The terminal in Stade near Hamburg in Lower Saxony is the first project-financed land-based LNG terminal in Germany. The shareholders of Hanseatic Energy Hub GmbH include Partners Group, Enagás, Dow and the Buss Group.

The official ground-breaking ceremony for the energy hub in the Stade industrial park is scheduled to be held in the coming weeks. The facility is set to receive its first cargo in 2027. In a first expansion phase, an emission-free LNG terminal is to be put into operation, the infrastructure of which is also authorised for bio-LNG and synthetic natural gas (SNG). This will later be followed by ammonia as a carbon-neutral, hydrogen-based energy carrier.

With a total capacity of 13.3 billion cubic metres of LNG per year, the Hanseatic Energy Hub will play an important role in securing the energy supply and supporting the energy transition in both Germany and wider Europe. In addition, the FSRU ""Energos Force"", one of five floating LNG terminals chartered by Germany's federal government and on site since March 2024, will continue to secure the gas supply in the short term until the more efficient land-based terminal is completed.

Florian Mahler, partner at Clifford Chance: ""This is another landmark transaction in the energy and energy transition sector in Germany and globally, showing our strong capabilities and integrated team approach. Securing the first project financing of a land-based LNG terminal in Germany is a huge achievement for all parties involved.""

With this mandate, Clifford Chance is emphasising its strategic focus on the energy sector and advising on the energy transition. Its global energy and infrastructure practice group is being continuously expanded, most recently with the opening of an office specialising in the energy transition sector in Houston, USA for which many new partners have been recruited.

Companies in the sector are mulling the use of renewable hydrogen in their operations, ""but it is a real challenge because of the volume that we need and the cost"", the general secretary of Spain's association of ceramic tile and flooring manufacturers (ASCER), Alberto Echavarria, told Argus.

The industry currently consumes around 15TWh/yr of natural gas, accounting for nearly 10pc of Spain's industrial gas demand. This would equate to around 380,000 t/yr of hydrogen, based on the higher heating value of 39.39kWh/kg. And it would not be far off the 500,000 t/yr of conventional hydrogen made from natural gas with unabated emissions that Spanish industry as a whole consumes currently.

Making 380,000 t/yr could require some 4GW of electrolyser capacity for the ceramics industry alone, equivalent to over one-third of Spain's 2030 target of 11GW.

In any event, existing technology can support no more than 10pc hydrogen blending in the kilns, Echavarria said. ASCER is in talks with kiln manufacturers developing hydrogen-ready ovens, but these are in a testing phase and are not expected to be available at industrial scale in the near future.

Alternatives for decarbonisation are thin on the ground. Electrifying operations is not a viable option, Echavarria said. While some parts of the ceramic production process can run on electricity, the industry ovens, known as kilns, fire at temperatures reaching 1,200°C, which are much too high for electricity. And the kilns represent 50-60pc of the sector's energy consumption, according to Echavarria.

Another alternative would be to use biomethane or e-methane, at least until hydrogen-fired kilns reach industrial scale. This approach would require minor modifications in facilities and would allow them to continue using the current infrastructure and distribution system. But biomethane is also only available in small volumes, and making e-methane requires electrolytic hydrogen, raising the same issues over supply availability and costs as direct hydrogen use.

Net emissions could also be reduced by implementing carbon capture technology but this would be even less cost-competitive, Echavarria said. It would require mechanisms to concentrate CO2 molecules at a focal point, which is an expensive undertaking, he said.

Piping hot

Future hydrogen use for ceramics production would depend on connections to a hydrogen pipeline system.

Spain's ceramics industry, which is the largest in Europe, is mainly concentrated in Castellon, where more than 150 facilities are based.

It is not practical to ""have 150 electrolysers"" and produce locally, Echavarria said, not least because the plants would need round-the-clock hydrogen supply to maintain the high temperatures.

ASCER has been collaborating with Spanish gas system operator Enagas on plans for the development of the Spanish hydrogen backbone to ensure access for its companies, he said. Firms have also looked into sourcing hydrogen via trucks, according to Echavarria. But this would require storage facilities, raising costs and safety concerns.",argusmedia.com,news,Argus Media,,0.08235294117647052,453455572,1,,eng-9561767

MADRID, May 12. /TASS/. Russia ranked second in liquefied natural gas (LNG) supplies to Spain in April 2024, according to data provided by Spanish energy company Enagas.

According to the report, Spain bought the equivalent of 5,342 GWh of LNG from Russia this April. As a result, Russia took the second position in terms of this fuel supply volumes to the country, behind only Algeria. In the first four months of 2024, Madrid purchased 26,854 GWh of gas from Russia.

Enagas earlier reported that Spain acquired 72,690 GWh of Russian LNG in 2023, up from 53,859 GWh in 2022. Thus, based on last year's data, Russia became the kingdom's third largest gas provider.

Russian Ambassador in Madrid Yury Klimenko told TASS earlier, Spain has become the main buyer of Russian LNG in the European Union in 2022-2023. According to the diplomat, from an economic point of view, it would not profitable for the kingdom to break the large long-term contract signed with Russia.

The comments come after a source told Reuters that Algeria would cancel deliveries of gas to Naturgy if the Spanish firm's shares are sold to another company.

The source did not name the firm that could buy Naturgy's shares, but Abu Dhabi's TAQA said last month it was in discussions with Naturgy's three largest shareholders which could lead to a full takeover bid for the largest natural gas firm in Spain.

""There have never been any clauses in the supply contracts (the current contracts expire in 2030/31) that were affected by possible changes in the shareholding of either party,"" a spokesperson told Reuters.

""In fact, such shareholder changes have occurred in the past and have had no impact on the contracts' performance,"" he added.

Algeria's ties with the United Arab Emirates, of which Abu Dhabi is the capital, have suffered in recent years after the UAE and Morocco were among Arab states boosting ties with Israel in the so-called Abraham Accords. Algeria and Morocco are major regional rivals, while Algeria champions the Palestinian cause and was critical of the accords.

Spokespeople for Spain's energy, economy and foreign ministries declined to comment on the possibility of Algerian gas supplies being cut. Representatives for Algeria's government were not immediately available to comment. TAQA said it ""does not comment on market rumour or speculation"" while the UAE government did not reply to a request for comment.

Naturgy has gas contracts with Algerian state oil and gas company Sonatrach for about 5 billion cubic metres (bcm) per year, according to figures the Spanish company gave to the market in 2022. The parties are negotiating prices for 2023, retroactively, and 2024.

Algerian gas made up roughly one-third of Spain's total gas imports in the first three months of the year, according to data from Spanish gas grid operator Enagas.

The bulk of the supply comes via the Medgaz pipeline, in which Naturgy is a minority partner and Sonatrach holds a 51% stake. Sonatrach also has a stake of about 4% in Naturgy.

Naturgy hailed its more than 50-year-old relationship with Sonatrach.

""During all these years, there have been no breaches by either party. Not even in politically sensitive times on both sides of the Mediterranean have the contracts not been honoured,"" it said.

TAQA said last month it was in talks with private equity firms CVC and GIP about buying each of their 20% plus stakes in Naturgy, and also with Naturgy's largest shareholder Criteria, which owns a 26.7% stake, about a possible partnership.

Criteria declined to comment on the future of Algerian gas deliveries.

The announcement was made during a recent gathering in Toledo, attended by the Minister of Sustainable Development, Mercedes Gómez, along with Kolya-PNE board members Juanjo José Moreno, Héctor García, Holger Boy, and development director Jesús Pacheco. The meeting was crucial for presenting the project to the Community Board of Castilla-La Mancha and discussing the region's burgeoning energy sector.

The selection of Albacete as the project site was praised by Gómez and Kolya-PNE representatives, highlighting the area's suitability due to its industrial zone, proximity to significant infrastructure like the Los Llanos Air Base, and the nearby Valencian Community with its diverse industrial landscape. This includes ports like Valencia and Sagunto and industries such as ceramics and stained glass. The location is further enhanced by the upcoming H2 hydroduct, a project by Enagás supported by the European Union.

Kolya-PNE has secured the necessary land for the wind farms and photovoltaic installations required for the project, along with the essential water supply for operating the electrolyzer. Current discussions are underway with local municipalities and the regional government to finalize the development steps, emphasizing minimal environmental impact and equitable local benefit distribution.
