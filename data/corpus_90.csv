The measure is intended to hamper the logistics of Russian gas exports from the Arctic, which during the winter months requires the use of ice-breaking LNG carriers. These ships, which are scarce due to their high production, maintenance and operating costs, deliver the LNG they carry to European ports for subsequent transport by conventional LNG carriers to the Asian market, especially China.

The sanctions, therefore, do not reduce the volumes of natural gas supplied to the EU and should not have a significant impact on European benchmark prices. Yet it is a move that will reduce Russia's export revenues and paves the way for a ban on Russian LNG imports to the EU by 2027, in line with the targets set out in REPowerEU.

Why are transshipment services important?

From November to June, during the Arctic winter season, LNG that is exported from the Yamal project needs to use ice-breaking vessels to access international markets. The port where the Yamal LNG terminal is located, Sabetta, is inaccessible to conventional vessels during these months as it is surrounded by frozen waters. At present, there are only 15 icebreakers in operation, and they are mostly operated by Western shipping lines (OMV, Seapeak and Dynagas) that are well established, reputable and therefore compliant with international sanctions. To optimise the voyages of these specialised vessels, the natural gas they carry is transferred to conventional LNG tankers in warm water ports.

These transhipment services, essential for Russian LNG logistics, take place mainly in Zeebrugge, Belgium, and Montoir-de-Bretagne, France, in order to access the Asian market. In winter, permanent darkness and ice in the Arctic Ocean render it impossible for LNG tankers, even icebreakers, to reach Asian markets through the Bering Strait. This forces shipments to be re-routed through European ports servicing LNG from Yamal. Unlike crude oil transhipments, the technical specification of LNG transhipment operations means that they must be carried out in specialised ports.

As a result, Russian LNG exported to Asia during winter relies on EU port services specifically designed for these operations. Currently, Fluxys, the Belgian gas transport system operator, has a 20-year contract with Yamal LNG for gas transhipment at the Zeebrugge terminal, where a dedicated storage tank was built for Russian LNG operations in 2020. The Montoir-de-Bretagne terminal is also transhipping Yamal LNG through the ship-to-ship process under a 23-year contract signed by Engie that was subsequently inherited by France's TotalEnergies. Although these are lucrative contracts for these ports, their termination would have limited implications for the EU gas market. Novatek, the operator of the Yamal LNG facility, previously conducted transhipment operations outside port facilities in Norwegian fjords and continues to do so in Russian waters north of Murmansk. However, these ship-to-ship operations require calm seas and weather and do not offer the same security as European port terminals.

Why are these sanctions effective?

The fact that Yamal LNG continues to flow to Asia, China in particular, even when the Northern Arctic Route is closed for the winter, underlines the importance of contractual destination restrictions, which oblige LNG cargoes to be physically delivered to the agreed port. This explains why even now most LNG tankers avoid passing through the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait: Russian cargoes from Yamal are making the longer and more costly journey via the Cape of Good Hope around Africa for deliveries to Asia.

Russia has built a floating terminal for such transshipments in Murmansk and Kamchatka, but US sanctions imposed on both projects in September 2023 appear to have delayed their entry into full operation. The US sanctions affect the companies operating the Murmansk floating terminal, which has prevented LNG tanker operators, mostly Western companies, from delivering or gathering LNG from the facility.

Banning transshipments in European ports will be especially disruptive for Russian LNG logistics and exports to Asia during next winter. This will be particularly relevant for Yamal LNG's contract with CNPC, whose final destination is bound to be China. Both companies will have to renegotiate the contract and, foreseeably, sell part of the LNG output during the winter months on the European market, probably with significant discounts. Other offtakers in the Yamal project, although not contractually obliged to do so, exported part of the gas to the Asian market (SEFE, Gunvor, TotalEnergies and Shell). During the winter months they will also have to redirect these volumes to the European market. It is an open question whether LNG tanker operators will be willing to take greater risks and logistical constraints by resorting to transhipments in Russian waters.

Figure 1. Long-term supply LNG Yamal contracts

In addition, Novatek is encountering problems in obtaining the services of new LNG carriers, both conventional and icebreakers, because of US sanctions. The latter have prevented the transfer of six icebreaking LNG carriers that were built at the Hanwha shipyard in South Korea. Novatek, together with Sovcomflot, had directly commissioned the construction of icebreaking LNG carriers from Russia's Zvezda shipyard in collaboration with Samsung, which subsequently abandoned the project. Sanctions are also reportedly delaying commissioning by preventing access to key Western technology. France's GTT and US-based General Electric, suppliers of some of the equipment for these LNG carriers, withdrew from Russia in 2023 because of the sanctions.

Sanctions on LNG transshipment and access to technology impose a very high cost on Russia without significantly harming EU interests. As recommended by the Agency of EU Energy Regulators, ACER, reductions in Russian LNG imports should be approached with caution, especially in light of the imminent expiry of the contract for Russian gas transit to Europe via Ukraine at the end of 2024. It seems more reasonable to focus efforts on limiting access to Western technology and transshipment services to Russian LNG companies, minimising the impact on the European natural gas market and maximising costs for Russian gas companies and Russian coffers.",eurasiareview.com,news,Eurasia Review,Elcano Royal Institute,0.0117647058823529,453427167,1,https://www.eurasiareview.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/a-3-e1715730886278.jpg,eng-9562354

The latest plan: ban use of European Union ports for re-exporting liquefied natural gas.

Russian producer Novatek PJSC relies on stopovers in the EU to move Arctic fuel from ice-class ships onto conventional tankers. While choking off its access won't prevent cargoes from reaching Europe -- where LNG imports from Russia have actually increased in the aftermath of the war -- it will make it harder to send them onward to third countries in Asia, potentially angering key buyers such as China or India.

EU policymakers are discussing the move as part of their 14th package of sanctions against Russia. While it isn't an outright ban, it would mark the first time Europe enforces concrete measures against Russian LNG.

If approved, the measure may lead to even more Russian fuel circulating in Europe. It would also likely trigger contractual challenges for European logistics firms and political backlash from other gas-buying nations.

What exactly will be sanctioned?

To optimise shipping costs, the Arctic-based Yamal LNG project -- led by Novatek -- relies on the ports of Zeebrugge in Belgium and Montoir in France to transfer cargoes from its 15 ice-class vessels onto conventional tankers. Typically, an arriving ship discharges at the terminal and a standard LNG carrier loads at about the same time. That will no longer be possible under the ban.

For Yamal LNG, the stopovers are necessary to allow highly-specialised vessels to return to the Arctic plant, where conditions are too harsh for regular ones. Ship-tracking data indicate that up to eight Russian cargoes are transshipped in Europe in some months, although the number varies and drops significantly during summer and autumn, when the Northern Sea Route across the Arctic has less ice and provides faster access to China.

What will it mean for European LNG purchases?

EU imports of Russian LNG totalled 14.4mn tonnes last year, according to consultant Energy Aspects Ltd Transshipments, where the fuel is transferred, made up 2mn tonnes. A likely scenario is that a ban will lead to those extra volumes remaining in the bloc, where Russian LNG already holds a share of about 13%.

For example, Novatek could unload cargoes meant for Asia in Europe and use locational swaps, said James Waddel, head of European gas and global LNG at Energy Aspects. This means it would source gas elsewhere to supply Asian customers.

As a result, that ""would open up European governments to accusations that they are turning up their Russian LNG supply while claiming they are trying to minimise it,"" Waddel said.

Will Russian LNG production suffer?

The sanctions would further complicate shipping logistics for Russia and force specialised vessels to travel over longer routes. Global fleets are already avoiding the Red Sea after attacks by Yemen's Houthis, forcing journeys to reroute around Africa. Taking Yamal LNG cargoes directly to Asia would raise freight and logistics costs, according to Energy Aspects, and also tie up the icebreakers for longer.

Russia does have some alternatives: it conducts ship-to-ship transfers near its northern city of Murmansk, which it could use to free up vessels. It can also make use of its Northern Sea Route during summer when ice melts and a variety of ships can access the plant.

If alternative shipping arrangements fail, Russian LNG exports may be reduced. But the country has been pretty resourceful in getting around Western sanctions on oil.

What will the ban mean for Asian customers?

Russian LNG exports to Asian buyers could decline or become more expensive to account for higher freight costs, according to Energy Aspects.

In an extreme scenario, ""if Novatek were unable to reconfigure its logistics and Russian LNG exports were shut in, Europe would be disrupting a Russian supply contract with China for 3mn tonnes per year, which may generate a political backlash from China,"" Waddel said.

Relying on the Northern Sea Route or Murmansk transshipment would also depend on ice conditions, shifting supplies to Asia to the second half of each calendar year, he added.

How would European companies be impacted?

European companies such as Germany's state-owned Securing Energy for Europe GmbH, Shell Plc and TotalEnergies SE rely on transshipments in Zeebrugge and Montoir for Yamal cargoes, according to a contract base published by the global importers' group.

Those contracts won't expire until 2038 and 2041, potentially opening the door to force majeure notices or contractual disputes if transshipments are banned.

SEFE, for example, needs Yamal LNG volumes transshipped in Zeebrugge to serve its long-term contract with India's GAIL Ltd. The chief of the German company told Bloomberg earlier this year that Yamal supplies could stay on the continent if it's cheaper logistically, while supplying GAIL from other sources. SEFE said it's monitoring the developments and declined to comment in detail on the potential impact of the sanctions package.

Will there be other losers?

One of the biggest losers might be Fluxys SA, which operates the Zeebrugge LNG terminal. The company built a dedicated storage tank at the terminal to service a 20-year contract with Yamal Trade, a trading arm for Yamal LNG.

The terminal may announce a force majeure in case of sanctions on transshipments, or face penalties as high as €1bn ($1.1bn) if it cannot provide Yamal Trade the service for the remainder of the contract's duration, according to one market estimate. A Fluxys spokesperson said it's unclear what exactly will be covered by the sanctions, and therefore impossible to estimate the exact impact.",gulf-times.com,news,Gulf-Times,,0.0117647058823529,453407503,15,https://www.gulf-times.com/gulftimes/uploads/images/2024/05/14/thumbs/300x300/175921.jpg,eng-9564315

SEFE, for example, needs Yamal LNG volumes transshipped in Zeebrugge to serve its long-term contract with India's GAIL Ltd. The chief of the German company told Bloomberg earlier this year that Yamal supplies could stay on the continent if it's cheaper logistically, while supplying GAIL from other sources. SEFE said it's monitoring the developments and declined to comment in detail on the potential impact of the sanctions package.

Will there be other losers?

One of the biggest losers might be Fluxys SA, which operates the Zeebrugge LNG terminal. The company built a dedicated storage tank at the terminal to service a 20-year contract with Yamal Trade, a trading arm for Yamal LNG.

The terminal may announce a force majeure in case of sanctions on transshipments, or face penalties as high as €1 billion ($1.1 billion) if it cannot provide Yamal Trade the service for the remainder of the contract's duration, according to one market estimate.

Should the Belgian government's actions prevent obligations under the transshipment contract, this would be classified as force majeure, according to the contract terms published on Fluxys' website.

""It would be bad for the European ports handling transshipment,"" said Katja Yafimava, senior research fellow of the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies.

Image by ffikretow via iStock

Since the start of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Europe and its allies have looked for ways to curb Moscow's fossil fuel revenues without inflicting higher energy costs on their own citizens. The latest plan: ban use of European Union ports for re-exporting liquefied natural gas.

Russian producer Novatek PJSC relies on stopovers in the EU to move Arctic fuel from ice-class ships onto conventional tankers. While choking off its access won't prevent cargoes from reaching Europe -- where LNG imports from Russia have actually increased in the aftermath of the war -- it will make it harder to send them onward to third countries in Asia, potentially angering key buyers such as China or India.

EU policymakers are discussing the move as part of their 14th package of sanctions against Russia. While it isn't an outright ban, it would mark the first time Europe enforces concrete measures against Russian LNG.

If approved, the measure may lead to even more Russian fuel circulating in Europe. It would also likely trigger contractual challenges for European logistics firms and political backlash from other gas-buying nations.

What exactly will be sanctioned?

To optimize shipping costs, the Arctic-based Yamal LNG project -- led by Novatek -- relies on the ports of Zeebrugge in Belgium and Montoir in France to transfer cargoes from its 15 ice-class vessels onto conventional tankers. Typically, an arriving ship discharges at the terminal and a standard LNG carrier loads at about the same time. That will no longer be possible under the ban.

For Yamal LNG, the stopovers are necessary to allow highly-specialized vessels to return to the Arctic plant, where conditions are too harsh for regular ones. Ship-tracking data indicate that up to eight Russian cargoes are transshipped in Europe in some months, although the number varies and drops significantly during summer and autumn, when the Northern Sea Route across the Arctic has less ice and provides faster access to China.

What will it mean for European LNG purchases?

EU imports of Russian LNG totaled 14.4 million tons last year, according to consultant Energy Aspects Ltd. Transshipments, where the fuel is transferred, made up 2 million tons. A likely scenario is that a ban will lead to those extra volumes remaining in the bloc, where Russian LNG already holds a share of about 13%.

For example, Novatek could unload cargoes meant for Asia in Europe and use locational swaps, said James Waddel, head of European gas and global LNG at Energy Aspects. This means it would source gas elsewhere to supply Asian customers.

As a result, that ""would open up European governments to accusations that they are turning up their Russian LNG supply while claiming they are trying to minimize it,"" Waddel said.

Will Russian LNG production suffer?

The sanctions would further complicate shipping logistics for Russia and force specialized vessels to travel over longer routes. Global fleets are already avoiding the Red Sea after attacks by Yemen's Houthis, forcing journeys to reroute around Africa. Taking Yamal LNG cargoes directly to Asia would raise freight and logistics costs, according to Energy Aspects, and also tie up the icebreakers for longer.

Russia does have some alternatives: it conducts ship-to-ship transfers near its northern city of Murmansk, which it could use to free up vessels. It can also make use of its Northern Sea Route during summer when ice melts and a variety of ships can access the plant.

If alternative shipping arrangements fail, Russian LNG exports may be reduced. But the country has been pretty resourceful in getting around Western sanctions on oil.

What will the ban mean for Asian customers?

Russian LNG exports to Asian buyers could decline or become more expensive to account for higher freight costs, according to Energy Aspects.

In an extreme scenario, ""if Novatek were unable to reconfigure its logistics and Russian LNG exports were shut in, Europe would be disrupting a Russian supply contract with China for 3 million tons per year, which may generate a political backlash from China,"" Waddel said.

Relying on the Northern Sea Route or Murmansk transshipment would also depend on ice conditions, shifting supplies to Asia to the second half of each calendar year, he added.

European companies such as Germany's state-owned Securing Energy for Europe GmbH, Shell Plc and TotalEnergies SE rely on transshipments in Zeebrugge and Montoir for Yamal cargoes, according to a contract base published by the global importers' group.

While choking off its access won't prevent cargoes from reaching Europe -- where LNG imports from Russia have actually increased in the aftermath of the war -- it will make it harder to send them onward to third countries in Asia, potentially angering key buyers such as China or India.

EU policymakers are discussing the move as part of their 14th package of sanctions against Russia. While it isn't an outright ban, it would mark the first time Europe enforces concrete measures against Russian LNG.

If approved, the measure may lead to even more Russian fuel circulating in Europe. It would also likely trigger contractual challenges for European logistics firms and political backlash from other gas-buying nations.

What exactly will be sanctioned?

To optimize shipping costs, the Arctic-based Yamal LNG project -- led by Novatek -- relies on the ports of Zeebrugge in Belgium and Montoir in France to transfer cargoes from its 15 ice-class vessels onto conventional tankers. Typically, an arriving ship discharges at the terminal and a standard LNG carrier loads at about the same time. That will no longer be possible under the ban.

For Yamal LNG, the stopovers are necessary to allow highly-specialized vessels to return to the Arctic plant, where conditions are too harsh for regular ones. Ship-tracking data indicate that up to eight Russian cargoes are transshipped in Europe in some months, although the number varies and drops significantly during summer and autumn, when the Northern Sea Route across the Arctic has less ice and provides faster access to China.

What will it mean for European LNG purchases?

EU imports of Russian LNG totaled 14.4 million tons last year, according to consultant Energy Aspects Ltd. Transshipments, where the fuel is transferred, made up 2 million tons. A likely scenario is that a ban will lead to those extra volumes remaining in the bloc, where Russian LNG already holds a share of about 13%.

For example, Novatek could unload cargoes meant for Asia in Europe and use locational swaps, said James Waddel, head of European gas and global LNG at Energy Aspects. This means it would source gas elsewhere to supply Asian customers.

As a result, that ""would open up European governments to accusations that they are turning up their Russian LNG supply while claiming they are trying to minimize it,"" Waddel said.

Will Russian LNG production suffer?

The sanctions would further complicate shipping logistics for Russia and force specialized vessels to travel over longer routes. Global fleets are already avoiding the Red Sea after attacks by Yemen's Houthis, forcing journeys to reroute around Africa. Taking Yamal LNG cargoes directly to Asia would raise freight and logistics costs, according to Energy Aspects, and also tie up the icebreakers for longer.

Russia does have some alternatives: it conducts ship-to-ship transfers near its northern city of Murmansk, which it could use to free up vessels. It can also make use of its Northern Sea Route during summer when ice melts and a variety of ships can access the plant.

If alternative shipping arrangements fail, Russian LNG exports may be reduced. But the country has been pretty resourceful in getting around Western sanctions on oil.

What will the ban mean for Asian customers?

Russian LNG exports to Asian buyers could decline or become more expensive to account for higher freight costs, according to Energy Aspects.

In an extreme scenario, ""if Novatek were unable to reconfigure its logistics and Russian LNG exports were shut in, Europe would be disrupting a Russian supply contract with China for 3 million tons per year, which may generate a political backlash from China,"" Waddel said.

Relying on the Northern Sea Route or Murmansk transshipment would also depend on ice conditions, shifting supplies to Asia to the second half of each calendar year, he added.

How would European companies be impacted?

European companies such as Germany's state-owned Securing Energy for Europe GmbH, Shell Plc and TotalEnergies SE rely on transshipments in Zeebrugge and Montoir for Yamal cargoes, according to a contract base published by the global importers' group.

Those contracts won't expire until 2038 and 2041, potentially opening the door to force majeure notices or contractual disputes if transshipments are banned.

SEFE, for example, needs Yamal LNG volumes transshipped in Zeebrugge to serve its long-term contract with India's GAIL Ltd. The chief of the German company told Bloomberg earlier this year that Yamal supplies could stay on the continent if it's cheaper logistically, while supplying GAIL from other sources. SEFE said it's monitoring the developments and declined to comment in detail on the potential impact of the sanctions package.

Will there be other losers?

One of the biggest losers might be Fluxys SA, which operates the Zeebrugge LNG terminal. The company built a dedicated storage tank at the terminal to service a 20-year contract with Yamal Trade, a trading arm for Yamal LNG.

The terminal may announce a force majeure in case of sanctions on transshipments, or face penalties as high as €1 billion ($1.1 billion) if it cannot provide Yamal Trade the service for the remainder of the contract's duration, according to one market estimate. A Fluxys spokesperson said it's unclear what exactly will be covered by the sanctions, and therefore impossible to estimate the exact impact.

For the first time, it targets Russian LNG exports.

As earlier reported by Politico, the European Commission introduced the proposal to member states on 3 May. The tabled project of the 14 package of sanctions can impose sanctions on Russia's liquefied natural gas (LNG) industry for the first time, aiming to limit Russia's LNG revenues and future capacity expansion. The proposed measures wouldn't directly block Russian LNG imports to the EU but would prohibit EU countries from re-exporting Russian LNG after receiving it.

Up to this point, EU and US measures have been focused on inhibiting the country's ability to construct new LNG projects and deliver those supplies to markets. An EU ban on transshipments would, for the first time, directly target existing Russian LNG production and exports.

Recently, major European economies like Germany and Italy came out in support of the complete import ban. However, it could not garner the required unanimous support of all 27 members, so the ban on transshipments comes as a compromise. Yet, it can become a big blow to Russia's image of energy dominance.

The EU's previous attempts to limit Russian energy, such as bans on Russian coal and seaborne crude oil, have been circumvented, prompting increased pressure on the block's leaders to target Russian gas.

Despite an overall decrease in Russian gas imports by around two-thirds since the war in Ukraine began, LNG imports have increased significantly compared to pre-invasion levels.

The Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA), an independent organization that tracks Russian fossil fuels, estimates the bloc paid €8.2 billion last year for 20 billion cubic meters (bcm) of Russian LNG, representing 5% of the total gas consumption. Belgium, France, and Spain were the main entry points for Russian LNG.

CREA says about 22% of Russian LNG supplies to European ports were transshipped globally, with China, India, and Türkiye among key final destinations.

Russia's ability to access EU ports to receive and transfer LNG from Arctic-capable carriers to conventional carriers has been a key to selling its gas to global markets. Without access to land-based LNG storage facilities and transshipment hubs, it may resort to ship-to-ship transfers in Russian or international waters.

These operations require relatively calm seas and do not offer the same flexibility and schedule reliability as port-based terminals.

Novatek, which operates Russia's largest terminal Yamal LNG, is heavily reliant on European transshipment hubs for reaching markets outside of the EU. Potential direct financial loss from logistical hurdles, reduced exports and global LNG market share for Novatek is estimated to reach 2 billion Euro by the end of the year.

The main LNG terminals that have received the bulk of supply from Russia's Yamal LNG project are Zeebrugge in Belgium, followed by Montoir-de-Bretagne in France, and Bilbao in Spain.

Around two-thirds of transshipments pass through the port of Zeebrugge, with Belgium's gas operator Fluxys having a 20-year contract with Yamal LNG. An EU-wide ban on the reloading would follow calls by the Belgian government that a binding agreement was needed to effectuate a change.

The proposal from the European Commission breaks a long-held taboo in Brussels as Russian gas has been, until now, completely spared from any restrictions.

The governments of Sweden, Germany, Italy, and Belgium have all publicly supported this in recent statements, but the two top three importers of Russian LNG -- France and Spain -- remain largely silent on the issue.

In the first three months of 2024 France has paid Russia €600 million ($644 million) for liquified natural gas imports, making it the fastest-growing consumer of Russian LNG in the EU.

France's lead in the volume and growth of Russian LNG imports in 2024, with a total of 1.5 mn tonnes, sets it apart within the EU. Other major buyers like Belgium, Spain, and the Netherlands have expressed willingness to reduce purchases but emphasize the need for collective action.

According to Politico, critics argue that Paris' inaction is in part due to resistance from French energy giant TotalEnergies, which was a long-time partner of Novatek and still has a 20% stake in the Yamal LNG project.

The partnership between TotalEnergies and Novatek has played a pivotal role in enabling exports of Russian liquefied natural gas to Europe and other regions of the world, especially since 2017, when the Yamal LNG terminal started operation. Now, the joint venture currently provides the bulk of Russian LNG exports.

According to a Le Monde investigation, another French company, Technip Energies, supplied equipment to the Russian Arctic LNG 2 project between August and October 2022 despite EU sanctions imposed in April 2022 that prohibited the sale, supply, transfer, or export of goods and technology suited for use in oil refining and natural gas liquefaction to any entity or body in Russia.

The report issued by Friends of the Earth France in April 2024 highlighted the broad negative impact of fossil fuel industry interests on the integrity of France's energy and foreign policies.

In its press release, supported by Razom We Stand and other groups, FoE argues that France's involvement has become an essential part of the Russian gas market expansion:

""This allows Russia to export more gas, finances the war on Ukraine and has nothing to do with providing French energy security. It is time to refuse to be locked into this deleterious dependence on outdated fossil energy and transition towards a sustainable energy system.""

Now, it is up to France's Prime Minister Gabriel Attal and Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire to take the upper hand over the private interests of the fossil fuel industry, change course, and start steering away from dirty Russian energy.

In March 2024, Spain's Teresa Ribera called for a common approach from the European Commission to ban Russian gas, including the seaborne LNG. But those statements had little effect on Spain's ongoing addiction to Russian gas.

In March 2024, Russian LNG comprised almost 26% of Spain's total gas imports, up from 14.4% a year earlier, confirming that the Iberian country is a key entry hub for Russian gas into Europe.

In April 2024, Russia's state-run energy company, Gazprom, delivered its second shipment of LNG from its small-scale Portovaya LNG plant on the Baltic Sea to Spain, according to Reuters analysis of shipping data. A tanker known as the Cool Rover loaded LNG ship-to-ship from the floating storage and regasification unit, the Marshal Vasilkevskiy, and discharged at the BBG LNG terminal in the Spanish port town of Bilbao.

Data by S&P Global published on 9 April showed that between October 2023 and March 2024, Russian LNG deliveries into Spain amounted to 2.57 million tons, compared with 2.28 million tons for the same period a year earlier. S&P analysts also stated that Spain has no plans to diversify away from Russian LNG.

Spanish energy companies Repsol and Naturgy are among the largest buyers of Russian LNG globally. In 2023, Spain was the leading importer of Russian LNG among all EU countries

Hydrogen Pipeline Market Analysis

Based on classification, the repurposed hydrogen pipeline segment will exceed more than USD 650 million by 2035. The pipelines involve converting existing natural gas pipelines for the transportation of hydrogen. They enable this blending process, allowing for a smooth transition toward higher hydrogen content in the gas grid, thereby supporting the development of hydrogen infrastructure. These are more cost effective than building new infrastructure. Blending allows for the gradual introduction of hydrogen into existing natural gas infrastructure, supporting the transition to a hydrogen economy, thereby stimulating the business statistics.

Based on type, the onshore hydrogen pipeline will showcase gains at nearly 59.5% up to 2035. The onshore pipelines are designed to transport hydrogen gas from production sites, comprising of electrolysis plants or steam methane reforming facilities, to various points of consumption. These play a crucial role in the transportation of hydrogen from production facilities to end users, including industrial consumers, power plants, and refueling stations for fuel cell vehicles. Further, these are designed to facilitate the blending of hydrogen with other gases, including natural gas.

Ongoing integrated with other elements, including production facilities, storage systems, and distribution networks, to create a seamless and efficient hydrogen delivery system will drive the product demand. The length and connectivity of the onshore hydrogen pipelines depend on the geographical distribution of hydrogen demand centers and production sites. The long distance pipelines further connect regions with surplus hydrogen production to areas with high demand. They need to comply with local, regional, and national regulations governing the transportation of hazardous materials, thereby augmenting the business landscape.

Europe hydrogen pipeline market is projected to witness about 105.5% CAGR through 2035. The European Union (EU) and individual European countries have been actively pursuing strategies to integrate hydrogen into their energy systems as part of broader decarbonization efforts.

According to the report, the proposals on the table would only touch a fraction of the billions Moscow gets annually from liquified natural gas, leaving plenty for its war chest.

""The European Commission is poised to release a proposed ban on EU ports reselling Moscow LNG as soon as Friday, according to three EU diplomats. The Commission will also ask for restrictions on three upcoming Russian LNG projects, they added. The measures will come as part of Brussels' 14th sanctions package, "" the news report noted.

The LNG sanctions are designed to stifle a lucrative business for Moscow that keeps its energy cargoes moving around the world. Yet as written in draft proposals -- still subject to change -- the penalties would only hit around a quarter of Russia's €8 billion in LNG profits, according to experts and data analyzed by POLITICO.

That comes amid repeated warnings that EU and Western efforts to choke off Moscow's fossil fuel revenues have largely failed. While the EU has banned imports of Russian coal and seaborne crude oil, numerous loopholes and evasive tactics have kept money flowing to the Kremlin.

Meanwhile, the EU has made little progress in punishing Moscow's LNG sector. Although the fuel made up just 5 percent of the EU's gas consumption last year, it remains a cash cow that the Kremlin relies on to wage war. France, Spain and Belgium have been the biggest hubs for the supercooled gas, much of which is then exported to countries including Germany and Italy.

- Breaking the ice

Halting the EU resale of Russian LNG would require Moscow to overhaul its current business model -- no small feat.

Without European ports as a convenient layover stop, Russia would have to use specially equipped icebreakers that cut through Arctic Sea ice -- which are in short supply -- to get its gas to Asia.

That would hurt Russia's vast $27 billion Yamal LNG plant in the Siberian far north, according to Laura Page, a gas expert at the Kpler data analytics firm.

""If they can't transship in Europe, they might have to take their ice-class tankers on longer journeys,"" she said, meaning Russia ""may not be able to get out as many loadings from Yamal because their vessels can't get back as quickly.""

The shift would blow a €2 billion hole in Russia's LNG revenues, based on last year's figures, said Petras Katinas, an energy analyst at the Center for Research on Energy and Clean Air think tank.

That's a lot of money but represents only 28 percent of Russia's LNG profits and just over a fifth of its exports to the EU last year.

The ban ""is a good first step forward,"" Katinas said, but ""it's not enough"" if the EU wants to throttle the Kremlin's cash flow.

Meanwhile, potential sanctions on Russian LNG projects -- including Arctic LNG 2, its Murmansk plant, and the UST Luga LNG terminal -- are a ""paper tiger,"" Katinas said, since none of them are currently sending cargoes to Europe.

The EU's proposals are also laden with legal complications.

Depending on how the Commission defines ""transshipments,"" the importers likely to be most affected will be Spain's Naturgy, France's Elengy and Belgium's Fluxys, said Katinas, all of which have long-term contracts linked to Russia's Yamal LNG.

But it's unclear whether EU sanctions would allow the firms to safely end their contracts unilaterally without facing penalties or legal action from their Russian partners, he added.

A spokesperson for Fluxys said it would ""fully comply"" with sanctions if imposed, but noted the firm had ""no control"" over the origin of LNG kept in its storage sites and that it was ""obliged to respect the contractual agreements"" with its customers.

Elengy and Naturgy didn't respond to requests for comment. Novatek, Gazprom and RusGazDobycha, the owners and operators of the Russian LNG projects being considered for EU sanctions, also didn't respond to questions sent by POLITICO.

-Liquid luck

The Commission has resisted sanctioning LNG so far despite repeated requests from the Baltic countries and Poland. The new proposal, however, seems to be gathering political support quickly.

""As part of a new package of sanctions against Russia, the federal government is calling for a gradual end to transshipment of Russian LNG in European ports,"" Belgian Energy Minister Tinne van der Straeten said on Tuesday. ""We must ... stop adding to Putin's war chest.""

German Economy Minister Robert Habeck said last week that he would ""very much support"" restrictions on Moscow's LNG -- the endorsement is crucial given Germany's size -- while Italy's Energy Minister Gilberto Pichetto Fratin told POLITICO on Sunday the country ""has no reason to oppose"" such sanctions.

Pressure is also mounting on EU countries to tighten penalties on Russian fossil fuels, given that some are showing diminishing returns. Just this week a group of ocean tanker insurers controlling much of the global market called a G7 measure to limit Russia's oil revenues to $60 per barrel ""increasingly unenforceable"" as Moscow relies on a parallel trade conducted by shadow vessels outside Western control.

Still, Brussels may struggle to get all 27 capitals on board with the new LNG penalties, a requirement for any sanctions to pass. Hungary, for example, may veto the move in light of its historical record of blocking restrictions on Russian gas out of principle.

For others, meanwhile, the sanctions package is anticlimactic.

It's ""disappointing ... that we've been waiting for such a long time for the proposal of the 14th package,"" said one EU diplomat, who was granted anonymity to speak candidly.

Sanctions are ""meant to hurt the Russian economy and its ability to wage the war in Ukraine,"" the diplomat added. ""All the more [reason why] the 14th package should be comprehensive and strong.""",english.aawsat.com,news,Asharq Al-Awsat English,,-0.2235294117647059,452660721,15,https://english.aawsat.com/s3/files/styles/1200x600/public/2024-05/636295_0.jpeg,eng-9538653
