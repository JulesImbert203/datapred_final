As part of an audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. The examination of the administration and the proposed appropriations of the company's profit or loss is based primarily on the audit of the accounts. Additional audit procedures performed are based on our professional judgment with starting point in risk and materiality.

The seizures were made under the Law on the Transfer, Forced Alienation, or Seizure of Property under Martial Law or State of Emergency, which obligates the state to eventually return the seized assets to the owners or give them fair compensation.

Naftogaz owns 43.05% of Ukrtatnafta. The remaining shares were allegedly divided between the so called Privat group, associated with tycoons Ihor Kolomoiskyi and Hennadiy Boholyubov, and Oleksandr Yaroslavskyi.

According to Naftogaz, the Defense Ministry now manages the shares of Ukrtatnafta that belonged to private owners.

As we reported in Issue 68, former CEO of WOG gas stations chain Serhiy Koretskyi became the CEO of both Ukrnafta and Ukrtatnafta on Nov. 8 and 10, respectively.

As we also reported in Issue 68, the Defense Ministry, as Ukrnafta and Ukrtatnafta's new shareholder, appointed new supervisory boards at these companies on Nov. 7, 2022. At both companies, all new board members were appointed as shareholder representatives - with all of them nominated and appointed by one shareholder, the Defense Ministry.

Several facilities were hit, and six railway workers were non-fatally injured. Trains continued to run on schedule.

As we reported earlier, Ukrzaliznytsia's civilian infrastructure in and around Dnipro was also shelled by Russian troops on April 19. See Issue 128 for more detail.

On May 8, Ukrzaliznytsia's civilian infrastructure in Kherson was also shelled. See Issue 131 for more detail.

SASU identifies shortcomings to the tune of Hr 330 million ($8.2 million) at Ukrspyrt; the company is on the verge of bankruptcy. On May 23, the State Audit Service of Ukraine (SASU) reported the findings of Ukrspyrt's financial audit.

According to SASU, Ukrspyrt, the largest alcohol distillery producer and state monopoly, has completely ceased production activities since April 2023 and owes millions to the state budget and other creditors.

The demonopolization and reform of the alcohol industry began in 2020. The state budget was forecasted to receive about Hr 5 billion ($124 million). The privatization of distilleries was supposed to be completed in 2021 (according to the Program for Reforming and Developing the Alcohol Industry for 2020-2023).

Instead, as of April 1, eight of Ukrspyrt's enterprises remained unprivatized, resulting in Ukrspyrt missing Hr 95.7 million ($2.4 million) of the planned privatization proceeds (the book value of the property that the winner of the auction would have to pay separately), SASU said.

According to SASU, Ukrspyrt also incurred more than Hr 70 million ($1.7 million) in additional costs to maintain non-operating enterprises and a further of Hr 5.2 million ($128,000) in lost assets. This caused the company to fail to repay its overdue debts to the state budget and other creditors by the end of 2023.

Yet another loss was due to the late implementation of the decision of the Antimonopoly Committee of Ukraine (AMCU) by Ukrspyrt's former management: The company paid a Hr 33 million ($817,000) penalty.

The total amount of identified deficiencies and violations in the use of property and funds is over Hr 330 million ($8.2 million), SASU summarized.

SASU also notes that Ukrspyrt's failure to fulfill its obligations to the state budget and contractors (due to lack of working capital) would result in penalties of Hr 29.3 million ($725,650) and fines of Hr 8.4 million ($208,000) in case the courts decide in favour of the plaintiffs.

As we wrote in Issue 131, on May 6, Stanislav Banchuk was appointed as Ukrspyrt's new acting CEO.

On March 1, 2024, Vitaliy Koval, head of the State Property Fund of Ukraine (SPFU), wrote that privatization of distilleries was in the home stretch, with the Fund planning to privatize 17 more Ukrspyrt facilities in 2024.

According to Koval, the SPFU had run 115 online auctions of Ukrspyrt assets; 54 auctions resulted in sales. The sum of prices went from Hr 1.25 billion ($30.9 million) to Hr 3.01 billion ($74 million) during the auctions.

As we wrote in January 2022 Issue 63, acting CEO of Ukrspyrt Serhiy Bleskun resigned. After that, the Cabinet of Ministers temporarily assigned Vitaliy Zhadobin as the new acting CEO.

On Nov. 11, 2022, the Cabinet appointed Ivan Kucherenko as Ukrspyrt's new acting CEO.

Ukrspyrt last had a permanent CEO in 2014, and the company has since been led by various ""acting"" CEOs.

SPFU sets the terms and starting price for UMCC's privatization, next step is up to the Cabinet. On May 23, the SPFU auction commission determined the terms of privatization of United Mining and Chemical Company (UMCC). The starting price is Hr 3.9 billion ($96.6 million).

The buyer must preserve the core business, invest in modernization, and provide social guarantees for employees.

The SPFU said that it was preparing to submit a draft decision of the Cabinet of Ministers to approve the terms and starting price for the sale. After the Cabinet's approval, an auction on Prozorro.Sale would be announced.

Vitaliy Koval, head of the SPFU, said that seven different business groups that were interested in UMCC before the full-scale war have verbally confirmed their interest.

As we wrote in Issue 33 more than two years ago, the UMCC privatization auction was scheduled to take place on Aug. 31, 2021. Later, in SOE Weekly Issue 41, we reported that the SPFU cancelled that privatization auction, which had only one qualified bidder.

The media published a list of participants allegedly interested in UMCC assets. Some of them said that the asset was not well prepared for privatization, and they did not consider the auction terms fair. Others claimed that the starting price was inadequate. It was reportedly impossible to estimate the company's mineral deposits.

The SPFU's auction commission set Oct. 29, 2021 as the new auction date, but that auction was also cancelled (see Issue 49 for detail). So was the following auction on Dec. 20, 2021 (see Issue 57 for detail).

In Issue 105, we reported that the SPFU changed UMCC's executive board, dismissing first deputy CEO Yaroslava Maksymenko and replacing her with Yegor Perelygin.

As we reported in Issue 106, the SPFU planned for UMCC to be one of the first large companies to be privatized. The starting price would be determined with BDO Corporate Finance, the SPFU's advisor on the privatization of UMCC.

However, as we wrote in Issue 109, then acting head of the SPFU Oleksandr Fedoryshyn said later in October that the SPFU was going to offer investors to buy UMCC in a single package with Demurinsky Mining and Processing Plant.

Vitaliy Koval, the newly appointed head of the SPFU, confirmed this later in an interview (see our Issue 117).

In effect, this suggested that the SPFU's previously announced plans to privatize UMCC as one of the first targets would be seriously delayed, if not put aside.

However, the SPFU's most recent communication suggests that the Fund has discarded the idea of bundling UMCC and Demurinsky in a single lot.

See more on the previous attempts to sell UMCC in our Issues 33, 41, 49, 56, and 57.

Parliament prevents bankruptcy claims for Ukrnafta, Ukrtatnafta, Motor Sich, ZTR, and AvtoKrAZ to protect them from former owners. On May 22, the Verkhovna Rada amended the law on critical infrastructure (Draft Law No. 8316), approving a moratorium on bankruptcy of state-owned critical infrastructure objects during martial law plus two years.

According to one of the authors of the law, MP Oleksandr Fediyenko (Sluha Narodu faction), this will allow the seized Motor Sich, Ukrnafta, Ukrtatnafta, Zaporizhzhiatransformator (ZTR), and AvtoKrAZ to remain in state ownership.

According to Oleksandr Kuznetsov, managing partner of Armada law firm, the government is effectively depriving the creditors of these companies of the right to have their claims considered. ""They would not be able to file an application to secure a claim by seizing the debtor's property,"" he explained. The seizure of these companies should also be lifted, Kuznetsov told Forbes Ukraine.

According to Kuznetsov, to be protected by the law, a company must meet three criteria at once:

The regional gas companies seized from tycoon Dmytro Firtash's Regional Gas Company (RGC) Group also fit this description, Forbes Ukraine added.

As we reported in Issue 114, in 2023 Naftogaz completed taking over all Firtash gas companies.

As we wrote in Issue 113, the integration of regional gas companies establishes Naftogaz as a monopoly in gas distribution, but it is a wartime measure, and they should be privatized via public auctions when ""the situation allows this"", Naftogaz's CEO Oleksii Chernyshov said.

""It's a good law for debtors and a bad law for creditors,"" Vadym Kizlenko, an insolvency officer in the bankruptcy case of AvtoKrAZ, told Forbes Ukraine. The company entered bankruptcy proceedings in 2016 and owes a total of about Hr 5 billion (around $123 million at the going exchange rate) to its 39 creditors, Kizlenko said. According to YouControl, AvtoKrAZ's total debts as of the end of 2023 are estimated at Hr 12.3 billion (around $304 million). The company's revenue reached Hr 303.7 million (around $7.5 million) in 2023.

In addition to AvtoKrAZ, ZTR would also be granted the right to a ""new life without bankruptcy,"" Forbes Ukraine wrote. According to YouControl, in 2023 the company's revenue reached Hr 2.2 billion ($54 million), four times more than in 2022. ""To approve orders and contracts of companies that are already in bankruptcy, the Defense Ministry as the administrator must hold a meeting of creditors every time, and this can delay decisions important for the country's defence capability,"" Kizlenko suggested. ""Closing the bankruptcy case would effectively exclude creditors from this chain,"" he added.

According to Forbes Ukraine, another purpose of the moratorium is to protect these companies from their former owners. In May 2023, tycoon Kostiantyn Zhevago announced his plans to file a lawsuit with the Supreme Court over the seizure of AvtoKrAZ. There has been no news since and now he probably cannot proceed, Kuznetsov said. ""The former owners would not be able to challenge the nationalization procedure and protect their asset by imposing a ban on its alienation or any other actions that may affect the asset. A judicial remedy is meaningless,"" Kuznetsov also said.

The register of critical infrastructure referred to in the law is closed to the public. The State Service for Special Communications and Information Protection (SSSCIP) is in charge of its content and management, Forbes Ukraine also wrote.

""The ban on courts considering disputes over companies only because they belong to critical infrastructure contradicts the Constitution, according to which the state must protect all property,"" Kuznetsov concluded.

In SOE Weekly Issue 68, we reported that the shares of Ukrnafta, Ukrtatnafta, Motor Sich, AvtoKrAZ, and Zaporizhzhiatransformator (ZTR) were seized ""for the needs of the state"" and transferred to the Ministry of Defence on Nov. 6, 2022.

The seizures were made under the Law on the Transfer, Forced Alienation, or Seizure of Property under Martial Law or State of Emergency, which obligates the state to eventually return the seized assets to the owners or give them fair compensation. See Issue 68 for more detail.

ST. PETERSBURG, May 24. /TASS/. The Arbitration Court of St. Petersburg and the Leningrad Region has upheld Gazprom Export's claim against the Czech Republic's CEZ banning it from continuing foreign arbitration proceedings, a TASS correspondent reported from the courtroom.

In case of violation of the ban, the court ruled to recover 57.7 mln euro from the Czech company in favor of Gazprom Export.

""The Arbitration Court of the city of St. Petersburg and the Leningrad Region determined: to prohibit the company CEZ a. s. from continuing proceedings at the International Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce <...>. In case CEZ a. s. fails to comply with the ruling of the court on this case <...> an award in favor of Gazprom Export LLC [in the amount of] 57,734,000 euros in rubles at the rate of the Bank of Russia will be paid by the company CEZ a. s.,"" the judge said.

Earlier, Gazprom Export demanded that CEZ be prohibited from continuing arbitration proceedings at the International Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce in Geneva, and that it be fined if CEZ failed to comply with the judicial act.

It was reported in February 2023 that the Czech energy company CEZ (70% of shares owned by the state) had initiated an arbitration worth $45 mln against Gazprom Export due to a gas shortfall in 2022.

Earlier Gazprom filed claims in the Russian court against German traders Uniper Global Commodities SE and Meta-Methanhandel GmbH, Austria's OMV Exploration & Production GmbH, Czech company NET4GAS, Naftogaz of Ukraine, the Dutch gas transport Gasunie Transport Service, the operator of the BBL gas pipeline between the UK and the Netherlands, Slovakia's ZSE Energia and the Polish-Russian company Europol GAZ, which owns the Polish section of the Yamal-Europe gas pipeline, demanding a ban on continuing arbitration proceedings in foreign courts.

May 24 (Interfax) - Ukrnafta has begun introducing new polymer flooding technology to enhance oil recovery at its fields, first testing it at a field in Ivano-Frankovsk region.

""Ukrnafta specialists have for the first time in the company's history used a modern technology in order to optimize the system to maintain formation pressure. The result was an almost 17% increase in the oil flow rate at the trial site at one of the company's western fields,""

Ukrainian media reported, citing the company's statement.

Specifically, the company said it used flow deviation technology with cross-linked polymer systems, meaning it injected a ""polymer compound into the injection well in order to block flushed zones from injection to production wells and draw in previously unswept areas of the deposit.""

The company pumped 130 cubic meters of polymer compound into the injection well. Its specialists monitored the well for two months and noted a decrease in the water cut and increase in flow rate.

""There are plans to introduce this technology at the fields of all Ukrnafta divisions in order to increase oil production. Sites have already been selected and reagents have been purchased,"" the company said.

Ukrnafta increased production of oil with condensate by 3% to 1.41 million tonnes in 2023 and gas production 5.8% to 1.097 billion cubic meters. The company's strategic goal is to double oil and natural gas production by 2027, to 3 million tonnes and 2 billion cubic meters, respectively.

ST. PETERSBURG, May 22. /TASS/. The Arbitration Court of St. Petersburg and the Leningrad Region upheld Gazprom Export's claim against Austria's OMV Gas Marketing & Trading GmbH banning it from continuing foreign arbitration proceedings, a TASS correspondent reported from the courtroom.

The court ruled that the Austrian company will have to pay Gazprom Export if it violates the ban.

""The Arbitration Court of the city of St. Petersburg and the Leningrad Region determined: to prohibit the company OMF Gas Marketing and Trading GmbH from continuing arbitration proceedings at the Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce <...>.

Earlier, Gazprom Export demanded that OMV Gas Marketing & Trading GmbH be prohibited from continuing arbitration proceedings at the Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce and that it be fined if it failed to comply with the judicial act.

Gazprom Export's lawyer insisted in court that because of sanctions, the company can not get proper legal representation and justice abroad. In particular, a number of EU law firms refused to work with Russian companies, and an agreement on streamlining the issuance of visas was also canceled. Nevertheless, the OMV representative claimed that no personal sanctions had been imposed against Gazprom Export, and the Austrian company proposed - within the same arbitration court - to transfer the hearings to other jurisdictions (including Dubai or Istanbul), but did not receive any response.

OMV Gas Marketing & Trading GmbH is a subsidiary of Austria's OMV AG. In June 2018, an agreement was signed to extend the existing contract between Gazprom Export LLC and OMV Gas Marketing & Trading GmbH to supply Russian natural gas to Austria until 2040. Previously, the contract was signed through 2028.

MOSCOW, May 9. /TASS/. Gazprom supplied gas for Europe through Ukraine in the volume of 42.4 mln cubic meters per day via the Sudzha gas pumping station in Russia's Kursk Region, a Gazprom representative told reporters.

""Gazprom supplies Russian gas for transit through Ukrainian territory in the volume confirmed by the Ukrainian side via the Sudzha gas pumping station of 42.4 mln cubic meters as of May 9. The request for the Sokhranovka gas pumping station has been rejected,"" a Gazprom representative told reporters.

The transit line through Ukraine remains the only route to supply Russian gas to western and central European countries. The pumping through Nord Stream has been fully suspended.

Since May 2022, when GTSOU announced the suspension of transit to Europe via the Sokhranovka station due to force majeure - the company allegedly cannot exercise control over the Novopskov compressor station in the Lugansk People's Republic, Russian gas supplies have been flowing through Ukraine in a reduced volume. The Russian gas holding, on the other hand, saw no reason to stop pumping as before.

In the fall of 2022, Naftogaz of Ukraine petitioned the International Court of Arbitration against Gazprom for allegedly late payment for gas transportation services through Ukrainian territory. Gazprom CEO Alexey Miller stated that the arbitration proceeding is illegitimate and that the Russian holding's participation in the process is pointless.

Ukreximbank appoints a new CEO. On May 3, Ukreximbank reported that its supervisory board had elected Viktor Ponomarenko as the new bank's CEO following a competitive selection.

According to Ukreximbank, the selection was carried out with the assistance of the recruitment company Odgers Berndtson. Ponomarenko's candidacy is yet to be approved by National Bank of Ukraine (NBU).

The bank said that Ponomarenko has over 24 years of experience in the banking sector, including 20 years at ProCredit Bank Ukraine, part of the German financial company ProCredit Holding. Ponomarenko has been ProCredit Bank's CEO since 2012.

As we reported in Issue 123, on March 11, Ukreximbank announced the competitive selection of a new CEO. The submission deadline was April 1.

The bank's current CEO is Serhiy Iermakov, who had been an acting CEO from October 2021 to March 2022, when he was promoted to a full-fledged chief executive.

Viktoriya Strakhova, a member of Ukreximbank's supervisory board, then explained that Iermakov would continue to work as the CEO until a new CEO is appointed. See Issue 123 for more detail.

Ireneusz Fafara resigns from Uknafta's supervisory board to head Polish energy concern Orlen. On April 10, Orlen S.A., an energy group and the largest state-owned company in Poland, announced the appointment of Ireneusz Fafara as its new CEO.

On April 11, Ukrnafta's CEO Sergii Koretskyi wrote on his Facebook page that Fafara filed his resignation notice as an independent member of Ukrnafta's supervisory board.

Naftogaz calls on the EU to help protect gas storage from Russian missiles. According to Financial Times (FT), Naftogaz's CEO Oleksiy Chernyshov called on EU countries to help protect Naftogaz's gas storage facilities from a spate of Russian attacks so that these facilities can keep contributing to lower gas prices across the continent.

""It is in the EU's interest to protect storage, transportation, and production facilities, given that Ukraine's gas infrastructure is well integrated in Europe's energy system,"" Chernyshov said.

According to Naftogaz, its gas storage sites in western Ukraine had come under attack several times in recent months, but only ground facilities had been damaged. Underground storages, which may be as deep as 3 kilometres, had remained unaffected, the company added.

""Technologically, we're all fit, we have managed to repair the damaged surface equipment, and we fulfil our obligations to our customers after the attacks,"" Chernyshov said.

According to FT, Ukraine still acts as a transit route for Russian pipeline gas into Europe, and its underground gas storages provided European traders with valuable space to park their excess gas ahead of last winter as sites in the EU reached maximum capacity.

As we reported in Issue 120, European traders earned about $320 million from using Ukraine's underground storages.

According to Naftogaz, foreign traders and energy companies stored 2.5 billion cubic meters of gas in Ukraine in 2023. Naftogaz aims to increase this to 4 billion cubic meters in 2024.

Naftogaz said that Ukraine offered foreign customers up to 10 billion cubic meters of storage capacity this year, a third of Ukraine's total underground capacity.

Foreign traders transported over 60 million cubic meters of gas to Ukraine in January-February 2024 (see Issue 123).

As we wrote in Issue 126, Ukrtransgaz reported the end of the 2023/2024 heating season and the start of a new season of gas injection into underground storage on 2 April.

As we reported in Issue 129, on 27 April 2024, Russian forces attacked a gas infrastructure facility in the western region of Ukraine. Naftogaz said that no one was injured, and the attack did not affect customer utility access.

Ukrposhta loses Hr 800 million in 2023 (audited). On April 26, Ukrposhta reported its financial results for 2023.

According to a release, Ukrposhta ended 2023 with a loss of Hr 796 million ($20 million). Compared to 2022, the company's net loss decreased by almost 37%, the company added.

Among the significant factors that negatively affected the company's financial performance were delays in approving the regulated tariffs and fulfilling of free-of-charge obligations to support the government's social initiatives, Ukrposhta explained.

The company ended 2023 with a net income of Hr 11.6 billion ($295 million), which is 12% more than the 2022 net income (Hr 10.3 billion, or $262 million). The data was confirmed by an international auditor, Ukrposhta stated.

In 2023, the company continued to implement strategic investment projects, such as upgrading its logistics infrastructure, automating the network, strengthening its resilience to energy and communication disruptions, modernizing its vehicle fleet, and renewing critical IT systems, Ukrposhta also said.

As we reported in Issue 85, Ukrposhta ended 2022 with a loss of Hr 1.258 billion ($32 million). That year, the company had a net revenue of Hr 10.3 billion ($262 million) from sales of goods and services, 7.7% down from 2021. See Issue 85 for more detail.

SPFU takes over 49% of Shell petrol station chain in Ukraine, previously owned by sanctioned Khudainatov. On April 19, the State Property Fund of Ukraine (SPFU) reported that it obtained control over 49% of the chain of Shell petrol stations in Ukraine.

""This is the sanctioned property of Eduard Khudainatov, who owned 49% of Alliance Holding LLC. The company operates a Ukrainian chain of petrol stations under the Shell brand. (The SPFU also acquired control over) 100% of the share capital of Alliance-Ukraine Oil Company LLC, which owns an oil depot and real estate.

Eduard Khudainatov, a former top manager of the Russian state-owned company Rosneft, owns Independent Oil and Gas Company. In June 2022, he was sanctioned by the European Union, and in October 2022, by Ukraine,"" the SPFU explained.

According to Forbes Ukraine, before Russia's full-scale invasion, Shell had 131 petrol stations in Ukraine, of which 118 operate now.

The proceeds from the sale of the sanctioned property would be used to fund the liquidation of the consequences of Russia's armed aggression, the SPFU added.

On Oct. 4, 2023, the Justice Ministry filed a lawsuit with the High Anti-Corruption Court (HACC) to seize Khudainatov's assets, which included Alliance Holding LLC.

In January 2024, the HACC refused to seize a stake in Alliance Holding LLC. The reason was that Shell had increased its stake in the Ukrainian subsidiary after the full-scale invasion to 97.4% via two recapitalisations. The share of the company, which the Justice Ministry associates with Khudainatov, was diluted to 2.6%.

The Justice Ministry appealed, and on April 2, the Appeals Chamber of the HACC allowed the nationalization of a 49% stake in Alliance Holding LLC.

According to Forbes Ukraine, the court agreed with the ministry's argument that Shell had diluted Khudainatov's stake after he was sanctioned. ""There has been a violation of Ukraine's public order and a dilution of the sanctioned person's share bypassing the sanctions,"" the media's source said.

Shell then said that Ukraine's ""unjustified appropriation of (the company's) foreign investments and assets is contrary to international law protecting international investors."" The company would do everything it could to protect its employees, assets, investments, and reputation, Shell added.

On April 29, the SPFU said that it was going to put the 49% stake in the Shell chain up for an open auction after the asset seizure is lifted and the starting price is set. The Fund does not plan to offer this stake exclusively to Shell: The greater the competition for the asset, the greater the benefit to the state budget, the SPFU believes. The Fund was not yet prepared to say when the auction would take place.",kyivindependent.com,news,The Kyiv Independent,,0.07450980392156858,452798381,1,https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/GettyImages-1235727957.jpg,
