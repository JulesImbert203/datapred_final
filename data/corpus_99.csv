China and Central Asia are in easy reach and deals are already being done, but in the long-term India is the big prize. / bne IntelliNews

Eighteen months have passed since the EU banned the import of Russian crude oil and refined products and Moscow has successfully managed to replace what was its biggest export market, Europe, with new customers in Asia and elsewhere. Having overcome obstacles such as the price cap sanctions and the need to make bi-lateral payment mechanisms more efficient, Russia is again exporting maximum oil volumes and while earning less from these exports, it is enough to support the budget and the economy.

The Kremlin has now switched its attention to the gas market. It wants to replace the almost lost European market with new customers in Asia and to diversify the export infrastructure with both new pipeline routes and with a much bigger content of more valuable LNG and LPG.

The reason why the focus has been mostly on the oil market since late 2022 is because that was a relatively easier fix. It required hundreds of small and mostly independent, or more accurate, opaquely owned oil tankers, the so-called ""ghost tanker fleet,"" and flexible price setting. Achieving the same result with gas will not be so easy, or so quick. It will take between five and ten years, even assuming all goes as hoped, to replace the lost European volumes. But this is what President Putin wants to do before the end of what may be his last term as President in 2036.

The scale of the task is clear when one considers that while in 2021 Russia exported 167bn cubic meters (bcm) of natural gas to Europe, last year that volume had collapsed to 45bcm of which 28.3bcm went to EU member states.

In total, Russia exported 203.5bcm of natural gas in 2021 (18.7bcm to Belarus, 8.4bcm to other CIS states and 9.1bcm to Turkey). Last year that total was less than 100bcm. Deputy Prime Minister (DPM) Alexander Novak, who is also Putin's point man for OPEC+ and on geo-energy policy, said that the aim is to rebuild, and expand, gas export volumes steadily over the next decade to a target of 314bcm of natural gas, and close to 100mn tonnes of LNG (equivalent to 135bcm), by 2050, up from 34mn tonnes last year.

The main challenges to achieve these ambitious targets are a combination of sanctions and geography. The more immediate target is to sell more gas to neighbouring China and to the countries in Central Asia which are connected to the Soviet-era pipeline network, and which can be repaired and expanded relatively easily. The big new prize for the Kremlin is the Indian market which Putin has several times referred to as having much greater gas export potential for Russia than Europe had at the peak.

Unlike oil, Russia's gas exports to Europe are not affected by direct sanctions. It was a Russian initiative to shut off the Nord Stream 1 (NS1) pipelines before the newly constructed, but not yet in use, Nord Stream 2 (NS2) pipelines and one of the NS1 pipes were blown up. Russian gas to Europe now transits via the Turkish Stream 2 (TS2) pipeline snaking up the Balkans from the Black Sea-Turkey (Turkish Stream 1 - TS1) route and also uses the remaining Ukraine pipeline transit to customers in Slovakia, Czechia, Hungary and Moldova. TS2 carried just over 20bcm and the Ukraine route carried just under 15bcm last year.

Exports to Europe are expected to stay around the 45bcm level for the foreseeable future. The contract between Gazprom and Ukraine's Naftogaz to transit Russian gas will end this year and Naftogaz has made clear it will not be renewed. But the company has said it will carry Russian gas on behalf of customers in neighbouring Slovakia, etc, so a similar volume to last year (circa 14.65bcm) should continue.

Longer term, and completely depending on whether relations between Russia and the EU return to some form of pragmatism after the conflict ends, it is possible that the undamaged NS1 pipe could be used to carry approximately 20bcm of gas to Germany. But there is no realistic prospect of the three damaged pipes ever being used. The gas flow to Belarus and the Caucasus (approx. 27bcm) should also continue with Belarus taking most of it. Turkey has said it intends to diversify future gas imports, e.g. using more US LNG, but it should continue to take approximately 25bcm from Russia, via Blue Stream and Turkish Stream 1 (TS1).

China is the biggest medium-term target for Moscow. Last year, Russia exported approximately 25bcm to China via the Power of Siberia 1 (PoS1) pipeline. DPM Novak said that the full capacity of the route - 38bcm - should be reached by mid next year.

Therefore, for 2024 and 2025 Russia's natural gas exports to Europe should be 45bcm; to CIS states the volume should be 27bcm; to Turkey it should be 25bcm; and to China, a total of 38bcm. That is a total of 135bcm exported by pipeline and well below the almost 204bcm exported in 2021. More importantly, there is now a much higher percentage of exports sold to countries at a significant price discount to the previous exports to Germany and other EU states. Sales to Belarus and the other CIS states are at less than half the EU price and the sales to China will be at 75% of the EU export price in 2025. It means the monetary value of exports will be hit much harder than the volume decline.

New markets

So, where does Moscow hope to find the new export markets? Some are known and others are in the ""hoped-for"" category. In the former category are additional routes to China and sales to Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. In the latter is India.

In November 2023 Gazprom and the Chinese energy company CPNC signed a contract to build new, and a relatively short gas pipeline in the Far East. It will have a capacity of 10bcm and is planned to be operational by late 2027. In addition, it has recently been announced that Russia and China are exploring the possibility of upgrading the existing network in Kazakhstan to carry an additional 35bcm of Russian gas to China.

If the Kazakh transit route is agreed, then the Power of Siberia 2 (PoS2) will, at least, be further delayed. The 2,600km project, which has been under discussion between Moscow and Beijing for many years, has a planned capacity of 55bcm. Russian officials continue to say that a deal to commence the project is close but Chinese officials conspicuously remain quiet. Very likely the sticking points are the gas price (China will hold out for a big multi-year discount) and the construction costs.

Russia is also now focusing on both Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan as both countries are short of power generating capacity and both suffered from a shortage of gas for heating during the last two winters. Uzbekistan has now agreed to buy 12bcm of gas from Russia and is busy upgrading the pipeline network to accommodate this. Kazakhstan is yet to sign a long-term import deal but is also expected to purchase approximately 10bcm from Gazprom to cover its domestic deficit and to provide gas for President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev's promise to expand urban gasification across the country.

The new Central Asian contracts, along with the Far East pipeline, will bring Russian total exports up to just over 165bcm annually in three years. The proposed 35bcm Kazakh transit exports to China, or the PoS2 volume if that is green-lighted in preference, would get the total back over the 2021 export volume of over 203bcm. But the monetary value of such exports would still be a long way below the lost EU export earnings because of the need to offer discounts to achieve these new exports.

This is why the big prize for the Kremlin is direct access to the Indian market. There are two possible routes, either a pipeline via the proposed Iranian hub or via LNG exports, or a combination of both.

DPM Novak confirmed that Russia and Iran are working on a feasibility study to build a gas hub in the Gulf, offshore Iran and close to the South Pars gas field. The ""provisional plan"" under discussion is to swap Russian gas, piped to Northern Iran, with gas from South Pars to then either feed a direct sub-sea pipeline to Mumbai or to feed into a new LNG plant, possibly built in Oman to avoid sanctions both for the construction and for the buyers of the gas. Some refer to the project as an unlikely ""pipedream"" but President Putin wants it and medium-term commercial considerations will not be a decisive factor.

LNG

The other part of the Russian gas recovery program is LNG. Partly in response to the sanctions threat, which became to the Kremlin from spring 2014, Yamal LNG was built. Managed by Novatek, it exported its first cargo in December 2017 - ironically this cargo was diverted to the UK to prevent a gas shortage crisis at Christmas in the country. Last year approximately half of Russia's total 33mn tonnes of LNG came from Yamal in the west of the country and the remainder from Sakhalin 1 and Sakhalin 2 on the east coast. Approximately 50% of the total LNG output was sold to the EU and the rest to Asian buyers.

Russia has previously set out a very ambitious plan to grow LNG exports to 100mn tonnes by 2030 and to 140mn tonnes by 2025. It had planned to add new projects in the Arctic (the LNG-2 project), in Murmansk and in Ust-Luga. However, the US imposed severe sanctions against LNG-2 last September aimed at blocking equipment supply, engineering support and foreign investment. In February this year those sanctions were expanded to include a ban on the building of new LNG tankers for any Russian project. The stated aim of the US is to cap Russian LNG production at close to last year's volumes.

Because the first (of three) train of LNG-2 is complete, it is expected that this will come into production and add 6mn tonnes of LNG this year. Officials say that the second train is almost ready and can be completed with equipment sourced from China. That should add another 6mn tonnes of LNG production, possibly by end this year or early in 2025. Beyond that, the sanctions will, at best, significantly slow new LNG projects at least until new LNG tankers can be built in Russian shipyards.

The bottom line is that Russia should be able to increase LNG exports from last year's 33mn tonnes to 38mn tonnes this year and to 44mn tonnes for 2025. But then production and exports are likely to be capped for several years. It is possible that a slow delivery of new tankers and equipment may allow exports to growth to 55-60mn tonnes by 2030 but, with the current sanctions regime, even that seems optimistic.

There is no doubt that sanctions targeting the oil sector and Moscow's initiatives in the gas sector, have cost the Russian budget dozens of billions of dollars in lost export receipts. The transition in the oil sector is now over as volumes have recovered and the price discounting is at moderate levels. The gas sector transition has now started. It will be a lot slower and more expensive in terms of construction costs and price discounting than has been the case for oil. But the Kremlin is playing the long game and appears to accept that it will take a further decade to achieve its ambition of balancing the major gas export destinations, as is now the case with oil, between China and India.

Both are eager buyers and willing to side-step western sanctions because Russian oil and gas not only improves energy supply security - especially for China given the risk of sanctions or a trade blockade in the event of a conflict with the US over Taiwan - but adds to their respective global economic competitiveness as the oil and gas, which used to go to Europe and is now replaced with more expensive alternatives, is now heading their way and at a cheaper price. Given that gas will play an important role in global energy for a lot longer than oil, or coal, Moscow's gas strategy is a potential game-changer.",intellinews.com,news,Intellinews                        ,,0.1686274509803922,454743394,9,https://d39raawggeifpx.cloudfront.net/styles/16_9_desktop/s3/articleimages/bneCompany_bneGeneric_Russia_GAzprom_pipeline_power_of_siberia__3.png,

President Volodymyr Zelenskiy of Ukraine has officially inaugurated the biomethane market in the country, a move that could stimulate foreign investment and eventually see Ukraine exporting 22 bcm of the product to cover 20% of the EU's needs.

With one of the largest agricultural land masses in Europe, Ukraine stands poised to become a major player in the continent's biomethane market. The country's unparalleled biomethane potential not only exceeds the annual natural gas consumption of a medium-sized European nation, but also boasts cost advantages over other EU states, wrote energy journalist Dr Aura Sabadus for the Atlantic Council.

The legislation signed into law by Zelenskiy relates to customs control and clearance of biomethane transported via pipeline across Ukraine's customs border.

Ukraine currently boasts 22 biomethane plants poised to integrate into the gas distribution network. The Gas Distribution Networks of Ukraine has already granted technical approval for the connection of plants in the Kyiv and Dnipropetrovsk regions, with approvals pending for facilities in the Khmelnytskyi and Chernihiv regions. Naftogaz Group estimates the potential connection to the gas transportation system at 7.2 bcm and through gas distribution networks at up to 2.4 bcm. Additionally, the option exists to connect biomethane plants via gas filling stations and Ukrgazvydobuvannya's infrastructure.

Currently, five biomethane refining plants are gearing up to produce and export 77mn cubic metres of biomethane this year, with an additional ten plants expected to double production by 2025. As international demand for Ukrainian biomethane grows, projections suggest a potential to cover 20% of the EU's biomethane demand by 2030, with annual output potentially reaching 22 bcm within two decades.

Despite having enacted legislation regulating biomethane production last year, Ukraine faced limitations due to wartime restrictions imposed at the outset of the war. These restrictions, intended primarily for natural gas, inadvertently affected biomethane exports, forcing many companies to halt production or delay investments.

The shift towards biomethane not only reduces Ukraine's reliance on Russian gas and coal imports but also harnesses the potential of its agricultural resources for sustainable energy production, benefitting local producers and European consumers alike.

The recent lifting of export restrictions has reignited optimism among biomethane producers, with plans to commence exports to Germany as early as May. Ukraine aims to establish EU-aligned guarantees of origin, ensuring compliance with European sustainability criteria and facilitating integration into the EU's single market. While this process may take time, Ukrainian companies can initiate exports by providing customs-agreed certificates of compliance or proofs of sustainability.

The new law is also expected to develop a burgeoning energy production sphere and its alignment with international commitments on decarbonisation. Additionally, it facilitates compliance with the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) requirements for exporting products to the European Union, thus enhancing Ukraine's export potential.

Under the provisions of the new law, biomethane transported across Ukraine's customs border will undergo the same customs control and clearance procedures as natural gas. Customs clearance of biomethane will be based on information regarding the volumes of biogas or other alternative gas sources, which can be interchanged with natural gas or their mixture during transit through the gas transport system.

Hanna Zamazeyeva, the head of the State Agency for Energy Efficiency, emphasised the need to stimulate both export and domestic trade of biomethane to reduce reliance on Russian gas and meet international obligations towards renewable energy sources. Deputy Minister of Energy Mykola Kolisnyk affirmed that the necessary technical prerequisites for biomethane production have been established in Ukraine, underscoring the imperative to attract investment to the industry.

Potential measures to attract manufacturers include offering equipment discounts through a refinancing mechanism. Naftogaz, the national energy company, has expressed readiness to support investment in expanding biomethane production and facilitating its transportation. The company also aims to procure biomethane from Ukrainian producers.

Oleksiy Lukashuk, a top manager at Naftogaz Group, underscored the ample infrastructure available to accommodate the burgeoning biomethane industry and that Ukraine's production potential surpasses annual natural gas consumption.

A month ago Naftogaz held its first Ukraine Biomethane Forum. However, the industry's success still hinges on export viability, as current regulations do not subsidise internal production.

May 29 (Interfax) - PJSC Ukrnafta has used hydraulic fracturing to boost the daily flow rate of a well in the country's north-east 25-fold, Ukrainian media quoted company chief Sergei Koretsky as saying on social media.

This is now the company's most productive well with 103 tonnes of oil equivalent per day, he said.

As a result of the work done by the contractor, Takrom Ukraine LLC, the well, which used to produce 4.1 tonnes per day with a bottom-hole pump, now has a flow rate of 73 tonnes of oil and 35,000 cubic meters of gas.

Koretsky also said that as of the end of May, 12 acid frac jobs had been done in 10 wells at an Ukrnafta field in Western Ukraine. Specialists from the field development department used an enhanced slurry composition and combined their own fleet and mobile special equipment.

""The result is that additional cumulative output out from hydraulic and acid fracturing over five months amounted to 8,941 tonnes of oil, the success rate was 93% and the average increase in flow rate was 4x,"" he said.

Ukrnafta increased production of oil with condensate by 39,900 tonnes or 3% to 1,409,900 tonnes in 2023. Production of natural and associated petroleum gas increased by 60.4 mcm or 5.8% to 1.097 billion cubic meters.

Ukrnafta has the strategic goal of doubling oil and natural gas production by 2027, to 3 million tonnes and 2 billion cubic meters, respectively.

Ukrnafta is Ukraine's biggest oil producer. It has a national network of 537 filling stations, of which 456 are operating. The biggest shareholder is Naftogaz with 50% plus one share. The Headquarters of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief ruled on November 5, 2022 to expropriate Ukrnafta shares owned by private shareholders - that stake is now controlled by the Defense Ministry.",interfax.com,news,interfax.com,,0.3960784313725489,454684965,1,,eng-9613800

Why was I saying a year and a half ago that the reason Hunter Biden is untouchable by the Justice Department is because he was part of a CIA operation? Multiple ones, actually. You have to understand what's going on here. Let me give you a dozen data points on Hunter Biden and the CIA.

The first thing is, Hunter was on the chairman's advisory board of the National Democratic Institute, the NDI. The NDI is the DNC wing of the National Endowment for Democracy, which is the top CIA cutout used in our tens of thousands of NGO swarms, NED ranks number one. It was created to be an NGO affiliate of the CIA. It was created to do overtly what the CIA was doing covertly and getting in trouble for doing in the 20th century. Created under the Reagan administration in 1983, there is something called the NDI for Democrats and the IRI for Republicans, the CIA wing of the Republican Party. They both split spoils on US foreign policy jobs that the CIA orchestrates. You don't get to be part of the chairman's advisory committee of the NDI unless you are CIA-linked or CIA-vetted. It is a CIA-organized, non-CIA organization.

When Hunter was at Burisma, who was the other person on the Burisma board from the US? It was Cofer Black, who had spent 30 years in the CIA. Cofer Black was Mitt Romney's ""sherpa to the intelligence community"" during his presidential run in 2012. Mitt Romney is on the board of the IRI, the International Republican Institute, the CIA cutout counterpart to the NDI.

Burisma was a CIA operation. Let me say this again: Burisma was a CIA operation.

So was Naftogaz, the public and then respectively the private and public natural gas companies. There were a couplenof other private ones in addition to Burisma. The CIA was trying to break down Gazprom and swing the gas market from Russia to NATO. They've been trying to do this for 16 friggin' years. It's been an in-process CIA/State Department/Pentagon project for 16 years.

They were trying to capacity-build Burisma and shift its board to make it US-controlled. They're doing the same thing simultaneously with Naftogaz, the feeder that Burisma feeds into. You can even read about the power struggle between George Soros and Vladimir Putin for control over Naftogaz, the state-owned titan that has been the privatization prize of the IMF. That was part of the reason we overthrew the Ukrainian government in 2014 was to privatize those assets because we knew we were going to be cutting Russia off. So Western stakeholders want to profit from this trillion-dollar windfall, if Russia could be kicked out of the European energy market.

This is a common activity for the CIA, which was created by corporate lawyers in 1947. The corporate espionage side of the CIA operation here has geopolitical dimensions. If you kill Russia's energy exports, you kill their military, which means you kill their ability to run air defense systems to Syria. You kill their ability to run small arms to Sub-Saharan Africa to oppose US control over lithium, cobalt, copper, aluminum, gold, and oil and gas. This was a long-range CIA project where Hunter Biden happened to be deep in the number one geopolitical target of what the CIA was doing under the Obama administration, which is trying to kill Russia's energy exports.

Meanwhile, you had this endogenous Ukrainian gas company that Hunter was on the board of. By the way, who was Hunter's dad at the time? It's Joe Biden, the vice president in charge of the Ukraine portfolio. But Joe Biden spent 30 years on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, 10 years rotating between chairman and ranking member. That is the coordinating wing of the Senate with the State Department and the CIA. Specifically, in Central and Eastern Europe, Joe Biden was hugely involved in the Yugoslavia operation in the late 1990s and breaking that up, which again was a CIA job.

That's what you have to understand about the structure of the blob. Whenever you see the State Department, the CIA is there and the Pentagon are there, and you just don't see it yet. Whenever you see the CIA, the State Department and the Pentagon are there, you just don't see it yet. Even British intelligence is all over this LNG story, and you don't get British intelligence without U.S. intelligence.

The fact is the CIA will lean on the Justice Department. I just did six hours of subscriber streams about the relationship between the CIA and DOJ. The CIA will lean on DOJ to kill investigations into criminal activity involving assets of the CIA so that they can continue to do work that's in the U.S. national interest, even if it's a criminal enterprise, because the CIA has a license to do that. They have the license to crime under NSC 10-2, the license to do criminal activity as long as it's plausibly deniable.

Hunter Biden was a part of a plausibly deniable CIA operation to swing the gas market towards NATO. That's why he's untouchable.",realclearpolitics.com,news,Real Clear Politics,Tim Hains,0.1686274509803922,454631574,18,https://assets.realclear.com/images/64/642381_5_.jpg,

""In 2023, the production volumes increased by 5%. We are planning to further develop production in 2024, overall by 4%. However, in the past five months, the actual rise has already reached 10%,"" Ivanchuk said.

Ukreximbank appoints three new top executives. On May 23, Ukreximbank reported that its supervisory board had elected Pavel Haskovec, Maksym Zemlianyi, and Svitlana Ageeva as new members of the bank's executive board following a competitive selection. Their candidacies must now be approved by National Bank of Ukraine (NBU).

Pavel Haskovec has been chosen as NPL Officer. According to the bank's press release, Haskovec has more than 25 years of banking management experience in Ukraine, Austria, Italy, Kazakhstan, and the Czech Republic (including 23 years with UniCredit in various positions in Ukraine, the Czech Republic, Kazakhstan and Italy).

Maksym Zemlianyi has been chosen as Chief Operations Officer (COO). He held leadership roles in Ukrainian banks over 20 years and improved their operational resilience during the full-scale military invasion. Zemlianyi has been TAScombank's deputy CEO since 2016.

Svitlana Ageeva was selected as the new CFO. She has 10 years of financial planning and analysis under her belt from European and Ukrainian banks (including Sense Bank, First Ukrainian International Bank, as well as TBI Bank in Bulgaria).

As we wrote in Issue 130, on May 3, Ukreximbank's supervisory board had elected Viktor Ponomarenko as the bank's new CEO following a competitive selection. His candidacy is yet to be approved by the NBU. Until then, Serhiy Iermakov, will continue as the bank's current CEO. (See Issue 123 for detail.)

Independent supervisory board to be formed at Ukrtatnafta. On May 21, Naftogaz and Ukraine's Defense Ministry - Ukrtatnafta's shareholders jointly holding 100% of the company's shares - began the process of establishing a supervisory board.

According to Naftogaz's press release, the board will include a majority of independent members, nominated via a competitive selection, as well as shareholders' representatives.

In SOE Weekly Issue 68, we reported that the shares of Ukrnafta, Ukrtatnafta, Motor Sich, AvtoKrAZ, and Zaporizhzhiatransformator (ZTR) were seized ""for the needs of the state"" and transferred to the Defense Ministry on Nov. 6, 2022.

The seizures were made under the Law on the Transfer, Forced Alienation, or Seizure of Property under Martial Law or State of Emergency, which obligates the state to eventually return the seized assets to the owners or give them fair compensation.

Naftogaz owns 43.05% of Ukrtatnafta. The remaining shares were allegedly divided between the so called Privat group, associated with tycoons Ihor Kolomoiskyi and Hennadiy Boholyubov, and Oleksandr Yaroslavskyi.

According to Naftogaz, the Defense Ministry now manages the shares of Ukrtatnafta that belonged to private owners.

As we reported in Issue 68, former CEO of WOG gas stations chain Serhiy Koretskyi became the CEO of both Ukrnafta and Ukrtatnafta on Nov. 8 and 10, respectively.

As we also reported in Issue 68, the Defense Ministry, as Ukrnafta and Ukrtatnafta's new shareholder, appointed new supervisory boards at these companies on Nov. 7, 2022. At both companies, all new board members were appointed as shareholder representatives - with all of them nominated and appointed by one shareholder, the Defense Ministry.

Several facilities were hit, and six railway workers were non-fatally injured. Trains continued to run on schedule.

As we reported earlier, Ukrzaliznytsia's civilian infrastructure in and around Dnipro was also shelled by Russian troops on April 19. See Issue 128 for more detail.

On May 8, Ukrzaliznytsia's civilian infrastructure in Kherson was also shelled. See Issue 131 for more detail.

SASU identifies shortcomings to the tune of Hr 330 million ($8.2 million) at Ukrspyrt; the company is on the verge of bankruptcy. On May 23, the State Audit Service of Ukraine (SASU) reported the findings of Ukrspyrt's financial audit.

According to SASU, Ukrspyrt, the largest alcohol distillery producer and state monopoly, has completely ceased production activities since April 2023 and owes millions to the state budget and other creditors.

The demonopolization and reform of the alcohol industry began in 2020. The state budget was forecasted to receive about Hr 5 billion ($124 million). The privatization of distilleries was supposed to be completed in 2021 (according to the Program for Reforming and Developing the Alcohol Industry for 2020-2023).

Instead, as of April 1, eight of Ukrspyrt's enterprises remained unprivatized, resulting in Ukrspyrt missing Hr 95.7 million ($2.4 million) of the planned privatization proceeds (the book value of the property that the winner of the auction would have to pay separately), SASU said.

According to SASU, Ukrspyrt also incurred more than Hr 70 million ($1.7 million) in additional costs to maintain non-operating enterprises and a further of Hr 5.2 million ($128,000) in lost assets. This caused the company to fail to repay its overdue debts to the state budget and other creditors by the end of 2023.

Yet another loss was due to the late implementation of the decision of the Antimonopoly Committee of Ukraine (AMCU) by Ukrspyrt's former management: The company paid a Hr 33 million ($817,000) penalty.

The total amount of identified deficiencies and violations in the use of property and funds is over Hr 330 million ($8.2 million), SASU summarized.

SASU also notes that Ukrspyrt's failure to fulfill its obligations to the state budget and contractors (due to lack of working capital) would result in penalties of Hr 29.3 million ($725,650) and fines of Hr 8.4 million ($208,000) in case the courts decide in favour of the plaintiffs.

As we wrote in Issue 131, on May 6, Stanislav Banchuk was appointed as Ukrspyrt's new acting CEO.

On March 1, 2024, Vitaliy Koval, head of the State Property Fund of Ukraine (SPFU), wrote that privatization of distilleries was in the home stretch, with the Fund planning to privatize 17 more Ukrspyrt facilities in 2024.

According to Koval, the SPFU had run 115 online auctions of Ukrspyrt assets; 54 auctions resulted in sales. The sum of prices went from Hr 1.25 billion ($30.9 million) to Hr 3.01 billion ($74 million) during the auctions.

As we wrote in January 2022 Issue 63, acting CEO of Ukrspyrt Serhiy Bleskun resigned. After that, the Cabinet of Ministers temporarily assigned Vitaliy Zhadobin as the new acting CEO.

On Nov. 11, 2022, the Cabinet appointed Ivan Kucherenko as Ukrspyrt's new acting CEO.

Ukrspyrt last had a permanent CEO in 2014, and the company has since been led by various ""acting"" CEOs.

SPFU sets the terms and starting price for UMCC's privatization, next step is up to the Cabinet. On May 23, the SPFU auction commission determined the terms of privatization of United Mining and Chemical Company (UMCC). The starting price is Hr 3.9 billion ($96.6 million).

The buyer must preserve the core business, invest in modernization, and provide social guarantees for employees.

The SPFU said that it was preparing to submit a draft decision of the Cabinet of Ministers to approve the terms and starting price for the sale. After the Cabinet's approval, an auction on Prozorro.Sale would be announced.

Vitaliy Koval, head of the SPFU, said that seven different business groups that were interested in UMCC before the full-scale war have verbally confirmed their interest.

As we wrote in Issue 33 more than two years ago, the UMCC privatization auction was scheduled to take place on Aug. 31, 2021. Later, in SOE Weekly Issue 41, we reported that the SPFU cancelled that privatization auction, which had only one qualified bidder.

The media published a list of participants allegedly interested in UMCC assets. Some of them said that the asset was not well prepared for privatization, and they did not consider the auction terms fair. Others claimed that the starting price was inadequate. It was reportedly impossible to estimate the company's mineral deposits.

The SPFU's auction commission set Oct. 29, 2021 as the new auction date, but that auction was also cancelled (see Issue 49 for detail). So was the following auction on Dec. 20, 2021 (see Issue 57 for detail).

In Issue 105, we reported that the SPFU changed UMCC's executive board, dismissing first deputy CEO Yaroslava Maksymenko and replacing her with Yegor Perelygin.

As we reported in Issue 106, the SPFU planned for UMCC to be one of the first large companies to be privatized. The starting price would be determined with BDO Corporate Finance, the SPFU's advisor on the privatization of UMCC.

However, as we wrote in Issue 109, then acting head of the SPFU Oleksandr Fedoryshyn said later in October that the SPFU was going to offer investors to buy UMCC in a single package with Demurinsky Mining and Processing Plant.

Vitaliy Koval, the newly appointed head of the SPFU, confirmed this later in an interview (see our Issue 117).

In effect, this suggested that the SPFU's previously announced plans to privatize UMCC as one of the first targets would be seriously delayed, if not put aside.

However, the SPFU's most recent communication suggests that the Fund has discarded the idea of bundling UMCC and Demurinsky in a single lot.

See more on the previous attempts to sell UMCC in our Issues 33, 41, 49, 56, and 57.

Parliament prevents bankruptcy claims for Ukrnafta, Ukrtatnafta, Motor Sich, ZTR, and AvtoKrAZ to protect them from former owners. On May 22, the Verkhovna Rada amended the law on critical infrastructure (Draft Law No. 8316), approving a moratorium on bankruptcy of state-owned critical infrastructure objects during martial law plus two years.

According to one of the authors of the law, MP Oleksandr Fediyenko (Sluha Narodu faction), this will allow the seized Motor Sich, Ukrnafta, Ukrtatnafta, Zaporizhzhiatransformator (ZTR), and AvtoKrAZ to remain in state ownership.

According to Oleksandr Kuznetsov, managing partner of Armada law firm, the government is effectively depriving the creditors of these companies of the right to have their claims considered. ""They would not be able to file an application to secure a claim by seizing the debtor's property,"" he explained. The seizure of these companies should also be lifted, Kuznetsov told Forbes Ukraine.

According to Kuznetsov, to be protected by the law, a company must meet three criteria at once:

The regional gas companies seized from tycoon Dmytro Firtash's Regional Gas Company (RGC) Group also fit this description, Forbes Ukraine added.

As we reported in Issue 114, in 2023 Naftogaz completed taking over all Firtash gas companies.

As we wrote in Issue 113, the integration of regional gas companies establishes Naftogaz as a monopoly in gas distribution, but it is a wartime measure, and they should be privatized via public auctions when ""the situation allows this"", Naftogaz's CEO Oleksii Chernyshov said.

""It's a good law for debtors and a bad law for creditors,"" Vadym Kizlenko, an insolvency officer in the bankruptcy case of AvtoKrAZ, told Forbes Ukraine. The company entered bankruptcy proceedings in 2016 and owes a total of about Hr 5 billion (around $123 million at the going exchange rate) to its 39 creditors, Kizlenko said. According to YouControl, AvtoKrAZ's total debts as of the end of 2023 are estimated at Hr 12.3 billion (around $304 million). The company's revenue reached Hr 303.7 million (around $7.5 million) in 2023.

In addition to AvtoKrAZ, ZTR would also be granted the right to a ""new life without bankruptcy,"" Forbes Ukraine wrote. According to YouControl, in 2023 the company's revenue reached Hr 2.2 billion ($54 million), four times more than in 2022. ""To approve orders and contracts of companies that are already in bankruptcy, the Defense Ministry as the administrator must hold a meeting of creditors every time, and this can delay decisions important for the country's defence capability,"" Kizlenko suggested. ""Closing the bankruptcy case would effectively exclude creditors from this chain,"" he added.

According to Forbes Ukraine, another purpose of the moratorium is to protect these companies from their former owners. In May 2023, tycoon Kostiantyn Zhevago announced his plans to file a lawsuit with the Supreme Court over the seizure of AvtoKrAZ. There has been no news since and now he probably cannot proceed, Kuznetsov said. ""The former owners would not be able to challenge the nationalization procedure and protect their asset by imposing a ban on its alienation or any other actions that may affect the asset. A judicial remedy is meaningless,"" Kuznetsov also said.

The register of critical infrastructure referred to in the law is closed to the public. The State Service for Special Communications and Information Protection (SSSCIP) is in charge of its content and management, Forbes Ukraine also wrote.

""The ban on courts considering disputes over companies only because they belong to critical infrastructure contradicts the Constitution, according to which the state must protect all property,"" Kuznetsov concluded.

In SOE Weekly Issue 68, we reported that the shares of Ukrnafta, Ukrtatnafta, Motor Sich, AvtoKrAZ, and Zaporizhzhiatransformator (ZTR) were seized ""for the needs of the state"" and transferred to the Ministry of Defence on Nov. 6, 2022.

The seizures were made under the Law on the Transfer, Forced Alienation, or Seizure of Property under Martial Law or State of Emergency, which obligates the state to eventually return the seized assets to the owners or give them fair compensation. See Issue 68 for more detail.

Parliament adopted a draft law on vehicle insurance.

On May 21, the Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine's parliament, adopted draft law #8300 on mandatory civil liability insurance of land vehicle owners. The draft law is aimed to harmonize Ukrainian legislation with the provisions of Directive 2009/103/EU including the gradual increase of insurance sums to the level in the EU countries.

The draft law also suggests improving and fastening compensation mechanisms to injured persons and expanding the use of the ""European protocol"" which gives an opportunity to fill an application for insurance compensation without the involvement of the police.

The draft law also introduces direct settlement in all cases of road accidents in which damage is caused only to the vehicle, which will allow the injured person to apply for an insurance payment from his insurer, even if the culprit is not insured.

The Committee also agreed to add to the law a number of important amendments for the insurance industry in the near future.

Legal sales of tobacco goods started to increase in March and April, but not in all regions.

The amount of legal sales of tobacco goods reached Hr 8.85 billion ($219 million) in March and Hr 8.98 billion ($222 million) in April after the continued decrease since September 2023.

At the same time legal sales of tobacco goods continued to fall in several regions such as Zakarpattia, Lviv, Rivne, Khmelnytskyi and Cherkasy oblasts.

During March and April legal tobacco sales in these regions fell down more than a third from August 2023. This indicates the absence of any effective actions by law enforcement in countering the illegal tobacco market in above mentioned regions.

The government still hasn't decided on a candidate for the position of the dismissed infrastructure minister.

Last week some representatives of the presidential faction expected that the Verkhovna Rada would appoint a new Vice Prime Minister for the Reconstruction of Ukraine - Minister of Community Development, Territories and Infrastructure. Let me remind that the predecessor Oleksandr Kubrakov was dismissed at the beginning of May.

The most likely candidates for the position of the Minister of Community Development were said to be Oleksiy Chernyshov, CEO of Naftogaz, and Oleksiy Kuleba, Deputy Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine. However, the government and the Office of the President still haven't decided on a candidate and the position remain vacant.

Another one Ukrainian investment fund accused law enforcement of putting pressure on business.

Ukrainian investment company Dragon Capital owned Tomas Fiala reported that the Bureau of Economic Security puts pressure on its business. According to the official statement of the company, with the tax evasion case opened by the division in Kyiv, a parallel case was opened by the bureau's unit in Lviv which even interrogated the company's employees.

On the same day Dragon Capital made its public statement, the bureau announced that the case opened by the Lviv unit is prepared to be closed.

Gizo Uglava is suspended from the position of the first deputy director of the NABU following allegations of investigations leakage.

On May 24, the first deputy director of Ukraine's National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) Gizo Uglava was suspended following allegations of leakage of information regarding high profile investigations, including investigation related to embezzlement of funds during the president's ""Big Construction"" road construction project.

The official investigation into the leakage of information is conducted by the Specialized Anti-corruption Prosecutor's Office (SAPO) initiated by the whistleblower within the NABU. There was an attempt by the suspects in the case to accuse SAPO of presumed procedural violations and potential conflict with the NABU, however later they were refuted.

The Ukrainian energy firm caught between US presidential rivals,"The once little-known Ukrainian natural gas firm Burisma Holdings found itself thrust into the centre of a presidential impeachment storm earlier this year, over its ties to the son of former US vice-president Joe Biden.

The company's name surfaced repeatedly throughout investigations into President Donald Trump's conduct in office, amid allegations he attempted to coerce leaders in Ukraine into digging dirt on a potential rival in the upcoming US election.

Trump was ultimately acquitted of his impeachment charges, which comprised allegations of an abuse of power and the obstruction of Congress.

But with former vice-president Biden now battling Trump in the upcoming election, and a bitter campaign trail entering its final weeks, Burisma is once again in the spotlight.

Biden's son Hunter joined Burisma in 2014 as a board member -- around the same time his father was serving under President Obama -- holding the position for five years.

Trump argues for a conflict of interests -- and even alleges corruption -- between Hunter Biden's role at Burisma and his father's political activity in the country during the Obama administration.

Biden had been tasked by Obama with overseeing US political activities in Ukraine, primarily advocating for anti-corruption reforms in the country's energy industry.

In a now-infamous July 2019 phone call, Trump allegedly asked Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate both Bidens in return for political favours.

Critics called this an attempt to strongarm the country into discrediting a political opponent ahead of the 2020 election, with Biden considered by many at that time as the Democratic candidate most likely to challenge Trump.

Despite the impeachment acquittal, the discourse surrounding Trump, Biden and Burisma has not gone away - and amid all this furore, the energy company has skyrocketed into the public consciousness on both sides of the Atlantic.

Founded in 2002, Burisma Holdings is an oil and natural gas company owned by Ukrainian oligarch Mykola Zlochevsky.

He is a businessman who previously served in public office in the country, and one who has been the subject of fraud investigations -- although never convicted.

The business -- which is based in Kyiv (Kiev) but registered in Cyprus -- is a holding company for several subsidiaries in the energy industry, including Esko-Pivnich, Pari, Persha Ukrainska Naftogazova Kompaniya, Naftogaz Garant, KUB-Gas and Astroinvest Ukraine.

It is one of the largest natural gas operators in Ukraine, as well as having further interests in Germany, Mexico, Italy and Kazakhstan.

According to the company, it produced 1.3 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas in 2018, and while it does not disclose its financial results, estimates by news agency Reuters suggest this level of production could have generated revenues upwards of $400m.

In 2014, Hunter Biden -- who was at a loose end having been discharged from the US Navy for a positive cocaine drug test -- joined the board of Burisma, earning a reported monthly salary of $50,000.

At the time, Reuters cited a statement from Hunter Biden which appeared on the Burisma website, in which he said his role would be to help the company with ""transparency, corporate governance and responsibility, international expansion"" along with other issues.

His appointment raised a few eyebrows in political and industry circles, given his father's position as Obama's right-hand man, as well as Burisma's chequered history and accusations of fraud against its owner.

Burisma had previously been the subject of anti-corruption probes by domestic lawmakers, while its owner Zlochevsky had been investigated by the UK's Serious Fraud Office as part of a wider inquiry into claims of money laundering in the Ukraine -- although this ended in 2018 due to ""insufficient evidence"".

Many commentators have suggested Burisma's hiring of Hunter Biden -- along with other high-profile board members including former Polish president Aleksander Kwaśniewski and former CIA official Cofer Black -- were an attempt to deflect attention from corruption investigations and restore some reputational value to its name.

Corporate fraud in Ukraine had become a key issue for vice-president Biden towards the end of the Obama era, and he actively campaigned for reforms in the country -- singling out Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin in particular as an obstacle in the fight against corruption.

Pressure from Biden, alongside other international figureheads, eventually led to Shokin's dismissal in March 2016 for, among other things, his failure to adequately investigate Burisma over claims of money laundering and tax evasion between 2010 and 2012.

All these factors constellated in the July 2019 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, which became the focal point of the impeachment investigation and subsequent Senate trial.

A whistleblower complaint led US Democrats to launch their impeachment inquiry in September 2019, after it was alleged Trump pressured the Ukrainian leader to investigate both Joe and Hunter Biden to secure damaging information on them.

This was described during the impeachment hearings as a ""quid pro quo"" in return for the US providing a $400m military-aid package to support Ukraine in its conflict with neighbouring Russia.

It was argued that Trump was seeking to boost his chances against a political rival in the upcoming 2020 presidential elections -- something that it is illegal to solicit foreign entities to do.

President Trump has himself argued the Bidens had a nefarious influence and conflict of interests in Ukraine, particularly in regards to the removal of Shokin from office.

Since the impeachment trial was concluded in February, former vice president Biden has become the Democratic challenger to Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election - due to be held on 3 November.

It has been a bitterly contested campaign, defined largely by the two candidates' differing approaches to the coronavirus pandemic - which has killed more than 200,000 Americans - as well as race relations and climate change.

Yet Burisma continues to feature in political discussions.

The president has not abandoned his claim that the Bidens' exerted improper influence in Ukraine, while a months-long inquiry has been conducted by Senate Republicans seeking to prove illicit behaviour.

In an update to their investigation, published in September, Republican senators claimed ""Hunter Biden's position on Burisma's board cast a shadow over the work of those advancing anti-corruption reforms in Ukraine"".

The report - dramatically titled ""Hunter Biden, Burisma, and Corruption"" - has been criticised, however, for a lack of compelling new evidence to support allegations of wrongdoing against the former vice president.

Democrats have described the probe as a ""politically-motivated investigation"" designed to ""damage [Biden's] prospects as a challenger to President Trump"".

ST. PETERSBURG, May 24. /TASS/. The Arbitration Court of St. Petersburg and the Leningrad Region has upheld Gazprom Export's claim against the Czech Republic's CEZ banning it from continuing foreign arbitration proceedings, a TASS correspondent reported from the courtroom.

In case of violation of the ban, the court ruled to recover 57.7 mln euro from the Czech company in favor of Gazprom Export.

""The Arbitration Court of the city of St. Petersburg and the Leningrad Region determined: to prohibit the company CEZ a. s. from continuing proceedings at the International Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce <...>. In case CEZ a. s. fails to comply with the ruling of the court on this case <...> an award in favor of Gazprom Export LLC [in the amount of] 57,734,000 euros in rubles at the rate of the Bank of Russia will be paid by the company CEZ a. s.,"" the judge said.

Earlier, Gazprom Export demanded that CEZ be prohibited from continuing arbitration proceedings at the International Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce in Geneva, and that it be fined if CEZ failed to comply with the judicial act.

It was reported in February 2023 that the Czech energy company CEZ (70% of shares owned by the state) had initiated an arbitration worth $45 mln against Gazprom Export due to a gas shortfall in 2022.

Earlier Gazprom filed claims in the Russian court against German traders Uniper Global Commodities SE and Meta-Methanhandel GmbH, Austria's OMV Exploration & Production GmbH, Czech company NET4GAS, Naftogaz of Ukraine, the Dutch gas transport Gasunie Transport Service, the operator of the BBL gas pipeline between the UK and the Netherlands, Slovakia's ZSE Energia and the Polish-Russian company Europol GAZ, which owns the Polish section of the Yamal-Europe gas pipeline, demanding a ban on continuing arbitration proceedings in foreign courts. The Russian company won all its claims to ban the continuation of legal proceedings abroad.

May 24 (Interfax) - Ukrnafta has begun introducing new polymer flooding technology to enhance oil recovery at its fields, first testing it at a field in Ivano-Frankovsk region.

""Ukrnafta specialists have for the first time in the company's history used a modern technology in order to optimize the system to maintain formation pressure. The result was an almost 17% increase in the oil flow rate at the trial site at one of the company's western fields,""

Ukrainian media reported, citing the company's statement.

Specifically, the company said it used flow deviation technology with cross-linked polymer systems, meaning it injected a ""polymer compound into the injection well in order to block flushed zones from injection to production wells and draw in previously unswept areas of the deposit.""

The company pumped 130 cubic meters of polymer compound into the injection well. Its specialists monitored the well for two months and noted a decrease in the water cut and increase in flow rate.

""There are plans to introduce this technology at the fields of all Ukrnafta divisions in order to increase oil production. Sites have already been selected and reagents have been purchased,"" the company said.

Ukrnafta increased production of oil with condensate by 3% to 1.41 million tonnes in 2023 and gas production 5.8% to 1.097 billion cubic meters. The company's strategic goal is to double oil and natural gas production by 2027, to 3 million tonnes and 2 billion cubic meters, respectively.

One of the more-talked-about stories in Ukrainian business this past week was a seemingly odd government decision to exempt some workers at a few big-name companies from conscription.

What went down? Last month, the Economy Ministry decided a group of companies, which included the popular online gambling site Favbet, food delivery app Glovo, and Visa, could set aside a number of employees who they feel are too valuable to lose to mobilization.

The government allows some companies to ""reserve"" certain employees to ensure companies can stay up and running, and continue paying taxes to a starving state budget.

The public reaction was fierce: How could the government excuse people from military service from companies that aren't essential, people wondered. The public was quick to point out that only one company on the list had anything to do with the military.

Digital Transformation Minister Mykhailo Fedorov had his own reply: The 54 people the companies requested exemptions for ""weren't couriers or gamers, but top-level IT specialists, engineers, and developers.""

The minister reminded everyone in a post on Facebook how ""essential"" IT workers are to Ukraine's economy: The sector contributes nearly 5% of the country's GDP and last year paid Hr 20.8 billion ($522 million) in taxes to the state budget, up Hr 3.1 billion ($77.8 million) from last year.

""One IT specialist working creates and maintains almost three jobs in the economy,"" he wrote, adding that while more than 300,000 employees work in the sector, only 1.5% are exempt from military service.

After canceling the exemption, the Economy Ministry said it would ""analyze the decision regarding each company separately.""

Russian drones and missiles aren't enough to deter some foreigners from opening businesses in Ukraine -- foreigners have opened 2,652 companies here since February 2022, according to Opendatabot, a Ukrainian analytics service.

Turkish businesspeople made up the largest share of foreign businesses that have opened up since 2022, registering 354 new businesses. Uzbek citizens opened up 274 businesses, while Poles opened up 193.

The U.S., Kazakhstan, Germany, Azerbaijan, Israel, and the U.K. also ranked high.

The biggest players? At the top of the list was an Armenian-owned company called TENS1MA with a charter capital of Hr 1.28 billion ($32.5 million). The company, registered in Odesa, is involved in construction.

In second place was the Yugen investment fund, owned by American billionaire and philanthropist Dell Loy Hansen with a charter capital of $18 million.

Hansen's Wasatch Group announced last year plans to build 600 modular homes for internally displaced people in Ukraine. Yugen Invest is currently developing luxury cottages in Ukraine's western Carpathian mountains.

In third place is a Polish-owned company registered under the name LFS in Lviv with a charter capital of Hr 300 million ($7.6 million) that is involved in food and tobacco product wholesale.

As Russian troops push into Kharkiv Oblast, attacks on the city of Kharkiv are daily and constant. The city's energy generation is practically destroyed with generators picking up the slack.

The survival of Kharkiv's businesses is of great concern. As Ukraine's second-largest city, it makes up 3% of the country's GDP. The city and its region's industries include heavy industry, machine building, agriculture, IT, and publishing.

How is business in the city? Surprisingly perhaps, the biggest issue facing businesses in Kharkiv isn't Russian attacks or power outages, but mobilization and local bureaucracy, according to business representatives who spoke at an event on business in Kharkiv held by the Kyiv-based Center for Economic Strategy last week.

Companies are hard-pressed to find people who want to work officially, as people look to avoid being seen by the state, and thus avoid conscription, Ihor Humennyi, president of the business holding UBC Group said at the event.

And with only highly skilled (and higher paid) employees being eligible for conscription exemption, companies are worried about retention.

And then there's the issue that companies can't send their male employees abroad as men of conscription age can't leave the country. This puts particular strain on IT companies in Kharkiv, whose clients are 95% located abroad.

""We cannot sign contracts if the client does not see us,"" Olha Shapoval, executive director of Kharkiv IT Cluster, said.

Despite it all, the city's businesses keep going. Last year, the Kharkiv-based Ranok Publishing House printed 4.2 million books, 150,000 of which were exported. It also signed a contract with Disney to publish Star Wars books in Ukraine, its director said at the event.

All the way on the other side of the country from Kharkiv -- 1,087 kilometers to be exact -- is the western city of Lviv, that held a tourism summit last week to promote the city.

Tourism to a war-torn country? Rumors have swirled that the city's airport will be the first to open since the start of the full-scale invasion. Lviv Oblast Governor Maksym Kozytskyi made the case for his airport to be the pick of the litter.

""It is important for us to open the airport. At every international meeting, we emphasize that the opening of the airport means, on the one hand, that the sky over Ukraine would have to be closed. On the other hand, it is a huge opportunity for an international investor, a foreign tourist to see Ukraine,"" he said during the summit.

Naturally, hotel owners in the nearby Carpathian mountains agree, saying that reopening the airport will revive the tourism industry, the Lviv outlet Vysoky Zamok reported.

On the sidelines of the summit, Kozytskyi met with the American investment company Chicago Atlantic Trident, who is considering investing in building affordable housing in the Lviv region.

The real estate business in Lviv Oblast isn't a bad choice. The region has accepted the largest number of internally displaced people, having added somewhere between 240,000-350,000 people since the start of the full-scale invasion. That's a lot of demand.

Rents in the region are rising, and are now the highest in the country, according to the State Statistics Service. Lviv Oblast topped recent ratings with an average rental price of a one-bedroom apartment Hr 11,914 ($299) in April 2024, a 1.1% increase from December 2023.

Every year on the third Thursday of May, Ukrainians celebrate Vyshyvanka Day. Our office celebrated it last week (see the picture above -- I'm the first one from the right in the front row).

If you aren't familiar with a vyshyvanka, it's the Ukrainian word for an embroidered shirt or dress - a central piece to traditional Ukrainian clothing. They're centuries old, but have made a comeback.

In fact, the number of offers on Ukraine's popular online marketplace OLX selling vyshyvankas has increased 28 times since 2020, according to OLX data requested by Liga.net. In 2022, responses to offers on OLX hit 70,000, double the year before. In 2023, responses hit 230,000.

Why are they becoming so popular? As the saying goes, no one did more to consolidate the Ukrainian identity than Russian President Vladimir Putin. The war has led to a cultural revival of sorts as Ukrainians look for a way to distance themselves from Russia.

Many of us in the photo are wearing vyshyvankas from the incredibly popular brand Etnodim that has a special knack for making the medieval modern. Guess what? They have international shipping. Check them out here.

Ukraine harvested 80 million tons of grain and seed oil products last year and exported agricultural goods worth $22 billion, Deputy Agriculture Minister Taras Vysotskyi announced on May 16. According to Vysotskyi, 87% of all agricultural products are being exported from Odesa and adjacent ports.

Officials from the EU and Ukraine are pushing to begin formal accession negotiations as early as June 25, Politico reported on May 21, citing its undisclosed sources. According to the news outlet, intense diplomacy is being undertaken aimed at convincing the Hungarian government to drop its objections to Kyiv's membership in the bloc.

The EU Council agreed to use profits from the frozen Russian sovereign assets to aid Ukraine, the Czech representation in the EU announced on May 21. According to the statement, the proceedings could amount to between 2.5 billion and 3 billion euros ($2.7-3.26 billion) annually, with most of it allocated to Kyiv's military needs.

In the first quarter of 2024, Ukrainian banks earned Hr 40.5 billion ($1 billion), according to the data analytics service Opendatabot. Despite an increase in taxes, this is 19% more than in the same period last year. At the end of last year, the government passed a law taxing banks at a rate of 50% for excess profits in 2023. In 2024, the basic income tax for banks was raised to 25% from 18%.

Businessman Vitaliy Kropachov is the owner of the Ukrdoninvest Group of companies with assets in the coal industry, machine-building, construction, transportation, and media. The businessman is suspected of fraud in the coal sector, Ekonomichna Pravda reported, citing unnamed law enforcement sources.

Vodafone Ukraine's revenue in the first quarter of 2024 increases by 13% to Hr 5.76 billion ($144.6 million). The growth was mainly due to an increase in the use of data services and number of users in both mobile and fixed communications, the company, Ukraine's second largest mobile operator,said in a press release.

Naftogaz has launched seven new gas wells since the start of 2024. Last year, the company, Ukraine's gas and oil giant, launched 86 new wells, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said on May 17. The goal for 2024 for Naftogaz is to reach production of about 15 billion cubic meters of gas this year, he said.

May 22 (Interfax) - PJSC Ukrnafta has installed 29 electric submersible pumps supplied by Germany's Oil Dynamics in wells, Ukrainian media reported, citing a company press release.

""Electric submersible pumps help stabilize production at fields: they ensure nominal productivity and pressure and, compared to other types of well pumps, increase the turnaround interval,"" said Ukrnafta chief Sergei Koretsky.

The company said new equipment to API standards would be installed in more than 150 wells by the end of 2024, including facilities already equipped.

Ukrainian frequency control stations operate in tandem with German pumps. Software has been adapted to ensure compatibility.

Ukrnafta said operators and engineers were controlling the equipment remotely, using special operating modes and changing operating frequency. They use an automated remote well monitoring system to monitor all the necessary parameters: pressure, temperature, electric motor load ratio, current, insulation resistance and submersible equipment vibration.

Ukrnafta signed a memorandum with the American Petroleum Institute in 2023 on the implementation of new international standards in the company's work. Replacing outdated equipment with modern international standards is part of the company's renewal strategy.

Ukrnafta increased production of oil with condensate by 39,900 tonnes or 3% to 1,409,900 tonnes in 2023. Production of natural and associated petroleum gas increased by 60.4 mcm or 5.8% to 1.097 billion cubic meters.

Ukrnafta has the strategic goal of doubling oil and natural gas production by 2027, to 3 million tonnes and 2 billion cubic meters, respectively.

Ukrnafta is Ukraine's biggest oil producer. It has a national network of 537 filling stations, of which 456 are operating. The biggest shareholder is Naftogaz with 50% plus one share.

ST. PETERSBURG, May 22. /TASS/. The Arbitration Court of St. Petersburg and the Leningrad Region upheld Gazprom Export's claim against Austria's OMV Gas Marketing & Trading GmbH banning it from continuing foreign arbitration proceedings, a TASS correspondent reported from the courtroom.

The court ruled that the Austrian company will have to pay Gazprom Export if it violates the ban.

""The Arbitration Court of the city of St. Petersburg and the Leningrad Region determined: to prohibit the company OMF Gas Marketing and Trading GmbH from continuing arbitration proceedings at the Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce <...>.

Earlier, Gazprom Export demanded that OMV Gas Marketing & Trading GmbH be prohibited from continuing arbitration proceedings at the Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce and that it be fined if it failed to comply with the judicial act.

Gazprom Export's lawyer insisted in court that because of sanctions, the company can not get proper legal representation and justice abroad. In particular, a number of EU law firms refused to work with Russian companies, and an agreement on streamlining the issuance of visas was also canceled. Nevertheless, the OMV representative claimed that no personal sanctions had been imposed against Gazprom Export, and the Austrian company proposed - within the same arbitration court - to transfer the hearings to other jurisdictions (including Dubai or Istanbul), but did not receive any response.

OMV Gas Marketing & Trading GmbH is a subsidiary of Austria's OMV AG. In June 2018, an agreement was signed to extend the existing contract between Gazprom Export LLC and OMV Gas Marketing & Trading GmbH to supply Russian natural gas to Austria until 2040. Previously, the contract was signed through 2028.

Earlier Gazprom filed claims in the Russian court against German traders Uniper Global Commodities SE and Meta-Methanhandel GmbH, Austria's OMV Exploration & Production GmbH, Czech company NET4GAS, Naftogaz of Ukraine, the Dutch gas transport Gasunie Transport Service, the operator of the BBL gas pipeline between the UK and the Netherlands, Slovakia's ZSE Energia and the Polish-Russian company Europol GAZ, which owns the Polish section of the Yamal-Europe gas pipeline, demanding a ban on continuing arbitration proceedings in foreign courts.

Parliament reverses SOE corporate governance law to have Ukrnafta pay dividends directly to the state budget, SOE Weekly's team member Oleksandr Lysenko told Ekonomichna Pravda (EP).

Parliament made this change while adopting a law on the export of certain goods (Draft Law No. 10168-2), which has nothing to do with either SOEs or corporate governance. However, among other things, it changed the recently adopted key law on SOEs (Draft Law No. 5593-d). See SOE Weekly's Issues 120 and 122 for more detail on this law.

The amendment was proposed by MP Danylo Hetmantsev (Sluha Narodu faction), Chair of the Finance, Taxation and Customs Policy Committee. Is says that companies that (a) have been seized or confiscated by the state under martial law [in particular, Ukrnafta - see Issue 68 for more detail], and (b) in which the shareholder is a business entity with a state share of 50% or more (Naftogaz own 50% + 1 share in Ukrnafta), will pay dividends directly to the treasury.

""In other words, Naftogaz ... would no longer be entitled to receive dividends as a shareholder ... and Ukrnafta would have to pay dividends directly to the state budget (as it was before the adoption of the law on SOE corporate governance),"" Lysenko said.

He called this a reversal of corporate governance reform. The introduction of consolidated dividend payments was an important achievement, requested by the OECD.

""The adoption of Draft Law No. 5593-d in accordance with OECD Guidelines was a condition for receiving such important funding from our (international) partners, including the IMF. And now it turns out that we promised to pass a good law, but we did not promise not to change it later,"" he added.

This is not the first time the state tried to introduce this rule. For example, as we reported in Issue 106, the state wanted to take away Naftogaz's right to decide on its subsidiaries' dividends in the draft law on the 2024 state budget.

Practices consistent with the OECD Guidelines on Corporate Governance of SOEs imply that dividends are consolidated at the level of the mother company. In contrast, a practice when SOE subsidiaries pay dividends directly to the state budget breaches the OECD's level playing field principle for SOEs and private companies.

As we reported in Issue 121, Ukrnafta is to pay the state a total of Hr 8 billion ($200.9 million at the average exchange rate in 2023) in dividends for 2023. Ukrnafta's audited financial statements for 2022 or 2023 were not available at the time of writing.

As we wrote in Issue 126, Ukrnafta earned almost Hr 24 billion ($602.7 million) in net profit in 2023.

Ukrainian banks post combined profits of Hr 40 billion ($1 billion) in Q1 2024; state-owned banks earn 60% of the total, Opendatabot reported. The data provider also said that the top 10 banks on the market account for 84% of the total profits - Hr 34.2 billion ($858 million) at the average exchange rate over the respective period).

The six state-owned banks made 60% of Ukrainian banks' total profits. Five of the six state-owned banks are among Ukraine's top 10 banks.

As we reported earlier, Sense Bank, previously owned by sanctioned Russian oligarchs Mikhail Fridman, Petr Aven, and Andrey Kosogov, was nationalized in late July 2023. See more in our Issue 98.

Only PINbank, recently transferred under state control, lost Hr 7.6 million ($190,000).

As we reported earlier, PINbank, previously owned by Russian oligarch Yevgenii Giner, was transferred under the control of the State Property Fund of Ukraine (SPFU). See more in our Issue 116.

Centrenergo continues to clear the rubble after Russian missile attacks on Zmiivska and Trypilska TPPs. On May 14, Yevhenii Harkavyi, Centrenergo's technical director, reported that Zmiivska and Trypilska Thermal Power Plants (TPPs) were still clearing debris after the March 22 and April 11 missile strikes. This should take at least another month or two.

""The amount of rubble is really massive. This is hundreds, even thousands of tonnes of concrete that needs to be removed, and the surviving equipment needs to be preserved as much as possible,"" he added.

According to Centrenergo, these attacks resulted in the destruction of expensive equipment and significant damage and fires.

""The most expensive are generators (almost Hr 500 million, or $12.6 million), transformers (about Hr 200 million, or $5 million), and turbines,"" Harkavyi said.

He stressed that Centrenergo's main activity has been suspended. ""As of today, 100% of the generation capacity of our power plants has been destroyed. We are without electricity and heat production, and our satellite cities are without hot water,"" Harkavyi also said.

As we wrote in Issue 127, on April 11, Centrenergo reported that the Trypilska TPP in Kyiv Oblast was completely destroyed by a large-scale Russian missile attack.

The TPP provided electricity to almost 3 million people and was the largest electricity supplier in Kyiv, Zhytomyr, and Cherkasy oblasts.

Centrenergo had three TPPs, which were essentially all the company's assets: Trypilska in Kyiv Oblast, Zmiivska in Kharkiv Oblast, and Vuhlehirska in Donetsk Oblast.

On March 22, Zmiivska TPP was completely destroyed. On July 25, 2022, Russian troops occupied Vuhlehirska TPP. Thus, Centrenergo lost 100 per cent of its generation. See Issue 127 for more detail.

Naftogaz Group pays Hr 28.3 billion ($710.7 million) in taxes for January-April 2024, the company's press office reported on May 15. The state budget got Hr 26.2 billion ($657 million at the average exchange rate over the respective period), and local budgets got Hr 2.1 billion ($52.7 million).

Naftogaz's contributions for January-April 2024 make up 11.5% of Ukraine's total tax revenues in that period, the company added.

As we reported in Issue 115, Naftogaz Group paid Hr 83.4 billion ($2.1 billion) in taxes to the state budget and another Hr 6.8 billion ($170.7 million) to local budgets in 2023.

As we wrote in Issue 131, Naftogaz Group reported that it made Hr 23.1 billion ($580.1 million) in consolidated net profit in 2023, a significant rebound from its Hr 79.1 billion ($2 billion) loss in 2022.

Ukrenergo begins rolling emergency power outages for households and industry in all regions. On May 14, Ukrenergo announced controlled emergency power outages for industrial and household consumers in all regions of Ukraine during evening peak hours. The power supply to critical infrastructure facilities was not restricted, the company said.

The reason for these outages was a significant shortage of electricity in the system due to Russians blowing up power plants and increased consumption due to the cold snap, Ukrenergo explained.

In the following days, Ukrenergo introduced hourly outage schedules for industry and households.

According to Ukrenergo's CEO Volodymyr Kudrytskyi, warmer weather should allow Ukraine to avoid outages, unless Russia takes out any more energy assets. In the summer, the use of air conditioners during scheduled repairs might again lead to a critical power drop.

As we reported earlier, Ukraine faced five massive missile and drone strikes on energy facilities since 22 March 2024. See Issues 124, 125, 127, 129, and 131 for more detail.

After every Russian mass missile attack on Ukraine's vital infrastructure, emergency outages take place, lasting for days due to the ongoing repair works. During such outages, people in Ukraine are often left without electricity, heating, water supply, or access to mobile phone networks.

Coal businessman Kropachov detained for alleged fraud and damages of Hr 2 billion ($50.2 million). The State Bureau of Investigation (DBR) and the National Police detained Vitaliy Kropachov, the de facto owner of Krasnolymanske LLC (part of his Ukrdoninvest Group), Ekonomichna Pravda (EP) wrote.

Officials of the Energy Ministry and the State Tax Service were allegedly involved, according to EP's sources.

Later, the DBR confirmed that Kropachov was detained. According to DBR, he took over the assets of Oleksandr Yanukovych, the son of the deposed fugitive president Viktor Yanukovych. Kropachov gained control over many state-owned coal mines and processing plants in eastern Ukraine.

Kropachov allegedly worked with the CEO and accountant of Krasnolymanske LLC to prevent the state-owned Krasnolymanska Coal Mining Company from operating and drove it into bankruptcy.

The state-owned mine is dependent on Krasnolymanske LLC, as it is unable to extract coal from its own seams, which are located lower than the seams mined by Kropachov's company.

According to DBR, the investigation documented four instances of illegal activity:

Employees of Krasnolymanske LLC also illegally acquired property with this money on Kropachov's instructions in 2022-2023, the DBR said.

Besides Kropachov, his financial manager, and the CEO and chief accountant of Krasnolymanske LLC, were also notified of the suspicion. The DBR is seeking detention without bail.

Vitaliy Kropachov is the owner of the Ukrdoninvest Group of companies with assets in the coal industry, machine-building, construction, transportation, and media. In particular, in 2022, he acquired Corona Sunrise LLC, which owned a digital licence for Channel 4. In 2023, he launched the Ukraine World News TV channel.

In 2016, EP wrote that Kropachov was a ""lookout"" in the coal industry for Ihor Kononenko, former first deputy head of the parliament's BPP faction and business partner of Ukraine's fifth President, Petro Poroshenko. Kropachov later denied this.

According to EP, Kropachov bought several enrichment plants in the government-controlled part of Donbas, and in 2017 acquired the Krasnolymanska coal mine, which eventually became one of the most successful coal enterprises in Ukraine.

In 2018, Kropachov's Ukrdoninvest took part in the privatization auction for Centrenergo, but the State Property Fund of Ukraine (SPFU) later cancelled the auction because the documentation submitted by the bidders did not meet the legal requirements.

At that time, the SPFU intended to sell the state-owned stake in Centrenergo (78.3%) at an auction with a starting price of Hr 5.9 billion (€181 million at the exchange rate at that time). Kropachov did not say what stake he already had in Centrenergo, revealing only that it was more than 1%.

In 2018, EP wrote that Kropachov had monopolized the supply of coal to Centrenergo. According to EP, more than 80% of the coal supplied to Centrenergo was provided by entities directly or indirectly linked to the businessman.

As we reported in April 2023 (Issues 84 and 85), Kropachov's Ukrdoninvest, the winner of the Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi trade port privatization auction, said that it backed out of the sale at the stage of hashing out the terms of the sale and purchase agreement with the SPFU regional office in Odesa and Mykolaiv Oblasts.

The first privatization auction for Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi trade seaport failed as no one registered, but a second auction was held with a winning bid of Hr 220 million (€5.7 million at that time) by Ukrdoninvest LLC. However, the winner missed the payment deadline. See Issue 85 for more detail.

MOSCOW, May 18. /TASS/. The volume of Russian gas supplies to Europe through Ukraine is 42.4 mln cubic meters per day, a Gazprom spokesman told reporters.

""Gazprom continues to supply Russian gas for transit through Ukrainian territory via the Sudzha gas pumping station in an amount approved by Ukraine. The volume is 42.4 mln cubic meters for May 18. A request for transit via the Sokhranovka gas pumping station was rejected,"" he said.

The volume also stood at 42.4 mln cubic meters on May 17.

The transit line through Ukraine remains the only route for Russian gas supplies to western and central European countries. Pumping through the Nord Stream pipeline was completely suspended. Gas supplies via Turkish Stream and Blue Stream are intended for Turkey and southern and southeastern European countries.

In May 2022, the Gas Transmission System Operator of Ukraine said it would suspend the flow of gas to Europe via the Sokhranovka transit point due to force majeure as the company allegedly was unable to control the Novopskov gas compressor station in the Lugansk People's Republic. However, the Russian gas giant did not see any proof of force majeure.

In the fall of 2022, Ukraine's Naftogaz company filed a petition for arbitration with the International Arbitration Court against Gazprom for allegedly being late with its payment for gas transportation services through Ukraine. Gazprom CEO Alexey Miller stated that the Russian company considered Naftogaz's arbitration to be illegitimate. Meanwhile, Russia may impose sanctions against Naftogaz in the event of further unfair actions by the Ukrainian company and any relations with Naftogaz will be impossible.",tass.com,news,TASS,,-0.0117647058823529,453722928,26,https://tass.com/img/blocks/common/tass_logo_share_ru.png,

In late April, students at universities across the United States set up tent encampments and occupied buildings, protesting their campuses' complicity in the Israeli war in Gaza.

The chant ""from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free"" could be heard along with calls for divestment from weapons suppliers and companies that supported Israel.

While these protests were laudable, wouldn't it have been nice if protesters had extended their critique of U.S. foreign policy to include Ukraine?

Particularly as the Biden White House has extended massive new military aid packages to Ukraine that include long range weapons designed to strike into Russia.

Two new books published by Clarity Press show the role that the U.S. played in engineering the Ukraine conflict -- whose death toll eclipses Gaza -- along with a proliferation of corruption in Ukraine that has been fueled in large part by Joe Biden and the Democratic Party.

The first book, by Glenn Diesen, a professor at the University of South-Eastern Norway, is titled The Ukraine War & the Eurasian World Order; the second, by CovertAction Magazine writer Arnaud Develay, a lawyer who previously worked for former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark, is called Foreign Entanglements: Ukraine, Biden & the Fractured American Political Consensus.

Diesen's book argues that Ukraine is the graveyard for the post-Cold War neo-conservative dream of establishing American unipolar power.

In his 1997 book, The Grand Chessboard, a bible for neo-conservatives, the late Zbigniew Brzezinski, Jimmy Carter's former National Security Adviser, argued that, ""without Ukraine, Russia ceases to be a Eurasian empire,"" although ""if Moscow regains control over Ukraine with its 52 million people and major resources as well as its access to the Black Sea, Russia automatically regains the wherewithal to become a powerful imperial state, spanning Europe and Asia.""

Brzezinski's book laid out the agenda of the neo-conservatives in trying to decouple Ukraine from Russia and integrate it with the West.

To help advance this strategy, the George W. Bush administration supported a 2004 color revolution that brought to power pro-Western leader Viktor Yushchenko who pursued North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) membership against the will of the vast majority of Ukrainians and ended his term with a 2.7% approval rating.

When Russia-friendly Viktor Yanukovych won 2010 elections and sought to strengthen Ukraine's economy by keeping Ukraine's access to the Russian market, the Obama administration backed the February 2014 Maidan coup.

The coup resulted in the replacement of Yanukovych with a regime that compromised Ukraine's economic and political sovereignty, terrorized the political opposition, and deliberately provoked a war with Russia as Ukraine was turned into a de facto CIA base whose ports were upgraded to fit U.S. warships.

Diesen emphasizes that the U.S. calculatingly sabotaged the Minsk peace agreements, which provided a way to resolve the conflict between western and eastern Ukraine that resulted from the 2014 coup. The Minsk agreement allowed for autonomy for the eastern section and called for an end to discriminatory policies by Kyiv, including its efforts to bar use of the Russian language in the Donbass.

Unfortunately, the agreement was never taken seriously by Germany, France and the U.S., which saw it merely as an opportunity to buy time to further militarize Ukraine so it could be used as a battering ram against Russia.

Debunking the myth of an unprovoked Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Diesen shows that the U.S. purposely drew Russia into the war in eastern Ukraine by a) escalating the anti-terrorist operation targeting eastern Ukrainians, which left 14,000 dead between 2014 and 2022; and b) openly advocating for NATO expansion into Ukraine, which even CIA Director William Burns admitted was a red line for Russia.

Inspired by Brzezinski, the U.S. strategy was modeled after Afghanistan in the 1980s where the U.S. would draw the Soviet Union into a drawn-out quagmire that would deplete its military capability and ruin its economy as a result of the ratcheting up of sanctions.

Then the U.S. could advance regime-change efforts and ensure its own dominance of the Central Asian region -- which Brzezinski and his acolytes viewed as key to world domination.

The destruction of the Nord Stream II pipeline was further part of a strategy of severing Russia's economy from Western Europe and trying to destroy its oil and gas industry.

Diesen shows that U.S. neo-conservatives and their British counterparts repeatedly spurned any peace proposals and supported far-right factions in Ukraine who had threatened President Volodymyr Zelensky if he made any peace overtures toward the Russians. The only countries trying to broker peace were Israel, Turkey and China.

The U.S. and UK sent Ukraine depleted uranium and cluster munitions that were deployed against the civilian population of eastern Ukraine, as well as long range missiles that could be used to attack deep inside Russia -- leaving the world on the threshold of World War III.

The tragedy of it all is that Russia and Ukraine have similar cultural ancestry in Kievan Rus and had co-existed for centuries without fighting each other. Moscow's leadership had been accepted historically after it had led the regional defeat and expulsion of the Mongols in the late 15 century under Ivan the Great.

The neo-conservative gamble, according to Diesen, is headed toward failure as Russia succeeded in regaining its Black Sea naval base in Sevastopol, has reclaimed Ukrainian territory, and adapted to sanctions by reorienting Russia's economy to the East and strengthening the Eurasian Union.

The new Russia-China alliance is part of a new world power bloc that has upended 500 years of Western domination. Diesen quotes former Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki who said: ""If we lose Ukraine, we will lose the world for decades. The defeat in Ukraine could be the beginning of the end of the golden age of the West."" This indeed looks to be the case.

Develay's book, Foreign Entanglements, shows how Ukraine-which UK Prime Minister Boris Johnon's top adviser recently called ""a corrupt mafia state""-was at the center of the Biden family and Democratic Party corruption in the age of Russia Gate.

Develay starts his book by detailing incriminating tapes assembled by a Ukrainian member of Parliament named Andrii Derkach, which detailed high-level Ukrainian government corruption -- including a scheme to embezzle $142 million in technical assistance through a charitable organization helping people living with HIV-AIDS -- and the external management of Ukraine by U.S. government officials.

The external management was evident when Vice President Joe Biden blackmailed Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko by threatening to withhold a $1 billion International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan if he did not fire prosecutor Viktor Shokin.

Shokin was prosecuting Burisma, an oil and gas company that appointed Hunter Biden to its board and that, according to Derkach, transferred $16.5 million in funds to offshore shell companies owned by Hunter.

Derkach's tapes exposed how one of Biden's most trusted advisers, Amos Hochstein, a special envoy for international energy issues at the U.S. State Department, set up a gas-reserve scheme using a Ukrainian state-owned provider company, Naftogaz, in order to ""rebrand"" Russian gas into more expensive European gas and sell it to Ukrainian consumers.

Derkach calculated that Ukraine overpaid almost $1.5 billion for so-called European gas over five years, with Poroshenko increasing gas prices for the Ukrainian population by 75%.

Additionally, Derkach provided lists of Ukraine's members of parliament, members of the Cabinet, employees of the Office of the President and individuals sitting on the state-owned companies' supervisory boards who were in the pay of Open Society founder George Soros, a billionaire financier of color revolutions in Eastern Europe who shared the neo-conservative dream of using Ukraine as a tool to weaken Russia.

The tapes further revealed conversations between Biden and Poroshenko in which Poroshenko riles Biden over the fact that his faction in Ukrainian politics [the Samopomich faction] was losing its edge; indicating that key elements in the Ukrainian government were subservient to the U.S. Vice President in a blatant example of neo-colonialism.

In order to try to neutralize Derkach, the U.S. a) revoked his U.S. visa; b) had his television show put off the air; c) accused him of being a Russian spy; d) encouraged his prosecution on money-laundering charges; and e) applied sanctions to him.

Turning its head on the Russia Gate narrative, Foreign Entanglements argues that it was Ukraine -- not Russia -- that interfered in U.S. politics, including by engineering a fake scandal that brought down Paul Manafort, one of Trump's closest advisers, in order to make Trump look bad.

The case against Manafort centered on the delivery by a former Ukrainian intelligence agent official of a ""notebook"" that supposedly pointed to payoffs dished out in exchange for favors rendered to Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych's Party of Regions.

According to Develay ""the 'evidence' leveled against Manafort which led to his downfall never had any legal basis.""

Neither, says Develay, was there any legal basis for the impeachment hearing targeting Donald Trump who was accused of trying to blackmail Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in an attempt to get him to investigate Joe and Hunter Biden.

Develay makes clear that an investigation of the Bidens was absolutely warranted.

The Burisma affair epitomized how Biden basically ruled Ukraine like a viceroy, helping to oversee the imposition of a surrogate government after the 2014 Maidan coup that advanced U.S. business interests, including in the oil and gas sector.

At Biden's urging, Arseniy Yatsenyuk, the leader handpicked by the U.S. to run Ukraine, began zealously removing Russian gas lines from Ukraine while promoting the interests of Burisma, which dramatically increased its portfolio of licenses to develop new gas fields in Ukraine after the 2014 coup.

Petro Poroshenko also pushed through parliament the laws necessary to ensure a precipitous drop in Russian gas deliveries in favor of supplies from the European Union (EU).

The new post-coup finance minister, Natalie Jaresko, had worked for many years for the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and U.S. State Department and U.S. embassy in Ukraine. Born in Illinois, she received Ukrainian citizenship the day she was appointed Finance Minister.

Viktor Shokin complained that ""the most shocking thing is that all the [government] appointments were [being] made in agreement with the United States. Washington's behavior indicated that they believed that 'Ukraine was their fiefdom.'""

Through their control of the Supervisory Board of Ukraine's railway company, ""Ukrzaliznytsia"" and other national companies, Americans ""managed to create a system of shadow management of Ukraine's public sector,"" according to Develay.

Americans also, according to Develay, established a network of bio-weapons labs -- something Victoria Nuland, Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs between 2021 and 2024, admitted to before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in 2022.

These labs produced deadly bacteria and toxins that resulted in disease outbreaks within Ukraine, including of cholera.

One of the companies involved, EcoHealth Alliance, is a CIA front organization accused by whistleblower Andrew Huff of being behind the manufacture of COVID-19.

Black & Veatch, a global company receiving Pentagon contracts to operate the biolabs, received substantial funding from Rosemont Seneca, Hunter Biden's investment fund.

This points to the sinister profiteering of the president's son off of Frankenstinian initiatives that may have resulted in a global pandemic.

Ukraine is ultimately a black hole in American politics that has been heralded by today's Democratic Party as a heroic country deserving of massive U.S. investment and weapons supplies. After Congress recently voted to appropriate $60 billion in additional military aid, many congressmen and women waved Ukrainian flags.

The real Ukraine, as Develay and Diesen's books show, is a corrupt playland for American imperialists who have used the country as a pawn in a great game that they are losing.

In a statement, AGPU said the number of operational rigs in Q1 was well up on the pre-war average of 30 and also higher compared with Q1 2023 when 37 rigs were operating.

Ukraine has made it a priority in 2024 to further increase domestic gas production to eliminate the need for costly European imports.

AGPU executive director Artem Petrenko said the increase in drilling activity demonstrated the sector's efforts to maximize gas output despite the Russian invasion.

""State and private companies are doing everything possible to provide Ukraine with its own gas,"" Petrenko said.

AGPU, citing Baker Hughes statistics, said that in Europe as a whole there were 118 rigs in operation, meaning 40% of the total were located in Ukraine.

Total Ukrainian gas production rose to 18.7 Bcm in 2023, up from 18.5 Bcm in 2022, with UkrGazVydobuvannya, the upstream arm of Ukraine's state-owned Naftogaz, leading efforts to raise domestic output.

UGV increased gas production further in the first quarter of 2024, with output up by 12% compared with the same period last year.

Naftogaz said last month that UGV had brought online five ""highly productive"" gas wells since the start of 2024, with CEO Oleksiy Chernyshov saying output rose also as a result of ""effective"" work at older fields.

""Our goal is to maintain this trend and to achieve an increase in production also based on the results of the year,"" Chernyshov said.

UGV already boosted daily gas output to a more than five-year high in February, with production topping 38.5 million cu m/d, the highest level since December 2018.

Naftogaz said in April that production rates were traditionally highest in the east of the country, but that output in the west and central regions also exceeded expectations.

Ukraine has long held the ambition of producing all the gas it consumes to eliminate imports from Europe, and said imports were not needed in the past winter.

Halting the need for imports to meet its own demand is a key priority for Ukraine, not least given the relatively high price of imported gas.

Platts, part of S&P Global Commodity Insights, assessed the benchmark Dutch TTF month-ahead price on May 13 at Eur29.53/MWh.

""In particular, Ukrgasvydobuvannya JSC generated about UAH 13 billion in net profit in 2023 compared to UAH 2.9 billion in 2022. Ukrnafta PJSC also significantly improved its results, having generated more than UAH 20 billion in net profit compared to UAH 1.1 billion worth of losses suffered in 2022,"" the report states.

Additionally, the net profit of Ukrtransgaz JSC reached about UAH 7 billion in 2023 compared to UAH 3.2 billion in 2022. Ukrtransnafta JSC raised its profit by 40% to UAH 5.6 billion.

""The main activity area where Naftogaz Group did now show profitable results was the segment of gas sales. This came from the supply of natural gas to consumers under Public Service Obligations (PSO) at the prices set by the state,"" the company noted.

At the same time, Naftogaz of Ukraine Gas Supply Company managed to reduce its losses by 12 times, and Naftogaz Trading Gas Supply Company - about sixfold.

Naftogaz Group's parent company, Naftogaz of Ukraine NJSC, decreased the amount of losses from UAH 36.6 billion in 2022 to UAH 0.78 billion in 2023.

May 14 (Interfax) - Ukrgazvydobuvannya (UGV) has launched another two high-yield wells with daily flow rates of 270,000 and 120,000 cubic meters of gas, Ukrainian media reported, quoting the Naftogaz Group's website, on Tuesday.

The wells, 6,200 and 6,225 meters deep, are twin wells, so called because they were drilled at the same field and same reservoir and almost simultaneously.

The wells were drilled in eight months instead of the usual two or three years this would take in the past, thanks to the use of state of the art drilling rigs, the skills of Ukrburgaz specialists and fewer accidents while work was performed.

""New seismic exploration and drilling data enabled our specialists to create a high-quality 3D model, which is one of the best at Ukrgazvydobuvannya, allowing us to plan effectively for the field's further development. Work at the field continues, and the next appraisal and production well will soon be drilled,"" UGV chief Oleg Tolmachev said.

UGV has commissioned seven new high-yield wells, including the twin wells, since the start of 2024.

UGV commissioned 86 new wells, 24 of them with an initial daily flow rate of more than 100,000 cubic meters, in 2023.

UGV's saleable gas production fell 3% to 12.5 billion cubic meters in 2022. UGV produced 13.224 bcm of saleable gas in 2023, up 679 mcm from 2022. The 2024 target is 13.75 bcm.",interfax.com,news,interfax.com,,0.2627450980392156,453390344,1,,

The Kyiv Independent is reposting it with permission.

Cabinet appoints new acting CEO for Ukrspyrt. On May 3, Stanislav Banchuk was appointed to the position. On May 6, Ukrspyrt confirmed Banchuk's appointment, with no further details.

Banchuk previously had a legal practice in Kyiv. A person by that name was deputy regional prosecutor of Chernivtsi Oblast until 2014 according to Ekonomichna Pravda (EP).

According to YouControl, Banchuk founded Standart Law Firm LLC, Gaztekhkom LLC, Novitni Energetychni Systemy LLC, P.E.G.O. Trading House, Voga Resources LLC, and SpetsOil LLC, which specialize in oil and gas trading.

On March 1, Vitaliy Koval, head of the State Property Fund of Ukraine (SPFU), wrote that the privatization of distilleries was in the home stretch, with the fund planning to privatize 17 more Ukrspyrt facilities in 2024.

According to Koval, the SPFU had run 115 online auctions of Ukrspyrt assets and 54 auctions had resulted in sales. The sum of prices went from Hr 1.25 billion ($31.5 million) to Hr 3.01 billion ($75.9 million) during the auctions.

As we wrote in January 2022 in Issue 63, acting CEO of Ukrspyrt Serhiy Bleskun resigned. After that, the Cabinet of Ministers temporarily assigned Vitaliy Zhadobin as the new acting CEO.

On Nov. 11, 2022, the Cabinet appointed Ivan Kucherenko as Ukrspyrt's new acting CEO.

Ukrspyrt last had a permanent CEO in 2014, and the company has since been led by various ""acting"" CEOs.

Detention order issued for SPFU's former head who allegedly embezzled millions. On May 8, the High Anti-Corruption Court (HACC) ordered detention for the former head of the SPFU, Dmytro Sennychenko, who is wanted internationally.

According to the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office (SAPO), Sennychenko headed a criminal group that embezzled more than Hr 500 million ($12.6 million) from state-owned enterprises, including Odesa Portside Plant (OPZ) and United Mining and Chemical Company (UMCC), and laundered Hr 10 billion ($252 million) in 2019-2021.

As we reported in Issue 80, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) and SAPO said that they exposed a criminal group run by Sennychenko in March 2023. See Issue 80 for more detail.

Sennychenko headed the SPFU from September 2019 to February 2022. He filed his resignation letter in November 2021, but the Verkhovna Rada only approved his resignation on Feb. 17, 2022.

As we wrote in Issue 83, the suspects in this case, including Sennychenko, were placed on the wanted list in April 2023.

In November 2023, we wrote that NABU and SAPO updated suspicions against all members of the criminal group allegedly led by Sennychenko. They are now also suspected of legalizing criminal proceeds of over Hr 10 billion ($252 million).

See our Issues 80, 83, and 114 for more detail on this case.

Ukrainian energy facilities struck again. On May 8, the Energy Ministry reported that Russia damaged Ukraine's energy infrastructure, including transmission facilities in Poltava, Kirovohrad, Zaporizhzhia, Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk, and Vinnytsia oblasts.

There were no casualties or injuries. Power engineers worked together with the State Emergency Service to eliminate the consequences, the ministry added.

In addition to damage to generation infrastructure, equipment at one of Ukrenergo's facilities in central Ukraine was also damaged, the company said.

Due to the power shortages caused by the massive attack, Ukrenergo was forced to impose restrictions on power supply to industry and businesses during evening peak hours.

Ukrenergo also imports electricity from Romania, Slovakia, Poland, Hungary, and Moldova, but according to the company's CEO Volodymyr Kudrytskyi, this is not enough to cover the deficit.

Rinat Akhmetov's DTEK, Ukraine's largest private energy holding, reported that Russia attacked three of its thermal power plants again, severely damaging equipment.

On May 9, Ukrhydroenergo reported that two hydroelectric power plants (HPPs) were out of operation due to the attack. [The company has a total of ten HPPs.

""Today, all hydroelectric power generation has suffered crucial damages. The destroyed equipment requires considerable efforts to repair and restore and significant financial resources,"" the company said.

On June 6, Ukrhydroenergo reported that the Kakhovka HPP was destroyed beyond restoration after the Russians set off a massive explosion in the engine room. See our Issue 91 for more detail.

Russian missiles attacked Ukraine's largest HPP, the Dnipro HPP in Zaporizhzhia, on March 22. See Issue 124 for more detail.

During another missile attack, on March 29, the Kaniv and Dniester HPPs were deliberately targeted by Russian forces. See Issue 125 for more detail.

After every Russian mass missile attack on Ukraine's vital infrastructure, emergency outages take place, lasting for days due to the ongoing repair works. During such outages, people in Ukraine are often left without electricity, heating, water supply, or access to mobile phone networks.

Ukraine faced the largest Russian missile and drone attack on its energy facilities on March 22. See Issue 124 for more detail.

A week later, Ukrenergo faced yet another Russian missile and drone attack. See more in Issue 125.

On April 11, Ukraine faced the third Russian attack on its energy facilities in one month. The Trypillia Thermal Power Plant (TPP) in Kyiv oblast was destroyed. See Issue 127 for detail.

On April 27, Ukraine faced another Russian attack on its energy infrastructure. See Issue 129 for more.

The Cabinet keeps low electricity tariffs for households until the end of May 2024. On April 26, the Cabinet of Ministers extended public service obligations (PSOs) for another month, from April 30 - May 31. The price for households will remain Hr 2.64 ($0.07) per kWh.

Energoatom and Ukrhydroenergo were granted the right to sell electricity on market terms from Oct. 1, 2021. Under the new PSO model, the proceeds were used to compensate electricity providers for the difference between the regulated household tariffs (at that time, Hr 1.44/kWh and Hr 1.68/kWh depending on the volume of consumption) and market prices.

Since October 2021, the Cabinet of Ministers has repeatedly extended the PSO mechanism to keep electricity tariffs for households unchanged until the end of the previous heating season. The PSO mechanism was in place until April 30, 2023.

On May 30, 2023, the Cabinet approved an increase in the electricity tariff for households to Hr 2.64/kWh from June 1, 2023.

As we reported in Issue 115, in January, the PSO model had been extended until April 30. The government made this decision to reduce the financial burden on households due to the difficult economic situation caused by the full-scale war. As a result, the electricity price for households would continue to be Hr 2.64 per kWh.

According to Deputy Energy Minister Svitlana Hrynchuk, the Cabinet of Ministers is discussing the possibility of raising electricity tariffs, as resources are needed for the next heating season. No decision has been made yet, she said.

As we reported in our earlier issues, the low electricity tariff has consistently caused financial challenges for Ukrainian energy SOEs:

As we wrote in April, Naftogaz left the current gas tariff for households unchanged for at least another year. See Issue 129 for detail.

Ukrenergo reports a Hr 400 million profit in 2023 (audited); financial statements on the LSE website. On May 3, Ukrenergo reported its financial results for 2023, ending the year with a revenue of Hr 83 billion ($2.1 billion).

The company's financial statements, including the independent auditor's report, were published on the website of the London Stock Exchange (LSE).

On May 10, the company also held a briefing where CEO Volodymyr Kudrytskyi commented on Ukrenergo's key indicators in 2023.

The company made a profit of Hr 377 million ($9.5 million) in 2023. In 2022, Ukrenergo posted a loss of Hr 6 billion ($151 million)

Despite the Russian shelling of the infrastructure and the difficult situation in the energy system, the value of Ukrenergo's assets increased by almost Hr 45 billion ($1.1 billion), Kudrytskyi said.

In addition, the company paid Hr 2.4 billion ($60 million) in taxes and dividends to the state in 2023.

Kudrytskyi also said that the company paid off Hr 24 billion ($605 million) in debts in 2023 and the first quarter of 2024.

As we wrote in November 2023, the electricity market had a chain of debts of ""everyone to everyone"" worth Hr 60 billion ($1.5 billion). See Issue 110 for more detail.

German government grants 45 million euros ($48.7 million) to restore and protect energy infrastructure. On May 9, Ukrenergo signed an agreement with the German Development Bank KfW.

According to Ukrenergo's CEO Volodymyr Kudrytskyi, this will pay for a high-voltage line that will increase the stability of Ukraine's connection to the European grid. The aid will also pay for high-voltage equipment and restoring facilities in central Ukraine after Russian attacks.

In total, with KfW's support, Ukrenergo has attracted more than 177 million euros ($191 million) in loans and grants for the restoration and development of the electricity transmission network since Russia's invasion, the company added.

As we reported in Issue 128, Ukrenergo received nearly 1 million euros ($1.1 million) worth of energy equipment from German partners.

Naftogaz Group says its 2023 audited net profit is Hr 23 billion; financial statements not yet available. On May 7, Naftogaz Group reported that it made Hr 23.1 billion ($583 million) in consolidated net profit in 2023, a significant rebound from its Hr 79.1 billion ($1.9 billion) loss in 2022.

The company said that its consolidated financial statements were confirmed by an independent auditor, approved by the supervisory board on May 3, and sent to the Cabinet for approval.

The financial statements were not publicly available at the time of writing.

Note that the law on the functioning of the financial sector during martial law allows, in particular, joint-stock companies not to publish financial statements.

In pursuance of this law, the National Securities and Stock Market Commission (NSSMC), as a regulator, adopted a decision according to which joint-stock companies must disclose their annual and interim information (which includes financial statements) for 2021-2023 during 90 days after the end of martial law.

Until this provision of the above law is lifted, state-owned joint-stock companies, such as Naftogaz, Ukrnafta, and others, will have a legal ground not to disclose their financial statements.

Under normal circumstances, according to the NSSMC's disclosure regulation, joint-stock companies must disclose annual financial statements for 2023 as part of their annual disclosure by April 30.

At the same time, the law does not prevent such disclosure (including financial statements) by SOEs, as this would be customarily done in best corporate governance practice.

We are not aware of any objective reasons, including those related to martial law, for the above exemption to continue to exist. The lack of annual reports leads to opaqueness of SOEs, including making it impossible to analyze or understand their performance.

When SOEs or their management report selected financial indicators or trends, no objective analysis of such reports or SOEs' performance altogether is possible.

Countries with developed capital markets have rules regulating the disclosure of sensitive (insider) information by public companies. Among other things, shareholders, other investors, or the public may not be misled by selective or delayed disclosure of such information.

The profitability of the business lines was driven by significantly improved financial results of the Group's companies, Naftogaz added without providing any details.

The company also said that most of the profit will go into dividends to the state. The Cabinet set the individual dividend pay-out ratio for Naftogaz at 95%. See SOE Weekly's Issue 118.

It is also unclear whether or how Ukrnafta's financial performance is incorporated in Naftogaz's financial statements.

As we reported in Issue 121, Ukrnafta is to pay the state a total of Hr 8 billion ($202 million) in dividends for 2023. Ukrnafta's audited financial statements for 2022 or 2023 were also not available at the time of writing.

Meanwhile, the former CEO of the Gas Transmission System Operator of Ukraine (GTSOU) Serhiy Makogon questioned the data. He said that buffer gas was Naftogaz's major source of profit in the first six months of 2023, according to the company's (unaudited) reporting for that period.

Apparently, this means that Naftogaz was now able to sell the buffer gas from underground storages, which it could not sell earlier.

Buffer gas is the volume of gas that is necessary to ensure the stable operation of underground storages, including maintaining the necessary pressure that allows normal gas take-off.

Naftogaz CEO interviewed. Naftogaz CEO Oleksiy Chernyshov spoke to Forbes Ukraine this week. We selected key segments:

On Naftogaz's financial performance in 2023 and forecasts for 2024:

As we reported in Issue 126, Ukrnafta earned almost Hr 24 billion ($605 million) in net profit in 2023.

It is unclear how Ukrnafta's dividends would be paid to the state and Naftogaz; see previous item.

As a result of the attack, the tracks at Kherson railway station were damaged, and the movement of Train No. 121/122 (Kyiv-Kherson-Kyiv) was temporarily restricted. Later that day, railway workers completed repairs to the track damaged by the shelling, the company said.

As we reported earlier, Ukrzaliznytsia's civilian infrastructure in and around Dnipro was also shelled by Russian troops on April 19. See Issue 128 for more detail.

Confiscated PentoPack Plant up for auction at Hr 203 million ($5.1 million), the State Property Fund's (SPFU) press office reported on May 6. It was confiscated from Russian-Greek businessman Ivan Savvidi.

The online auction is scheduled for May 31.

According to the SPFU, PentoPack is one of the leading producers of packaging for meats and sausages. It produces multilayer synthetic shrink wrap using modern technologies, including printing with UV, water, and alcohol inks.

PentoPack's products are used in more than thirty countries around the world. In Ukraine, the company does business with Rud, Globino, and Myasna Gildiya.

PentoPack retained 193 jobs and has no wage or state budget arrears. The company plans to enter new markets for packaging materials for the dairy industry, fish processing, and animal feed packaging, the SPFU added.

""This is an extremely attractive investment asset. It is not just about production facilities, but about a well-established profitable business in a promising segment of the food industry. The new owner would have all the opportunities for further growth and development,"" SPFU head Vitaliy Koval said.

As we reported in Issue 122, the SPFU declared its privatization plans for PentoPack in early March.

Ukrnafta and ARMA seek permission to manage Tatneft's assets. On May 6, Ukrnafta and the Asset Recovery and Management Agency (ARMA), applied for a merger clearance to manage Russian Tatneft Group's assets in Poltava and Kharkiv oblasts. These include petrol stations, oil depots, and other commercial property - a total of 110 units.

Most of them are in rundown condition, and some petrol stations have been destroyed, and they need to be rebuilt from scratch, Ukrnafta said. As of today, about 15 of the 70 Tatneft petrol stations are operational. The situation is similar with idle oil depots, Ukrnafta added.

ARMA declared its plans to transfer Tatneft filling stations to Ukrnafta's management ten months ago (see Issue 99), and the Cabinet transferred them on Aug. 15, 2023 (see Issue 100).

It is unclear why ARMA and Ukrnafta had not applied for merger clearance earlier, and how the assets have been maintained in the meantime.

Ukrnafta said that it would assess these assets on a case-by-case basis to calculate the required level of investment and the timing of their return.

ARMA and Ukrnafta are finalizing the asset management agreement.

As we reported earlier, Ukrnafta also manages the assets of the Glusco group. On March 14, the Antimonopoly Committee of Ukraine allowed Ukrnafta to take over the management of Glusco's assets - see Issue 123. On March 15, Ukrnafta and ARMA said that they signed acts of acceptance for the transfer of Glusco assets - see Issue 124.

In a time of war, geopolitical tensions, and energy insecurities, Ukraine emerged as a shining example of resilience and unwavering determination this past winter, as it powered through the season, using only domestic gas sources for the first time in its history.

Supplying oil and gas equipment to Ukraine. As an American entrepreneur deeply engaged in Kyiv's oil and gas sector, I'm proud of my company's role in this endeavor. Vorex USA, headquartered in Erie, Pa., was the leading U.S. supplier of oil and gas equipment to Ukraine in 2023, fulfilling contracts worth over $100 million with Ukrainian state-owned Naftogaz. We collaborated seamlessly with partners in the U.S. and Kyiv, to facilitate the delivery of 30,000 tons of pipe and equipment to Ukraine amidst the backdrop of ongoing conflict.

The struggle to develop gas reserves. Ukraine's efforts to achieve energy security are the product of a decade-long struggle that began with Russia's early invasion of the country in 2014. Ukraine has some of the biggest reserves of natural gas in Europe, but it traditionally relied on Moscow for its energy needs. The country quit importing Russian gas in 2015, so Ukraine is ahead of the curve -- and ahead of Europe.

Today, the Ukrainian energy market is transformed: It is fully integrated with the natural gas and electricity markets of Europe, embracing European energy standards and regulations and completely independent of Russia. In fact, Ukraine's Transmission System Operator (TSO) recently said it planned to end its current Russian gas transit contract this year -- surely sooner than European countries had expected.

The EU can learn from Ukraine. But the EU lags Ukraine in crimping its consumption of Moscow's natural gas, which has remained fairly steady throughout the war. Though EU countries passed sanctions and swore off oil imports from Russia at the start of the current war in Ukraine, they continue to be highly dependent on Russian gas. According to statistics generated by the Reuters news agency, Moscow continued supplying about 15% of Europe's gas supply in 2023, in line with what it historically provided. The EU has pledged to quit its reliance on Russian natural gas by 2027, but that may not be soon enough: If Ukraine closes the pipe, several countries, including Austria and Poland, will be affected.

To be sure, closing the Ukraine pipeline is a daunting task. The interconnected nature of these pipelines is challenging -- Ukraine cannot simply shut the flow and strand its neighbors. And this is all happening as Russia is launching one of its largest missile and drone attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure.

To navigate this transition, Ukraine will depend on companies like mine to deliver crucial assistance to the adaptation process. In collaboration with cGAS, a Polish company based in Rawicz, Vorex will deliver innovative solutions tailored to Ukraine's specific needs, including four Automatic Gas Distribution Stations, each boasting a capacity of 5,000 Nm3/h, to ensure TSO pipelines are ready for use after Russian transport. We are also providing ball valves and gas regulators from Italy, essential components for managing and controlling the flow of gas within the pipeline network.

Gains in Ukrainian gas production. The current conflict in Ukraine, which began with a full-bore Russian invasion in early 2022, laid bare critical vulnerabilities inherent in Europe's reliance on Moscow for natural gas and its pipeline network. But progress during wartime seems to be the way in Ukraine. According to S&P Global, Ukrainian gas production rose to 18.7 Bcm in 2023, up from 18.5 Bcm in 2022. While that is still lower than pre-war levels, the country didn't need any winter gas imports this season -- a signal achievement for a country in the throes of a full-scale foreign invasion.

Moreover, as Naftogaz duly reported recently, Ukraine has already brought five new wells online in 2024, including a new high-throughput gas production well producing more than 500,000 cmgd (17.6 MMcfgd).

What Ukraine has achieved holds potential lessons for the broader landscape of global energy security. According to the International Trade Commission, Ukraine boasts the third-largest natural gas reserves in Europe and possesses the necessary infrastructure to facilitate the transportation of gas to European markets. The country currently has some 5,000 producing gas wells, with another 5,000 wells depleted and sealed. The Commission reckons perhaps 1,000 of the shut-in wells could become productive again by deploying modern techniques. All told, the country has some 900 Bcm (31.8 Tcf) of gas reserves, the Commission says, much of it unexploited and the second largest stockpile in Europe.

Looking forward. Through a combination of strategic investments in technology, the establishment of a robust regulatory framework, and embracing innovation and entrepreneurship, Ukraine's energy sector is on solid footing, despite the threat of occupation by a hostile foreign power.

And there's more to come. I believe that when hostilities cease, Ukraine will be well-placed to export natural gas to its European neighbors, perhaps filling the void left by Moscow.

Since late March, Ukrainian energy infrastructure increasingly has come under attack from Russian military forces, with gas facilities and underground storage units hit several times by missile and drone strikes.

Russian attacks on Ukrainian gas infrastructure are a part of broader series of assaults on oil, gas and power facilities between the two nations, initiated by Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, with an attack on Russia's Salavat refinery by Ukrainian drones May 9 being the latest development

""It is just too sudden and unpredictable for me,"" a Netherlands-based trader said, reflecting on the risk of a rapid deterioration of the situation in Ukraine.

Similar to the country's gas storage infrastructure, Ukrainian gas production facilities were also subjects of shelling and power cuts, but Naftogaz's upstream arm, UkrGazVydobuvannya, posted 12% year-on-year gains in Q1 2024.

""The risk is too high,"" a European gas trader said. ""We have considered [using Ukrainian storage], but it's too hard to put the case together because it's impossible to know Russia's next moves.""

Ukrainian storage capacity benefits from customs warehouse regime

In a report published May 7, analysts at S&P Global Commodity Insights revised their projections and now consider it ""more likely than not"" that Russian gas flows through Ukraine will cease by 2025.

This development has prompted Europe to look at several flexibility and contingency options. For the Central and Eastern European, or CEE, markets, an option is to utilize Ukrainian gas storage facilities under the country's customs warehouse regime. The Ukrainian customs warehouse regime has more storage capacity than any other EU country, a legacy of the high volumes of Russian gas exported through the country.

The regime bundles all Ukrainian storage facilities as one, meaning if one facility is hit, participants can continue to withdraw gas from other facilities. Moreover, UkrTransGaz also offers custom duty exemptions for three years, meaning gas can easily be reimported back into the EU.

Up to 10 Bcm of capacity was on offer under the customs warehouse regime, according to Agneta Kutselim, UkrTransGaz head of commercial.

By comparison, German storage's working gas volume stands at roughly 25 Bcm, with the country boasting the EU's largest underground storage capacity, data from Gas Infrastructure Europe shows.

A Hungary-based trader wondered who would ultimately take the financial hit for the gas lost due to infrastructure attacks.

""Domestic players or foreign companies?"" the source asked, pointing out that the current replacement arrangement would cause operational problems but is ""is doable until a certain level"" of infrastructure damage.

The prior mentioned analytics report forecasts that, based on current gas storage levels and continued injections throughout summer 2024, 2.5 Bcm of gas would be available for withdrawals during the winter season.

Winter premiums remain weak

Market participants continued to see the seasonal spreads as currently unfavorable in pushing enough injections into Ukrainian storage by the end of summer.

""I do not think that the current spreads between summer contracts and winter will incentivize a lot of players to fill storage beyond the EU into Ukraine"" a UK-based gas analyst said, ""If there is less gas in Ukrainian storage, or if they become less available [due to attacks], the gas system in winter will be much tighter, and Eastern European countries will have to also rely more on imports from Northwest Europe.""

Platts, part of S&P Global Commodity Insights, assessed the Winter 2024 premium to the month-ahead at Europe's bellwether Dutch TTF hub at Eur5.32/MWh May 11, with the spread having averaged around Eur5.325/MWh since the summer season began.

In comparison, Platts had assessed the TTF Winter 2023 premium to the month-ahead at Eur20.075/MWh as of May 11, 2023. This spread would then reach a peak of Eur20.6/MWh by May 24, remaining between the Eur15-20/MWh for much of the previous summer season.

European gas market participants have highlighted persistent concerns surrounding risks of further escalation alongside unfavorable pricing dynamics.

""The spreads are the driver,"" a Switzerland-based trader said. ""If the spreads were Eur10-12/MWh, which was a decent level for last year, would a trader inject in light of these new attacks?""

Another European gas trader said: ""It is about portfolio management and risk appetite. Personally, I would not use any Ukrainian source as long as Russia is active in the field. ... My opinion now is that the market isn't focused on this.""

""If storage infrastructure is damaged, it may cause a reactive price spike but shouldn't have a long-term effect on prices because they are not being utilized in the market,"" the same source said.

May 13 (Interfax) - Naftogaz stands ready to provide the infrastructure of its enterprises to enable the prompt connection of gas-fired power plants and to supply them with natural gas in a required amount, Naftogaz CEO Alexei Chernyshov said.

""Naftogaz is ready to provide the infrastructure that we already have, above all thermal power plants, to install and connect these facilities. It is more convenient and faster of course to install them on existing capacities. And we are ready to provide them with natural gas if this happens,"" Ukrainian media quoted Chernyshov as saying at Forbes Ukraine's Business Breakfast event.

""I ought to say completely responsibly and guarantee that the amount of natural gas will be sufficient for supplying them, and we are ready to ensure an additional volume,"" he said.

Modern gas-fired power plants are quite energy-efficient and do not use as much gas as old ones, he said.

Chernyshov said that, as far as he knows, the Ukrainian government is now actively holding negotiations and is searching for such facilities.

""There is certain clarity on this matter,"" he said.

""As for our plans, we are looking at this segment, it is this competence that Ukrnafta is predominantly developing now. But when we speak about the following winter, there, beyond any doubt, could be exclusively donor projects to deliver available facilities, which could arrive in Ukraine as soon as possible, tentatively speaking next month or in July. In this case, we can manage to do that before the following winter,"" Chernyshov said.

As reported on May 8, citing Chernyshov, Ukraine plans to accumulate at least 13 billion cubic meters of gas in its underground gas storage facilities before the next heating season.

There were over eight bcm of gas in underground storage facilities in early May 2024, he said.

A total of 8.5 bcm of gas were taken from Ukraine's underground storage facilities during the 2023-2024 heating season, including 6.7 bcm consumed by Ukraine itself.

""Gazprom continues to supply Russian gas for transit through Ukrainian territory via the Sudzha gas pumping station in an amount approved by Ukraine. The volume is 42.9 mln cubic meters for May 12. A request for transit via the Sokhranovka gas pumping station was rejected,"" he said.

The volume also stood at 42.4 mln cubic meters on May 11.

The transit line through Ukraine remains the only route for Russian gas supplies to western and central European countries. Pumping through the Nord Stream pipeline was completely suspended. Gas supplies via Turkish Stream and Blue Stream are intended for Turkey and southern and southeastern European countries.

In May 2022, the Gas Transmission System Operator of Ukraine said it would suspend the flow of gas to Europe via the Sokhranovka transit point due to force majeure as the company allegedly was unable to control the Novopskov gas compressor station in the Lugansk People's Republic. However, the Russian gas giant did not see any proof of force majeure.

In the fall of 2022, Ukraine's Naftogaz company filed a petition for arbitration with the International Arbitration Court against Gazprom for allegedly being late with its payment for gas transportation services through Ukraine.

Marc Champion, for example, writing for Bloomberg, highlighted the fact that the Israeli Prime Minister is currently ""fighting corruption charges in court"" (it being implicit that it is of course usually harder to investigate and to condemn incumbent national leaders). Netanyahu, in addition, will ""face a political reckoning over Oct. 7's security failures as soon as the war in Gaza ends.""

Thus, writes Champion, ""under cover of the country's blinding rage and deep yearning for long-term security, Netanyahu is fighting to secure his own political survival."" Champion and other analysts may or may not be spot on, with regards to Netanyahu's motivations and calculations. The point is that personal, private and business interests (sometimes even involving shady deals) may indeed shape, to some degree, foreign policy decisions. And the issue is more outstanding in Ukraine than perhaps anywhere else.

By October 2023, the European Union (EU) and the United States had made over $160 billion (and counting) in commitments to Ukraine (including tens of billions in arms - many of which ended up in black markets, by the way). One may recall that already in 2021 Amos Hochstein was especially appointed by US President Joe Biden as the US Senior Advisor for Energy Security, with a focus, back then, on reducing the ""risks"" Nord Stream 2 posed, from an American perspective. Today, the Russian-German Nord Stream 2 pipeline is gone (have been criminally exploded as it was), and Hochstein, when not busy threatening Lebanon with war, (""learn from Gaza"") is currently preoccupied with the seemingly lost cause of Saudi-Israel normalization. Volumes could be written on those issues, but let us focus here on Eastern Europe.

Back in 2021, I commented on how American geopolitical and geoeconomic interests, pertaining to selling its own (more expensive) liquefied natural gas to Europe, were inextricably linked with private interests, which included corruption scandals involving Biden's own family and his aforementioned protégé Hochstein - who is a former member of Naftogaz' supervisory board, this being the largest national oil and gas company in Ukraine, also involved in a number of scandals.

I've also written on the shady deals involving Ukrainian investment company Dragon Capital and the American multinational investment company BlackRock, as well as the evidence implicating the Democrat Party and the Bidens. In many of these episodes, Hunter Biden, the incumbent president's son plays a role: his sexual scandals, the once ridiculed biolabs allegations, and many other accusations once deemed as mere ""conspiracy theories"" gained traction within the US media, were weaponized by the Republicans, and keep haunting the current American presidency to this day.

As I wrote before, in August 2021, a Ukrainian Parliament' member denounced a corruption ring within the aforementioned Naftogaz: interestingly, his testimony included alleged leaked audio records of then US Vice President Biden offering the then Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko a billion dollars as part of a secret deal to dismiss the former Ukrainian Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin, who was investigating the business activities of Biden's son in the country.

Considering all that, it would not be too far-fetched at all to apply to the Biden's administration, the same reasoning Marc Champion applied (with or without merit in this case) to Netanyahu's one: the Bidens certainly seem to have lots of business and personal reasons to desire the perpetuation of a conflict in Ukraine, from which American arms's manufacturers also profit.

Taking this reasoning further, this ""personal"" angle becomes even more evident when it comes to Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky. We know that already in June 2022, Ukrainian Army Brigadier General Volodymyr Karpenko admitted his nation had lost almost 50% of all weapons and equipment it received, and we know much of it has been smuggled to criminal and terrorist groups, Ukraine being ""a longtime hub of arms trafficking"", as John Hudson, writing for the Washington Post, once described it.

Ukraine is also an import transit destination for drugs such as heroin. It has the third highest criminality score of 33 countries in Europe. In today's world, illicit trade plays of course a major role in the financing of terrorist and extremist networks globally, and far-right extremism is yet another huge problem that has been haunting the country since at least 2014. Such forces have certainly been a force to be reckoned with: on May 27, 2019, former neo-Fascist Dmytro Yarosh, then adviser to Valerii Zaluzhny, former Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, said that President Zelensky could ""lose his life"" and end up ""hanging on a tree on Khreshchatyk"" if he ever ""betrayed"" Ukrainian ultra-nationalists by negotiating an end to the civil war in Donbass.

Zelensky does have his personal motivations, including concerns about his own physical safety, for keeping the conflict with Russia going indefinitely. According to Seymour Hersh (Pulitzer winner winner) CIA sources, European leaders last year (from Hungary, Poland, Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia, and the Czech Republic) were pressuring the Ukrainian leader ""to find a way to end the war"", and they had ""made it clear that 'Zelensky can keep what he's got - a villa in Italy and interests in offshore bank accounts - 'if he works up a peace deal even if he's got to be paid off, if it's the only way to get a deal'.""

Taking all that into consideration, it is not far-fetched at all to describe the current aid Washington sends to Kyiv as being in part a major corruption scam that has a lot to do with leaders across the Atlantic trying to protect themselves and to secure their own private interests. This is not to deny of course the role American geopolitical interests (pertaining to NATO expansion) also played in the greater scheme of things. The point is that personal and electoral factors too should all be considered by analysts and journalists when trying to make sense of unwinnable conflicts being fueled.

MOSCOW, May 9. /TASS/. Gazprom supplied gas for Europe through Ukraine in the volume of 42.4 mln cubic meters per day via the Sudzha gas pumping station in Russia's Kursk Region, a Gazprom representative told reporters.

Here is an overview of Ukraine's worsening energy situation since Russia's February 2022 full-scale invasion.

DAMAGE

Ukraine's energy system was badly damaged by a Russian air campaign in the war's first winter and only partially repaired. Russian forces renewed their assault on the grid on March 22, 2024, attacking thermal and hydro-electric power stations and the main power distribution substations.

Ukraine lost about 80% of its thermal power generation and about 35% of its hydropower capacity during the renewed attacks, officials said.

DTEK, Ukraine's largest private energy company which typically covers about a quarter of the nation's total energy needs, said the attacks had damaged five of its power plants and took out 80% of their capacity.

Smaller, state-owned Centenergo said it lost all its generating capacity after the Trypilska coal-powered plant outside Kyiv, a major supplier for the Kyiv region and two central regions, was destroyed on April 11. Its other station was destroyed in March and another one is occupied.

Officials say Russia has also attacked Ukrainian natural gas infrastructure, targeting underground storage facilities. Naftogaz said the state energy company's facilities had been attacked at least five times since March 2024.

NUCLEAR

Before Russia's invasion, Ukraine had one of Europe's largest electricity systems and was a net power exporter. In 2020, the installed capacity was about 54.5 GW and the mix was diversified.

Now Ukraine has to rely increasingly on its three nuclear power plants, which produce about 60% of its electricity.

Ukraine's six-reactor Zaporizhzhia, Europe's biggest such plant, was occupied by Russia at the start of its invasion.

Thermal and hydro-electric power generation are needed to keep the levels of supply and consumption balanced during peak hours of energy consumption in the morning and evening.

Ukraine is also developing renewable energy, hydro-electric power, solar, biogas and wind, which it sees as vital to creating a ""decentralised"" system that would be less vulnerable to Russian bombing.

BLACKOUTS

Russian attacks have forced authorities to impose rolling blackouts in multiple regions, but their full impact will likely be felt when seasonal energy consumption peaks at the height of summer and in winter.

Power companies and officials are urging Ukrainians to minimise their power use and avoid using more than one electrical household appliance at a time, especially during peak evening hours.

Ukraine consumed about 17-18 GW prior to the war, International Energy Agency data shows. No new data was available.

Ukraine's second largest city, Kharkiv, the surrounding region and several other frontline regions in the east are already facing rolling blackouts because of a power shortfall.

Analysts expect that to become larger in the summer as temperatures rise, which would in turn force the government to introduce broader blackouts in July and August.

The colder autumn and winter months will worsen that shortfall. Energy Minister German Galuschenko has called on residents and businesses to start preparing and to purchase power generators and power banks.

RESILIENCE

The government rolled out hundreds of ""invincibility"" centres offering food, drinks and warmth to people left without power during the first winter of the war. As of April 2024, more than 13,000 centres were functioning across the country.

The energy system has been connected to the European Union's united grid since the first weeks of Russia's invasion.

Ukraine can import about 1,700 MW of electricity from Europe and relies on imports from its Western neighbours to balance its system during peak hours. Kyiv hopes to increase these volumes.

Here is an overview of Ukraine's worsening energy situation since Russia's February 2022 full-scale invasion.

DAMAGE

Ukraine's energy system was badly damaged by a Russian air campaign in the war's first winter and only partially repaired. Russian forces renewed their assault on the grid on March 22, 2024, attacking thermal and hydro-electric power stations and the main power distribution substations.

Ukraine lost about 80% of its thermal power generation and about 35% of its hydropower capacity during the renewed attacks, officials said.

DTEK, Ukraine's largest private energy company which typically covers about a quarter of the nation's total energy needs, said the attacks had damaged five of its power plants and took out 80% of their capacity.

Smaller, state-owned Centenergo said it lost all its generating capacity after the Trypilska coal-powered plant outside Kyiv, a major supplier for the Kyiv region and two central regions, was destroyed on April 11. Its other station was destroyed in March and another one is occupied.

Officials say Russia has also attacked Ukrainian natural gas infrastructure, targeting underground storage facilities. Naftogaz said the state energy company's facilities had been attacked at least five times since March 2024.

NUCLEAR

Before Russia's invasion, Ukraine had one of Europe's largest electricity systems and was a net power exporter. In 2020, the installed capacity was about 54.5 GW and the mix was diversified.

Now Ukraine has to rely increasingly on its three nuclear power plants, which produce about 60% of its electricity.

Ukraine's six-reactor Zaporizhzhia, Europe's biggest such plant, was occupied by Russia at the start of its invasion.

Thermal and hydro-electric power generation are needed to keep the levels of supply and consumption balanced during peak hours of energy consumption in the morning and evening.

Ukraine is also developing renewable energy, hydro-electric power, solar, biogas and wind, which it sees as vital to creating a ""decentralised"" system that would be less vulnerable to Russian bombing.

BLACKOUTS

Russian attacks have forced authorities to impose rolling blackouts in multiple regions, but their full impact will likely be felt when seasonal energy consumption peaks at the height of summer and in winter.

Power companies and officials are urging Ukrainians to minimise their power use and avoid using more than one electrical household appliance at a time, especially during peak evening hours.

Ukraine consumed about 17-18 GW prior to the war, International Energy Agency data shows. No new data was available.

Ukraine's second largest city, Kharkiv, the surrounding region and several other frontline regions in the east are already facing rolling blackouts because of a power shortfall.

Analysts expect that to become larger in the summer as temperatures rise, which would in turn force the government to introduce broader blackouts in July and August.

The colder autumn and winter months will worsen that shortfall. Energy Minister German Galuschenko has called on residents and businesses to start preparing and to purchase power generators and power banks.

RESILIENCE

The government rolled out hundreds of ""invincibility"" centres offering food, drinks and warmth to people left without power during the first winter of the war. As of April 2024, more than 13,000 centres were functioning across the country.

The energy system has been connected to the European Union's united grid since the first weeks of Russia's invasion.

Ukraine can import about 1,700 MW of electricity from Europe and relies on imports from its Western neighbours to balance its system during peak hours. Kyiv hopes to increase these volumes.

KYIV, May 8 (Reuters) - Russia launched a barrage of missiles and drones at Ukraine on Wednesday, hitting nearly a dozen energy infrastructure facilities across the country, in the latest in a string of attacks on the power sector over the past two months.

The Bank Alliance, in collusion with the energy traders affiliated with Ukrainian oligarch Ihor Kolomoisky, stole 14,000 Mavic drones from the state. Courts prevent refund - write Gary Cartwright of EU Today.

During the last few weeks, the judges of the Kyiv Economic Court and the Pivnichny (Northern) Economic Court of Appeal actually froze the chances of Ukrenergo to recover UAH 1.13 billion (26.7 million euros).

This is part of the funds that United Energy, affiliated with Ihor Kolomoisky, at the beginning of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine received from electricity resale without paying to the state.

The firm's debt was to be covered by the guarantor - Bank Alliance.

However, it also refused to fulfil its obligations. The amount equivalent to the cost of 14,000 Mavic drones, 57,000 FPV drones or 7,000 155mm shells for Ukraine's Defence Forces hangs in the air.

At the same time, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU), which investigated the case, is not involved as a party to the court proceedings.

The scheme with the guarantee.

The full-scale war, which has been going on for the third year, does not stop large-scale corruption schemes in Ukraine.

At the beginning of January 2024, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau and the Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office announced the disclosure and completion of the investigation into the stunning deal with the participation of the Ukrenergo state-run power company, the United Energy trading firm and the commercial Bank Alliance, which, at the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, caused losses to the state amounting to over a billion hryvnias.

Despite the fact that all the participants are known and their participation in the scheme is obvious, a number of legal processes related to this criminal case make us assume that the corrupt officials are going to emerge unscathed.

According to the case file, chronologically this story began in the Autumn of 2021.

At this point in time Alliance - a small bank - issued a guarantee to United Energy. This company is affiliated with Ihor Kolomoisky. According to the documents, the bank guarantees payments for the electricity purchased from Ukrenergo.

Nevertheless, the presence of such a document (which confirmed that the bank ""insures"" this client) allowed the company to negotiate and receive electricity in fact on credit. The head of the department of Ukrenergo, who should have stopped such energy supply, taking into account the debts, but did not do so, ignored United Energy's problems.

As a result, Kolomoisky's company resold the energy received from Ukrenergo, withdrawing money to a related company. Taking into account fines, the total debt of this counterparty amounted to UAH 1.7 billion, of which Ukrenergo has already managed to recover only UAH 600 million.

In the NABU case, everything appears simple and clear: the employee of Ukrenergo, the chairman of the bank's board and Kolomoisky's partner Kiperman, who is responsible for United Energy, was put on the wanted list. The detectives indicated that all three persons actually colluded in the deal.

However, a criminal case with such a plot is not yet a court decision. The High Anti-Corruption Court will have to consider this story and pass a fair sentence to the participants.

Ukrenergo timely forwarded a number of the bank's demands for the fulfilment of guarantee obligations for the debts of United Energy. The financial institution fulfilled them only partially.

As part of the economic dispute, the state-owned company is now trying to recover from the guarantor bank the funds due to the state for UAH 1.13 billion, which the company actually borrowed and did not return. However, the bank refuses to be responsible for these debts.

Not a participant in the scheme, but a victim?

A lengthy interview of beneficial owner Oleksandr Sosis appeared on the website of Bank Alliance, where he claimed that the guarantee should have been fulfilled only if all parties followed the rules of the game in the electricity market.

Since Ukrenergo - contrary to internal rules - continued to supply energy to United Energy, the financial institution in this story is a victim of circumstances.

Prior to being put on the wanted list, Yulia Frolova, head of the bank's board, said in a comment to mind.ua that the requirements of Ukrenergo were improperly drafted, that is why they were not subject to satisfaction.

Ukrenergo denied this because the bank still satisfied part of the demands formulated in the same way. In support of such a point of view, the bank even - probably - engaged several ""opinion leaders"" who, in unison with the owner, expressed their opinions on a narrow-profile topic.

""The presumption of the rightness of the beneficiary (Ukrenergo) consists in the fact that provided the beneficiary behaves conscientiously, the very fact of presenting a claim to the guarantor bank indicates that the debtor (United Energy) has not fulfilled the main obligation and that the bank has the obligation to pay the amount of the guarantee,"" Arzinger lawyer Yevhen Diadiuk commented on the issue to mind.ua.

Ukrenergo says that it is ready to cooperate with the NABU to find out what actually happened. The main line of defence is that the responsible employee was working in evacuation conditions, so production processes were partially slowed down.

Therefore, - probably - he had no evil intention in supplying ""free"" energy to United Energy. Kolomoisky's company is the only one that actually does not deny its guilt of participating in the scheme.

In two parallel lawsuits, Bank Alliance defends its right not to pay the debt of Kolomoisky's company.

In December 2022, the Kyiv Economic Court, by ruling in case No. 910/3268/22, obliged the institution to fulfil its guarantee obligations for UAH 1.13 billion, while the bank appealed against this decision.

Court hearings in the Northern Court of Appeal, in violation of all procedural terms, last more than a year.

According to mass media, judges were sick, they were on sick leave, on vacation, disqualified themselves, referring to the media's attention to the case, postponed the court hearing , and not able to make a decision based on the merits.

Ultimately, on April 25, 2024, the judges of the Court of Appeal, namely Hennadiy Korobenko, Karolina Tarasenko and Alla Tyschenko, issued a decision to stop the proceedings.

The reason was another decision made a week before by the Kyiv Economic Court, within which Bank Alliance had already decided to contest the legality of the bank guarantee itself.

In case No. 910/1479/23, judge Rostyslav Stashkiv recognised the guarantee as unenforceable.

So now, Ukrenergo will have to appeal against this decision as well. Until all stages are completed, there will be no return to the suspended proceedings in the main case.

Interestingly, Judge Stashkiv actually investigated the circumstances of the case, which were already investigated by his colleagues in December 2022 and based on which the guarantee was deemed acceptable.

However, he did not want to involve the NABU on the side of Ukrenergo as a victim in this case.

Another detail that the media drew attention to was the size of the court fee determined for Bank Alliance.

Since Judge Stashkiv decided that the subject of the lawsuit was non-property relations between the financial institution and Ukrenergo, the court fee was set at UAH 5,368. In fact, taking into account the amount of liabilities recognised by the court, when filing a lawsuit, the bank had to pay a court fee of at least UAH 1 million.

Such a position of the court regarding the determination of this category of dispute as immaterial generally contradicts the established judicial practice.

All these actions on the part of the bank and the court actually lead to a new circle in this story, gaining time for the participants to delay the payment under the guarantee of Bank Alliance.

On the verge of withdrawal from the market

The National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) responded to the request of the NV. Business publication that it was monitoring the situation concerning Bank Alliance and would take measures if necessary.

The financial institution's failure to fulfil guarantee obligations may raise the question of its withdrawal from the market. After all, the bank's own capital is under UAH 1 billion, therefore the guarantee payment in the amount of UAH 1.13 billion can significantly impact its financial stability.

In parallel with the processes regarding the bank, Ukrenergo is trying to collect funds not only from the financial institution but also directly from United Energy. The next court hearing in this dispute is scheduled for May 8.

Journalists have already drawn attention to the fact that it is rather unusual for a third-tier bank to take on obligations of billions of hryvnias that exceed its financial capabilities. Moreover, even a cursory look at the balance sheet figures shows that Bank Alliance did not have the right to issue guarantees of this size.

As of Sept. 1, 2021, the financial institution had a regulatory capital of UAH 610 million. This means that the guarantee under the contract with United Energy could not exceed UAH 152 million (25 per cent of regulatory capital).

However, taking into account the agreements between the company and the bank, the amount of the guarantee reached almost UAH 1.9 billion. This is 12.5 times more than the regulatory limit.

This should attract the attention of the regulator (the NBU) in the first place. According to the results of the inspection of Bank Alliance in December 2023, it became known that the bank deliberately submitted non-reliable financial statements to the NBU. The question arises again: where is the NBU's position?

Nevertheless, Bank Alliance issued other guarantees (as of September 2023, they exceeded UAH 7 billion) and is involved in a number of court cases related to refusal to satisfy the guarantee requirements of creditors, in particular the Ministry of Defense, the National Health Service of Ukraine, the Gas Transmission System Operator of Ukraine, Naftogaz Trading, and the Ukrainian Sea Ports Authority.

In addition, the bank appears in the materials of criminal proceedings No.  42017000000000445 dated Feb. 17, 2017, which indicates that through the bank in 2017-2018, the management of the regional gas companies of Dmytro Firtash could illegally withdraw funds, which led to a significant increase in the debt to Naftogaz.

Thus, it is obvious that invalidating guarantees in all cases is not the best way to position the financial institution on the market. Unless this is what the business model is all about. But then the National Bank - as well as the NABU - should take a closer look at it to minimise the risks borne by depositors, as well as business that still works with the financial institution.

The lion's share of Naftogaz Group's net consolidated profit, which belongs to the company's shareholders, is expected to be directed to pay dividends to the state.

The financial statements were forwarded to the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine as a shareholder for consideration and approval.

Ukreximbank appoints a new CEO. On May 3, Ukreximbank reported that its supervisory board had elected Viktor Ponomarenko as the new bank's CEO following a competitive selection.

According to Ukreximbank, the selection was carried out with the assistance of the recruitment company Odgers Berndtson. Ponomarenko's candidacy is yet to be approved by National Bank of Ukraine (NBU).

The bank said that Ponomarenko has over 24 years of experience in the banking sector, including 20 years at ProCredit Bank Ukraine, part of the German financial company ProCredit Holding. Ponomarenko has been ProCredit Bank's CEO since 2012.

As we reported in Issue 123, on March 11, Ukreximbank announced the competitive selection of a new CEO. The submission deadline was April 1.

The bank's current CEO is Serhiy Iermakov, who had been an acting CEO from October 2021 to March 2022, when he was promoted to a full-fledged chief executive.

Viktoriya Strakhova, a member of Ukreximbank's supervisory board, then explained that Iermakov would continue to work as the CEO until a new CEO is appointed. See Issue 123 for more detail.

Ireneusz Fafara resigns from Uknafta's supervisory board to head Polish energy concern Orlen. On April 10, Orlen S.A., an energy group and the largest state-owned company in Poland, announced the appointment of Ireneusz Fafara as its new CEO.

On April 11, Ukrnafta's CEO Sergii Koretskyi wrote on his Facebook page that Fafara filed his resignation notice as an independent member of Ukrnafta's supervisory board.

Naftogaz calls on the EU to help protect gas storage from Russian missiles. According to Financial Times (FT), Naftogaz's CEO Oleksiy Chernyshov called on EU countries to help protect Naftogaz's gas storage facilities from a spate of Russian attacks so that these facilities can keep contributing to lower gas prices across the continent.

""It is in the EU's interest to protect storage, transportation, and production facilities, given that Ukraine's gas infrastructure is well integrated in Europe's energy system,"" Chernyshov said.

According to Naftogaz, its gas storage sites in western Ukraine had come under attack several times in recent months, but only ground facilities had been damaged. Underground storages, which may be as deep as 3 kilometres, had remained unaffected, the company added.

""Technologically, we're all fit, we have managed to repair the damaged surface equipment, and we fulfil our obligations to our customers after the attacks,"" Chernyshov said.

According to FT, Ukraine still acts as a transit route for Russian pipeline gas into Europe, and its underground gas storages provided European traders with valuable space to park their excess gas ahead of last winter as sites in the EU reached maximum capacity.

As we reported in Issue 120, European traders earned about $320 million from using Ukraine's underground storages.

According to Naftogaz, foreign traders and energy companies stored 2.5 billion cubic meters of gas in Ukraine in 2023. Naftogaz aims to increase this to 4 billion cubic meters in 2024.

Naftogaz said that Ukraine offered foreign customers up to 10 billion cubic meters of storage capacity this year, a third of Ukraine's total underground capacity.

Foreign traders transported over 60 million cubic meters of gas to Ukraine in January-February 2024 (see Issue 123).

As we wrote in Issue 126, Ukrtransgaz reported the end of the 2023/2024 heating season and the start of a new season of gas injection into underground storage on 2 April.

As we reported in Issue 129, on 27 April 2024, Russian forces attacked a gas infrastructure facility in the western region of Ukraine. Naftogaz said that no one was injured, and the attack did not affect customer utility access.

Ukrposhta loses Hr 800 million in 2023 (audited). On April 26, Ukrposhta reported its financial results for 2023.

According to a release, Ukrposhta ended 2023 with a loss of Hr 796 million ($20 million). Compared to 2022, the company's net loss decreased by almost 37%, the company added.

Among the significant factors that negatively affected the company's financial performance were delays in approving the regulated tariffs and fulfilling of free-of-charge obligations to support the government's social initiatives, Ukrposhta explained.

The company ended 2023 with a net income of Hr 11.6 billion ($295 million), which is 12% more than the 2022 net income (Hr 10.3 billion, or $262 million). The data was confirmed by an international auditor, Ukrposhta stated.

In 2023, the company continued to implement strategic investment projects, such as upgrading its logistics infrastructure, automating the network, strengthening its resilience to energy and communication disruptions, modernizing its vehicle fleet, and renewing critical IT systems, Ukrposhta also said.

As we reported in Issue 85, Ukrposhta ended 2022 with a loss of Hr 1.258 billion ($32 million). That year, the company had a net revenue of Hr 10.3 billion ($262 million) from sales of goods and services, 7.7% down from 2021. See Issue 85 for more detail.

SPFU takes over 49% of Shell petrol station chain in Ukraine, previously owned by sanctioned Khudainatov. On April 19, the State Property Fund of Ukraine (SPFU) reported that it obtained control over 49% of the chain of Shell petrol stations in Ukraine.

""This is the sanctioned property of Eduard Khudainatov, who owned 49% of Alliance Holding LLC. The company operates a Ukrainian chain of petrol stations under the Shell brand. (The SPFU also acquired control over) 100% of the share capital of Alliance-Ukraine Oil Company LLC, which owns an oil depot and real estate.

Eduard Khudainatov, a former top manager of the Russian state-owned company Rosneft, owns Independent Oil and Gas Company. In June 2022, he was sanctioned by the European Union, and in October 2022, by Ukraine,"" the SPFU explained.

According to Forbes Ukraine, before Russia's full-scale invasion, Shell had 131 petrol stations in Ukraine, of which 118 operate now.

The proceeds from the sale of the sanctioned property would be used to fund the liquidation of the consequences of Russia's armed aggression, the SPFU added.

On Oct. 4, 2023, the Justice Ministry filed a lawsuit with the High Anti-Corruption Court (HACC) to seize Khudainatov's assets, which included Alliance Holding LLC.

In January 2024, the HACC refused to seize a stake in Alliance Holding LLC. The reason was that Shell had increased its stake in the Ukrainian subsidiary after the full-scale invasion to 97.4% via two recapitalisations. The share of the company, which the Justice Ministry associates with Khudainatov, was diluted to 2.6%.

The Justice Ministry appealed, and on April 2, the Appeals Chamber of the HACC allowed the nationalization of a 49% stake in Alliance Holding LLC.

According to Forbes Ukraine, the court agreed with the ministry's argument that Shell had diluted Khudainatov's stake after he was sanctioned. ""There has been a violation of Ukraine's public order and a dilution of the sanctioned person's share bypassing the sanctions,"" the media's source said.

Shell then said that Ukraine's ""unjustified appropriation of (the company's) foreign investments and assets is contrary to international law protecting international investors."" The company would do everything it could to protect its employees, assets, investments, and reputation, Shell added.

On April 29, the SPFU said that it was going to put the 49% stake in the Shell chain up for an open auction after the asset seizure is lifted and the starting price is set. The Fund does not plan to offer this stake exclusively to Shell: The greater the competition for the asset, the greater the benefit to the state budget, the SPFU believes. The Fund was not yet prepared to say when the auction would take place.",kyivindependent.com,news,The Kyiv Independent,,0.07450980392156858,452798381,59,https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/GettyImages-1235727957.jpg,

During the last few weeks, the judges of the Kyiv Economic Court and the Pivnichny (Northern) Economic Court of Appeal actually froze the chances of Ukrenergo to recover UAH 1.13 billion. This is part of the funds that United Energy, affiliated with Ihor Kolomoisky, at the beginning of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine received from electricity resale without paying to the state. The firm's debt was to be covered by the guarantor - Bank Alliance. However, it also refused to fulfill its obligations. The amount equivalent to the cost of 14,000 Mavic drones, 57,000 FPV drones or 7,000 155mm shells for the Defense Forces hung in the air. At the same time, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU), which investigated the case, is not involved as a party to the court proceedings.

The scheme with the guarantee

The full-scale war, which has been going on for the third year, does not stop large-scale corruption schemes in Ukraine. At the beginning of January 2024, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau and the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office announced the disclosure and completion of the investigation into the stunning deal with the participation of the Ukrenergo state-run power company, the United Energy trading firm and the commercial Bank Alliance, which, at the start of the full scale invasion of Ukraine, caused losses to the state amounting to over a billion hryvnias. Despite the fact that all the participants are known and their participation in the scheme is obvious, a number of legal processes related to this criminal case make us assume that the corrupt officials are going to emerge unscathed.

According to the case file, chronologically this story began in the fall of 2021. Then Alliance - a small bank - issued a guarantee to United Energy. This company is affiliated with Ihor Kolomoisky. According to the documents, the bank guarantees payments for the electricity purchased from Ukrenergo.

Nevertheless, the presence of such a document (which confirmed that the bank ""insures"" this client) allowed the company to negotiate and receive electricity in fact on credit. The head of the department of Ukrenergo, who should have stopped such energy supply, taking into account the debts, but did not do so, ignored United Energy's problems. As a result, Kolomoisky's company resold the energy received from Ukrenergo, withdrawing money to a related company. Taking into account fines, the total debt of this counterparty amounted to UAH 1.7 billion, of which Ukrenergo has already managed to recover UAH 600 million.

In the NABU case, everything is simple and clear: the employee of Ukrenergo, the chairman of the bank's board and Kolomoisky's partner Kiperman, who is responsible for United Energy, were put on the wanted list. The detectives indicated that all three persons actually colluded in the deal.

However, a criminal case with such a plot is not yet a court decision. The High Anti-Corruption Court will have to consider this story and pass a fair sentence to the participants.

Ukrenergo timely forwarded a number of the bank's demands for the fulfillment of guarantee obligations for the debts of United Energy. The financial institution fulfilled them partially. As part of the economic dispute, the state-owned company is now trying to recover from the guarantor bank the funds due to the state for UAH 1.13 billion, which the company actually borrowed and did not return. However, the bank refuses to be responsible for these debts.

Not a participant in the scheme, but a victim?

A lengthy interview of beneficial owner Oleksandr Sosis appeared on the website of Bank Alliance, where he claims that the guarantee should have been fulfilled only if all parties followed the rules of the game in the electricity market. Since Ukrenergo - contrary to internal rules - continued to supply energy to United Energy, the financial institution in this story is a victim of circumstances. Prior to being put on the wanted list, Yulia Frolova, head of the bank's board, said in a comment to mind.ua that the requirements of Ukrenergo were improperly drafted, that's why they were not subject to satisfaction. Ukrenergo denied this, because the bank still satisfied part of the demands formulated in the same way. In support of such a point of view, the bank even - probably - engaged several ""opinion leaders"" who, in unison with the owner, expressed their opinions on a narrow-profile topic.

""The presumption of rightness of the beneficiary (Ukrenergo) consists in the fact that, provided the beneficiary behaves conscientiously, the very fact of presenting a claim to the guarantor bank indicates that the debtor (United Energy) has not fulfilled the main obligation and that the bank has the obligation to pay the amount of the guarantee,"" Arzinger lawyer Yevhen Diadiuk commented on the issue to mind.ua.

Ukrenergo says that it is ready to cooperate with the NABU to find out what actually happened. The main line of defense is that the responsible employee was working in evacuation conditions, so production processes were partially slowed down. Therefore, - probably - he had no evil intention in supplying ""free"" energy to United Energy. Kolomoisky's company is the only one that actually does not deny its guilt of participating in the scheme.

In two parallel lawsuits, Bank Alliance defends its right not to pay the debt of Kolomoisky's company. In December 2022, the Kyiv Economic Court, by ruling in case No. 910/3268/22, obliged the institution to fulfill its guarantee obligations for UAH 1.13 billion, while the bank appealed against this decision. Court hearings in the Northern Court of Appeal, in violation of all procedural terms, last more than a year. According to mass media, judges were sick, they were on sick leave, on vacation, recused themselves, referring to the media's attention to the case, postponed the court hearing, not being able to make a decision on the merits.

Ultimately, on April 25, 2024, the judges of the Court of Appeal, namely Hennadiy Korobenko, Karolina Tarasenko and Alla Tyschenko, issued a decision to stop the proceedings. The reason was another decision made a week before by the Kyiv Economic Court, within which Bank Alliance has already decided to contest the legality of the bank guarantee itself. In case No. 910/1479/23, judge Rostyslav Stashkiv recognized the guarantee as unenforceable. So now, Ukrenergo will have to appeal against this decision as well. Until all stages are completed, there will be no return to the suspended proceedings in the main case. Interestingly, judge Stashkiv actually investigated the circumstances of the case, which were already investigated by his colleagues in December 2022 and based on which the guarantee was deemed acceptable. However, he did not want to involve the NABU on the side of Ukrenergo as a victim in this case.

Another detail that the media drew attention to was the size of the court fee determined for Bank Alliance. Since judge Stashkiv decided that the subject of the lawsuit was non-property relations between the financial institution and Ukrenergo, the court fee was set at UAH 5,368. In fact, taking into account the amount of liabilities recognized by the court, when filing a lawsuit, the bank had to pay a court fee of at least UAH 1 million. Such a position of the court regarding the determination of this category of dispute as immaterial generally contradicts the established judicial practice.

All these actions on the part of the bank and the court actually lead to a new circle in this story, gaining time for the participants to delay the payment under the guarantee of Bank Alliance.

On the verge of withdrawal from the market

The National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) responded to the request of the NV.Business publication that it was monitoring the situation concerning Bank Alliance and would take measures if necessary. The financial institution's failure to fulfill guarantee obligations may raise the question of its withdrawal from the market. After all, the bank's own capital is under UAH 1 billion, therefore the guarantee payment in the amount of UAH 1.13 billion can significantly impact its financial stability. In parallel with the processes regarding the bank, Ukrenergo is trying to collect funds not only from the financial institution, but also directly from United Energy. The next court in this dispute is scheduled for May 8.

Journalists have already drawn attention to the fact that it is rather unusual for a third-tier bank to take on obligations of billions of hryvnias that exceed its financial capabilities. Moreover, even a cursory look at the balance sheet figures shows that Bank Alliance did not have the right to issue guarantees of this size. As of Sept. 1, 2021, the financial institution had regulatory capital of UAH 610 million. This means that the guarantee under the contract with United Energy could not exceed UAH 152 million (25 percent of regulatory capital). However, taking into account the agreements between the company and the bank, the amount of the guarantee reached almost UAH 1.9 billion. This is 12.5 times more than the regulatory limit. This should attract the attention of the regulator (the NBU) in the first place. According to the results of the inspection of Bank Alliance in December 2023, it became known that the bank deliberately submitted non-reliable financial statements to the NBU. The question arises again: where is the NBU's position?

Nevertheless, Bank Alliance issued other guarantees (as of September 2023, they exceeded UAH 7 billion) and is involved in a number of court cases related to refusal to satisfy the guarantee requirements of creditors, in particular the Ministry of Defense, the National Health Service of Ukraine, the Gas Transmission System Operator of Ukraine, Naftogaz Trading, and the Ukrainian Sea Ports Authority. In addition, the bank appears in the materials of criminal proceedings No.  42017000000000445 dated Feb. 17, 2017, which indicate that through the bank in 2017-2018, the management of the regional gas companies of Dmytro Firtash could illegally withdraw funds, which led to a significant increase in the debt to Naftogaz.

Thus, it is obvious that invalidating guarantees in all cases is not the best way to position the financial institution on the market. Unless this is what the business model is all about. But then the National Bank - as well as the NABU - should take a closer look at it to minimize the risks borne by depositors, as well as business that still works with the financial institution.",kyivpost.com,news,KyivPost,,0.1215686274509804,452766807,9,https://static.kyivpost.com/storage/2024/05/06/219043e6191ec32a2177c345ae044b35.webp?w=630&q=90&f=jpg,

Marc Champion, in a piece for Bloomberg, underscores Netanyahu's current legal battles against corruption charges, suggesting the inherent challenges in investigating and prosecuting sitting national leaders. Furthermore, Champion notes that Netanyahu faces impending political repercussions due to security lapses on October 7th, once the Gaza conflict concludes.

Champion posits that amidst the national fervor for security, Netanyahu is maneuvering to safeguard his political tenure. While Champion and others speculate on Netanyahu's incentives, it's apparent that personal, private, and commercial interests can influence foreign policy decisions, a phenomenon particularly pronounced in Ukraine.

By October 2023, both the European Union (EU) and the United States had pledged substantial financial support to Ukraine, surpassing $160 billion, including significant arms sales, some of which illicitly entered black markets. The appointment of Amos Hochstein as the US Senior Advisor for Energy Security underlines US efforts to mitigate risks associated with projects like Nord Stream 2. Today, amidst diverse engagements, Hochstein is involved in advocating for Saudi-Israel normalization.

A scrutiny of past events reveals intertwining American geopolitical and geoeconomic interests, notably in promoting its liquefied natural gas to Europe. These interests intersect with private endeavors, embroiling figures like Biden and Hochstein, the latter having ties to Ukraine's Naftogaz. Additionally, revelations have emerged regarding questionable dealings involving Ukrainian entities like Dragon Capital and American counterparts such as BlackRock, with implications extending to the Democrat Party and the Bidens.

The nexus of these events implicates Hunter Biden, the president's son, in various controversies ranging from personal scandals to geopolitical allegations, some of which have been politicized by opposing factions, perpetuating scrutiny on the current administration.

In August 2021, a member of the Ukrainian Parliament unveiled allegations of corruption within Naftogaz, accompanied by purported leaked audio recordings implicating then-US Vice President Biden in a clandestine agreement with Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko. The deal supposedly involved a billion-dollar offer to dismiss Ukrainian Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin, who was probing the business dealings of Biden's son in the country.

Drawing parallels to Marc Champion's analysis of Netanyahu's motivations, it's not unreasonable to apply similar scrutiny to the Biden administration. The Bidens have vested interests, both personal and commercial, in the perpetuation of conflict in Ukraine, a situation that also benefits American arms manufacturers.

Delving deeper, the personal stakes for Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky become apparent. Reports from June 2022 revealed significant losses of weapons and equipment, with a substantial portion diverted to criminal and terrorist groups, exploiting Ukraine's historical role as an arms trafficking hub.

Furthermore, Ukraine's challenges extend beyond arms trafficking, encompassing issues like drug smuggling and a concerning rise in far-right extremism since 2014. Zelensky himself faces personal risks, as indicated by threats from ultra-nationalist elements within Ukraine, warning of dire consequences if he pursues peace negotiations in Donbass.

Zelensky's motivations are multifaceted, including concerns for his own safety. According to Seymour Hersh, European leaders have pressured Zelensky to broker a peace deal, dangling promises of financial incentives to secure an agreement.

In this context, Washington's aid to Kyiv raises questions of corruption, intertwined with leaders on both sides of the Atlantic seeking to safeguard personal interests. While geopolitical considerations, such as NATO expansion, are undoubtedly influential, personal and electoral factors also warrant attention when analyzing protracted conflicts.

In conclusion, understanding the dynamics of seemingly intractable conflicts requires a nuanced examination of various factors, including personal motivations of key actors, alongside broader geopolitical interests. Analysts and journalists alike must consider these complexities to gain insight into the underlying dynamics driving such conflicts.",tfiglobalnews.com,news,TFIGlobal,Atul Kumar Mishra,0.4509803921568627,452762301,9,https://tfiglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/gettyimages-1850412065-6b755c7d5c926cabf0f760b3f8e51ec4c4407ce5.jpg,
