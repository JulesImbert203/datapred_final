MOSCOW, May 18. /TASS/. The volume of Russian gas supplies to Europe through Ukraine is 42.4 mln cubic meters per day, a Gazprom spokesman told reporters.

""Gazprom continues to supply Russian gas for transit through Ukrainian territory via the Sudzha gas pumping station in an amount approved by Ukraine. The volume is 42.4 mln cubic meters for May 18. A request for transit via the Sokhranovka gas pumping station was rejected,"" he said.

The volume also stood at 42.4 mln cubic meters on May 17.

The transit line through Ukraine remains the only route for Russian gas supplies to western and central European countries. Pumping through the Nord Stream pipeline was completely suspended. Gas supplies via Turkish Stream and Blue Stream are intended for Turkey and southern and southeastern European countries.

In May 2022, the Gas Transmission System Operator of Ukraine said it would suspend the flow of gas to Europe via the Sokhranovka transit point due to force majeure as the company allegedly was unable to control the Novopskov gas compressor station in the Lugansk People's Republic. However, the Russian gas giant did not see any proof of force majeure.

In the fall of 2022, Ukraine's Naftogaz company filed a petition for arbitration with the International Arbitration Court against Gazprom for allegedly being late with its payment for gas transportation services through Ukraine. Gazprom CEO Alexey Miller stated that the Russian company considered Naftogaz's arbitration to be illegitimate. Meanwhile, Russia may impose sanctions against Naftogaz in the event of further unfair actions by the Ukrainian company and any relations with Naftogaz will be impossible.",tass.com,news,TASS,,-0.0117647058823529,453722928,1,https://tass.com/img/blocks/common/tass_logo_share_ru.png,

May 13 (Interfax) - The European gas market has replaced most of the Russian gas it used to receive with U.S. liquefied natural gas, but Europe has also been saved by extraordinarily mild winters, lower gas consumption by industry and increased use of renewable energy. However, European gas analysts believe the crisis is now over, and, faced by reduced supply flexibility and a recovery in consumption, infrastructure constraints and competition from Asia for LNG, as well as uncertainty over the continued transit of Russian gas through Ukraine, every cubic meter of gas could count in the event of a cold winter.

Cara MacDonald, head of LNG & Clean-Fuel Supply and Origination at RWE AG, said at the Flame gas conference at the end of April that Europe had been able to withstand the past two heating seasons thanks to mild weather and a demand side response. ""Europe had much milder weather, especially in the winter of 2022-2023, which cooled consumption and allowed storage to fill up. Additionally, due to high gas prices, we have seen demand destruction in Europe, while in Asia, this meant more fuel switching,"" she said.

""But is the crisis over? Things could change in the coming winters, especially if there is no flexibility in LNG supplies. The only answer may be continued demand side response,"" MacDonald said, although she believes this might not save the situation.

""Yes, we coped by reducing demand, but can we do it again? When I look at demand side signals, I see that the market will become tighter,"" she said, adding that there was limited supply flexibility and any incident at an LNG plant could tighten the balance.

Glenn Vinvand Kviljo, head of trading at Equinor, also said the European market faced uncertainty in the coming winter after two mild winters: ""Will there be another mild winter, or we will get back to the normal, cold winter? We cannot sit back and relax,"" he said.

Chief analyst at Uniper Energy, Gregor Pett, warned that despite the fact that the market has been more bearish in recent weeks and months, this was mainly associated with a weak economy, air temperatures, high storage and others. ""But for most market participants, this is a fragile balance, and at any time the situation can turn around [...] and there could be a repeat of the crisis. It's not over, it's far from over,"" he said.

""It is difficult to foresee what will happen in terms of supply and demand. It depends on many things, including the weather. We can have a very mild winter, so gas demand in Europe will be low. If it's an extremely cold winter the demand will be higher than in the past two years and a lower supply could be a problem,"" a representative of a European gas trader told Interfax in an interview.

""If there was an outage of the production from Norway or hurricanes in the U.S. - there are many events which can happen and which can bring to a very tight situation in Europe where each Bcm of supply is important,"" the trader said, adding that a very hot summer could also cause demand to spike.

He said that current gas prices in Europe include a risk premium since all these factors were difficult to predict. ""And each player has an own opinion if prices are fair or not. Currently the market is pricing in, I would say, a normal cold winter, but the winter can be different,"" the trader said.

Europe has reduced gas consumption by about 20% over the past two years to approximately 330 billion cubic meters due to high gas prices (27 EU countries), as well as the energy transition drive, while some industrial demand for gas has been lost forever, some participants believe. However, there are signs of demand recovering.

Cheniere Energy said in a presentation that gas consumption in Europe was now below the 2017-2021 average. It fell 19% in the region's six biggest economies, with consumption in industry down 22% (between 18% and 23%), in energy - 14% (between 8% and 25%), in other sectors - 21% (between 17% and 28%).

Uniper Energy's Pett said Europe has lost a very large amount of industrial production due to high prices, but ""we expect a lot of industrial demand to return to the market."" However, most gas analysts were unable to say to what extent demand might return.

Gautam Mukherjee, head of gas analytics at BP, said it was necessary to look at sectors. For example, in industry, gas is being replaced by heat pumps; in the energy sector, on the one hand, there is more renewable energy, but on the other hand, coal is being replaced. Overall, he said, Europe has had very weak economic results over the past two years, so not only has demand for gas fallen, but demand for electricity has also been very low. And Europe's economy is expected to recover in the coming years, so demand for gas in both the power industry and other industry will increase.

Uniper Energy's Pett said the difference in consumption in a mild and normal winter for northwestern Europe was 30 billion cubic meters, and last winter was ""extraordinarily mild.""

Given the demand and uncertainty over the weather, gas market participants are concerned about whether the contract for Russian gas transit through Ukraine will be extended, and if not, whether LNG can replace it. Europe has lost over 100 billion cubic meters of pipeline gas supplies from Russia over the past two years, but supplies through Ukraine and TurkStream continue to some extent.

Andrei Prokofiev, head of Division for Cooperation with Clients at Gas Transmission System Operator of Ukraine (GTSOU), said that both the transit deal and the agreement between Gazprom and GTSOU would expire at the end of the year. ""As the Ukrainian authorities and European Commission have said many times, Ukraine is not going to negotiate with Russia on this matter - no direct agreements. What does this mean from a practical point of view? Not having an agreement between operators means we'll not be putting any capacity up for at auction,"" he said.

""This is like the situation on our border with Romania, where we have interconnectors - Tekovo, Mediesu Aurit. ""There is infrastructure, a tariff, but we cannot come to an agreement with the Romanian TSO due to technical problems. And neither we nor Romania are offering capacity,"" Prokofiev said.

Last year, Europe bought about 135 bcm of LNG, almost half of it from the United States. However, industry participants say that there will be a limited supply of LNG on the market in 2024-2026. Marco Saalfrank, head of trading for continental Europe at Axpo, estimates that the market will be tight in Europe in 2026-2027 because Europe will need to pay high prices to attract LNG. In addition, there will be high volatility in the market because Europe has lost its flexibility (for supply), he said.

There is an opinion that higher gas prices for Europe will become a new reality. Andrew Walker of Cheniere Marketing said that Europe, as the largest market for US LNG exports, has not traditionally been tied to spot prices in Asia, where the market is tight, as it relies on pipeline supplies. However, now Europe is more tied to Asian prices. ""So now this is a bit of a new reality for Europe, so Europe will probably have to get used to higher prices,"" he said.

Patrick Dugas, head of LNG trading at TotalEnergies, said that before the conflict in Ukraine, Europe was a balancing market where any cargo could find a home. However, then the paradigm changed, and Europe became a premium market like Asia. ""I think in the coming months and years we will see competition for LNG between the two basins, European and Asian,"" he said.

Dugas also said that the European market has become characterized by volatility and uncertainty. ""Every time there is a supply problem, it creates volatility in the market [...] and to solve these two problems, we need flexibility,"" he said.

The TotalEnergies trader said not to forget about the recovery in China, which imported 20 million tonnes of LNG in the first quarter, which is 4 million tonnes more than the previous year. ""So recovery in demand in China and possibly Europe will be the two main themes in the market over the next few years,"" he said.

""There really is a maximum amount of LNG on the market now. And if there is no increase in supply with growing demand in Asia, Europe will not be able to fill the balance with liquefied natural gas,"" a spokesperson from RWE said.

However, LNG sellers need assurances that their products will be in demand in the long term. Landon Larson, marketing director for American LNG producer Sempra Infrastructure, said that European companies are now buying LNG, but Europe has announced decarbonization goals, and this puts pressure on investment decisions for the second wave of LNG projects, raising questions about whether or not the projects will be able to sell their LNG, and about their financial sustainability. At the same time, many believe that Europe has set unrealistic goals for its energy transition, at least where timing is concerned.

Meanwhile, the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden has already suspended the issuance of new licenses for LNG exports, intending to assess the extent to which Europe is focused on LNG purchases, or if it will still move away from using fossil fuels.

Axpo's Saalfrank said that there are risks in signing long-term contracts. Therefore, Europe is going to reduce gas consumption; in addition, one cannot exclude ""the risk that Russian gas will return to the European market in 10-20 years,"" he said.

Another risk relates to price: gas purchases tied to oil or linked to Henry Hub spot pricing is sold at a TTF price in Europe, so such price risks are not easily hedged in long-term contracts. In addition, the trader said, there is a regulatory risk (on carbon regulation). ""So, 3-4 years ago, Ireland and France refused to buy American LNG because it is produced in shale deposits,"" he said.

Nicola Duffin, head of LNG supply at Ineos Energy Trading, said that Ineos had the advantage of being a private company and is not under pressure from shareholders to divest from fossil fuels. ""We are realistic and understand that we will need gas for the next 20 years. Other companies may agree with this, but they are not allowed to,"" she noted. In order to enter into a long-term agreement for the purchase of LNG, you need to be ""relatively large and have a huge amount of money,"" Duffin said. It is difficult for small companies to operate in the LNG market.

Gulfstream LNG CEO Vivek Chandra said that traders help grow the LNG business by becoming intermediaries, for example, with countries like Sri Lanka that cannot enter into long-term contracts. Asia, especially China and India, are much more active in purchasing LNG, as they consider it a transition fuel, he said. In addition, we should not forget about the Middle East; for example, Kuwait has become an active buyer, as well as African countries.

But infrastructure is no less of a risk. Laurent Hamou of Gas Infrastructure Europe (GIE) said the gas infrastructure utilization in Europe has been at record levels over the past two years and this means that ""in the coming years we cannot afford any disruptions. Any problem will be very noticeable, and we have a limited number of suppliers and less flexibility.""

""Everyone says that everything is fine - there's spare capacity at LNG terminals in Europe. But I believe that, on the contrary, we need to increase capacity and give the market more flexibility. Let's see what happens in the next two years. Our contract for gas through Ukraine might come to an end, there might be some recovery in demand, and I'm sure we'll need more LNG terminals,"" he said.

Hamou said there was a regional discrepancy in Europe in this regard - for example, Spanish terminals were operating at normal levels, while infrastructure in south-eastern Europe, for example, the terminal in Greece, as well as infrastructure in Germany, were operating at a totally unusual level.

Halting gas transit through Ukraine will result in even bigger restrictions, but we need to think about all European consumers. ""If French consumers paid the German price for gas like in 2022, they would be paying 5 billion euros more. This is a lot of money. You need geographical flexibility, time flexibility and supply flexibility. Any accident will affect prices,"" Hamou said.

Hungary is heavily reliant on Ukrainian transit. ""Yes, some new infrastructure is being built, but it is not yet clear how it will work. There is a lot of infrastructure in the north and south, but gas needs to be delivered to the center,"" he said.

Thomas Thorkildsen, chief commercial officer at Hoegh LNG, in his presentation cited the degree of exposure of some European countries to Russian gas. Croatia gets 81% of its gas from Russia (1.4 bcm), Austria - 75% (5.6 bcm), Hungary - 62% (6.2 bcm), Slovakia - 57% (2.4 bcm), Serbia - 61% (2.1 bcm) Greece - 39% (2 bcm) and the Czech Republic - 35% (2.6 bcm).

Half of this gas enters the EU through Ukraine, the transit agreement ends at the end of 2024, and this must be borne in mind, he said.

A trader at Hungary's MVM CEEnergy told Interfax that the company was now buying 10-11 LNG cargoes, equivalent to 1 bcm of gas, at the Krk terminal in Croatia. The capacity booking contract is valid until 2027, and the company plans to bid at auctions for new capacity. But any increase in purchases will depend how LNG competes with pipeline supplies. Hungary is also counting on potentially higher production within the EU, in particular the Neptun project offshore Romania, which ExxonMobil could put on line in 2026-2027.

But the MVM CEEnergy trader said that although there is enough regasification capacity, pipeline tariffs across Europe might be too high to justify buying LNG.

GTSOU's Prokofiev echoed this. He said European markets were highly segmented and it was difficult to transport LNG from Greece to Slovakia, Austria or Germany. The issue of capacity can be resolved, for example, there is capacity in Ukraine. ""But due to the tariff policies of some countries, this sometimes does not make economic sense. For example, the cost of storage in Germany, likewise in Austria, the anticipated increase in tariffs in Slovakia, make the problem more difficult. And this needs to be resolved, at least at the government level,"" he said, adding that since everyone protected their own market, perhaps a decision at the level of the European Commission is needed.

Prokofiev also said that last year about 2.5 billion cubic meters of gas were pumped into Ukrainian underground gas storage facilities by non-residents and another 0.6-0.7 bcm remained there. At the same time, the capacity of Ukrainian underground gas storage facilities is more than 10 bcm, which could cover a potential interruption of gas supplies to Europe.

Market participants believe that even more LNG terminals need to be built. Ineos Energy Trading's Duffin said Europe needed a huge amount of imported capacity by 2028. She said Northwestern Europe, under normal weather conditions, would have to import an additional 46 bcm of gas as LNG - demand is growing due to the switch from coal to gas, and internal production is falling.

But demand might also fall, so it might make more sense to use floating storage regasification units. But Duffin said it should be remembered that FSRUs are more expensive, do not last forever and they do not have operational flexibility. ""So if governments put an end to subsidies and companies stop paying, they will go to other countries where they are needed more quickly. And I see that in Europe people soon forgot about this and are perhaps not taking it as seriously as they should,"" she said.

Hoegh LNG's Thorkildsen said the company currently owned 10 FSRUs, and a further three LNG tankers that can be converted into FSRUs, which usually takes up to 18 months, but there have been precedents where this happened within five months. He said a new FSRU costs about $500 million and that all shipyards were now booked until 2028.

Hoegh LNG estimates that in 2022 the order for new LNG vessels broke all records and amounted to 145 units, with 68 in 2023 and 44 tankers in 2024. At the same time, 10 gas carriers have already been built in 2024, another 60 are expected, with plans to build 86 tankers in 2025, 84 in 2026, 73 in 2027 and 26 in 2028.The LNG fleet is currently about 600 tankers, excluding FSRUs, which are mainly used as terminals.

The company's FSRUs operate under long-term contracts - half of them in Europe (three in Germany and one in each of France and Lithuania). But Thorkildsen said China was the only market that plans to increase regasification capacity to 200 bcm from the current 100 bcm. Other growing markets, such as Italy, Malaysia, Germany, India, Indonesia, Thailand and Bangladesh, where LNG demand is forecast to grow, are not making decisions to build regasification facilities.

He said Germany was the exception among European countries. But given the announced growth in imports and planned commissioning of regasification capacities, their utilization will reach 63% in 2025-2028 and 82% by 2029, which corresponds to the situation with capacity utilization in north-west Europe in 2022, when there was chaos and high prices. Utilization of LNG terminals in Germany will exceed 90% after 2030, reaching 95% in 2033.

In Italy it is even worse - utilization of its regasification capacity will reach 94% in 2024, and this will no longer be enough from 2027, given the planned import of LNG. ""This doesn't look like energy security,"" Thorkildsen said.

According to Hoegh LNG, 40% of gas consumed in Europe in 2024 will be LNG - about 175 bcm of approximately 420 bcm consumed, while 119 bcm will be supplied by gas pipelines from Norway, 22 bcm by the gas pipeline from Russia, and 67 bcm will be produced in the EU and the UK.

A drop in Russian gas supplies is expected after 2024 as the transit contract with Ukraine expire; supplies from North Africa and Azerbaijan will remain largely at the same level; imports from Norway will decrease from 108 bcm in 2029 to 81 bcm in 2034 and 58 bcm in 2039; and Europe's own production will decrease to 60 bcm.

LNG supplies are expected to increase initially to 203 bcm in 2029, accounting for half of consumption, but as consumption falls to approximately 330 bcm in 2039, LNG purchases will also fall, to 157 bcm, Hoegh LNG says in its presentation.

The European Union is currently discussing a ban on imports of Russian LNG. Last year, Europe purchased about 18 bcm of LNG from Russia, with about 1 bcm of this redirected to Asian markets.

However, market participants believe European politicians will most likely postpone the embargo until 2027, when new LNG projects go on line for world markets.",interfax.com,news,interfax.com,,-0.1058823529411764,453481330,1,,eng-9563546

The Kyiv Independent is reposting it with permission.

Cabinet appoints new acting CEO for Ukrspyrt. On May 3, Stanislav Banchuk was appointed to the position. On May 6, Ukrspyrt confirmed Banchuk's appointment, with no further details.

Banchuk previously had a legal practice in Kyiv. A person by that name was deputy regional prosecutor of Chernivtsi Oblast until 2014 according to Ekonomichna Pravda (EP).

According to YouControl, Banchuk founded Standart Law Firm LLC, Gaztekhkom LLC, Novitni Energetychni Systemy LLC, P.E.G.O. Trading House, Voga Resources LLC, and SpetsOil LLC, which specialize in oil and gas trading.

On March 1, Vitaliy Koval, head of the State Property Fund of Ukraine (SPFU), wrote that the privatization of distilleries was in the home stretch, with the fund planning to privatize 17 more Ukrspyrt facilities in 2024.

According to Koval, the SPFU had run 115 online auctions of Ukrspyrt assets and 54 auctions had resulted in sales. The sum of prices went from Hr 1.25 billion ($31.5 million) to Hr 3.01 billion ($75.9 million) during the auctions.

As we wrote in January 2022 in Issue 63, acting CEO of Ukrspyrt Serhiy Bleskun resigned. After that, the Cabinet of Ministers temporarily assigned Vitaliy Zhadobin as the new acting CEO.

On Nov. 11, 2022, the Cabinet appointed Ivan Kucherenko as Ukrspyrt's new acting CEO.

Ukrspyrt last had a permanent CEO in 2014, and the company has since been led by various ""acting"" CEOs.

Detention order issued for SPFU's former head who allegedly embezzled millions. On May 8, the High Anti-Corruption Court (HACC) ordered detention for the former head of the SPFU, Dmytro Sennychenko, who is wanted internationally.

According to the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office (SAPO), Sennychenko headed a criminal group that embezzled more than Hr 500 million ($12.6 million) from state-owned enterprises, including Odesa Portside Plant (OPZ) and United Mining and Chemical Company (UMCC), and laundered Hr 10 billion ($252 million) in 2019-2021.

As we reported in Issue 80, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) and SAPO said that they exposed a criminal group run by Sennychenko in March 2023. See Issue 80 for more detail.

Sennychenko headed the SPFU from September 2019 to February 2022. He filed his resignation letter in November 2021, but the Verkhovna Rada only approved his resignation on Feb. 17, 2022.

As we wrote in Issue 83, the suspects in this case, including Sennychenko, were placed on the wanted list in April 2023.

In November 2023, we wrote that NABU and SAPO updated suspicions against all members of the criminal group allegedly led by Sennychenko. They are now also suspected of legalizing criminal proceeds of over Hr 10 billion ($252 million).

See our Issues 80, 83, and 114 for more detail on this case.

Ukrainian energy facilities struck again. On May 8, the Energy Ministry reported that Russia damaged Ukraine's energy infrastructure, including transmission facilities in Poltava, Kirovohrad, Zaporizhzhia, Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk, and Vinnytsia oblasts.

There were no casualties or injuries. Power engineers worked together with the State Emergency Service to eliminate the consequences, the ministry added.

In addition to damage to generation infrastructure, equipment at one of Ukrenergo's facilities in central Ukraine was also damaged, the company said.

Due to the power shortages caused by the massive attack, Ukrenergo was forced to impose restrictions on power supply to industry and businesses during evening peak hours.

Ukrenergo also imports electricity from Romania, Slovakia, Poland, Hungary, and Moldova, but according to the company's CEO Volodymyr Kudrytskyi, this is not enough to cover the deficit.

Rinat Akhmetov's DTEK, Ukraine's largest private energy holding, reported that Russia attacked three of its thermal power plants again, severely damaging equipment.

On May 9, Ukrhydroenergo reported that two hydroelectric power plants (HPPs) were out of operation due to the attack. [The company has a total of ten HPPs.

""Today, all hydroelectric power generation has suffered crucial damages. The destroyed equipment requires considerable efforts to repair and restore and significant financial resources,"" the company said.

On June 6, Ukrhydroenergo reported that the Kakhovka HPP was destroyed beyond restoration after the Russians set off a massive explosion in the engine room. See our Issue 91 for more detail.

Russian missiles attacked Ukraine's largest HPP, the Dnipro HPP in Zaporizhzhia, on March 22. See Issue 124 for more detail.

During another missile attack, on March 29, the Kaniv and Dniester HPPs were deliberately targeted by Russian forces. See Issue 125 for more detail.

After every Russian mass missile attack on Ukraine's vital infrastructure, emergency outages take place, lasting for days due to the ongoing repair works. During such outages, people in Ukraine are often left without electricity, heating, water supply, or access to mobile phone networks.

Ukraine faced the largest Russian missile and drone attack on its energy facilities on March 22. See Issue 124 for more detail.

A week later, Ukrenergo faced yet another Russian missile and drone attack. See more in Issue 125.

On April 11, Ukraine faced the third Russian attack on its energy facilities in one month. The Trypillia Thermal Power Plant (TPP) in Kyiv oblast was destroyed. See Issue 127 for detail.

On April 27, Ukraine faced another Russian attack on its energy infrastructure. See Issue 129 for more.

The Cabinet keeps low electricity tariffs for households until the end of May 2024. On April 26, the Cabinet of Ministers extended public service obligations (PSOs) for another month, from April 30 - May 31. The price for households will remain Hr 2.64 ($0.07) per kWh.

Energoatom and Ukrhydroenergo were granted the right to sell electricity on market terms from Oct. 1, 2021. Under the new PSO model, the proceeds were used to compensate electricity providers for the difference between the regulated household tariffs (at that time, Hr 1.44/kWh and Hr 1.68/kWh depending on the volume of consumption) and market prices.

Since October 2021, the Cabinet of Ministers has repeatedly extended the PSO mechanism to keep electricity tariffs for households unchanged until the end of the previous heating season. The PSO mechanism was in place until April 30, 2023.

On May 30, 2023, the Cabinet approved an increase in the electricity tariff for households to Hr 2.64/kWh from June 1, 2023.

As we reported in Issue 115, in January, the PSO model had been extended until April 30. The government made this decision to reduce the financial burden on households due to the difficult economic situation caused by the full-scale war. As a result, the electricity price for households would continue to be Hr 2.64 per kWh.

According to Deputy Energy Minister Svitlana Hrynchuk, the Cabinet of Ministers is discussing the possibility of raising electricity tariffs, as resources are needed for the next heating season. No decision has been made yet, she said.

As we reported in our earlier issues, the low electricity tariff has consistently caused financial challenges for Ukrainian energy SOEs:

As we wrote in April, Naftogaz left the current gas tariff for households unchanged for at least another year. See Issue 129 for detail.

Ukrenergo reports a Hr 400 million profit in 2023 (audited); financial statements on the LSE website. On May 3, Ukrenergo reported its financial results for 2023, ending the year with a revenue of Hr 83 billion ($2.1 billion).

The company's financial statements, including the independent auditor's report, were published on the website of the London Stock Exchange (LSE).

On May 10, the company also held a briefing where CEO Volodymyr Kudrytskyi commented on Ukrenergo's key indicators in 2023.

The company made a profit of Hr 377 million ($9.5 million) in 2023. In 2022, Ukrenergo posted a loss of Hr 6 billion ($151 million)

Despite the Russian shelling of the infrastructure and the difficult situation in the energy system, the value of Ukrenergo's assets increased by almost Hr 45 billion ($1.1 billion), Kudrytskyi said.

In addition, the company paid Hr 2.4 billion ($60 million) in taxes and dividends to the state in 2023.

Kudrytskyi also said that the company paid off Hr 24 billion ($605 million) in debts in 2023 and the first quarter of 2024.

As we wrote in November 2023, the electricity market had a chain of debts of ""everyone to everyone"" worth Hr 60 billion ($1.5 billion). See Issue 110 for more detail.

German government grants 45 million euros ($48.7 million) to restore and protect energy infrastructure. On May 9, Ukrenergo signed an agreement with the German Development Bank KfW.

According to Ukrenergo's CEO Volodymyr Kudrytskyi, this will pay for a high-voltage line that will increase the stability of Ukraine's connection to the European grid. The aid will also pay for high-voltage equipment and restoring facilities in central Ukraine after Russian attacks.

In total, with KfW's support, Ukrenergo has attracted more than 177 million euros ($191 million) in loans and grants for the restoration and development of the electricity transmission network since Russia's invasion, the company added.

As we reported in Issue 128, Ukrenergo received nearly 1 million euros ($1.1 million) worth of energy equipment from German partners.

Naftogaz Group says its 2023 audited net profit is Hr 23 billion; financial statements not yet available. On May 7, Naftogaz Group reported that it made Hr 23.1 billion ($583 million) in consolidated net profit in 2023, a significant rebound from its Hr 79.1 billion ($1.9 billion) loss in 2022.

The company said that its consolidated financial statements were confirmed by an independent auditor, approved by the supervisory board on May 3, and sent to the Cabinet for approval.

The financial statements were not publicly available at the time of writing.

Note that the law on the functioning of the financial sector during martial law allows, in particular, joint-stock companies not to publish financial statements.

In pursuance of this law, the National Securities and Stock Market Commission (NSSMC), as a regulator, adopted a decision according to which joint-stock companies must disclose their annual and interim information (which includes financial statements) for 2021-2023 during 90 days after the end of martial law.

Until this provision of the above law is lifted, state-owned joint-stock companies, such as Naftogaz, Ukrnafta, and others, will have a legal ground not to disclose their financial statements.

Under normal circumstances, according to the NSSMC's disclosure regulation, joint-stock companies must disclose annual financial statements for 2023 as part of their annual disclosure by April 30.

At the same time, the law does not prevent such disclosure (including financial statements) by SOEs, as this would be customarily done in best corporate governance practice.

We are not aware of any objective reasons, including those related to martial law, for the above exemption to continue to exist. The lack of annual reports leads to opaqueness of SOEs, including making it impossible to analyze or understand their performance.

When SOEs or their management report selected financial indicators or trends, no objective analysis of such reports or SOEs' performance altogether is possible.

Countries with developed capital markets have rules regulating the disclosure of sensitive (insider) information by public companies. Among other things, shareholders, other investors, or the public may not be misled by selective or delayed disclosure of such information.

The profitability of the business lines was driven by significantly improved financial results of the Group's companies, Naftogaz added without providing any details.

The company also said that most of the profit will go into dividends to the state. The Cabinet set the individual dividend pay-out ratio for Naftogaz at 95%. See SOE Weekly's Issue 118.

It is also unclear whether or how Ukrnafta's financial performance is incorporated in Naftogaz's financial statements.

As we reported in Issue 121, Ukrnafta is to pay the state a total of Hr 8 billion ($202 million) in dividends for 2023. Ukrnafta's audited financial statements for 2022 or 2023 were also not available at the time of writing.

Meanwhile, the former CEO of the Gas Transmission System Operator of Ukraine (GTSOU) Serhiy Makogon questioned the data. He said that buffer gas was Naftogaz's major source of profit in the first six months of 2023, according to the company's (unaudited) reporting for that period.

Apparently, this means that Naftogaz was now able to sell the buffer gas from underground storages, which it could not sell earlier.

Buffer gas is the volume of gas that is necessary to ensure the stable operation of underground storages, including maintaining the necessary pressure that allows normal gas take-off.

Naftogaz CEO interviewed. Naftogaz CEO Oleksiy Chernyshov spoke to Forbes Ukraine this week. We selected key segments:

On Naftogaz's financial performance in 2023 and forecasts for 2024:

As we reported in Issue 126, Ukrnafta earned almost Hr 24 billion ($605 million) in net profit in 2023.

It is unclear how Ukrnafta's dividends would be paid to the state and Naftogaz; see previous item.

As a result of the attack, the tracks at Kherson railway station were damaged, and the movement of Train No. 121/122 (Kyiv-Kherson-Kyiv) was temporarily restricted. Later that day, railway workers completed repairs to the track damaged by the shelling, the company said.

As we reported earlier, Ukrzaliznytsia's civilian infrastructure in and around Dnipro was also shelled by Russian troops on April 19. See Issue 128 for more detail.

Confiscated PentoPack Plant up for auction at Hr 203 million ($5.1 million), the State Property Fund's (SPFU) press office reported on May 6. It was confiscated from Russian-Greek businessman Ivan Savvidi.

The online auction is scheduled for May 31.

According to the SPFU, PentoPack is one of the leading producers of packaging for meats and sausages. It produces multilayer synthetic shrink wrap using modern technologies, including printing with UV, water, and alcohol inks.

PentoPack's products are used in more than thirty countries around the world. In Ukraine, the company does business with Rud, Globino, and Myasna Gildiya.

PentoPack retained 193 jobs and has no wage or state budget arrears. The company plans to enter new markets for packaging materials for the dairy industry, fish processing, and animal feed packaging, the SPFU added.

""This is an extremely attractive investment asset. It is not just about production facilities, but about a well-established profitable business in a promising segment of the food industry. The new owner would have all the opportunities for further growth and development,"" SPFU head Vitaliy Koval said.

As we reported in Issue 122, the SPFU declared its privatization plans for PentoPack in early March.

Ukrnafta and ARMA seek permission to manage Tatneft's assets. On May 6, Ukrnafta and the Asset Recovery and Management Agency (ARMA), applied for a merger clearance to manage Russian Tatneft Group's assets in Poltava and Kharkiv oblasts. These include petrol stations, oil depots, and other commercial property - a total of 110 units.

Most of them are in rundown condition, and some petrol stations have been destroyed, and they need to be rebuilt from scratch, Ukrnafta said. As of today, about 15 of the 70 Tatneft petrol stations are operational. The situation is similar with idle oil depots, Ukrnafta added.

ARMA declared its plans to transfer Tatneft filling stations to Ukrnafta's management ten months ago (see Issue 99), and the Cabinet transferred them on Aug. 15, 2023 (see Issue 100).

It is unclear why ARMA and Ukrnafta had not applied for merger clearance earlier, and how the assets have been maintained in the meantime.

Ukrnafta said that it would assess these assets on a case-by-case basis to calculate the required level of investment and the timing of their return.

ARMA and Ukrnafta are finalizing the asset management agreement.

As we reported earlier, Ukrnafta also manages the assets of the Glusco group. On March 14, the Antimonopoly Committee of Ukraine allowed Ukrnafta to take over the management of Glusco's assets - see Issue 123. On March 15, Ukrnafta and ARMA said that they signed acts of acceptance for the transfer of Glusco assets - see Issue 124.

In May 2022, the Gas Transmission System Operator of Ukraine said it would suspend the flow of gas to Europe via the Sokhranovka transit point due to force majeure as the company allegedly was unable to control the Novopskov gas compressor station in the Lugansk People's Republic. However, the Russian gas giant did not see any proof of force majeure.

In the fall of 2022, Ukraine's Naftogaz company filed a petition for arbitration with the International Arbitration Court against Gazprom for allegedly being late with its payment for gas transportation services through Ukraine.

The Bank Alliance, in collusion with the energy traders affiliated with Ukrainian oligarch Ihor Kolomoisky, stole 14,000 Mavic drones from the state. Courts prevent refund - write Gary Cartwright of EU Today.

During the last few weeks, the judges of the Kyiv Economic Court and the Pivnichny (Northern) Economic Court of Appeal actually froze the chances of Ukrenergo to recover UAH 1.13 billion (26.7 million euros).

This is part of the funds that United Energy, affiliated with Ihor Kolomoisky, at the beginning of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine received from electricity resale without paying to the state.

The firm's debt was to be covered by the guarantor - Bank Alliance.

However, it also refused to fulfil its obligations. The amount equivalent to the cost of 14,000 Mavic drones, 57,000 FPV drones or 7,000 155mm shells for Ukraine's Defence Forces hangs in the air.

At the same time, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU), which investigated the case, is not involved as a party to the court proceedings.

The scheme with the guarantee.

The full-scale war, which has been going on for the third year, does not stop large-scale corruption schemes in Ukraine.

At the beginning of January 2024, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau and the Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office announced the disclosure and completion of the investigation into the stunning deal with the participation of the Ukrenergo state-run power company, the United Energy trading firm and the commercial Bank Alliance, which, at the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, caused losses to the state amounting to over a billion hryvnias.

Despite the fact that all the participants are known and their participation in the scheme is obvious, a number of legal processes related to this criminal case make us assume that the corrupt officials are going to emerge unscathed.

According to the case file, chronologically this story began in the Autumn of 2021.

At this point in time Alliance - a small bank - issued a guarantee to United Energy. This company is affiliated with Ihor Kolomoisky. According to the documents, the bank guarantees payments for the electricity purchased from Ukrenergo.

Nevertheless, the presence of such a document (which confirmed that the bank ""insures"" this client) allowed the company to negotiate and receive electricity in fact on credit. The head of the department of Ukrenergo, who should have stopped such energy supply, taking into account the debts, but did not do so, ignored United Energy's problems.

As a result, Kolomoisky's company resold the energy received from Ukrenergo, withdrawing money to a related company. Taking into account fines, the total debt of this counterparty amounted to UAH 1.7 billion, of which Ukrenergo has already managed to recover only UAH 600 million.

In the NABU case, everything appears simple and clear: the employee of Ukrenergo, the chairman of the bank's board and Kolomoisky's partner Kiperman, who is responsible for United Energy, was put on the wanted list. The detectives indicated that all three persons actually colluded in the deal.

However, a criminal case with such a plot is not yet a court decision. The High Anti-Corruption Court will have to consider this story and pass a fair sentence to the participants.

Ukrenergo timely forwarded a number of the bank's demands for the fulfilment of guarantee obligations for the debts of United Energy. The financial institution fulfilled them only partially.

As part of the economic dispute, the state-owned company is now trying to recover from the guarantor bank the funds due to the state for UAH 1.13 billion, which the company actually borrowed and did not return. However, the bank refuses to be responsible for these debts.

Not a participant in the scheme, but a victim?

A lengthy interview of beneficial owner Oleksandr Sosis appeared on the website of Bank Alliance, where he claimed that the guarantee should have been fulfilled only if all parties followed the rules of the game in the electricity market.

Since Ukrenergo - contrary to internal rules - continued to supply energy to United Energy, the financial institution in this story is a victim of circumstances.

Prior to being put on the wanted list, Yulia Frolova, head of the bank's board, said in a comment to mind.ua that the requirements of Ukrenergo were improperly drafted, that is why they were not subject to satisfaction.

Ukrenergo denied this because the bank still satisfied part of the demands formulated in the same way. In support of such a point of view, the bank even - probably - engaged several ""opinion leaders"" who, in unison with the owner, expressed their opinions on a narrow-profile topic.

""The presumption of the rightness of the beneficiary (Ukrenergo) consists in the fact that provided the beneficiary behaves conscientiously, the very fact of presenting a claim to the guarantor bank indicates that the debtor (United Energy) has not fulfilled the main obligation and that the bank has the obligation to pay the amount of the guarantee,"" Arzinger lawyer Yevhen Diadiuk commented on the issue to mind.ua.

Ukrenergo says that it is ready to cooperate with the NABU to find out what actually happened. The main line of defence is that the responsible employee was working in evacuation conditions, so production processes were partially slowed down.

Therefore, - probably - he had no evil intention in supplying ""free"" energy to United Energy. Kolomoisky's company is the only one that actually does not deny its guilt of participating in the scheme.

In two parallel lawsuits, Bank Alliance defends its right not to pay the debt of Kolomoisky's company.

In December 2022, the Kyiv Economic Court, by ruling in case No. 910/3268/22, obliged the institution to fulfil its guarantee obligations for UAH 1.13 billion, while the bank appealed against this decision.

Court hearings in the Northern Court of Appeal, in violation of all procedural terms, last more than a year.

According to mass media, judges were sick, they were on sick leave, on vacation, disqualified themselves, referring to the media's attention to the case, postponed the court hearing , and not able to make a decision based on the merits.

Ultimately, on April 25, 2024, the judges of the Court of Appeal, namely Hennadiy Korobenko, Karolina Tarasenko and Alla Tyschenko, issued a decision to stop the proceedings.

The reason was another decision made a week before by the Kyiv Economic Court, within which Bank Alliance had already decided to contest the legality of the bank guarantee itself.

In case No. 910/1479/23, judge Rostyslav Stashkiv recognised the guarantee as unenforceable.

So now, Ukrenergo will have to appeal against this decision as well. Until all stages are completed, there will be no return to the suspended proceedings in the main case.

Interestingly, Judge Stashkiv actually investigated the circumstances of the case, which were already investigated by his colleagues in December 2022 and based on which the guarantee was deemed acceptable.

However, he did not want to involve the NABU on the side of Ukrenergo as a victim in this case.

Another detail that the media drew attention to was the size of the court fee determined for Bank Alliance.

Since Judge Stashkiv decided that the subject of the lawsuit was non-property relations between the financial institution and Ukrenergo, the court fee was set at UAH 5,368. In fact, taking into account the amount of liabilities recognised by the court, when filing a lawsuit, the bank had to pay a court fee of at least UAH 1 million.

Such a position of the court regarding the determination of this category of dispute as immaterial generally contradicts the established judicial practice.

All these actions on the part of the bank and the court actually lead to a new circle in this story, gaining time for the participants to delay the payment under the guarantee of Bank Alliance.

On the verge of withdrawal from the market

The National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) responded to the request of the NV. Business publication that it was monitoring the situation concerning Bank Alliance and would take measures if necessary.

The financial institution's failure to fulfil guarantee obligations may raise the question of its withdrawal from the market. After all, the bank's own capital is under UAH 1 billion, therefore the guarantee payment in the amount of UAH 1.13 billion can significantly impact its financial stability.

In parallel with the processes regarding the bank, Ukrenergo is trying to collect funds not only from the financial institution but also directly from United Energy. The next court hearing in this dispute is scheduled for May 8.

Journalists have already drawn attention to the fact that it is rather unusual for a third-tier bank to take on obligations of billions of hryvnias that exceed its financial capabilities. Moreover, even a cursory look at the balance sheet figures shows that Bank Alliance did not have the right to issue guarantees of this size.

As of Sept. 1, 2021, the financial institution had a regulatory capital of UAH 610 million. This means that the guarantee under the contract with United Energy could not exceed UAH 152 million (25 per cent of regulatory capital).

However, taking into account the agreements between the company and the bank, the amount of the guarantee reached almost UAH 1.9 billion. This is 12.5 times more than the regulatory limit.

This should attract the attention of the regulator (the NBU) in the first place. According to the results of the inspection of Bank Alliance in December 2023, it became known that the bank deliberately submitted non-reliable financial statements to the NBU. The question arises again: where is the NBU's position?

Nevertheless, Bank Alliance issued other guarantees (as of September 2023, they exceeded UAH 7 billion) and is involved in a number of court cases related to refusal to satisfy the guarantee requirements of creditors, in particular the Ministry of Defense, the National Health Service of Ukraine, the Gas Transmission System Operator of Ukraine, Naftogaz Trading, and the Ukrainian Sea Ports Authority.

In addition, the bank appears in the materials of criminal proceedings No.  42017000000000445 dated Feb. 17, 2017, which indicates that through the bank in 2017-2018, the management of the regional gas companies of Dmytro Firtash could illegally withdraw funds, which led to a significant increase in the debt to Naftogaz.

Thus, it is obvious that invalidating guarantees in all cases is not the best way to position the financial institution on the market. Unless this is what the business model is all about. But then the National Bank - as well as the NABU - should take a closer look at it to minimise the risks borne by depositors, as well as business that still works with the financial institution.

In fact, taking into account the amount of liabilities recognised by the court, when filing a lawsuit, the bank had to pay a court fee of at least UAH 1 million.

Such a position of the court regarding the determination of this category of dispute as immaterial generally contradicts the established judicial practice.

All these actions on the part of the bank and the court actually lead to a new circle in this story, gaining time for the participants to delay the payment under the guarantee of Bank Alliance.

The National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) responded to the request of the NV.Business publication that it was monitoring the situation concerning Bank Alliance and would take measures if necessary.

The financial institution's failure to fulfil guarantee obligations may raise the question of its withdrawal from the market. After all, the bank's own capital is under UAH 1 billion, therefore the guarantee payment in the amount of UAH 1.13 billion can significantly impact its financial stability.

In parallel with the processes regarding the bank, Ukrenergo is trying to collect funds not only from the financial institution, but also directly from United Energy. The next court hearing in this dispute is scheduled for May 8.

Journalists have already drawn attention to the fact that it is rather unusual for a third-tier bank to take on obligations of billions of hryvnias that exceed its financial capabilities. Moreover, even a cursory look at the balance sheet figures shows that Bank Alliance did not have the right to issue guarantees of this size.

As of Sept. 1, 2021, the financial institution had regulatory capital of UAH 610 million. This means that the guarantee under the contract with United Energy could not exceed UAH 152 million (25 percent of regulatory capital).

However, taking into account the agreements between the company and the bank, the amount of the guarantee reached almost UAH 1.9 billion. This is 12.5 times more than the regulatory limit.

This should attract the attention of the regulator (the NBU) in the first place. According to the results of the inspection of Bank Alliance in December 2023, it became known that the bank deliberately submitted non-reliable financial statements to the NBU. The question arises again: where is the NBU's position?

Nevertheless, Bank Alliance issued other guarantees (as of September 2023, they exceeded UAH 7 billion) and is involved in a number of court cases related to refusal to satisfy the guarantee requirements of creditors, in particular the Ministry of Defense, the National Health Service of Ukraine, the Gas Transmission System Operator of Ukraine, Naftogaz Trading, and the Ukrainian Sea Ports Authority.

In addition, the bank appears in the materials of criminal proceedings No.  42017000000000445 dated Feb. 17, 2017, which indicate that through the bank in 2017-2018, the management of the regional gas companies of Dmytro Firtash could illegally withdraw funds, which led to a significant increase in the debt to Naftogaz.

Thus, it is obvious that invalidating guarantees in all cases is not the best way to position the financial institution on the market. Unless this is what the business model is all about. But then the National Bank - as well as the NABU - should take a closer look at it to minimise the risks borne by depositors, as well as business that still works with the financial institution.",eutoday.net,news,eutoday.net,Gary Cartwright,0.05098039215686279,452844609,1,https://i0.wp.com/eutoday.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Screenshot-2024-05-07-at-21.54.55.png,

During the last few weeks, the judges of the Kyiv Economic Court and the Pivnichny (Northern) Economic Court of Appeal actually froze the chances of Ukrenergo to recover UAH 1.13 billion. This is part of the funds that United Energy, affiliated with Ihor Kolomoisky, at the beginning of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine received from electricity resale without paying to the state. The firm's debt was to be covered by the guarantor - Bank Alliance. However, it also refused to fulfill its obligations. The amount equivalent to the cost of 14,000 Mavic drones, 57,000 FPV drones or 7,000 155mm shells for the Defense Forces hung in the air. At the same time, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU), which investigated the case, is not involved as a party to the court proceedings.

The scheme with the guarantee

The full-scale war, which has been going on for the third year, does not stop large-scale corruption schemes in Ukraine. At the beginning of January 2024, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau and the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office announced the disclosure and completion of the investigation into the stunning deal with the participation of the Ukrenergo state-run power company, the United Energy trading firm and the commercial Bank Alliance, which, at the start of the full scale invasion of Ukraine, caused losses to the state amounting to over a billion hryvnias. Despite the fact that all the participants are known and their participation in the scheme is obvious, a number of legal processes related to this criminal case make us assume that the corrupt officials are going to emerge unscathed.

According to the case file, chronologically this story began in the fall of 2021. Then Alliance - a small bank - issued a guarantee to United Energy. This company is affiliated with Ihor Kolomoisky. According to the documents, the bank guarantees payments for the electricity purchased from Ukrenergo.

Nevertheless, the presence of such a document (which confirmed that the bank ""insures"" this client) allowed the company to negotiate and receive electricity in fact on credit. The head of the department of Ukrenergo, who should have stopped such energy supply, taking into account the debts, but did not do so, ignored United Energy's problems. As a result, Kolomoisky's company resold the energy received from Ukrenergo, withdrawing money to a related company. Taking into account fines, the total debt of this counterparty amounted to UAH 1.7 billion, of which Ukrenergo has already managed to recover UAH 600 million.

In the NABU case, everything is simple and clear: the employee of Ukrenergo, the chairman of the bank's board and Kolomoisky's partner Kiperman, who is responsible for United Energy, were put on the wanted list. The detectives indicated that all three persons actually colluded in the deal.

However, a criminal case with such a plot is not yet a court decision. The High Anti-Corruption Court will have to consider this story and pass a fair sentence to the participants.

Ukrenergo timely forwarded a number of the bank's demands for the fulfillment of guarantee obligations for the debts of United Energy. The financial institution fulfilled them partially. As part of the economic dispute, the state-owned company is now trying to recover from the guarantor bank the funds due to the state for UAH 1.13 billion, which the company actually borrowed and did not return. However, the bank refuses to be responsible for these debts.

Not a participant in the scheme, but a victim?

A lengthy interview of beneficial owner Oleksandr Sosis appeared on the website of Bank Alliance, where he claims that the guarantee should have been fulfilled only if all parties followed the rules of the game in the electricity market. Since Ukrenergo - contrary to internal rules - continued to supply energy to United Energy, the financial institution in this story is a victim of circumstances. Prior to being put on the wanted list, Yulia Frolova, head of the bank's board, said in a comment to mind.ua that the requirements of Ukrenergo were improperly drafted, that's why they were not subject to satisfaction. Ukrenergo denied this, because the bank still satisfied part of the demands formulated in the same way. In support of such a point of view, the bank even - probably - engaged several ""opinion leaders"" who, in unison with the owner, expressed their opinions on a narrow-profile topic.

""The presumption of rightness of the beneficiary (Ukrenergo) consists in the fact that, provided the beneficiary behaves conscientiously, the very fact of presenting a claim to the guarantor bank indicates that the debtor (United Energy) has not fulfilled the main obligation and that the bank has the obligation to pay the amount of the guarantee,"" Arzinger lawyer Yevhen Diadiuk commented on the issue to mind.ua.

Ukrenergo says that it is ready to cooperate with the NABU to find out what actually happened. The main line of defense is that the responsible employee was working in evacuation conditions, so production processes were partially slowed down. Therefore, - probably - he had no evil intention in supplying ""free"" energy to United Energy. Kolomoisky's company is the only one that actually does not deny its guilt of participating in the scheme.

In two parallel lawsuits, Bank Alliance defends its right not to pay the debt of Kolomoisky's company. In December 2022, the Kyiv Economic Court, by ruling in case No. 910/3268/22, obliged the institution to fulfill its guarantee obligations for UAH 1.13 billion, while the bank appealed against this decision. Court hearings in the Northern Court of Appeal, in violation of all procedural terms, last more than a year. According to mass media, judges were sick, they were on sick leave, on vacation, recused themselves, referring to the media's attention to the case, postponed the court hearing, not being able to make a decision on the merits.

Ultimately, on April 25, 2024, the judges of the Court of Appeal, namely Hennadiy Korobenko, Karolina Tarasenko and Alla Tyschenko, issued a decision to stop the proceedings. The reason was another decision made a week before by the Kyiv Economic Court, within which Bank Alliance has already decided to contest the legality of the bank guarantee itself. In case No. 910/1479/23, judge Rostyslav Stashkiv recognized the guarantee as unenforceable. So now, Ukrenergo will have to appeal against this decision as well. Until all stages are completed, there will be no return to the suspended proceedings in the main case. Interestingly, judge Stashkiv actually investigated the circumstances of the case, which were already investigated by his colleagues in December 2022 and based on which the guarantee was deemed acceptable. However, he did not want to involve the NABU on the side of Ukrenergo as a victim in this case.

Another detail that the media drew attention to was the size of the court fee determined for Bank Alliance. Since judge Stashkiv decided that the subject of the lawsuit was non-property relations between the financial institution and Ukrenergo, the court fee was set at UAH 5,368.
