Lausitz Energie Bergbau AG -- a unit of Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky's EPH group -- had initially been promised €1.75 billion by the government to cover mine rehabilitations and closures, but Brussels' competition enforcers had some doubts about those calculations. The approval is likely to come imminently and before the summer break for Brussels, said the people that asked not to be named because the matter is private.

The commission is set to issue a draft decision on its state aid review as early as next week, the people said. The figure of the state aid is subject to change.

LEAG declined to comment. A spokesperson of the economy ministry said negotiations with the commission are still ongoing.

The commission said it was in ""continuous constructive contact with the German authorities in the context of the formal investigation into the compensation measure in favour of LEAG, also in light of the ongoing exchanges between the German authorities and LEAG.""

The German government initially brokered the deal in 2020, which was meant to cushion LEAG and RWE AG's coal exit by 2038. The EU Commission had opened an in-depth investigation on the proportionality of the subsidy especially for LEAG, but last year gave its green light to the full €2.6 billion support measure for RWE.

The Essen-based utility had previously sealed a deal with the government to move its coal exit forward to 2030, a step Cottbus-based LEAG is not willing to take as it insists on burning lignite -- a particularly climate-harmful fossil fuel -- for as long as legally possible.

LEAG earlier said it wanted to use a part of the state aid to finance its green energy push. The company wants to invest more than €10 billion in renewables by 2030.

In an effort to enhance ecosystems and support pollinators, a team of volunteers from RWE's Brechfa Forest West Onshore Wind Farm joined a planting day organised by the Bumblebee Conservation Trust.

Together, they planted a variety of native wildflowers and shrubs in the area, with the aim of making a significant impact on the local environment and encouraging bees and other pollinators to thrive.

RWE, the largest power producer and renewable energy generator in Wales, initiated a biodiversity restoration programme in 2022.

This programme aims to improve the ecological value of sites at four RWE onshore wind farms in the UK and Ireland. Recognising the vital role that pollinators play in sustaining food supply, the project supports bees, moths, butterflies and hoverflies by creating environments where they can flourish.

Toby Rumble, ecologist at RWE, said: ""Our recent site survey at Brechfa Forest identified a critical need for flowering plants that bloom in early spring and late summer. Thanks to the hard work and enthusiasm of our volunteers, we are closing this gap and providing greater feeding opportunities for a more diverse assemblage of pollinators during these crucial periods.""

One of the key strategies of RWE's biodiversity programme involves allowing native flowering species to flourish and bloom during July and August, providing a vital late-summer food source for pollinators, which traditional mowing practices would typically suppress.

This simple yet effective approach has already shown promising results.

Tom Bucker Flynn, bumblebees project officer at Bumblebee Conservation Trust, said: ""It's been incredible working with the RWE team at Brechfa Forest Wind Farm. As part of the habitat management plan, we've planted over 400 native locally sourced plug plants that will help benefit a range of pollinators when they most need it.""

Volunteering events like the plug planting day not only benefit the environment but also offer participants a chance to share their enthusiasm, skills, and ideas while having fun and meeting like-minded people.

The recent plug planting day is just one of the ways RWE is working to improve habitats for pollinators, with the potential to make a substantial impact on the local environment.",inyourarea.co.uk,news,InYourArea.co.uk,,0.4901960784313726,454864572,26,https://d4oy8w59p2l43.cloudfront.net/2024/05/escenic---2024-05-31T151128.531.jpg,eng-9617565

""With a planned capacity of 50MW and 400MWh, the Limondale BESS will support the energy transition by storing excess renewable energy and feeding it into the NSW grid when it is needed most,"" said an RWE spokesperson.

The project will be located next to RWE's 249MWac Limondale solar farm, which is one of Australia's largest.

The BESS will connect to existing grid infrastructure. Tesla is the BESS supplier. Beon Energy Solutions is the delivery partner for the Balance of Plant, which includes the civil, structural, electrical and control works required to connect the megapack to the existing 33kV substation.

Construction is scheduled to start in the second half of this year, with commissioning planned for late 2025.

Katja Wünschel, CEO for RWE Renewables Europe & Australia said: ""RWE's investment signing of supplier contracts for the Limondale BESS project is an exciting step forward in our commitment to the Australian renewables sector and support of New South Wales' renewable energy ambitions.

""RWE develops, builds and operates innovative and competitive battery storage systems in Europe and the US, and soon here in Australia.""

Australia is one of RWE's focus markets, where it has been present since 2013. In 2018, the company began construction of the Limondale solar farm in Balranald, New South Wales. With an installed capacity of 249MWac the large-scale solar farm is made up of 872,000 panels and generates enough electricity to power about 105,000 homes a year. Full commercial operation started in 2021.

RWE says: ""Our Australian team of more than 70 is developing a portfolio of wind, solar, and battery storage projects across the country, supported by the global RWE team. RWE intends to develop up to 3GW of renewable energy projects in Australia by 2030.""

RWE operates battery storage systems with an overall capacity of more than 700 MW and 1.2GW of battery storage projects under construction worldwide. The company recently commissioned three US battery storage projects totalling 190 MW.

CANTRAIN addresses a key aspect of the clinical trial environment -- the training of current Graduate Students, Postdoctoral Fellows, and the next generations of Trialists and Clinical Research Professionals in the development and conduct of clinical trials. Through a state-of-the-art Learning Management System (LMS), CANTRAIN provides competency-based courses in clinical research enriched by real-work and real-world experiential activities and expert mentorship.

CANTRAIN is unlike any other training platform. We offer an innovative, competency-based clinical trial training curriculum enriched by experiential learning and expert mentorship. CANTRAIN offers uniquely designed training for four streams of learners, including:

This latest stream aimed at public engagement is further defined to include health charities, policymakers, journalists, social media influencers, and more. Its specific intention is to increase equity, diversity, inclusion, and accessibility (EDIA) for underserved and underrepresented groups interested in working and/or participating in clinical trial research.

The CANTRAIN programmes and platform are available to all Canadian public, academic, and healthcare institutions (hospitals, research centres/institutes) that host Clinical Trial Units (CTUs). Through federal funding, all CANTRAIN programmes are free in Canada. We intend to offer the same portfolio of training programmes on a fee-for-service basis to the private sector (biotech, biopharma, clinical contract research organisations (CCRO), Site Management Organisation (SMO)), to support the training of their own personnel as well as study staff at clinical trials sites across the country. The time will soon come to expand CANTRAIN's horizons and engage public and private organisations abroad, including in Europe.

CANTRAIN's innovative approach to clinical trial training is competency-based and scientifically grounded. Such innovation in the adult learning curriculum and in clinical trials research is aligned with the needs of the persona of learners listed above, starting with the Principal Investigator (PI) / Qualified Investigator (QI) responsible for the conduct of clinical trials, assisted by a variety of clinical research professionals (CRP) from co-ordination to management, ethics, and regulatory affairs. We have adopted and are adapting 'The Levelled Core Competency Framework for the Clinical Research Professional' by the Joint Task Force for Clinical Trial Competency (JTF) of the Multi-Regional Clinical Trials (MRCT) Center of Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard. This framework includes 47 competencies across eight domains, graded for different levels of expertise and experience. Furthermore, using adult education principles based on cognitive science, CANTRAIN is now innovating by expanding this framework to new groups of learners, namely trialists, patients and community partners.

CANTRAIN is the creation of academic health and clinical researchers from all over Canada who are partnering to collaborate with patients' engaged organisations, such as Canadian SPOR (Strategy for Patient-Oriented Research). Similar, yet distinct organisations in Europe, such as EUPATI (European Patients Academy on Therapeutic Innovation), and in the US, such as PCORI (Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute), are inspiring strategies to engage and embed patient, caregiver and community perspectives and priorities into health research, and therefore speed up clinical trials research outcomes into evidence for better health policy, health services, health experiences and overall health.

CANTRAIN's strategy focuses on building the knowledge and skills of researchers, patients, and community members to increase the capacity of clinical trials, aiming for knowledge and learner-specific competencies related to clinical trial research.

To encourage Canada's highly trained students to get involved with clinical trials, CANTRAIN offers three salary award programmes. Supported by the current CIHR grant (2022-2026), and the collaboration with Canadian provincial health research organisations as co-funders, CANTRAIN has been enabled to double the number of awards on offer to master's and doctoral trainees and postdoctoral fellows. This one-year renewable programme supports these trainees in conducting clinical trial research and following the CANTRAIN curriculum of courses and mentorship.

CANTRAIN's programming also includes salary and internship awards with practica. There are four dedicated programmes combining courses and mentorship with real-work/real-world experience (RWE) in a clinical trial setting.

Horizon Europe is the world's largest research and innovation funding programme involving countries around the globe. Canada is part of this most ambitious funding programme as of November 2023. It gives Canadians access to even more opportunities to elevate their research and innovations through global partnerships. Through Horizon Europe, Canada's talented research and innovation communities, such as CANTRAIN-CTTP, can contribute to the development of solutions to some of the world's most pressing challenges, mainly toward Horizon Europe Pillar 1 aimed to support excellence in advanced research training, which CANTRAIN provides in the field of clinical trials.

CANTRAIN CTTP includes a level dedicated to 'Regulatory Compliance.' At this level, courses are devoted to ICH-GCP (International Council for Harmonisation - Good Clinical Practice), Health Canada, Food and Drug Regulations, and international research ethics standards. Additional courses are being developed to address ITA (Investigational Testing Authorisation) for medical devices, and other jurisdictions such as the US-FDA Chapter 21 of the CFR12 on clinical investigations of drugs, biological products, and medical devices and current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) regulations. The same approach is true for EMA (European Medicines Agency) and UK-MHRA (Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency). All courses can also be translated to other languages to enable sponsors to qualify sites and conduct trials in different countries.

CANTRAIN CTTP also includes a level dedicated to fundamental (basic or entry level) training, called the Common Core Foundation (CCF). This training consists of 11 courses designed to provide learners of various profiles with a strong knowledge baseline of key concepts in the planning and conduct of clinical trials. Everyone involved in clinical trials should know and understand this information, regardless of their role. Through this level, CANTRAIN modules are tailored, sequenced, and assembled in a way to meet the needs of a wide variety of learners (GPT, CTP/CRP, Trialists and patients/community partners), by selecting optimal content from amongst the domains and competencies of the JTF Core Competency Framework.

CANTRAIN's vision goes beyond knowledge-based training because it aims at mentoring all people on how to conduct or participate in clinical trials research. It is CANTRAIN's mission to prepare all learners for the future through an innovative, competency-based clinical trials training curriculum enriched by experiential learning and expert mentorship.

Now that Canada has joined Horizon Europe as an associate country under Pillar 1-2-3, CANTRAIN intends to apply with EU partners to form a consortium focusing on providing a multi-lingual, multi-competency, multi-jurisdictional (Health Canada-Regulatory Operations and Enforcement Branch (ROEB), Food and Drug Administration (US-FDA), European Medicines Agencies (EMA), and Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (UK-MHRA)) clinical trials training platform across two continents and beyond.",innovationnewsnetwork.com,news,Innovation News Network,Jack Thomas,0.3019607843137255,454857077,1,https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Image-1-©AdobeStockMirko-Vitali_485398728.jpeg,eng-9610444

The proposed 184km of new electricity transmission reinforcement between Norwich and Tilbury is part of National Grid's Great Grid Upgrade. As the UK transitions to renewable energy sources, the electricity network and its infrastructure will have to change to achieve net zero by 2050.

The government's ambition to connect 50GW of offshore wind by 2030 means that development has scaled up, with about 60% of current offshore wind projects coming ashore along the East Coast.

East Anglia's high-voltage electricity network will not be able to reliably transport new energy connections while working to the required standard. National Grid is investing 'significantly' in upgrading the existing network but will have to reinforce the network in the area further and increase its capability to carry the expected green energy.

The extended public consultation period follows the announcement of a UK general election on 4 July. This is the third public consultation on National Grid's proposals for Norwich to Tilbury.

The energy company said: ""We are committed to working with local communities as we develop our plans. We want local residents to have the opportunity to access the new jobs, business opportunities and positive biodiversity and environmental improvements that The Great Grid Upgrade can deliver.""

The east of England has emerged as an offshore wind hub in the UK with large developers, including Scottish Power Renewables, RWE and Ørsted, operating in the region. The area also benefits from a strong supply chain.

A recent report by the Crown Estate found that during 2023 10GW of UK offshore wind was added to the market and produced 49TWh of electricity, a record amount of generation. Furthermore, the UK's offshore wind market represents more than 40% of European offshore wind capacity, having grown to 93GW.

The 1284 MWe Gundremmingen B boiling water reactor (BWR) in southern Germany was disconnected from the grid on 31 December 2017 after 33 years of operation. Gundremmingen C - a 1288 MWe BWR - permanently shut down on 31 December 2021.

The licence for dismantling unit B according to the Atomic Energy Act was granted by the Bavarian State Ministry of the Environment and Consumer Protection in March 2019; the licence for dismantling unit C in May 2021.

""Since then, several thousand tonnes of material have been removed from the two reactor buildings, processed and mostly returned to the recycling cycle,"" RWE said. ""The third permit that has now been granted covers the dismantling of all plant components that were not the subject of the previous permits.""

RWE said the Bavarian State Ministry for the Environment and Consumer Protection issued the final licence on 28 May.

""This means that all the prerequisites for the dismantling target set for the mid/late 2030s, namely the release of the plant from nuclear regulatory supervision, are now in place,"" the company said.

""The granting of the permit enables us to continue the immediate dismantling in accordance with the current Atomic Energy Act and is an important milestone in our dismantling project,"" said Gundremmingen Plant Manager Heiko Ringel. ""The rapid and safe dismantling is guaranteed by a highly-motivated and technically experienced team made up of our own staff and partner companies.

""All work is subject to monitoring by the supervisory authority, which accompanies and supervises the dismantling with the support of various independent experts. Plant safety, occupational safety and health protection have the highest priority in all activities.""

In December 2021, RWE awarded a contract to Westinghouse to dismantle the two reactors at the Gundremmingen plant. Under the contract, Westinghouse will dismantle and pack the reactor pressure vessels, including the associated internals, the fuel element storage racks and adjacent concrete shielding structures in units B and C of the Gundremmingen plant.

The industry could use the same workforce, the same shipyards and possibly even the same platforms to generate renewable power.

With designs, data and offshore leases from Texas, Herman Schellstede and his team planned to build a 62-turbine wind farm off Galveston's coast -- one of the first such proposals in the United States and the first in the Gulf of Mexico.

The team approached banks and even Koch Industries seeking financing for the $300 million wind farm, he said. But financing nascent offshore wind was apparently too risky a proposition in the wake of the 2008 financial meltdown. The wind farm was eventually scuttled.

""We were still too early,"" said Schellstede, the Louisiana oil and gas entrepreneur who is still designing offshore wind turbines for proposed projects in the gulf.

Now, 33 years after the first offshore wind farm was built in waters off Denmark, it's still unclear if the time is right -- or will ever be right -- for the United States. In those years, only four wind farms generating 242 megawatts of power have been built off the U.S. coast; the largest just went into service in 2024.

Last year, inflation, supply chain problems and other macroeconomic issues led to the cancellation or renegotiation of about half of all proposed offshore wind projects. And while the Biden Administration is moving as quickly as possible to approve new lease sales and projects -- expanding the amount of power generated by 10-fold -- former President Donald Trump has promised to end offshore wind if elected.

The industry and advocates, however, do not seem daunted. Studies show offshore wind could meet 5% of the nation's energy needs by 2035, and up to 25% by 2050.

""We're all in this room today, not because we just see offshore wind as a massive opportunity -- which it is to build you clean energy -- but also we see the necessity of offshore wind,"" said Amanda Lefton, vice president of offshore development for the renewable energy company RWE.

Lefton, speaking at an April conference of the offshore wind industry in New Orleans, said the technology is needed to meet national and state decarbonization goals. RWE is developing projects off the East Coast and California and working to create a supply chain for offshore wind in the Gulf of Mexico with a large Louisiana-based coalition.

""We know the fundamentals exist in these markets,"" said Lefton, the former head of the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management who leads RWE's East Coast operations. ""We know that it's not an if, it's a when.""

In the years since Schellestede's wind project proposal, the industry has moved forward in fits and starts. In 2016, the small scale 30-megawatt Block Island Wind Farm off the coast of Rhode Island became the first U.S. offshore wind project to be completed.

Cape Wind, the first large-scale offshore wind project in the United States off the shores of Massachusetts, was canceled the following year after 16 years of controversy.

In 2020, a 12-MW pilot project -- the first in federally controlled waters -- came online off Virginia's coast.

So far this year, the industry has made historic progress as South Fork Wind Farm off New York began producing 132 MW of electricity, and Massachusetts' Vineyard Wind started spinning the first five of 62 turbines, sending 68 MW of power to the grid. At full operation, the wind farm is designed to generate 805 MW.

By contrast, worldwide there are almost 73,000 MW, or 73 gigawatts, of offshore wind operating, with half of that amount off China's coast.

Some of the delay in the U.S. industry occurred during Donald Trump's presidency. His administration held no offshore lease sales for federally owned waters. Trump ordered an environmental review for the Atlantic Coast, killing or delaying projects in various states of development.

As he did in his May 12 speech in New Jersey, Trump often repeats the falsehood that offshore wind is killing whales -- a claim dismissed by the federal government's own scientists. But groups funded by or tied to oil and gas interests including the American Petroleum Institute continue to perpetuate it, insisting offshore wind also harms fisheries and tourism.

""There is zero evidence for offshore wind activities causing whale deaths,"" said Helen Rose Patterson, senior campaign manager with National Wildlife Federation's offshore wind energy program. Patterson calls the claims ""disinformation,"" or false information that is intentionally spread.

She said the greatest threat to the whales is climate change, which offshore wind could help mitigate. North American right whales now must travel farther north to hunt their cold water prey, Patterson said, putting them closer to ships and fishing that put them at risk. ""The North Atlantic right whales are in different places because of climate change.""

When Joe Biden took office in 2021, he ordered a 180-degree turn on federal offshore wind policy.

During his first year in office, the Democrat established a target to deploy 30 GW of offshore wind -- the equivalent of about 30 new nuclear plants -- by 2030 to help reach his national climate goal of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.

So far, the administration has approved 10 GW of offshore projects and is expected to approve more by the end of the year in what some observers see as a rush to get more wind farms started in the event Trump wins the November election.

At the Oceantic Network conference in New Orleans, Interior Secretary Deb Haaland announced 12 offshore wind leasing sales over the next five years, ranging from New York to Hawaii and the Gulf of Mexico to the state of Oregon. Biden previously announced $5 billion in federally issued loan guarantees to boost offshore wind development.

Although Schellstede and his company, Wind Energy Systems Technology (WEST), failed to get interest for the project in Louisiana, Texas welcomed them. Texas saw offshore wind as a way to expand on its extensive energy resources, state officials said at the time.

Texas wasn't the only entity aiming to diversify. Big oil companies including Shell and BP and other international oil interests began adding wind to their own portfolios. In fact, the two oil giants were major sponsors of the offshore wind conference in New Orleans.

""It's not greenwashing,"" said Patterson of the oil majors investing in offshore wind. ""I'm much more concerned about oil and gas that aren't doing anything to diversify their portfolios.""

Since WEST tried to establish a wind farm off Galveston nearly 20 years ago, top Texas officials have become resistant to offshore wind energy. Last year, Texas Railroad Commissioner Wayne Christian told Gov. Greg Abbott that he opposes offshore wind, calling it a ""taxpayer boondoggle"" and repeating the false claims about offshore wind causing whale deaths.

The Texas land commissioner followed with her own opposition to the Biden Administration's plan to lease federal land off the state's coast for offshore wind. And the powerful Texas Public Policy Foundation, funded by conservative billionaires including oil baron Charles Koch, is leading offshore opposition along the East Coast.

Economically, it is also hard for more expensive offshore wind to compete with the abundance of renewable energy that Texas already has. Currently, Texas can supply 70% of its electricity demand through renewable power. The cost of offshore wind over the lifespan of the project, or levelized cost of energy, is up to double that of onshore wind -- but is cheaper than coal or nuclear power.

In Louisiana, even the most conservative Republicans have come to see things the way Schellstede did in the 2000s -- that Louisiana has the workforce, the industrial infrastructure and the knowledge to spur offshore wind, not only off the state's Gulf Coast, but around the country.

On May 11, the day before Trump said he would end offshore wind, House majority leader and Trump supporter U.S. Rep. Steve Scalise, R-Louisiana, watched as his wife Jennifer christened the nation's first offshore wind service vessel. Scalise has been a vocal supporter of the industry.

""I think in terms of contrast -- that really represented the opportunity that I see in Louisiana,"" said Jenny Netherton, Louisiana program manager for the nonprofit Southeastern Wind Coalition, who attended the christening in New Orleans.

""People think of us as an oil and gas state, and we are just an energy state,"" Netherton said. ""Because of offshore oil and gas, we have developed this huge vessel industry that is needed for offshore wind. We can build a lot -- and pretty quickly.""

The christened vessel, the Eco Edison, was commissioned by Danish wind developer Orsted and built by Louisiana's Edison Chouest Offshore. The vessel will service offshore wind in the Atlantic.

A recent report released at the conference by the Southeastern Wind Coalition, Greater New Orleans Inc., the Center for Planning Excellence and The Pew Charitable Trusts found there are 450 companies in Louisiana with the potential to shift toward offshore wind. Fifteen companies in the state already work on offshore wind, including Gulf Island Fabrication, which made the steel structures that support the turbines and other equipment for the Block Island wind farm.

""Louisiana can lead in wind power the same way it has led in oil and gas production,"" Lacy McManus, executive director of future energy for Greater New Orleans Inc., said in announcing the report.

Louisiana's former Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards set a goal of 5,000 MW of offshore wind by 2035. The state has leased its own land under nearshore waters to Vestas and Diamond Offshore Wind for potential development. And in last year's federal sale, RWE leased an offshore parcel in southwest Louisiana. Both projects are still in early stages of development.

It's unclear whether Republican Gov. Jeff Landry supports Edwards' goals; so far the governor, who took office in January, has said nothing publicly about offshore wind. His office did not return a request asking for the governor's position.

""While I have not spoken with Gov. Landry personally, we have heard that he favors the 'all of the above' energy approach,"" Camille Manning-Broome, CEO and president for the nonprofit Center for Planning Excellence in Baton Rouge, told Floodlight. ""Our work with state agency partners does lend itself to continuing this approach of bringing additional sources of energy to the gulf and diversifying our energy portfolio.""

Joshua Basseches is an assistant professor at Tulane University in New Orleans whose work focuses on energy and climate policy and politics. Basseches said he expects disinformation campaigns, like those on the East Coast around whales, along with opposition from the regional fishing industry, might make offshore wind in the Gulf of Mexico difficult.

Others are skeptical of the economics. It will be harder for offshore wind power to compete against the region's favored natural gas power plants, which produce lower cost energy. And building offshore wind farms in the Gulf of Mexico might be more expensive and less efficient than those being built elsewhere because of the risks of hurricanes and its relatively lower wind speeds.

""It doesn't really make a lot of sense,"" BloombergNEF analyst Chelsea Jean-Michel told Heatmap last year. The company, which researches the technologies driving the transition to a lower-carbon economy, confirmed in an email to Floodlight its opinion about the feasibility of offshore wind in the Gulf of Mexico has not changed.

""It's got to be economic. It has to produce the power at a low cost,"" Schellstede agreed. ""It will be interesting to see how this all settles out.""",insideclimatenews.org,news,InsideClimate News,Derek Harrison,0.05882352941176472,454843877,13,https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/eco_edison-1024x683.jpg,eng-9603774

Swiss landmark decision on the admissibility of intra-EU investment arbitration

By Michael Feit Dr. iur., LL.M., Attorney at Law Partner Direct phone: +41 58 658 55 08 [email protected]

and Francesca Borio MLaw, Attorney at Law Senior Associate Direct phone: +41 58 658 57 61 [email protected]

The legal and political backdrop or the ""crusade"" of the EU against investment arbitration

In March 2018, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) decided in Slovak Republic v. Achmea B.V. that the arbitration clause contained in the bilateral investment treaty (BIT) between the Netherlands and Slovakia was incompatible with EU law. This judgment steered EU law into collision course with investment arbitration.

In May 2020, 23 EU member states signed the Agreement for the termination of Bilateral Investment Treaties between the Member States of the European Union (Termination Agreement), by which all intra-EU BITs between the signatories were terminated. In the Termination Agreement, the signatories confirmed that intra-EU BIT arbitration clauses were ""contrary to the EU Treaties and thus inapplicable"".

The CJEU rendered further judgments confirming the incompatibility of intra-EU investment arbitration clauses with EU law, namely Republic of Moldova v. Komstroy LLC in September 2021 (regarding the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT)), Republic of Poland v. PL Holdings Srl in October 2021 (regarding ad hoc arbitration), and the DA v. Romatsa et al. decision in September 2022 (regarding the unenforceability of the Ioan Micula, Viorel Micula et al. v. Romania ICSID award).

In April 2024, the European Parliament voted for a withdrawal of the EU from the ECT.

Most recently, Spain (the appellant before the Swiss Supreme Court (Court)) announced in May 2024 in the State Official Gazette its withdrawal from the ECT. This decision was taken after investors had initiated numerous arbitrations against Spain in relation to its renewable energy reforms.

The Swiss landmark decision

By decision 4A_244/2023 dated 3 April 2024, the Court upheld jurisdiction of a Swiss seated ad hoc arbitral tribunal over a claim brought by a French investor against Spain under the ECT.

In the arbitration proceeding, Spain objected that the tribunal lacked jurisdiction to hear a claim between an investor from an EU member state and an EU member state. The tribunal dismissed the objection, and Spain filed a set-aside application before the Court.

In its introductory remarks, the Court commented that for several years now, EU bodies had been waging a ""crusade against international arbitration"" regarding intra-EU disputes. The Court did not mince words in its decision.

The Court noted that state courts outside of the EU have no obligation to adhere to EU law. Therefore, decisions rendered by the CJEU, and thus also the Komstroy judgement, are not binding on a Swiss court deciding on a set-aside application against an award rendered by a Swiss seated tribunal.

The Court further stated that it generally accepts the opinion expressed by the supreme court of the state that enacted

the foreign law in question. However, the Court is more reluctant to do so when the question arises whether the rules adopted by a community of states, such as the EU, take precedence over rights deriving from a multilateral treaty, such as the ECT. In case of a conflict between these rules, the community of states may be tempted, as in Komstroy, to assert the primacy of its own law over that of the multilateral treaty.

Following a detailed analysis, the Court concluded that the unconditional consent given by Spain in the arbitration clause contained in Article 26 ECT did not exclude intra-EU disputes.

The Court also rejected the notion that there was a conflict between Article 26 ECT and EU law. The Court was not convinced by the reasoning given in Komstroy, noting that it was essentially, if not exclusively, based on the requirement to preserve the autonomy of EU law, without taking any account of international law or the rules of interpretation of treaties.

The Court continued that even if Article 26 ECT were incompatible with EU law, nothing under public international law would suggest that EU law should take precedence over the ECT.

In conclusion, the Court dismissed the set-aside application.

Recent trends and the impact of the decision

Without being exhaustive, the following trends can be observed inside and outside of the EU:

Arbitral tribunals routinely confirm their jurisdiction in intra-EU disputes. By way of example, in the ICSID arbitration Adria Group B.V. and Adria Group Holding B.V. v. Croatia, the tribunal rejected in October 2023 Croatia's objection that it lacked jurisdiction to hear the investors' claims

arising out of the Croatia-Netherlands BIT. The notable exception to the rule constitutes Green Power Partners K/S and SCE Solar Don Benito APS v. Spain, in which the tribunal declined its jurisdiction under the ECT because it was an intra-EU dispute.

State courts within the EU are expected to deny the existence of a valid arbitration agreement in intra-EU disputes. In Germany, for example, a party can prior to the constitution of the tribunal request a state court to declare the arbitration proceedings inadmissible. On that basis, and upon application by Croatia, the Higher Regional Court of Frankfurt declared a German-seated UNCITRAL arbitration brought by Austrian investors under the Austria-Croatia BIT inadmissible.

Pursuant to the German Supreme Court, a party can even file such an application against ICSID arbitrations brought under the ECT. In line therewith, German courts declared the ICSID arbitrations Mainstream Renewable Power Ltd and others v. Germany, Uniper SE, Uniper Benelux Holding B.V. and Uniper Benelux N.V. v. Netherlands and RWE AG and RWE Eemshaven Holding II BV v. Netherlands inadmissible.

Similarly, state courts within the EU have set aside awards on intra-EU grounds (such as in the matters Triodos SICAV II v. Spain, Norvenergia II - Energy & Environment (SCA) (Grand Duchy of Luxembourg), SICAR v. Spain and PL Holdings in Sweden) and have refused to enforce intra-EU ICSID awards (such as in the matter Micula in Luxemburg and Sweden).

However, when enforcement actions are brought outside of the EU, EU state courts tend not to interfere. By way of illustration, the Landgericht Essen dismissed in April 2024 Spain's request for an anti-enforcement injunction to

prevent the enforcement of the intra-EU ICSID award in RWE Innogy GmbH and RWE Innogy Aersa S.A.U. v. Spain in the United States, holding that no obligation exists under the CJEU case law to resist enforcement of ICSID awards outside of the EU.

State courts outside of the EU generally allow enforcement of intra-EU awards, even though there are some uncertainties.

In recognition and enforcement proceedings of an ICSID award under the ECT in the United Kingdom, the High Court ruled in Infrastructure Services and Energia Termosolar B.V. v. Spain that the EU Treaties and the Achmea and Komstroy judgments do not trump pre-existing treaty obligations under the ICSID Convention. Therefore, EU law does not constitute a legal basis to refuse the enforcement of ICSID awards.

In the United States, two district judges rendered opposing decisions with regard to Spain's request to dismiss the investors' petitions to enforce awards based on the case law of the CJEU. One district court judge rejected Spain's intra-EU objection with regard to the two ICSID awards 9REN Holding S..R.L. v. Spain and NextEra Energy Global Holdings B.V. v. Spain. In contrast thereto, the other district court judge dismissed the petition to enforce the award rendered by an ad hoc Geneva seated UNCITRAL tribunal in Blasket Renewable Investments LLC v. Spain. The three enforcement proceedings are currently pending before the DC Circuit Court of Appeals.

In this context, what is the potential impact of the Court's decision? A number of commentators criticized the CJEU for limiting its analysis to EU law. The Court, however, conducted a broader international law assessment and its decision has been widely lauded as wellreasoned. State courts outside of the EU

2

faced with set-aside and enforcement requests might, therefore, take guidance by the decision of the Court. The decision could, thus, further tip the scale in favor of upholding jurisdiction and enforcement.

Conclusion

Within the EU, intra-EU disputes face, as some commentators noted, a hostile environment. Outside of the EU, however, the recent decision of the Court confirms the trend that intra-EU investment arbitrations are viewed as valid and enforceable. EU investors are, therefore, well advised to place the seat of the arbitration and to seek enforcement in a non-EU state. To increase protection, however, investors should consider taking proactive steps by structuring their investments within the EU through a non-EU state. Switzerland with its leading investment protection network is an excellent choice.

Yearly installation capacity is expected to double over the next few years, from a forecast 5 GW in 2024 to 12 GW of new capacity by 2026. It will then remain stable at around 10 GW annually until 2029, when we expect a jump in installations to about 20 GW. Overall, the expected Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) towards 2030 will be 32% in both established and emerging markets. Europe is persistently advancing towards greater renewable energy adoption and is projected to be the clear market leader, with 107 GW cumulative installations anticipated by 2030 out of a predicted about 137 GW total offshore wind capacity (excluding China). APAC is expected to become the second-largest region, with a development target of 17 GW by 2030, followed by the Americas with 12 GW.

2023 concluded with a record 4.2 GW of new offshore wind farms coming online in Europe, a 40% increase over 2022. These numbers position 2023 as the best year on record for new offshore wind installations across Europe. The Netherlands, France, and the UK led capacity installation, with the Hollandse Kust Zuid 1.5 GW project now recognised as the world's largest operational wind farm. 2023 was also a record year for FIDs, with more than 12 GW of projects reaching investment decisions, 9 GW of which was in Europe.

Nevertheless, challenges persist. Factors such as high interest rates, supply chain bottlenecks, and wavering political commitments complicate the growth trends. European developers respond by refining their strategic focus and narrowing their scope to core markets. Notably, RWE is expanding in the UK with the procurement of Vattenfall's Norfolk Trio, while Ørsted is exiting several offshore wind markets, such as Norway, Spain, and Portugal. Despite these shifts, the overall outlook for offshore wind in Europe remains largely unaffected.

By Pam Radtke/Floodlight | This story was originally published by Floodlight.

In the early 2000s, a long-time Louisiana engineer and entrepreneur thought it would be natural for the oil and gas industry in the Gulf of Mexico to expand into offshore wind. The industry could use the same workforce, the same shipyards and possibly even the same platforms to generate renewable power.

With designs, data and offshore leases from Texas, Herman Schellstede and his team planned to build a 62-turbine wind farm off Galveston's coast -- one of the first such proposals in the United States and the first in the Gulf of Mexico.

The team approached banks and even Koch Industries seeking financing for the $300 million wind farm, he said. But financing nascent offshore wind was apparently too risky a proposition in the wake of the 2008 financial meltdown. The wind farm was eventually scuttled.

""We were still too early,"" said Schellstede, the Louisiana oil and gas entrepreneur who is still designing offshore wind turbines for proposed projects in the gulf.

Now, 33 years after the first offshore wind farm was built in waters off Denmark, it's still unclear if the time is right -- or will ever be right -- for the United States. In those years, only four wind farms generating 242 megawatts of power have been built off the U.S. coast; the largest just went into service in 2024.

Last year, inflation, supply chain problems and other macroeconomic issues led to the cancellation or renegotiation of about half of all proposed offshore wind projects. And while the Biden Administration is moving as quickly as possible to approve new lease sales and projects -- expanding the amount of power generated by 10-fold -- former President Donald Trump has promised to end offshore wind if elected.

The industry and advocates, however, do not seem daunted. Studies show offshore wind could meet 5% of the nation's energy needs by 2035, and up to 25% by 2050.

""We're all in this room today, not because we just see offshore wind as a massive opportunity -- which it is to build you clean energy -- but also we see the necessity of offshore wind,"" said Amanda Lefton, vice president of offshore development for the renewable energy company RWE.

Lefton, speaking at an April conference of the offshore wind industry in New Orleans, said the technology is needed to meet national and state decarbonization goals. RWE is developing projects off the East Coast and California and working to create a supply chain for offshore wind in the Gulf of Mexico with a large Louisiana-based coalition.

""We know the fundamentals exist in these markets,"" said Lefton, the former head of the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management who leads RWE's East Coast operations. ""We know that it's not an if, it's a when.""

Offshore wind's rocky history

In the years since Schellestede's wind project proposal, the industry has moved forward in fits and starts. In 2016, the small scale 30-megawatt Block Island Wind Farm off the coast of Rhode Island became the first U.S. offshore wind project to be completed.

Cape Wind, the first large-scale offshore wind project in the United States off the shores of Massachusetts, was canceled the following year after 16 years of controversy.

In 2020, a 12-MW pilot project -- the first in federally controlled waters -- came online off Virginia's coast.

So far this year, the industry has made historic progress as South Fork Wind Farm off New York began producing 132 MW of electricity, and Massachusetts' Vineyard Wind started spinning the first five of 62 turbines, sending 68 MW of power to the grid. At full operation, the wind farm is designed to generate 805 MW.

By contrast, worldwide there are almost 73,000 MW, or 73 gigawatts, of offshore wind operating, with half of that amount off China's coast.

Some of the delay in the U.S. industry occurred during Donald Trump's presidency. His administration held no offshore lease sales for federally owned waters. Trump ordered an environmental review for the Atlantic Coast, killing or delaying projects in various states of development.

As he did in his May 12 speech in New Jersey, Trump often repeats the falsehood that offshore wind is killing whales -- a claim dismissed by the federal government's own scientists. But groups funded by or tied to oil and gas interests including the American Petroleum Institute continue to perpetuate it, insisting offshore wind also harms fisheries and tourism.

""There is zero evidence for offshore wind activities causing whale deaths,"" said Helen Rose Patterson, senior campaign manager with National Wildlife Federation's offshore wind energy program. Patterson calls the claims ""disinformation,"" or false information that is intentionally spread.

She said the greatest threat to the whales is climate change, which offshore wind could help mitigate. North American right whales now must travel farther north to hunt their cold water prey, Patterson said, putting them closer to ships and fishing that put them at risk. ""The North Atlantic right whales are in different places because of climate change.""

Biden pushes to revive industry

When Joe Biden took office in 2021, he ordered a 180-degree turn on federal offshore wind policy.

During his first year in office, the Democrat established a target to deploy 30 GW of offshore wind -- the equivalent of about 30 new nuclear plants -- by 2030 to help reach his national climate goal of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.

So far, the administration has approved 10 GW of offshore projects and is expected to approve more by the end of the year in what some observers see as a rush to get more wind farms started in the event Trump wins the November election.

At the Oceantic Network conference in New Orleans, Interior Secretary Deb Haaland announced 12 offshore wind leasing sales over the next five years, ranging from New York to Hawaii and the Gulf of Mexico to the state of Oregon. Biden previously announced $5 billion in federally issued loan guarantees to boost offshore wind development.

Offshore political winds shift in Texas

Although Schellstede and his company, Wind Energy Systems Technology (WEST), failed to get interest for the project in Louisiana, Texas welcomed them. Texas saw offshore wind as a way to expand on its extensive energy resources, state officials said at the time.

Texas wasn't the only entity aiming to diversify. Big oil companies including Shell and BP and other international oil interests began adding wind to their own portfolios. In fact, the two oil giants were major sponsors of the offshore wind conference in New Orleans.

""It's not greenwashing,"" said Patterson of the oil majors investing in offshore wind. ""I'm much more concerned about oil and gas that aren't doing anything to diversify their portfolios.""

Since WEST tried to establish a wind farm off Galveston nearly 20 years ago, top Texas officials have become resistant to offshore wind energy. Last year, Texas Railroad Commissioner Wayne Christian told Gov. Greg Abbott that he opposes offshore wind, calling it a ""taxpayer boondoggle"" and repeating the false claims about offshore wind causing whale deaths.

The Texas land commissioner followed with her own opposition to the Biden Administration's plan to lease federal land off the state's coast for offshore wind. And the powerful Texas Public Policy Foundation, funded by conservative billionaires including oil baron Charles Koch, is leading offshore opposition along the East Coast.

Economically, it is also hard for more expensive offshore wind to compete with the abundance of renewable energy that Texas already has. Currently, Texas can supply 70% of its electricity demand through renewable power. The cost of offshore wind over the lifespan of the project, or levelized cost of energy, is up to double that of onshore wind -- but is cheaper than coal or nuclear power.

'Energy state' Louisiana eyes offshore

In Louisiana, even the most conservative Republicans have come to see things the way Schellstede did in the 2000s -- that Louisiana has the workforce, the industrial infrastructure and the knowledge to spur offshore wind, not only off the state's Gulf Coast, but around the country.

On May 11, the day before Trump said he would end offshore wind, House majority leader and Trump supporter U.S. Rep. Steve Scalise, R-Louisiana, watched as his wife Jennifer christened the nation's first offshore wind service vessel. Scalise has been a vocal supporter of the industry.

""I think in terms of contrast -- that really represented the opportunity that I see in Louisiana,"" said Jenny Netherton, Louisiana program manager for the nonprofit Southeastern Wind Coalition, who attended the christening in New Orleans.

""People think of us as an oil and gas state, and we are just an energy state,"" Netherton said. ""Because of offshore oil and gas, we have developed this huge vessel industry that is needed for offshore wind. We can build a lot -- and pretty quickly.""

The christened vessel, the Eco Edison, was commissioned by Danish wind developer Orsted and built by Louisiana's Edison Chouest Offshore. The vessel will service offshore wind in the Atlantic.

A recent report released at the conference by the Southeastern Wind Coalition, Greater New Orleans Inc., the Center for Planning Excellence and The Pew Charitable Trusts found there are 450 companies in Louisiana with the potential to shift toward offshore wind. Fifteen companies in the state already work on offshore wind, including Gulf Island Fabrication, which made the steel structures that support the turbines and other equipment for the Block Island wind farm.

""Louisiana can lead in wind power the same way it has led in oil and gas production,"" Lacy McManus, executive director of future energy for Greater New Orleans Inc., said in announcing the report.

Louisiana's former Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards set a goal of 5,000 MW of offshore wind by 2035. The state has leased its own land under nearshore waters to Vestas and Diamond Offshore Wind for potential development. And in last year's federal sale, RWE leased an offshore parcel in southwest Louisiana. Both projects are still in early stages of development.

It's unclear whether Republican Gov. Jeff Landry supports Edwards' goals; so far the governor, who took office in January, has said nothing publicly about offshore wind. His office did not return a request asking for the governor's position.

""While I have not spoken with Gov. Landry personally, we have heard that he favors the 'all of the above' energy approach,"" Camille Manning-Broome, CEO and president for the nonprofit Center for Planning Excellence in Baton Rouge, told Floodlight. ""Our work with state agency partners does lend itself to continuing this approach of bringing additional sources of energy to the gulf and diversifying our energy portfolio.""

Headwinds to offshore remain

Joshua Basseches is an assistant professor at Tulane University in New Orleans whose work focuses on energy and climate policy and politics. Basseches said he expects disinformation campaigns, like those on the East Coast around whales, along with opposition from the regional fishing industry, might make offshore wind in the Gulf of Mexico difficult.

Others are skeptical of the economics. It will be harder for offshore wind power to compete against the region's favored natural gas power plants, which produce lower cost energy. And building offshore wind farms in the Gulf of Mexico might be more expensive and less efficient than those being built elsewhere because of the risks of hurricanes and its relatively lower wind speeds.

""It doesn't really make a lot of sense,"" BloombergNEF analyst Chelsea Jean-Michel told Heatmap last year. The company, which researches the technologies driving the transition to a lower-carbon economy, confirmed in an email to Floodlight its opinion about the feasibility of offshore wind in the Gulf of Mexico has not changed.

""It's got to be economic. It has to produce the power at a low cost,"" Schellstede agreed. ""It will be interesting to see how this all settles out.""",renewableenergyworld.com,news,Renewable Energy World,,0.05882352941176472,454788467,13,https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/eco_edison.jpg,eng-9603774

This announcement has been deemed crucial to achieving climate neutrality by Federal Economics Minister Habeck. Industry experts are also optimistic about the endeavor, believing it will aid many consumers.

The beginning of construction on the German side of the direct electricity link between the UK and Germany, dubbed ""NeuConnect,"" was commemorated in Wilhelmshaven with a symbolic ceremony. The global consortium funding this project will cover the investment costs. Robert Habeck, the Federal Economics Minister, stressed the significance of starting construction on the first direct German-British electricity link for the targeted climate neutrality and security of supply of both countries.

Planned with a capacity of 1.4 gigawatts, the electric cable is expected to provide electricity to up to 1.5 million households. Its completion is slated for 2028. NeuConnect is predicted to elevate the security of electricity supply and positively impact prices.

Addressing the media, Habeck explained, ""A climate-neutral electricity system necessitates flexibility. That's why we're not only increasing the German electricity grids but also providing power lines to our neighbors."" The initiation of this electricity connection signifies one of many stepping stones toward decarbonization alongside maintaining the maximum security of supply. This German-British collaboration is seen as a promising开端 for future joint ventures.

In addition to Habeck, the British minister of state for Trade Policy, Gregory Hands, and Lower Saxony's Economics Minister, Olaf Lies, will also attend the ground-breaking ceremony in Wilhelmshaven. This electricity connection will connect the German and British transmission grids approximately 720 kilometers apart.

The electricity link will extend from the proposed Isle of Grain substation in Kent to the Fedderwarden substation in Wilhelmshaven, crossing Dutch territory. The German line's length is 193 kilometers. The cable is designed to be submerged under the North Sea and buried underground on the German land section.

The ministry mentions that with the UK's objective of becoming climate-neutral by mid-century, it possesses extensive potential for offshore wind energy and plans to raise its installed capacity to 50 gigawatts by 2030. ""Green electricity will be sent to Germany through NeuConnect in the future,"" states the ministry.

The Association of German Engineers (VDI) expresses support for the project, as it will alleviate the pressure on consumers and boost the price-to-performance ratio. ""The ground-breaking ceremony for the first direct electricity connection between the UK and Germany is yet another integral component in ensuring a secure electricity supply in Europe,"" asserted VDI energy expert Harald Bradke. ""These interconnectors will foster the exchange of electricity among Europe's power grids and promote competition and stability.""

The Federal Network Agency reports that Germany already has connections with all its neighbors and Sweden/Norway. By 2022, the excess electricity generated by German producers had been exported. The following year, imports surpassed exports, partially due to price differences. Higher expenses for wind turbines as well as their financing have temporarily halted the advancement of additional wind farms. The current sixth round of funding for renewable energy projects could serve as a catalyst. The bulk of the funding allocation, 800 million pounds, will be allocated to offshore wind energy projects.

The UK, eager to become climate-neutral, has numerous wind farm projects planned in the North Sea. German corporations are pivotal participants in the British offshore wind energy industry. RWE, a federally owned company, is one of the largest wind farm developers in the country with ten current and nine proposed offshore projects. Likewise, EnBW is actively constructing three offshore wind farms along the British coast.

However, the industry experiences challenges. Rising costs for wind turbines and funding have imposed constraints on the progress of new wind farms.

Germany and the United Kingdom are joining forces to create a 720-kilometers-long electricity link; its completion is slated for 2028. Federal Economics Minister Habeck claims it will advance climate neutrality and improve electricity supply for both countries. Industry experts forecast this project will help alleviate the strain on consumers and result in improved price-to-performance ratios for electricity. The cable will run from England to Germany, connecting the two countries' transmission grids while providing green electricity. After decades of relying primarily on carbon-based sources, Germany and the UK are uniting in a substantial effort to expand their offshore wind energy capacities, with many established German companies working in the British market. However, the offshore renewable energy sector currently faces financial hurdles.",aussiedlerbote.de,news,aussiedlerbote.de,,0.2078431372549019,454777880,1,https://cdn.aussiedlerbote.de/content/images/2024/05/21/279859/jpeg/4-3/1200/75/germany-plans-to-construct-a-massive-power-line-linking-to-england.webp,eng-9603774

The company's intends to construct such hydrogen-fired facilities at its power plant sites in the country to support a successful coal phase-out by the end of this decade.

After extensive technical discussions, RWE has engaged an Italian-Spanish consortium to oversee the project's planning. The consortium is made up of Italy-based Ansaldo Energia and Spanish firm Tecnicas Reunidas.

The three parties have signed a contract which includes approval planning for the power plant as the initial step.

RWE said that the planning process for the hydrogen-ready CCGT power plant is already going on. This serves as a prerequisite for the German energy company to commence project implementation once an investment decision is achieved.

Located in Werne-Stockum, Unna district, the Gersteinwerk power plant has generated electricity since 1917. It is a combined-cycle gas and steam turbine power with a total generation capacity of over 1GW.

As per RWE's current planning, the H2-fired Gersteinwerk plant could start operations by 2030.

During commissioning, the plant is expected to utilise a fuel mix containing a minimum of 50% hydrogen content, with plans to transition operating entirely on hydrogen at a later stage.

RWE Generation CEO Nikolaus Valerius said: ""With the approval planning for a hydrogen-ready gas-fired power plant at the Gersteinwerk, we are taking proactive measures to keep the chance of completion by 2030 open.

RWE is planning to build hydrogen-ready gas-fired power plants at the company's power plant sites in Germany to contribute to a successful coal phase-out by 2030.

Following Weisweiler in the Rhenish mining area, the company is now pressing ahead with plans for such a plant at a possible second site in Werne in the southern Münsterland region.

An H2-ready combined-cycle gas turbine (CCGT) power plant with a nominal capacity of around 800 megawatts may be built at the Gersteinwerk power plant.

Following intensive technical soundings, RWE has commissioned an Italian-Spanish consortium to plan the project.

Work on the planning approval process is already underway.

Nikolaus Valerius, CEO RWE Generation SE:

with the approval planning for a hydrogen-ready gas-fired power plant at the Gersteinwerk, we are taking proactive measures to keep the chance of completion by 2030 open; with the construction of the new power plant, we are ready to contribute to green security of supply and thus secure the coal phase-out by 2030; this requires policymakers to quickly make some key decisions: we can only make a final investment decision once the connection of the site to a hydrogen network has been secured and the framework conditions allow for a commercially viable operation of the power plants. The German government has announced that its power plant strategy will soon create a regulatory framework for tendering hydrogen-ready gas-fired power plants.

RWE intends to participate in these tenders. According to the recently presented plans for the construction of a hydrogen infrastructure in Germany, the Gerstein plant in Werne could be located close to a hydrogen transport pipeline in the future.

A consortium consisting of Ansaldo Energia (Italy) and Tecnicas Reunidas (Spain) has won RWE's tender for the hydrogen-ready CCGT. The contract signed by the three partners includes approval planning for the power plant as a first step.

Work on the planning process is already underway.

This is the prerequisite for RWE to be able to start implementing the project as soon as an investment decision has been made.

According to current planning, the plant in Werne could start producing electricity by 2030.

We will be three years old later this year, and the incorporation of EastWind as an independent legal entity was always one of our objectives. It is allowing us to build on the informal agreements and arrangements that we already had in place, and to provide clarity between our partners as to how we can work together going forward.

Our ambition as the East of England's offshore wind cluster is to be able to do more for our network. Whether that's looking for additional funding or grants, or forging relationships and forming partnerships with other clusters and sectors.

Many of these opportunities are only available to formal entities, so, formalising EastWind as a company allows us to explore opportunities for the cluster's benefit.

Since we made the announcement of our transition to a Company Limited by Guarantee and the appointment of a dedicated project management resource at our member forum in February, we've been busy reviewing governance arrangements, developing our steering committee with representatives from RWE, ScottishPower Renewables and Opergy, and meeting with key stakeholders across industries, clusters and local authorities.

We've held in excess of 30 face-to-face meetings with organisations such as the ORE Catapult, Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex and Cambridgeshire Chambers of Commerce, county, district and borough councils, the East of England Energy Group (EEEGR), GENERATE, Peel Ports, NOF and Energi-Coast, National Grid and offshore wind developers, to name but a few, all with a genuine interest in the activity taking place in our region.

Information gathered from those meetings has been crucial when looking at the formalisation of our governance arrangements, the development of collaboration agreements and to reflect how, in a formal sense, we can work together to better position the role of offshore wind in the East of England and how we fit with the other energy interests in the region.

As we approach our third year, we aim to strengthen our impact, and with recent announcements of projects such as Equinor's Sheringham Shoal and Dudgeon extensions moving forward and Five Estuaries being accepted for DCO examination, plus RWE's formal acquisition of the Norfolk Offshore Wind Zone, we believe the timing couldn't be better.

We're on the verge of, potentially, so much offshore wind activity in our region. These developments alone represent broadly 6 GW of new offshore wind, which will double the amount of capacity that's in the East of England today, and more importantly, will continue to take the industry on the pathway to 16GW by 2035.

We recognise that much of the development of offshore wind started in our region. For example, the UK's first commercial scale wind farm, Scroby Sands, is off the coast of Great Yarmouth, and the Offshore Wind Sector Deal was launched by then Energy Minister, Claire Perry, in Lowestoft in 2019.

The East of England continues to have the greatest amount of installed capacity in the UK and these developments, and the benefits that come from them, are very exciting for all aspects of the EastWind community.

We've identified three key pillars upon which our outputs will be measured: collaboration, industry and community.

We will continue to serve as a bridge between the developer community, companies and organisations with a direct interest in offshore wind, and, more importantly, the communities in the East of England where those developments will have a positive impact.

In order for us to affect real change, collaboration will become increasingly important, and this is something that we recognise the significance of. By working together, we can identify common goals, optimise resources and address shared challenges to the benefit of the whole sector.

EastWind serves as a platform to facilitate collaboration and harness the collective view of our network. We don't want to lose the momentum that our region has. Initiative and inertia both begin with i, and I'd rather we maintain the initiative rather than divert to a lot of inertia!

The 1.6 GW wind farm cluster is expected to generate enough renewable energy to supply the equivalent of 1,600,000 German households.

This project award is a major milestone for Van Oord because it will be the first project for the brand-new offshore installation vessel Boreas, which is currently under construction. Van Oord's scope includes the installation of 104 extended monopiles as well as the installation of the scour protection. In 2025, 44 monopiles are planned for installation in 2025 and the remaining 60 monopiles in 2027. The Boreas will be the largest offshore installation vessel of its kind, purpose-built for the transport and installation of the next generation foundations and turbines for offshore wind farms. The jack-up vessel, with a crane capacity of more than 3,000 tonnes, can install up to 20 MW wind turbines at sea. It has the capability to fully operate on methanol, drastically reducing its carbon footprint. Green methanol is one of the most promising future fuels as it is produced using only renewable energy sources. As such, it can reduce the carbon footprint of Boreas by more than 78%.

Leading global renewables player RWE has today announced its investment decision to build Australia's first eight-hour battery near Balranald, in New South Wales (NSW). RWE's eight-hour lithium-ion Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) was the only successful project in New South Wales' first Long Duration Storage Long-Term Energy Service Agreements tender process, and was awarded a Long-Term Energy Service Agreement.

With a planned capacity of 50+ megawatts (MW) and 400+ megawatt hours (MWh), the Limondale BESS will support the energy transition by storing excess renewable energy and feeding it into the NSW grid when it is needed most. The project will be located next to RWE's 249 MWac Limondale Solar Farm - which is one of Australia's largest. The BESS will connect to existing grid infrastructure.

Tesla has been selected as the BESS supplier, and Beon Energy Solutions as the delivery partner for the Balance of Plant, which includes the civil, structural, electrical and control works required to connect the Megapack to the existing 33kV substation. Construction is scheduled to start in the second half of this year, with commissioning planned for late 2025.

Katja Wünschel, CEO RWE Renewables Europe & Australia: ""RWE's investment decision and signing of supplier contracts for the Limondale BESS project is an exciting step forward in our commitment to the Australian renewables sector and support of New South Wales' renewable energy ambitions. As a battery storage pioneer, RWE develops, builds and operates innovative and competitive battery storage systems in Europe and the US, and soon here in Australia. We look forward to continuing to work with all stakeholders to help realise the country's renewable energy goals.""

Australia is one of RWE's focus markets, where it has been present since 2013. In 2018, the company began construction of the Limondale solar farm in Balranald, New South Wales. With an installed capacity of 249 MWac the large-scale solar farm is made up of 872,000 panels and generates enough electricity to power about 105,000 homes per year. Full commercial operation started in 2021. RWE's Australian team of more than 70 is currently developing a portfolio of wind, solar, and battery storage projects across the country, supported by the global RWE team. RWE intends to develop up to 3 gigawatts of renewable energy projects in Australia by 2030.

RWE invests in battery storage worldwide

As a driver of the energy transition, RWE develops, builds and operates battery storage systems in Europe, the United States and Australia. Currently, the company operates battery storage systems with an overall capacity of more than 700 MW and 1.2 gigawatts (GW) of battery storage projects under construction worldwide. The company recently commissioned three U.S. battery storage projects totalling 190 MW. As an integral part of its Growing Green strategy, RWE plans to expand its battery storage capacity to 6 GW worldwide by 2030.

RWE

RWE is leading the way to a green energy world. With its investment and growth strategy Growing Green, RWE is contributing significantly to the success of the energy transition and the decarbonisation of the energy system. Around 20,000 employees work for the company in almost 30 countries worldwide. RWE is already one of the leading companies in the field of renewable energy. Between 2024 and 2030, RWE will invest 55 billion euros worldwide in offshore and onshore wind, solar energy, batteries, flexible generation, and hydrogen projects. By the end of the decade, the company's green portfolio will grow to more than 65 gigawatts of generation capacity, which will be perfectly complemented by global energy trading. RWE is decarbonising its business in line with the 1.5-degree reduction pathway and will phase out coal by 2030. RWE will be net-zero by 2040. Fully in line with the company's purpose - Our energy for a sustainable life.

Ammonia produced from electrolysis-generated hydrogen is to become the green energy carrier and sustainable basic chemical of the future. The infrastructure for the import is being created at lightning speed. In Hamburg and Brunsbüttel, new terminals are to start operation in 2026.

In the hydrogen sector, Japan has often been ahead of its time. In 2014, the Japanese government adopted its fourth strategic energy plan. Hydrogen and fuel cells were already high on the list back then. At the same time, various import options were to be investigated. One of them was ammonia.

Ammonia consists, as the chemical formula NH reveals, of nitrogen and hydrogen. If produced from hydrogen obtained electrolytically using renewable energies as well as nitrogen from the ambient air, it could become a climate-friendly energy source of the future. In contrast to pure hydrogen, it is comparatively easy to transport: Ammonia becomes liquid under ambient pressure ""already"" at ‑33 °C or at 20 °C with just under 9 bar. Additionally, the energy density of liquid ammonia lies with 11.4 GJ/m substantially over that of liquid hydrogen with 8.52 GJ/m.

Cracking eats up energy

With so-termed crackers, the ammonia can basically be broken down into hydrogen and nitrogen again. However, this involves an endothermic process. The Fraunhofer Institute for system and innovation research (Fraunhofer ISI) therefore warns in a metastudy on hydrogen import against high conversion losses and high costs when ammonia is used as a carrier to get hydrogen again in the end.

But this is not necessary for all applications, since ammonia can also be used directly as a fuel. Especially in ship transport could ammonia be a promising fuel. Japan wants to use the pungent-smelling gas primarily in coal-fired power plants. There has already been a test run. Starting 2021, the companies JERA and IHI have substituted 20 percent of the fuel in a gigawatt-level coal-fired plant with ammonia. Now, the first commercial terminals are being built. A consortium around Mitsubishi wants to convert a terminal in the port of Namikata to ammonia, and the duo IHI and Vopak are checking where in Japan further import terminals could be built.

Europe setting the pace

Since the energy crisis, Europe has also been flooring it. For this, it is convenient that there are already commercial shipping routes for ammonia. Around 20 million tonnes are transported by ship annually, mainly for the production of fertilizers. That the fertilizer giant Yara International with 15 ships and access to 18 ammonia terminals operates, according to its own information, the largest shipping and logistics network for this is therefore no surprise. But if ammonia is to become an energy source, its transport will need to be able to increase significantly.

At the beginning of 2024, the Dutch Institute for Sustainable Process Technology (ISPT) published a ""Clean Ammonia Roadmap."" Following this, alone in industry cluster Antwerp-Rotterdam-Rhine-Ruhr could up to 25 million tonnes of ""clean"" ammonia be generated and imported. The Port of Rotterdam could develop into a central transshipment and storage site. According to the ISPT study, up to three million tonnes annually could be further transported from the Netherlands and Belgium to Germany.

New and retrofitted terminals

To bring ammonia directly to Germany, several terminals are to be built or expanded. In Hamburg, October 2022, the port company HHLA test-imported ammonia in a shipping container from Abu Dhabi, with which the copper producer Aurubis was able to test the substitution of natural gas - an action that seems rather symbolic. For the real use, the energy company Mabanaft plans an import capacity of 600,000 tonnes per year, which is to be available starting 2026.

On the Blumensand Tank Terminal operated by Mabanaft's subsidiary Oiltanking Deutschland, a tank for the storage of liquid ammonia is to appear. A cracker is to be able to split the ammonia into nitrogen and hydrogen. In preparation for the approval procedure, a so-termed scoping meeting has now taken place with the environmental authority, at which, together with directly affected neighbors, environmental groups and other specialists, the scope of the voluntary environmental impact assessment was discussed.

Via the new terminal in Brunsbüttel, RWE wants to import around 300,000 tonnes of green ammonia annually. Here, too, 2026 is targeted as the starting year. Not really that much when you compare it with the planned LNG terminal, through which 8 billion cubic meters of liquefied natural gas are to be transported to Germany every year. Comparing the energy content, that's about 1,560 GWh of ammonia and 80,000 GWh of LNG.

RWE also announced plans to build a cracker to break down some of the ammonia back into hydrogen and nitrogen. Through the energy loss, the relationship between ammonia and LNG drifts further apart. RWE stressed, however, that a retrofit of the LNG terminal for ammonia is to be later possible.

Fewer headlines than the planned new construction have been made by both existing terminals of Yara in Brunsbüttel and Rostock, Germany, in contrast, which the company has so far only used for its own needs. Already about 600,000 tonnes of ammonia arrive in Rostock annually. In total, according to the company's information, Yara has the ability to deliver 3 million tonnes of clean ammonia, if the demand is available.

Distribution by rail or pipeline

One of the first customers of Yara could be the Leipzig-based natural gas company VNG. The two companies signed a corresponding cooperation agreement in spring 2023. Also Mabanaft in Hamburg has already named the process gas producer Air Products as an anchor customer. RWE is currently examining whether and how ammonia can be further transported by rail in Germany. Also on board is the rail transport company VTG.

The transport of ammonia by rail is not new, but it carries a higher risk than by sea. After all, ammonia not only smells unpleasant, it also attacks the respiratory tract. In the past, accidents involving injuries or even fatalities have repeatedly occurred during transport by train and truck through busy areas, including in Serbia in December 2022 and in the US state of Iowa September 2023. The Bulgarian fertilizer company Agropolychim, after the accident, is now investing in a new fleet of ammonia tankers.

According to a study by Dutch think tank ISPT, pipelines could make the transport of ammonia over land much safer. There are so far around 7,600 kilometers of ammonia pipelines worldwide. In the past 50 years, there have only been eleven accidents, none of which resulting in fatalities.

Where does green ammonia come from?

Before the ammonia can be imported to Germany, however, it must first be produced. A hotspot for this is expected to be Namibia with its H megaproject Hyphen Hydrogen Energy. With the German company Enertrag as shareholder, the path to hydrogen is practically paved out. The megaproject is set to supply one million tonnes of ammonia, generated using wind and solar energy. Of this, RWE has already reserved 300,000 tonnes by means of a letter of intent. But looking at the quantities cited by ISPT, the currently targeted production in Namibia will not suffice.

RWE therefore has also reported a partnership with the Korean LOTTE Chemical and the Japanese Mitsubishi Group. Together, the companies are investigating the establishment of production of up to 10 million metric tons of ammonia per year in the US state of Texas. Involved are both ""blue"" and ""green"" ammonia, and production is to start in 2030. With this, RWE is equally fulfilling a recommendation of Fraunhofer ISI: Join forces with other future importing nations instead of creating a competitive situation.",h2-international.com,news,H2-international,,0.2,454748603,26,https://h2-international.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ammoniak-Testlieferung-Kopie.jpg,eng-9603476

The wind farms will be built in the North Sea, about 50 kilometers north of the island of Juist. Suppliers of the main components have already been selected for the cluster as a whole.

The Nordseecluster is being implemented in two phases - Nordseecluster A and B.

Nordseecluster A is expected to have a total capacity of 660 MW. Manufacturing of some key components has already started. Construction at sea is scheduled to begin next year. By the beginning of 2027, all 44 wind turbines are scheduled to be connected to the grid.

Nordseecluster B is expected to add a further 900 MW of capacity. The 60 turbines are scheduled to start commercial operation from the beginning of 2029.

RWE says that it has selected a number of partners to implement its Nordseecluster project. These include Atlantique Offshore Energy, the maritime energy segment of Chantiers de l'Atlantique, which will supply two offshore transformer substations. Hellenic Cables was selected for the cable manufacture.

The foundations for the wind turbines will be manufactured by Dajin Offshore and will be installed at sea by Van Oord. Vestas will supply the wind turbines (type V236-15.0 MW), each with a capacity of 15 MW. Transport and installation of the wind turbines will be performed by Havfram Wind, using its installation vessels Norse Wind and Norse Energi.

Unlike many of the great Victorian infrastructure projects, it was financed from the public purse.

But in hindsight, Bazalgette's beautiful sewer, which was imitated across England, contained a fatal flaw: household sewage and stormwater drainage ran through the same set of pipes. Even today, heavy rainfall can cause the system to overflow, sending untreated waste straight into rivers.

It's the job of England and Wales's 17 water companies, privatised by Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s, to try to stop this from happening. Their increasing failure to do so - or the public's increasingly low tolerance for any such failure - has created a new Great Stink for the 21st century.

And lodged in the heart of this fracas, at least as the public sees it, is an Australian company: the omnipresent Macquarie Group.

Its 2006-17 part-ownership of Thames Water is widely perceived as the catalyst, or epitome, of everything that has gone wrong: the struggling sewers and filthy waterways, the high household water bills, and the sector's sometimes parlous corporate finances.

""It has really hurt Macquarie in terms of its reputation in the UK, no doubt about that,"" says one seasoned local infrastructure investor.

He doesn't hold Macquarie responsible, but many do. The unravelling of Thames Water - which is now teetering on the verge of debt default and special measures - is frequently sheeted home to the Macquarie period, when Thames Water supposedly dosed up on debt and juiced up its dividends.

In the wash-up, the unforgiving British press labelled the Australian financier a ""vampire kangaroo"". Macquarie has since largely trod the safer terrain of digital infrastructure and renewables investments, but it has never quite shaken the moniker from its back.

More recently, Macquarie has donned a kind of hair shirt: it has pumped more than £1.6 billion ($3.1 billion) of equity into arguably the second-most fragile of the English sector's regional monopolies, Southern Water, with a clear intent to do things differently.

""Macquarie has been so burnt by the perception of what happened at Thames Water that it wants to demonstrate that it knows how to run a water company,"" says one industry observer.

But Macquarie's fresh investment means that its exposure to the fallout from the Thames Water crisis is not just reputational. It's also material: if, or when, the crisis boils over at Thames Water, it could easily spill into the sector at large.

And that also applies to the clutch of other Australian investors in English water assets, including QIC, IFM Investors, Igneo, REST, Spirit Super, Prime Super and SAS Trustee Corp. If Thames Water goes down, so, too, potentially, will the value of investments that ultimately belong to Australian workers and pensioners.

The reckoning is coming soon. On July 11, regulator Ofwat will set out its requirements for every English and Welsh water company for the five years from 2025.

In an initial ruling, which may only be the first salvo in a year-long battle, the companies will learn how much investment Ofwat wants them to sink into their networks, how much they can jack up bills to pay for it, and how much they can send to shareholders.

For the industry and its investors, it's an anxious wait. They're worried that Ofwat's priority is to please its political masters, whose antennae are tuned firmly into the public outrage on both waterway pollution and the cost of living.

This means Ofwat could hit the companies from both sides, capping bill increases while also demanding more investment into sewerage works.

Ofwat chairman Iain Coucher recently signalled as much. In a letter to the companies in March, he said the number of serious pollution incidents was ""still too high"" and ""the pace of reduction not fast enough"". But ""some companies are still paying significant dividends while failing to meet their environmental targets"".

Just in the past few weeks, South-West Water has come under fire from a cabinet minister, who expressed ""anger and frustration"" at the company for having the temerity to pay a dividend while fighting a major cryptosporidium outbreak.

If the regulator takes a tough line, Thames Water may have to go into special measures - and the effect of that could cascade throughout the sector. A shift in perceived risk, particularly regulatory risk, could rattle creditors. And it could sap the value of the equity stakes held by Macquarie and the Australian superannuation funds for years to come.

""The way Ofwat is behaving has alarmed a lot of investors and has caused them to reweight the risk of the whole sector,"" says one industry player.

A year of potential turmoil lies in store. But just how much of it really lies at the feet of Macquarie? And if it wasn't the vampire kangaroo, who has been the real villain?

The case for the prosecution has been made repeatedly in the media. Macquarie saw a company that was generating a solid, regulated annual return, but was not exploiting it. Through securitising the entire business, via a holding company, it could ratchet up Thames Water's gearing.

A clutch of Macquarie's funds joined with other investors, some of whom have stuck with Thames Water, to buy the company from RWE for £2.3 billion in October 2006. Macquarie's contribution was £1.1 billion, for a 48 per cent stake.

Macquarie and its co-investors then set about increasing the ratio of debt to regulatory capital, hitting 80 to 90 per cent in an industry where gearing is normally about 60 per cent. This funded an initial dividend payout in 2007, cementing the idea that Macquarie was loading up the company with debt to fund shareholder returns.

The general view among industry figures contacted by The Australian Financial Review was that all the companies were ramping up debt over this period, but Thames Water was a notable enthusiast. Its particular trick was to add a significant tranche of junior debt at the level of the parent company, Kemble, outside the regulatory ringfence that constrains borrowing at the operating company.

""Most people would feel that the behaviour of Macquarie was exceptional compared to the others. The gearing was higher than all the others. Then, when things became challenging, Thames Water had fewer resources on which to draw,"" says one insider.

In this telling, a roughly £17 billion debt pile left Thames Water ill-equipped for the past few years, when borrowing costs and input costs have risen, and when Ofwat has been busily stepping up penalties and keeping bill revenues in check.

""If the original shareholders profited at someone else's expense, it was first and foremost at the expense of the investors who subsequently bought over the original shareholders' shares at big premia in the decade or so that followed,"" John Earwaker, director of First Economics, said in a recent note.

""Most of these shareholders are now paying a heavy price for buying a company with a capital structure that, in actual fact, is not as efficient as it was sold to them.""

Macquarie, unsurprisingly, sees things differently. At its annual meeting in July, chairman Glenn Stevens and chief executive Shemara Wikramanayake railed against the British media for taking what Wikramanayake called ""a very narrow narrative on things"".

The company followed up in August by publishing a ""factsheet"" to set out its detailed case. Macquarie argues, in effect, that looking at absolute metrics like debt and dividends ignores what really went on at Thames Water during the fund manager's 11-year tenure.

Although debt jumped from £6 billion to £11 billion over the period, the regulated asset base - the investments Thames Water made in infrastructure that can be recouped from future bill revenue, generating returns for investors - expanded from £6.5 billion to £13 billion. On that measure, the gearing ratio declined.

It also says its own favoured measure, the debt-to-EBITDA ratio, largely stayed at 6 to 7 times, much like most other utilities, until the regulator put the squeeze on permitted returns in the mid-2010s.

On distributions, Macquarie says these totalled £1.1 billion over 11 years, comprising £879 million of dividends and £277 million of interest on shareholder loans. Of this, Macquarie's funds - or, more precisely, the institutional investors in those funds - absorbed £508 million.

Another tranche of distributions, totalling £1.6 billion, were not dividends but what Macquarie called ""inter-company movements"" - money shifted from the regulated operator Thames Water to the parent Kemble to repay the junior high-yield debt.

This meant the average annual yield on equity to the 2006 investors was 5 per cent, plus 7 per cent capital growth, for a total of 12 per cent a year. Britain's publicly listed utilities averaged a 10 per cent total shareholder return over the same period, Macquarie said, so Thames was not exceptional.

The factsheet makes unusual reading because, in the interests of reputation management, it almost seeks to downplay the relative success of the investment - not a trait normally associated with Macquarie.

But Macquarie does try to contrast its own stewardship with that of the subsequent owners, fielding data that suggests Thames Water's capital expenditure, regulated capital value and some of its debt ratios have worsened since 2018.

For good measure, it also suggests that Thames Water's investment in infrastructure - as measured by inflation-adjusted average annual capital expenditure - was higher under Macquarie ownership than when the utility was government-owned in the 1980s, when it was publicly listed in the 1990s, and when it was owned by RWE in the early 2000s.

But try telling all this to the public. The water companies have, in the past four to five years, become among the most toxic organisations in the country.

Their suspicion is fuelled by a media storm. The Times has run a year-long campaign against the water companies. Private Eye has a special section called ""Turd of the Week"", singling out the chief executives' remuneration, or lambasting the distribution policies. The 1980s pop singer Feargal Sharkey has been reborn as an activist.

Labour under Jeremy Corbyn promised to renationalise the entire sector - one of the few Corbynite pledges the electorate actually warmed to. The Liberal Democrats are hoping to rev it up as an election campaign issue. The New Statesman recently cited a poll of 6000 people who voted Conservative in 2019, in which more than half said they would consider the government's handling of the sewage crisis when voting this year.

""It has really taken off in the last two years. It's amazing how quickly this has shot up in the public consciousness,"" says Peter Hope, an economist at Oxera Consulting.

One reason, says David Henderson, CEO of the industry body Water UK, is that since 2021 Britain has had one of the toughest regimes for policing overspills and pollution.

""The government brought in legislation to monitor all the overflows. Nobody else does that. France doesn't know how many overflows it has, but in the UK we know what the problem is,"" he says.

But at the same time, government budgetary belt-tightening has eroded the Environment Agency's capacity to police the network and companies, and to maintain the public's trust that the government is on top of the problem.

When you then add in the difficulties that the debt-heavy companies have encountered as interest rates and energy costs spiralled, things look grim.

But appearances can be somewhat deceptive. Moody's Investor Service this year took on the job of figuring out whether the problem is actually any worse in England than elsewhere. And its findings would surprise the singularly disgruntled Brits.

""Treatment of wastewater is good, with more extensive sewage networks and more intensive treatment than other developed economies,"" Moody's analysts reported.

""Although the widespread use of combined sewers results in discharges to waterways, we can find no evidence that this is greater than in other countries, where overflow events are subject to less monitoring.""

England compares favourably with Australia on many metrics, including sewage treatment, although the English system is much leakier. Incredibly, England's coastal sites score better on World Health Organisation-equivalent guidelines than New South Wales.

Another telling statistic in the Moody's report is that the water utilities in Scotland and Northern Ireland, which are state-owned, perform less well than privatised England and Wales on almost every measure. So much for nationalisation as a solution.

The one area where England is a clear laggard is customer satisfaction. ""British households report lower confidence than those in other wealthy countries that water companies are 'doing enough',"" Moody's says.

""This perception creates social risks for water companies because it makes it harder to convince consumers to accept the bill increases that will be needed to support better outcomes.

""They also increase pressure on the UK and Welsh governments and Ofwat ... to change established regulatory approaches and to set increasingly demanding performance targets.""

Oxera's Hope backs this up. ""If we look at the next five years, the whole industry, particularly the sewerage companies, now have far larger investments to do, because of this public concern about the combined sewer outflows,"" he says.

""We've gone from a situation where for decades, the investment has been high in the water industry but fairly stable, to one where it's now going up by multiples. It's a gear change.""

This is where the root of the problem seems to lie. Macquarie's relatively aggressive initial gearing up at Thames Water may not have caused such hardship if it hadn't collided with Ofwat's change of approach.

""Borrowing costs increases were the proximate cause that tipped Thames Water over more recently. But the fundamental change was in the regulatory environment, from a framework that balanced the interests of investors and customers to one that was tilted towards getting bills down,"" says one long-term investor in the industry.

""You can understand that - household budgets were squeezed, there was a political pressure to push the cost of essential services down. But no one foresaw this regulatory change, which happened over the decade from 2009 to 2019.""

The industry's perspective is that if the regulator does not allow bills to increase substantially, they cannot make the investment in infrastructure upgrades that public and government are demanding. They simply won't be able to get investors to fund it.

""Ofwat has an unrealistically low idea of a good return on funds employed. Setting that at 4.5 per cent is not investible,"" says an executive at one of the water companies.

Earwaker agrees: ""There are two conclusions that one might draw at this point,"" he wrote. ""One might be that water companies just haven't been up to the task recently and deserve at least some of the criticism they have been receiving. But an alternative view might be that, with the benefit of hindsight, companies were set an impossible challenge five years ago and are now paying the price for regulatory miscalculation.""

The companies have lodged their bids with Ofwat already, and will be looking for some pretty hefty bill increases. Consumer Council for Water chief executive Mike Keil told the BBC that the public would struggle with this. ""People do want to see improvements, they do understand that takes investment. But I think the scale of [bill increases] being proposed here is going to come as a real shock.""

Ofwat doesn't have it easy. If the regulator's July 11 decision allows the bills to go up too much, it will trigger a political storm. If it doesn't, it could send more of the water companies to the edge of the financial precipice, and even beyond.

""Everyone is holding their breath. An aggressive bid from the regulator in the draft that comes out in July would send panic into the market,"" says one industry insider.

It is already tough to raise money, he says. ""Investors wonder if they can really trust the water regulator, and the politics. Will they ever get a return? You have to raise at a discount to the share price or asset base - that is dilutive and value-destructive.""

Ofwat's July release is just a draft, with a final determination in December. If the companies challenge that, it could take the Competition and Markets Authority until September next year to resolve the spat.

""Companies would continue to operate but would be in a bit of limbo about what their investment and returns would be,"" the insider says.

The industry is vaguely hopeful. One investor says he ""can't see any way forward other than the regulator readjusting the balance a bit more towards investment and financial returns"".

Moody's and Barclays have expressed similar optimism, but with the caveat that the sector's politics can be unpredictable.

Either way, Macquarie will still be right in the thick of it. Its utility Southern Water will need to tap the debt markets again in the coming year, and it will need Ofwat to help restore investor confidence.

Southern Water is also not planning to pay a dividend until performance picks up, even though investors in Macquarie Super Core Infrastructure Fund rely on dividend yield as well as capital growth.

Macquarie Asset Management's head of utilities in Europe, Will Price, says the challenge at Southern, as at all water companies, is to get the Victorian-era combined stormwater and sewerage systems up to scratch, particularly as they come under greater strain from population growth and climate change.

""Another step-change in investment will be needed to deliver new water supplies and leakage reduction alongside a redesign of the waste-water network,"" he tells the Financial Review.

""Moving Southern Water from the bottom quarter of the industry league table will take time, but we are focused on providing the financing and skills that are needed to accelerate its transformation.""

Macquarie's approach to Southern looks and feels very different to the Thames Water story. And the company is certainly keen to make sure of that.

Still, after getting scalded in the British media, it was a bold move on Macquarie's part to go back into the country's water sector.

Perhaps the fund managers involved are keeping the words of Greek philosopher Heraclitus pinned to their corkboards: ""No man ever steps in the same river twice. For it is not the same river, and he is not the same man.""",afr.com,news,Australian Financial Review,,-0.1764705882352942,454706107,5,https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.6457%2C$multiply_2%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_181%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/c_scale%2Cw_800%2Cq_88%2Cf_jpg/t_afr_no_label_no_age_social_wm/d84f1470126200dc055c790a60639a74b94e4f96,eng-9607105

Or follow us on Google News!

With its rough, rocky coast, the US state of Maine may seem one of the least likely places to launch an offshore wind industry. Nevertheless, the Granite State has been prepping for such an event throughout the early 2000s, and all their dreams just might come true.

The big news around Maine is the environmental review for a new offshore lease area. In a statement issued just yesterday, the US Bureau of Ocean Energy Management announced that it has awarded a Final Environmental Assessment for a research-scale offshore wind site southeast of Portland, Maine.

""After carefully considering alternatives described and analyzed in the Final EA, as well as comments from the public and cooperating and consulting agencies on the Draft EA, BOEM finds that the issuance of a wind energy research lease within the proposed lease area offshore Maine, and related site characterization and site assessment activities, would have no significant impact on the environment,"" BOEM stated.

The plan is to launch up to 12 wind turbines in the offshore area, with a combined capacity of up to 144 megawatts.

That's small potatoes compared to other offshore sites along the Atlantic coast, but it's a huge step for a state that is willing to take on unique challenges in the offshore wind area. If all goes according to plan, BOEM anticipates that the Gulf of Maine could yield up to 15 gigawatts' worth of clean offshore kilowatts.

The characterization of the lease area as a research site also means that BOEM can move the approval process forward without having to issue an Environmental Impact Statement, which is required under the National Environmental Policy Act for commercial offshore wind leases.

In case you're wondering how Maine is going to deal with its less-than-optimal coastline, that's a good question. Aside from the rocks and the unusual tidal activity in some areas, much of the state's prime wind resources are located in water too deep for the conventional offshore turbines seen elsewhere along the Atlantic coast, perching on top of tall monopiles sunk into the seabed.

The answer is new floating offshore wind technology. Instead of sitting on monopiles, floating wind turbines deploy on platforms that are tethered to the seabed by cables.

Compared to monopile turbines, floating wind turbines involve a much more complex feat of engineering, which explains why they are only just beginning to emerge in the offshore wind industry (see more floating turbine stories here).

The US Department of Energy has been supporting floating wind research programs here in the US, only to see the technology float off to France and elsewhere.

Part of the challenge is the relatively high cost of floating platforms. That's an angle researchers in Maine have been exploring for years, and progress has been a long time coming.

CleanTechnica caught up with the state of affairs back in 2019, when we noted that wind fans in the state ""suffered a disappointing blow"" several years before, in 2014.

""[F]ormer Governor Paul LePage ixnayed a gigantic offshore wind proposal from Statoil, but he did greenlight a more modest floating wind turbine R&D project involving the University of Maine's 1/8 scale VolturnUS floating wind turbine prototype, spearheaded by the firm Maine Aqua Ventus,"" CleanTechnica noted.

""A generous grant from the US Department of Energy sweetened the pot, and now it looks like all that hard work is about to pay off,"" we added.

In answer to the platform challenge, VolturnUS deploys concrete to help reduce costs. ""The University of Maine's patented VolturnUS is a transformational floating concrete hull technology to harness offshore wind energy with the potential to significantly reduce the cost of offshore wind,"" the school explains.

""VolturnUS can support wind turbines in water depths of 45 meters or more,"" the school also notes.

Concrete is not the first material that comes to mind for flotation. However, the school's Advanced Structures & Composites Center at the University of Maine, explains that the hull design was ""inspired and built like an upside-down bridge"" to resolve that issue.

CleanTechnica caught up with the project last fall, when we observed that the University of Maine project has been paying attention to local sourcing as an additional cost-cutting strategy.

""ASCC notes that the new hull deploys standard pre-cast bridge construction techniques that can be deployed practically anywhere in the world. Unlike steel construction, the materials can be locally sourced, and the developer can make use of local labor,"" we noted.

Concrete also avoids the corrosion risks that bedevil steel components, which can help reduce lifetime maintenance costs. ""Another advantage is the heavier weight of the concrete structure, which acts as a cushion against wave motion,"" we also noted.

Don't get too excited about Maine just yet. Aside from technology challenges, Maine Governor Janet Mills is facing blowback against her administration's selection of undeveloped land on Sears Island to develop as an offshore services hub and port facility.

Nevertheless, Governor Mills and other policymakers are not about to pull another Paul LePage on the state's offshore wind stakeholders. Quite the opposite, in fact. Aside from accessing zero-emission electricity in the age of climate change, state policymakers have been eyeballing offshore wind as a major new job-creating industry for Maine, including academic and research positions.

Last year, Maine issued a detailed roadmap for the state's floating wind industry, towards a goal of 3,000 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2040.

Among other details, the roadmap also takes note of innovative offshore technology developed through the University of Maine. In addition to the VolturnUS concrete hull, the Maine Offshore Wind Roadmap lists a floating LIDAR system called called ""DeepCLi-DAR,"" developed as to assess wind resources. The Roadmap also describes new reduced-impact synthetic mooring lines and ""the largest polymer 3D printer that can be used in the production of composite components and tooling.""

As of last year, things were moving along at a good clip towards floating a full scale, 11-megawatt demonstration turbine out to sea, under the wing of the firm New England Aqua Ventus. Initially, NEAV was a joint venture of the University of Maine, RWE Renewables, and the Diamond Offshore Wind branch of Mitsubishi. RWE reached out to CleanTechnica with an update last fall, to let us know that the company was selling its shares in NEAV to Diamond Offshore Wind, along with its shares in the Maine Research Array.

""The company remains optimistic about future commercial opportunities, including in the Gulf of Maine, to deliver floating offshore wind at scale into New England,"" RWE told CleanTechnica.

As for Maine, the state is determined to grid-connect its floating turbine before any other state in the US, so stay tuned for more on that.",cleantechnica.com,news,CleanTechnica,Tina Casey,0.2862745098039217,454691940,9,https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/maine-floating-offshore-wind-roadmap.png,eng-9605573

No new safety signals were observed. ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT02407236.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic, immune-mediated disorder characterized by inflammation of the colon. Due to the lifelong nature of UC, long-term treatment is often required to induce and maintain remission. Advances in biologic therapies have allowed a paradigm shift in treatment goals from controlling symptoms to endoscopic healing, thus improving long-term outcomes ().

Ustekinumab, a fully human interleukin-12/23p40 inhibitor, has shown to be safe and effective for maintaining remission through 3 years of subcutaneous (SC) maintenance therapy after intravenous (IV) induction in patients with moderate to severely active UC (). The UNIFI study consisted of an induction study, a maintenance study (), and a long-term extension (LTE) through 4 years.

In this report, the final efficacy and safety results of the UNIFI LTE study through 4 years are presented. Of note, endoscopic assessments were performed at the final efficacy evaluation, which enables more objective evaluation of long-term efficacy in addition to patient-reported symptoms.

The UNIFI study consisted of 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies: an 8-week induction study and a 44-week maintenance study, previously described (). The LTE began after week 44 of maintenance () through week 220 (final safety visit), with a final efficacy visit at week 200. The study design (see Supplementary Figure S1, https://links.lww.com/AJG/D138) has been previously reported ().

Overall, 523 IV ustekinumab induction responders were randomized to SC maintenance therapy (intent-to-treat [ITT] population). Patients not in full Mayo clinical response 8 weeks after IV ustekinumab induction received SC ustekinumab 90 mg at week 8, and those in full Mayo clinical response 16 weeks after the initial IV ustekinumab infusion were followed up in the nonrandomized population of the maintenance study and received ustekinumab 90 mg q8w. All patients completing week 44 of the maintenance study were eligible to continue treatment in the LTE. The maintenance study was unblinded after analysis of the week-44 end points. Patients receiving SC placebo at the time of study unblinding were discontinued.

At week 56, randomized patients whose UC worsened based on investigator's judgment could adjust to ustekinumab 90 mg q8w; dose adjustment was allowed once. The last dose adjustment was at week 188.

Assessments

Symptom and physician global assessments were conducted every 12 weeks until study unblinding and then every 8 or 12 weeks depending on assigned dose regimen. Patients who remained in the trial underwent an endoscopic assessment (either sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy) at week 200, and the endoscopic evaluation was performed by a local reader (not by central review as during the main study).

C-reactive protein (CRP) and fecal calprotectin were assessed every 3 months in the LTE through week 200. Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) was used to assess disease-specific health-related quality of life across 4 dimensional scores: bowel, systemic, social, and emotional (). Use of the IBDQ was made under license from McMaster University, Hamilton, Canada. The IBDQ was assessed every 6 months in the LTE through week 200.

Efficacy end points

Symptomatic remission was defined as a Mayo stool frequency subscore of 0 or 1 and a rectal bleeding subscore of 0 and was evaluated at each visit through week 200. Corticosteroid-free symptomatic remission was defined as patients in symptomatic remission and not receiving oral corticosteroids (including beclomethasone dipropionate and budesonide) at the time point (visit) of the efficacy assessment.

Efficacy end points related to the Mayo score were evaluated at week 200. Full Mayo clinical remission was defined as a Mayo score ≤2 points, with no individual subscore >1. Full Mayo clinical response was defined as a decrease from induction baseline in the Mayo score by ≥30% and ≥3 points, with either a decrease from induction baseline in the rectal bleeding subscore ≥1 or a rectal bleeding subscore of 0 or 1. Modified Mayo response was defined as a decrease from induction baseline in the modified Mayo score (no physician global assessment subscore) by ≥30% and ≥2 points, with either a decrease from induction baseline in the rectal bleeding subscore ≥1 or a rectal bleeding subscore of 0 or 1. Endoscopic improvement was defined as an endoscopy subscore (of the Mayo score) of 0 or 1. Median CRP and fecal calprotectin concentrations and IBDQ remission (IBDQ score ≥170 points) were assessed through week 200.

Safety

Adverse events (AE), serious AE (SAE), infections, serious infections, and laboratory assessments were evaluated during the LTE (week 44 through the final safety visit, which was week 220 or the discontinuation visit if the patient discontinued before week 220). Patients randomized to placebo could dose adjust to ustekinumab 90 mg q8w in the LTE before study unblinding, and any AE reported after dose adjustment were included in the ustekinumab group.

Immunogenicity

Serum blood samples for immunogenicity assessments were collected every 6 months during the LTE. Antibodies to ustekinumab were detected using a validated, drug-tolerant, electrochemiluminescent immunoassay on the MesoScale Discovery platform. This assay can detect antidrug antibodies (ADA) in the presence of up to 100 mg/mL of ustekinumab in the sample (). Patients were classified as positive if ADA were detected at any time after the first ustekinumab administration of the induction study through the end of the study.

Statistical analysis

The efficacy analysis populations included the following: (i) all patients randomized to ustekinumab in the maintenance study; (ii) randomized patients in the maintenance study who continued to receive ustekinumab in the LTE; and (iii) nonrandomized patients in the maintenance study who received ustekinumab in the LTE (see Supplementary Table S1, https://links.lww.com/AJG/D138). No statistical comparisons were made between treatment groups.

For the ITT analyses of symptomatic remission and corticosteroid-free symptomatic remission, all patients randomized to ustekinumab (q12w or q8w) in the maintenance study were included, regardless of whether patients entered the LTE. Patients who met treatment failure criteria were considered nonresponders (see Supplementary Table S1, https://links.lww.com/AJG/D138). Patients with missing data pertaining to a dichotomous end point at a visit were considered not to have achieved the dichotomous end point, including those who did not enter the LTE.

Randomized patients who entered the LTE were evaluated for symptomatic remission, stool frequency, rectal bleeding, corticosteroid use, outcomes associated with endoscopic evaluation at week 200 (full Mayo clinical remission, full Mayo clinical response, modified Mayo clinical response, and endoscopic improvement), inflammatory biomarkers (CRP and fecal calprotectin), and IBDQ remission. Symptomatic remission among patients who entered the LTE was evaluated using 3 approaches: (i) nonresponder imputation for treatment failure and missing data; (ii) observed case analysis only for patients with available data at an analysis visit; and (iii) modified observed case analysis up to the time of dose adjustment with nonresponder imputation for patients who met treatment failure criteria (see Supplementary Table S1, https://links.lww.com/AJG/D138). Other dichotomous end points, including proportions of patients with ≤3 stools/day, Mayo stool frequency subscores of 0 or 1, rectal bleeding subscores of 0 (see Supplementary Table S2, https://links.lww.com/AJG/D138), and IBDQ remission, were conservatively analyzed using nonresponder imputation for treatment failure and missing data. For continuous end points, including absolute number of stools/day, daily corticosteroid dose, CRP, and fecal calprotectin, patients who met treatment failure criteria had their week-0 (induction) value carried forward to the visits thereafter and patients who had missing data at a visit had their last available value carried forward to that visit. Symptomatic remission was also evaluated for nonrandomized patients who entered the LTE with nonresponder imputation for treatment failure and missing data.

Safety was evaluated using number of AE, SAE, infections, serious infections, AE leading to discontinuation, malignancies, and deaths per 100 patient-years (PY) of follow-up for all patients treated with ustekinumab in the LTE (randomized and nonrandomized). Event rates per 100 PY from week 44 through the final LTE safety visit were summarized. Event rates were also summarized for each year of the maintenance study (1st year: weeks 0-44; 2nd year: LTE weeks 44-96; 3rd year: LTE weeks 96-156; and 4th year: LTE weeks 156-220). All authors had access to the data and have reviewed/approved the final manuscript.

At maintenance baseline, 523 IV ustekinumab induction responders were randomized to SC maintenance therapy: SC placebo, n = 175; ustekinumab 90 mg q12w, n = 172; and ustekinumab 90 mg q8w, n = 176. Of these patients, 399 (76.3%) continued treatment in the LTE, including 284 patients who continued ustekinumab treatment (n = 141 q12w; n = 143 q8w). LTE baseline clinical disease characteristics were previously described (), including whether patients were biologic naive or had a history of biologic failure and prior UC treatments. During the LTE, UC-specific concomitant medications were permitted per investigator's discretion.

Of the patients randomized in maintenance who continued ustekinumab treatment in the LTE, 29.8% (42/141) in the 90 mg SC q12w group and 29.4% (42/143) in the 90 mg SC q8w group discontinued treatment (Table 1). Patients with a history of biologic failure were more likely to discontinue treatment (42.7%; 53/124) than biologic-naive patients (18.8%; 28/149).

An additional 157 patients who received ustekinumab IV induction were not in full Mayo clinical response at induction week 8, received a SC dose of ustekinumab 90 mg at induction week 8, and were in full Mayo clinical response at induction week 16. These patients continued to receive SC ustekinumab 90 mg q8w as part of the nonrandomized population in the maintenance study. At week 44, 116 of these patients entered the LTE and continued SC ustekinumab 90 mg q8w. Of these patients, 18.1% (n = 21) discontinued study treatment before the final dosing visit. Reasons for discontinuation included AE (n = 9), lack of efficacy (n = 6), and other (n = 6). Results for dose adjustment were previously reported ().

Efficacy

Among all patients randomized to ustekinumab at maintenance baseline, proportions of patients in symptomatic remission were maintained through week 200 (Figure 1a-c).

Overall, 55.2% (192/348) of all patients randomized to ustekinumab at maintenance baseline (combined q8w/q12w) were in symptomatic remission at week 200 (Figure 1a). Specifically, 54.5% (96/176) of patients randomized to ustekinumab q8w and 55.8% (96/172) randomized to ustekinumab q12w (including those who dose-adjusted to q8w) were in symptomatic remission at week 200.

A greater proportion of biologic-naive patients (Figure 1b) were in symptomatic remission at each time point than those with a history of biologic failure (Figure 1c). Overall, 67.2% (117/174) of biologic-naive patients randomized to ustekinumab at maintenance baseline (combined q8w/q12w) were in symptomatic remission at week 200, compared with 41.6% (67/161) of patients with a history of biologic failure. The proportion of patients in symptomatic remission was maintained more consistently over time in the biologic-naive patients than in those with a history of biologic failure. In addition, the proportion of patients in symptomatic remission in the biologic-naive q8w subgroup decreased <1% per year between weeks 44 and 200, while the proportion in q8w patients with a history of biologic failure decreased approximately 7% per year during this period.

Corticosteroid tapering was allowed starting at the beginning of the maintenance study. Proportions of patients in corticosteroid-free symptomatic remission increased through maintenance week 16 and were generally sustained thereafter (Figure 1d-f) in a pattern similar to symptomatic remission. Overall, 53.2% (185/348) of patients randomized to ustekinumab (combined q8w/q12w) were in corticosteroid-free symptomatic remission at week 200. A total of 65.5% (114/174) of biologic-naive patients (combined q8w/q12w) and 39.8% (64/161) of patients with a history of biologic failure randomized to ustekinumab (combined q8w/q12w) were in corticosteroid-free symptomatic remission at week 200.

Among patients in symptomatic remission at each time point in the maintenance study and LTE, most of them were not receiving steroids. Of the 96 q8w patients in symptomatic remission at week 200, 91 (94.8%) were corticosteroid-free. Similarly, of the 96 q12w patients in symptomatic remission at week 200, 94 (97.9%) were corticosteroid-free.

In addition, among the 55 q8w biologic-naive patients in symptomatic remission at week 200, 54 (98.2%) were corticosteroid-free, and of the 62 q12w biologic-naive patients, 60 (96.8%) were in corticosteroid-free symptomatic remission at week 200. Among the 37 q8w patients with a history of biologic failure in symptomatic remission at week 200, 34 (91.9%) were corticosteroid-free. Of the 30 q12w patients with a history of biologic failure in symptomatic remission at week 200, 30 (100%) were corticosteroid-free.

Among patients randomized to ustekinumab who entered the LTE, the proportion of patients in symptomatic remission was maintained through week 200 (Figure 2a-f). Symptomatic remission outcomes through week 200 were evaluated in the overall population of randomized patients who entered the LTE and in the subgroups of biologic-naive patients and patients with a history of biologic failure, in which patients with missing data/meeting treatment failure criteria were considered nonresponders (Figure 2a-c). An observed case analysis of symptomatic remission was performed in which only patients with available data at each visit were analyzed (Figure 2d-f). A modified observed case analysis included patients in symptomatic remission up to the time of dose adjustment, and patients who met treatment criteria were considered nonresponders (see Supplementary Figure S2, https://links.lww.com/AJG/D138).

Among randomized patients who entered the LTE, absolute stool numbers remained low and proportions of patients with an absolute stool number ≤3/day were maintained through week 200. Proportions of patients with Mayo stool frequency subscores of 0 or 1 or no rectal bleeding (Mayo rectal bleeding subscore of 0) were also generally maintained (see Supplementary Table S2, https://links.lww.com/AJG/D138).

Symptomatic remission outcomes through week 200 in the nonrandomized study population who received ustekinumab in the LTE (see Supplementary Figure S3, https://links.lww.com/AJG/D138) were consistent with randomized patients who entered the LTE (Figure 2a).

Among randomized patients receiving corticosteroids at maintenance baseline who entered the LTE, 77.9% (53/68) in the q12w group and 80.3% (57/71) in the q8w group were not receiving corticosteroids at week 200. The average daily P.Eq corticosteroid dose among patients receiving corticosteroids upon entering the LTE was low and generally maintained through week 200 (see Supplementary Figure S4, https://links.lww.com/AJG/D138).

Of the 213 patients with observed symptom data at week 200, 171 also had endoscopic assessments at that time point, which enabled Mayo clinical and endoscopic outcome evaluations. Full Mayo clinical remission, full Mayo clinical response, modified Mayo score response, and endoscopic improvement were evaluated for all patients with available data (observed case analysis) and with nonresponder imputation for patients who met treatment failure criteria (modified observed case analysis) (Figure 3).

Median serum CRP (see Supplementary Figure S5A, https://links.lww.com/AJG/D138) and fecal calprotectin (see Supplementary Figure S5B, https://links.lww.com/AJG/D138) concentrations were maintained from week 44 to week 200 among randomized patients who continued ustekinumab treatment in the LTE.

The proportion of patients who were in IBDQ remission was maintained from week 44 to week 200 (see Supplementary Figure S6, https://links.lww.com/AJG/D138).

Immunogenicity

The incidence of antibodies to ustekinumab was low through the final safety visit of the LTE. Overall, 5.5% (22/400) of randomized and nonrandomized patients who continued ustekinumab in the LTE were positive for ADA through the final safety visit. Overall, 5 of these 22 patients (22.7%) were positive for neutralizing antibodies. ADA were often transient and seemed to have no effect on efficacy.

Safety

Key safety events per 100 PY of follow-up for all patients treated in the LTE are summarized in Table 2. During the LTE (week 44 through the final safety visit [week 220], unless the patient discontinued study participation before week 220), key safety event rates in ustekinumab-treated patients were not greater than those observed in placebo-treated patients. The most frequently reported AE (>5 events per 100 PY) for patients receiving ustekinumab (combined q8w/q12w) during the LTE were nasopharyngitis (16.82 per 100 PY), UC worsening (15.04 per 100 PY), and upper respiratory tract infections (5.35 per 100 PY). Overall, 4 ustekinumab-treated patients in the LTE reported opportunistic infections (cytomegalovirus infection n = 2, Listeria monocytogenes n = 1, and oral herpes with mouth ulceration and concurrent neutropenia n = 1). The number of nonmelanoma skin carcinomas per 100 PY was 0.54 for ustekinumab-treated patients and 0.63 for placebo-treated patients (Table 2). Among ustekinumab-treated patients, 1 case of colorectal cancer and 1 case of rectal cancer were reported.

In the LTE, one previously reported death due to cardiac arrest occurred in a patient who received 1 dose of ustekinumab 90 mg SC after dose adjustment from placebo between weeks 44 and 96 (). The patient presented with multiple comorbidities, and the death was considered unrelated to ustekinumab. During the final year of the LTE, no new deaths or major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) were reported in ustekinumab-treated patients. No cases of active tuberculosis or posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome were reported throughout the maintenance study and the LTE. Rates of key safety events by year of ustekinumab treatment showed no increase in the fourth year of ustekinumab treatment (Figure 4).

DISCUSSION

In this final report from the UNIFI maintenance and LTE study, we present efficacy and safety data through 4 years for ustekinumab in patients with moderately to severely active UC who responded to IV induction and received SC maintenance treatment. The results showed that long-term SC maintenance therapy of q8w and q12w ustekinumab in patients who responded to IV ustekinumab induction was safe and effective at maintaining symptomatic remission. These results are consistent with previously reported findings from this LTE () and the IM-UNITI LTE study of ustekinumab in patients with Crohn's disease (). Biologic-naive patients had greater persistence of therapy and efficacy outcomes than those with a history of biologic failure. Ustekinumab maintained efficacy without the need for concomitant corticosteroids. Safety results were consistent with the known safety profile of long-term ustekinumab treatment. Exposure-adjusted analysis showed that ustekinumab AE rates were not greater than placebo.

A unique feature of this LTE was the endoscopic assessment at week 200, which enabled the analysis of full Mayo score-related outcomes 3 years after the primary analyses of the maintenance study at 1 year. The results showed that patients who remained in the study through week 200 (most of whom were doing well symptomatically) had high rates of full Mayo clinical remission, full Mayo clinical response, modified Mayo score response, and endoscopic improvement.

Symptomatic remission data were analyzed and presented using 3 different approaches, each addressing different clinical questions related to long-term data. The ITT analysis evaluated all patients randomized in the maintenance study. Patients who discontinued treatment for any reason at any time through week 200, including those who did not enter the LTE, were considered nonresponders. These results help conservatively estimate the probability that a patient who responded to ustekinumab IV induction may maintain symptomatic remission through up to 4 years of ustekinumab treatment. The observed case analyses included patients with available data at each visit in the LTE; patients who discontinued the study for any reason were excluded from time of discontinuation forward. These results help estimate the probability that a patient continuing ustekinumab treatment will be in symptomatic remission. In long-term studies, patients who continue treatment tend to have better efficacy and safety outcomes than those who discontinue (). The modified observed case analysis included patients with available data in the LTE up to the time of dose adjustment with nonresponder imputation for patients who met prespecified treatment failure criteria. This approach may be more reflective of the real-world long-term efficacy of ustekinumab because it excluded patients who discontinued ustekinumab for reasons other than efficacy.

Although 2 ustekinumab maintenance doses were evaluated throughout the LTE, the study was not powered to compare the efficacy and safety between doses. In the modified observed case analysis, the proportion of patients in symptomatic remission at week 200 in the q12w group was numerically greater than that in the q8w group, particularly among patients with a history of biologic failure. However, this was a result of the analysis approach because data were censored for patients who received dose adjustment. Dose adjustment (q12w to q8w) was conducted at the investigator's discretion starting at week 56. The effects of ustekinumab dose adjustment were previously reported ().

The safety results during long-term maintenance treatment were consistent with those previously reported in controlled studies across approved indications (). Exposure-adjusted analysis of key safety events, including AE, SAE, infections, serious infections, AE leading to discontinuations, and malignancies, occurred at rates that were not greater than placebo. Consistent with safety data previously reported during the UNIFI LTE, the most frequently reported AE were nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, and UC worsening. No cases of tuberculosis occurred. One death and 3 MACE occurred between weeks 44 and 96, as previously reported (). No new deaths or MACE occurred between weeks 96 and 200. Two patients had solid tumors (rectal and colon cancers).

Limitations of this study should be considered when interpreting the results. The LTE was double-blinded until all patients completed the 1-year maintenance study and the primary analysis was completed, at which time all patients were unblinded, and patients receiving placebo discontinued. Therefore, the duration of blinded treatment and assessments varied among patients, depending on when they were enrolled in the trial, and efficacy comparisons with placebo were not viable after week 44 (placebo comparison for safety was based on events per 100 PY). Endoscopic evaluations at week 200 were not available for all patients and were not centrally read.

In conclusion, in this population of patients with treatment-refractory moderate-to-severe UC, patients who responded to ustekinumab IV induction and received SC maintenance treatment generally maintained clinical benefit through 4 years. The safety profile of ustekinumab maintenance treatment was consistent with the known long-term safety profile in other approved indications.

A hydrogen-capable combined-cycle gas turbine power plant with a nominal output of around 800 megawatts could be built at Gersteinwerk, as RWE announced in Essen on Wednesday. RWE currently operates several natural gas units there.

According to RWE, the new plant could go into operation by 2030. The power plant should be able to use at least 50 percent hydrogen when it goes into operation. It will later be operated entirely with hydrogen.

Final investment decision still pending

As in Weisweiler, RWE commissioned the consortium of Ansaldo Energia (Italy) and Tecnicas Reunidas (Spain) with the planning. Work on the approval planning is already underway. However, RWE does not intend to make a final investment decision until the grid connection, the regulatory framework and the economic viability have been clarified. RWE did not provide any information on the estimated costs.

The head of RWE's power plant company RWE Generation, Nikolaus Valerius, said that the approval planning was being carried out in advance in order to keep the chance of completion by 2030 open. ""We are ready to make a contribution to green security of supply with the construction and thus secure the coal phase-out in 2030."" This requires politicians to quickly set a fundamental course. ""We can only make a final investment decision once the connection of the site to a hydrogen network has been secured and the framework conditions allow the power plants to be operated economically.""

RWE wants to participate in tenders

The German government has announced that its power plant strategy will soon create a regulatory framework for the tendering of hydrogen-capable gas-fired power plants. ""RWE intends to participate in these tenders,"" the company confirmed. According to the recently presented plans for the construction of a hydrogen infrastructure in Germany, the Gerstein plant could in future be located close to a hydrogen transport pipeline, RWE added.

The company plans to build hydrogen-capable gas-fired power plants with a total capacity of 3,000 megawatts at its power plant sites in Germany by 2030. In addition to Weisweiler and Werne, RWE is also planning such a plant in Voerde. The company also wants to produce green hydrogen there ""on an industrial scale."" /tob/DP/stw",marketscreener.com,news,Market Screener,,0.1137254901960785,454688499,51,https://www.marketscreener.com/images/twitter_MS_fdblanc.png,

In April, New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) decided not to sign offtake agreements with three planned offshore wind projects after U.S. supplier GE Vernova backtracked on plans to provide developers with 18 MW turbines, its largest ever.

The 1.4 GW Attentive Energy One (TotalEnergies and Corio Generation), 1.3 GW Community Offshore Wind (RWE and National Grid) and 1.3 GW Excelsior Wind (Vineyard Offshore) projects were all awarded provisional contracts in a competitive auction in October 2023.

GE's climbdown from supplying a 18 MW turbine comes as western suppliers focus on existing models to improve supply chain efficiency and reduce delivery risks associated with new larger models.

New York's decision follows the cancellation of several U.S. East Coast offshore wind projects last year due to rising costs and supply chain challenges since the pandemic. Developers including Orsted, Avangrid, and Equinor are struggling to secure installation vessels and face strong competition for turbines from European countries seeking to boost offshore wind generation.

Source: U.S. Department of Energy's Offshore Wind Market Report, 2023 Edition (August 2023)

New York required the three projects awarded in October to install GE Vernova turbines and earmarked a $300 million grant for the company and its subsidiary LM Wind Power to build nacelle and blade manufacturing facilities in New York state.

New York's attempt to combine support for supply chain buildout with offshore wind power contracts increased supply risks for developers, industry sources told Reuters Events.

Dependence on one turbine manufacturer resulted in high supply risks, Community Offshore Wind president and project director Doug Perkins told Reuters Events.

Tony Appleton, Offshore Wind Director at Burns & McDonnell, applauded New York's efforts but said ""aiming for an 18 MW turbine that had not yet been developed was an ambitious endeavor.""

New York is looking to lure back developers with another auction in the summer and one in 2025. New York plans to reallocate the $300 million supply chain grant and is considering changing cost indexes to reduce risks, but a solution will be required that encourages regional supply chain investments without restricting competition.

Perkins urged policymakers to separate offshore wind procurement from manufacturing procurement in future solicitations.

The upcoming auction will be successful if NYSERDA gives developers flexibility to choose the ""best available"" turbines from any supplier, he said.

Switching states

The developers of Attentive Energy One, Community Offshore Wind and Excelsior Wind are keen to continue with their projects but could instead seek to sell power to neighboring New Jersey.

Last month, New Jersey launched its fourth offshore wind auction to secure between 1.2 GW and 4 GW of clean power. Developers must submit their offers by July 10 and awards are scheduled for December.

In January, TotalEnergies and Corio Generation signed an offtake agreement with New Jersey for Attentive Energy Two, a project adjacent to Attentive Energy One.

According to Aegir Insights, as many as 10 offshore wind projects could take part in the New Jersey auction, including the three projects denied contracts in New York.

The three projects would only need a ""limited number of modifications"" to bid in the upcoming solicitations, Appleton told Reuters Events.

The cost of installing a higher number of smaller turbines could be offset by benefits including faster delivery times and higher capacity factors.

""Fundamentally, the projects will be the same. All you're changing is the number of turbines, and potentially their locations, and array cables,"" he added.

Turbine squeeze

Most U.S. East Coast projects are set to install turbines in the range of 11 GW to 15 GW and as the industry consolidates around this level, the three projects impacted in New York will face intense global competition for turbines.

The current global supply chain ""is just not big enough"" to meet ambitious offshore wind targets in U.S., Europe and other key markets, Appleton said.

Danish turbine supplier Vestas saw its back order for offshore wind turbines nearly double in 2023 to 4.3 GW, the company said in its annual report. This was largely due to demand for its new 15 MW turbine, which the Danish company will start delivering in 2025, it said. Germany's Siemens Gamesa is the largest global supplier of offshore wind turbines to date and the company is seeking to ramp up manufacturing capacity at three sites in Europe in a bid to meet increasing demand, it said earlier this month.

""This is not happening only in New York, this is a global issue. Developers are engaged in a constant battle with suppliers because no matter what states or what countries, they all have ambitious offshore wind targets and they are all pushing for the same deadlines,"" Appleton said.",reutersevents.com,news,reutersevents.com,,0.5294117647058822,454686821,1,,eng-9603774

Essen-RWE is planning to build hydrogen-ready gas-fired power plants at the company's power plant sites in Germany to contribute to a successful coal phase-out by 2030. Following Weisweiler in the Rhenish mining area, the company is now pressing ahead with plans for such a plant at a possible second site in Werne in the southern Münsterland region. An H2-ready combined-cycle gas turbine (CCGT) power plant with a nominal capacity of around 800 megawatts may be built at the Gersteinwerk power plant.

Following intensive technical soundings, RWE has commissioned an Italian-Spanish consortium to plan the project. Work on the planning approval process is already underway.

Nikolaus Valerius, CEO RWE Generation SE: ""With the approval planning for a hydrogen-ready gas-fired power plant at the Gersteinwerk, we are taking proactive measures to keep the chance of completion by 2030 open. With the construction of the new power plant, we are ready to contribute to green security of supply and thus secure the coal phase-out by 2030. This requires policymakers to quickly make some key decisions. We can only make a final investment decision once the connection of the site to a hydrogen network has been secured and the framework conditions allow for a commercially viable operation of the power plants.""

The German government has announced that its power plant strategy will soon create a regulatory framework for tendering hydrogen-ready gas-fired power plants. RWE intends to participate in these tenders. According to the recently presented plans for the construction of a hydrogen infrastructure in Germany, the Gerstein plant in Werne could be located close to a hydrogen transport pipeline in the future.

A consortium consisting of Ansaldo Energia (Italy) and Tecnicas Reunidas (Spain) has won RWE's tender for the hydrogen-ready CCGT. The contract signed by the three partners includes approval planning for the power plant as a first step.

Work on the planning process is already underway. This is the prerequisite for RWE to be able to start implementing the project as soon as an investment decision has been made.

According to current planning, the plant in Werne could start producing electricity by 2030.

At the time of commissioning, the plant should be able to use a fuel mix with at least 50 per cent hydrogen content, and it is intended to run it entirely on hydrogen at a later stage.

RWE's eight-hour lithium-ion battery energy storage system (BESS) was the only successful project in New South Wales' first Long Duration Storage Long-Term Energy Service Agreements tender process, and was awarded a Long-Term Energy Service Agreement.

With a planned capacity of 50+ MW and 400+ MWh, the Limondale BESS will support the energy transition by storing excess renewable energy and feeding it into the NSW grid when it is needed most. The project will be located next to RWE's 249 MWac Limondale solar farm - which is one of Australia's largest. The BESS will connect to existing grid infrastructure.

Tesla has been selected as the BESS supplier, and Beon Energy Solutions as the delivery partner for the Balance of Plant, which includes the civil, structural, electrical, and control works required to connect the Megapack to the existing 33 kV substation. Construction is scheduled to start in 2H24, with commissioning planned for late 2025.

Katja Wünschel, CEO RWE Renewables Europe & Australia, said: ""RWE's investment decision and signing of supplier contracts for the Limondale BESS project is an exciting step forward in our commitment to the Australian renewables sector and support of NSW's renewable energy ambitions. As a battery storage pioneer, RWE develops, builds, and operates innovative and competitive battery storage systems in Europe and the US, and soon here in Australia.

Construction of the Limondale battery energy storage system is scheduled to start in the second half of this year, with commissioning of the 400 MWh system planned for late 2025.

The final investment decision comes after the project last year won a Long-Term Energy Service Agreement in NSW's first competitive tender for supply under its electricity infrastructure roadmap.

Katja Wünschel, CEO of RWE Renewables in Australia and Europe, said the Limondale battery, to be built in the proposed South West Renewable Energy Zone, will support NSW's energy transition by storing excess renewable energy and feeding it into the grid when it is needed most.

""With the expansion of renewables, we also need to increase battery storage capacities,"" she said. ""They are key for a reliable, secure, and sustainable electricity supply. Our Limondale project is a great example of what this can look like.""

The Limondale storage system will have a 50 MW maximum output and 400 MWh of storage capacity, allowing it to dispatch at full power for eight hours before needing to be recharged.

While the Limondale battery is the first eight-hour battery to reach the final investment stage, there are others in the pipeline

Ark Energy plans to build a 275 MW/2,200 MWh battery project at Myrtle Creek in northern NSW, while Lightsource bp will deliver the 49 MW/392 MWh Goulburn River battery in the upper Hunter Valley. Both are being developed next to existing or proposed solar farms.

Wünschel said in addition to supporting NSW with its renewable energy ambitions, the decision to proceed with the Limondale project marks another milestone in RWE's ambition to expand its global batteries portfolio to 6 GW by 2030.

RWE currently operates more than 700 MW of battery storage systems globally and has 1.2 GW of battery storage projects under construction worldwide.

Australia has emerged as one of the company's focus markets, with the Essen-headquartered outfit late last year outlining plans to develop up to 3 GW of renewable energy projects in Australia by the end of the decade.

RWE Chief Executive Markus Krebber said the company will invest about AUD 6 billion ($3.99 billion) in a major build-out of solar, battery storage and wind power across the country.

""Australia is a very attractive renewable energy growth market,"" he said. ""RWE has been present in the country for 10 years and we intend to significantly expand our Australian renewables business.""

RWE has already signed a memorandum of understanding with Queensland government-owned energy company Stanwell to deliver two onshore wind projects with a combined capacity of up to 1.8 GW in that state.

Additionally, the company said it continues to develop an ""attractive pipeline"" of renewable projects focused on wind, solar and battery storage across the country.",pv-magazine.com,news,pv magazine International,David Carroll,0.4666666666666666,454666626,30,https://www.pv-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Screenshot-2024-05-29-at-09.34.14-280x280.png,eng-9614750

In the early 2000s, a long-time Louisiana engineer and entrepreneur thought it would be natural for the oil and gas industry in the Gulf of Mexico to expand into offshore wind. The industry could use the same workforce, the same shipyards and possibly even the same platforms to generate renewable power.

With designs, data and offshore leases from Texas, Herman Schellstede and his team planned to build a 62-turbine wind farm off Galveston's coast -- one of the first such proposals in the United States and the first in the Gulf of Mexico.

The team approached banks and even Koch Industries seeking financing for the $300 million wind farm, he said. But financing nascent offshore wind was apparently too risky a proposition in the wake of the 2008 financial meltdown. The wind farm was eventually scuttled.

""We were still too early,"" said Schellstede, the Louisiana oil and gas entrepreneur who is still designing offshore wind turbines for projects in the gulf.

Now, 33 years after the first offshore wind farm was built in waters off Denmark, it's still unclear if the time is right -- or will ever be right -- for the United States. In those years, only four wind farms generating 242 megawatts of power have been built off the U.S. coast; the largest just went into service in 2024.

Last year, inflation, supply chain problems and other macroeconomic issues led to the cancellation or renegotiation of about half of all proposed offshore wind projects. And while the Biden Administration is moving as quickly as possible to approve new lease sales and projects -- expanding the amount of power generated by tenfold -- former President Donald Trump has promised to end offshore wind if elected.

The industry and advocates, however, do not seem daunted. Studies show offshore wind could meet 5% of the nation's energy needs by 2035, and up to 25% by 2050.

""We're all in this room today, not because we just see offshore wind as a massive opportunity -- which it is to build you clean energy -- but also we see the necessity of offshore wind,"" said Amanda Lefton, vice president of offshore development for the renewable energy company RWE.

Lefton, speaking at an April conference of the offshore wind industry in New Orleans, said the technology is needed to meet national and state decarbonization goals. RWE is developing projects off the East Coast and California and working to create a supply chain for offshore wind in the Gulf of Mexico with a large Louisiana-based coalition.

""We know the fundamentals exist in these markets,"" said Lefton, the former head of the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management who leads RWE's East Coast operations. ""We know that it's not an if, it's a when.""

Offshore wind's rocky history

In the years since Schellestede's wind project proposal, the industry has moved forward in fits and starts. In 2016, the small scale 30-megawatt Block Island Wind Farm off the coast of Rhode Island became the first U.S. offshore wind project to be completed.

Cape Wind, the first large-scale offshore wind project in the United States off the shores of Massachusetts, was canceledthe following year after 16 years of controversy.

In 2020, a 12-MW pilot project -- the first in federally controlled waters -- came online off Virginia's coast.

So far this year, the industry has made historic progress as South Fork Wind Farm off New York began producing 132 MW of electricity, and Massachusetts' Vineyard Wind started spinning the first five of 62 turbines, sending 68 MW of power to the grid. At full operation, the wind farm is designed to generate 805 MW.

By contrast, worldwide there are almost 73,000 MW, or 73 gigawatts, of offshore wind operating, with half of that amount off China's coast.

Some of the delay in the U.S. industry occurred during Donald Trump's presidency. His administration held no offshore lease sales for federally owned waters. Trump ordered an environmental review for the Atlantic Coast, killing or delaying projects in various states of development.

As he did in his May 12 speech in New Jersey, Trump often repeats the falsehood that offshore wind is killing whales -- a claim dismissed by the federal government's own scientists. But groups funded by or tied to oil and gas interests including the American Petroleum Institute continue to perpetuate it, insisting offshore wind also harms fisheries and tourism.

""There is zero evidence for offshore wind activities causing whale deaths,"" said Helen Rose Patterson, senior campaign manager with National Wildlife Federation's offshore wind energy program. Patterson calls the claims ""disinformation,"" or false information that is intentionally spread.

She said the greatest threat to the whales is climate change, which offshore wind could help mitigate. North American right whales now must travel farther north to hunt their cold water prey, Patterson said, putting them closer to ships and fishing that put them at risk. ""The North Atlantic right whales are in different places because of climate change.""

Biden pushes to revive industry

When Joe Biden took office in 2021, he ordered a 180-degree turn on federal offshore wind policy.

During his first year in office, the Democrat established a target to deploy 30 GW of offshore wind -- the equivalent of about 30 new nuclear plants -- by 2030 to help reach his national climate goal of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.

So far, the administration has approved 10 GW of offshore projects and is expected to approve more by the end of the year in what some observers see as a rush to get more wind farms started in the event Trump wins the November election.

At the Oceantic Network conference in New Orleans, Interior Secretary Deb Haaland announced 12 offshore wind leasing sales over the next five years, ranging from New York to Hawaii and the Gulf of Mexico to the state of Oregon. Biden previously announced $5 billion in federally issued loan guarantees to boost offshore wind development.

Offshore political winds shift in Texas

Although Schellstede and his company, Wind Energy Systems Technology (WEST), failed to get interest for the project in Louisiana, Texas welcomed them. Texas saw offshore wind as a way to expand on its extensive energy resources, state officials said at the time.

Texas wasn't the only entity aiming to diversify. Big oil companies including Shell and BP and other international oil interests began adding wind to their own portfolios. In fact, the two oil giants were major sponsors of the offshore wind conference in New Orleans.

""It's not greenwashing,"" said Patterson of the oil majors investing in offshore wind. ""I'm much more concerned about oil and gas that aren't doing anything to diversify their portfolios.""

Since WEST tried to establish a wind farm off Galveston nearly 20 years ago, top Texas officials have become resistant to offshore wind energy. Last year, Texas Railroad Commissioner Wayne Christian told Gov. Greg Abbott that he opposes offshore wind, calling it a ""taxpayer boondoggle"" and repeating the false claims about offshore wind causing whale deaths.

The Texas land commissioner followed with her own opposition to the Biden Administration's plan to lease federal land off the state's coast for offshore wind. And the powerful Texas Public Policy Foundation, funded by conservative billionaires including oil baron Charles Koch, is leading offshore opposition along the East Coast.

Economically, it is also hard for more expensive offshore wind to compete with the abundance of renewable energy that Texas already has. Currently, Texas can supply 70% of its electricity demand through renewable power. The cost of offshore wind over the lifespan of the project, or levelized cost of energy, is up to double that of onshore wind -- but is cheaper than coal or nuclear power.

'Energy state' Louisiana eyes offshore

In Louisiana, even the most conservative Republicans have come to see things the way Schellstede did in the 2000s -- that Louisiana has the workforce, the industrial infrastructure and the knowledge to spur offshore wind, not only off the state's Gulf Coast, but around the country.

On May 11, the day before Trump said he would end offshore wind, House majority leader and Trump supporter U.S. Rep. Steve Scalise, R-Louisiana, watched as his wife Jennifer christened the nation's first offshore wind service vessel. Scalise has been a vocal supporter of the industry.

""I think in terms of contrast -- that really represented the opportunity that I see in Louisiana,"" said Jenny Netherton, Louisiana program manager for the nonprofit Southeastern Wind Coalition, who attended the christening in New Orleans.

""People think of us as an oil and gas state, and we are just an energy state,"" Netherton said. ""Because of offshore oil and gas, we have developed this huge vessel industry that is needed for offshore wind. We can build a lot -- and pretty quickly.""

The christened vessel, the Eco Edison, was commissioned by Danish wind developer Ørsted and built by Louisiana's Edison Chouest Offshore. The vessel will service offshore wind in the Atlantic.

A recent report released at the conference by the Southeastern Wind Coalition, Greater New Orleans Inc., the Center for Planning Excellence and The Pew Charitable Trusts found there are 450 companies in Louisiana with the potential to shift toward offshore wind. Fifteen companies in the state already work on offshore wind, including Gulf Island Fabrication, which made the steel structures that support the turbines and other equipment for the Block Island wind farm.

""Louisiana can lead in wind power the same way it has led in oil and gas production,"" Lacy McManus, executive director of future energy for Greater New Orleans Inc., said in announcing the report.

Louisiana's former Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards set a goal of 5,000 MW of offshore wind by 2035. The state has leased its own land under nearshore waters to Vestas and Diamond Offshore Wind for potential development. And in last year's federal sale, RWE leased an offshore parcel in southwest Louisiana. Both projects are still in early stages of development.

It's unclear whether Republican Gov. Jeff Landry supports Edwards' goals; so far the governor, who took office in January, has said nothing publicly about offshore wind. His office did not return a request asking for the governor's position.

""While I have not spoken with Gov. Landry personally, we have heard that he favors the 'all of the above' energy approach,"" Camille Manning-Broome, CEO and president for the nonprofit Center for Planning Excellence in Baton Rouge, told Floodlight. ""Our work with state agency partners does lend itself to continuing this approach of bringing additional sources of energy to the gulf and diversifying our energy portfolio.""

Headwinds to offshore remain

Joshua Basseches is an assistant professor at Tulane University in New Orleans whose work focuses on energy and climate policy and politics. Basseches said he expects disinformation campaigns, like those on the East Coast around whales, along with opposition from the regional fishing industry, might make offshore wind in the Gulf of Mexico difficult.

Others are skeptical of the economics. It will be harder for offshore wind power to compete against the region's favored natural gas power plants, which produce lower cost energy. And building offshore wind farms in the Gulf of Mexico might be more expensive and less efficient than those being built elsewhere because of the risks of hurricanes and its relatively lower wind speeds.

""It doesn't really make a lot of sense,"" BloombergNEF analyst Chelsea Jean-Michel told Heatmap last year. The company, which researches the technologies driving the transition to a lower-carbon economy, confirmed in an email to Floodlight its opinion about the feasibility of offshore wind in the Gulf of Mexico has not changed.

""It's got to be economic. It has to produce the power at a low cost,"" Schellstede agreed. ""It will be interesting to see how this all settles out.""

BMO Canadian rates and macro strategist Benjamin Reitzes warns clients that economic data is weaker than it appears on the surface,

""Canadian headline retail sales fell for a third straight month to start 2024 (down 0.2 per cent in March), as elevated interest rates and high prices continue to weigh on consumers. Volumes weren't much better, falling 0.4 per cent, the second consecutive monthly drop. For all of Q1, volumes rose 1.1 per cent annualized, and are up 0.8 per cent year-over-year for March. While that doesn't seem particularly soft given the challenging backdrop, the reality is far less rosy. The modest gain in retail activity comes despite population growth north of 3 per cent. That mean sales are FALLING on a per capita basis. Indeed, per capita volumes have been trending lower for about three years, and are just 0.5 per cent above 2018Q2's pre-pandemic peak. Accordingly, there should be little question why Canadian consumer sentiment remains soft, and some retailers are struggling. While the April flash estimate points to a bounce in activity, there's nothing in the retail figures that will keep the BoC from cutting rates at next week's meeting""

Prominent JP Morgan global strategist Mislav Matejka favours defensive sectors over cyclicals,

""Historically, Defensives and bond proxies struggled when bond yields would be moving higher. This phase might be ending. Now, in Nov-Dec episode Cyclicals rallied as US 10-year yield nosedived 120bp, from 5.0 per cent to 3.8 per cent, but the background here was the market anticipation of activity acceleration, to be spurred on by Fed pivot and easing in financing conditions. That is why Russell2000 briefly beat S&P500 at the time. This time around, the backdrop could be the softening activity momentum, as seen in a notable fall in US CESI [economic surprise index] most recently, into negative territory. If bond yields are falling as economic growth is moderating, the sector leadership is likely to be more Defensively tilted. Indeed, in Q2 so far, Defensives are ahead in both the U.S. and in Europe. Additional considerations are: valuations - Cyclicals are generally trading stretched vs Defensives, past performance - the Cyclical run over the last 18 months has opened up a gap with PMIs, which has not closed yet""

Scotiabank analyst Ben Isaacson's report on lithium stocks included a link to important news for battery producers,

""Scientists have recently developed a new type of cathode material using iron to make lithium-ion batteries for electric cars. This would replace the more expensive and scarce metals such as cobalt and nickel and pave the way for cheaper, safer, and more sustainable batteries with higher energy densities. EVs might benefit from this new approach not only due to the cost-effectiveness of the new material but also because a collaboration co-led by an Oregon State University chemistry researcher is hailing it as a more sustainable alternative. 'We've transformed the reactivity of iron metal, the cheapest metal commodity,' Oregon State University's Xiulei 'David' Ji stated. 'Our electrode can offer a higher energy density than the state-of-the-art cathode materials in electric vehicles. And since we use iron, whose cost can be less than a dollar per kilogram - a small fraction of nickel and cobalt, which are indispensable in current high-energy lithium-ion batteries - the cost of our batteries is potentially much lower.'""

This funding surge comes as the company continues to advance the application of generative AI through its platform, Geneva OS.

The investment round was spearheaded by Valtruis, with substantial contributions from Cencora Ventures, McKesson Ventures, and Merck Global Health Innovation Fund, in addition to the continued support of existing backers like Breyer Capital, Emerson Collective, and Presidio Ventures.

""Atropos Health addresses a very real problem that both health systems and pharmaceutical manufacturers face in turning medical data into insights in a timely, predictable, and cost-effective manner,"" said Michelle Snyder, partner at McKesson Ventures.

Founded in 2019 by Brigham Hyde, Nigam Shah, and Saurabh Gombar, Atropos Health originated as the 'Green Button' project at Stanford University. The founders are prominent figures in the intersection of AI and real-world evidence (RWE) research, aiming to democratize access to high-quality RWE to enhance healthcare decision-making and outcomes.

Atropos Health's product, ChatRWD, uses generative AI to drastically reduce the time needed to produce high-quality, publication-grade real-world evidence from months to mere minutes. This tool is built on the GENEVA OS framework, which ensures the integrity and security of large language models (LLMs) while mitigating the risk of hallucinations, a critical feature for clinical evidence reliability.

""As excitement over the application of Generative AI technology in healthcare turns from potential to practical applications, the focus of providers, life sciences, and other healthcare stakeholders turns to quality, transparency, and automation backed by tangible ROI,"" said Brigham Hyde, CEO and co-founder of Atropos Health.""

The new funds will bolster Atropos Health's initiatives in value-based care. Their suite of evidence-generating applications aids in providing comprehensive care and supports value-based performance metrics. Partners, including Arcadia, benefit from accelerated clinical decision-making processes that are both high-value and low-cost.

The aim of the project is to utilize an extensive offshore wind measurement campaign and modeling methods to determine if and how large-scale wake effects and the global blockage effect can be reduced in the future.

The project is set to make significant contributions to climate change mitigation and ensure reliable and cost-efficient energy supply. To date, little research on this topic has been conducted anywhere in the world. The project is being funded by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action (BMWK) with a total of around €2.86 million.

Space-efficient wind energy expansion required

By 2030, at least 80% of electricity is to be produced from renewable energies. Offshore wind energy has an important role to play in this endeavor, and the expansion plans and associated tendering volumes have accordingly been significantly increased. The German government plans to increase the offshore wind energy capacity to at least 30 gigawatts (GW) by 2030 and at least 70 GW by 2045. This growth is regulated and promoted in the German Offshore Wind Energy Act (WindSeeG). The strategic planning is laid down in the area development plan and is relevant for the design, installation, and operation of wind farms. As the areas available for offshore wind farm development in the German Bight are limited, efficient utilization of this space is required to maximize the benefit of offshore wind. Therefore, offshore wind farms are often installed in groups known as clusters. Precise determination of the wind potential helps to optimize the energy yield from the areas. In the Controlled Cluster Wakes research project, ""C²-Wakes"" for short, scientists are investigating how the planning and operation of large offshore wind farms and wind farm clusters can be improved and rendered more efficient.

Improved methods for optimized wind farm yields

The turbines in large wind farm clusters can influence each other, with wakes with lower wind speeds and higher turbulence developing behind the turbines. Improved modeling and measurement of the wakes thus allows optimized site selection and resource planning for future offshore wind farms. The scientists plan to investigate how wakes from different wind farms overlap and how wake-optimized operational management may impact these effects in large offshore wind farms on both internal and also large-scale wakes. This requires extensive measurements and validated models. To this end, the project team is collecting data via a comprehensive scanning lidar measurement campaign in RWE's Amrumbank West offshore wind farm close to the German island of Heligoland. The devices installed on the wind turbine nacelles measure the flow fields downstream of the wind turbines. Using the acquired data, the scientists can analyze how the wind speeds evolve within the wind farm as well as how internal and large-scale wake effects behind the wind farm change if the control strategy is adapted, for example by testing wake steering.

""In the C²-Wakes project, we can draw on our findings from the earlier research project X-Wakes, where we gained a fundamental understanding of the interaction between long-range wake effects, the global blockage effect, and the coasts in the German Bight. These findings help us to investigate whether and how large-scale wind farm effects can be influenced. Among other things, we are combining assumptions about future wind turbine technologies, wind farm designs, and active wake steering,"" explained Dr. Martin Dörenkämper, project coordinator, Fraunhofer IWES.

As part of the project, the scientists at the University of Oldenburg, ForWind, are developing and evaluating high-resolution simulation methods and lidar measurement scenarios. The team from Helmholtz-Zentrum Hereon is analyzing satellite data and further developing methods for wind field reconstruction, which, in turn, should provide an answer to the question of how different wind turbine technologies, wind farm structures, and wind farm layouts impact wake effects. Offshore wind farms off the British coast will be analyzed as well.

Thomas Michel, COO RWE Offshore Wind, said: ""We are pressing ahead with the expansion of offshore wind energy worldwide. At the same time, we also intend to further accelerate the development and demonstration of innovative solutions. With the research results of the C²-Wakes project, we have the opportunity to make offshore wind energy even more cost-effective and efficient.""

The offshore scanning lidar measurement campaign started in early April with the installation of three devices and is intended to run for a period of at least six months. The data acquired will be used in the scope of the project for the validation of improved models. The research project was launched in May 2023 and will run for three years. In addition to scientific publications, the results will also be made available to industry and planning authorities in the form of recommendations for action and further developed open-source software tools such as the FOXES wind farm planning software.

RWE does not have to make any lease payments to the German Federal Network Agency (Bundesnetzagentur) for the Nordseecluster sites. The size of the cluster will provide synergy effects for RWE in the construction and subsequent operation of the wind farms. RWE will use the green electricity generated from the wind farms to support its industrial customers on the path to decarbonisation with customised energy solutions. These customers increasingly include operators of artificial intelligence (AI) data centres.

Globally, RWE is one of the leading players in offshore wind. In the past 20 years, the company has put 19 offshore wind farms into operation, including six off the German coast. RWE has set itself the goal of tripling its global offshore wind capacity from the current 3.3 GW to 10 GW in 2030.

The acquisitions include two development-stage renewables projects located in PacifiCorp's operating territory in the Pacific Northwest, as well as a mid-stage development asset in northeastern New York:

Hanson Wood, Head of Development, Utility-Scale Renewables for RWE Clean Energy, expressed excitement about the acquisitions, particularly the Remington and Cedar Ridge projects. Wood highlighted the expansion into the Pacific Northwest market, emphasizing the projects' potential to provide clean power, create jobs, and stimulate local economies.

John Clifford, Chief Revenue Officer for Galehead Development, LLC, commented on the transaction's significance, acknowledging the collaboration with RWE and the project's contribution to advancing renewable energy initiatives.

RWE currently boasts a development pipeline of 36 gigawatts (GW) of onshore wind, solar, and battery energy storage systems (BESS) in the U.S. This expansion aligns with RWE's strategic goal to grow its renewables portfolio from over 9 GW net installed capacity today to more than 19 GW net by 2030.

With the U.S. serving as a pivotal component of RWE's Growing Green strategy, the company aims to significantly increase its global green technology capacity to more than 65 GW by 2030, with the U.S. accounting for 30% of its global green portfolio by the end of the decade.",solarquarter.com,news,SolarQuarter,,0.4901960784313726,454579566,22,https://solarquarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/27-1.png,eng-9602252

German-born Ghanaian defender, Aaron Manu, is the latest player to be released, as reported by the WAZ newspaper.

The club has reportedly proposed an early transfer for the player.

Aaron Manu joined Rot-Weiss Essen (RWE) at the beginning of the current season. However, his tenure at the club has been marred by a series of injuries, which limited his playing time to a single appearance in the third tier and a few games in the national cup.

Despite being under contract with RWE until 2025, the club is eager to part ways with the defender. To facilitate an early termination of the contract,

Rot-Weiss Essen (RWE) would either have to secure a buyer for Aaron Manu or be prepared to pay substantial compensation fees.

European equities ended Monday broadly positive, while the U.S. market was closed for the Memorial Day holiday.

Traders maintained an overall positive risk sentiment on European assets, driven by near-total certainty that the European Central Bank (ECB) will deliver a rate cut at its June meeting.

Three key ECB members -- chief economist Philip Lane, Finland Central Bank governor Olli Rehn and France Central Bank governor François Villeroy de Galhau -- made reassuring statements indicating a rate cut is imminent.

""A June rate cut is appropriate if the inflation outlook holds,"" Lane said. ""Inflation is converging to our 2% target in a sustained way, making it the right time in June to ease the monetary policy stance and start cutting rates,"" Rehn said. ""Barring a surprise, a June rate cut is a done deal,"" Villeroy said.

Traders now almost fully price in a June rate cut and expect a total of 65 basis points in cuts (more than two cuts but less than three) by the end of the year.

RWE took the investment decision for its Nordseecluster project, which will be located about 50 kilometers (31 miles) north of the island of Juist and will be implemented in two phases.

The construction of Nordseecluster A with a capacity of 660 MW is due to start next year with full commissioning planned for early 2027, while the construction of Nordseecluster B with a capacity of 900 MW is expected to begin in 2027, with full commissioning to take place in early 2029, the German company said.

Suppliers of the main components have already been selected for the cluster as a whole, RWE added.

""RWE will use the green electricity generated from the wind farms to support its industrial customers on the path to decarbonisation with customised energy solutions. These customers increasingly include operators of AI data centres,"" the German firm said in a statement.

RWE has been shutting down coal capacity and boosting its renewables offering in recent years.

RWE said at the end of last year that it plans to invest $60 billion (55 billion euros) worldwide by 2030 in renewable energy, batteries, flexible generation, and hydrogen projects.

After the end of the 2023/2024 winter, RWE shut down permanently five coal power plant units in Germany, removing 2,100 megawatts (MW) of lignite capacity permanently from the grid. RWE has already decommissioned 12 lignite-fired power plant units with a total output of 4,200 MW since the end of 2020 and is confident it will complete its coal phase-out by 2030.

RWE, one of the leading renewable energy companies in the U.S. and worldwide, has signed two 15-year Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) with Microsoft Corporation. Under the PPAs, Microsoft will purchase clean electricity from two new RWE onshore wind farms in Texas.

The official groundbreaking for the RWE Peyton Creek II onshore wind farm has just taken place and for the Lane City project, RWE made the investment decision. The two onshore wind projects have a combined capacity of 446 megawatts (MW).

Andrew Flanagan, CEO of RWE Clean Energy: ""As RWE, we are excited to be working with Microsoft to provide the clean electricity they need to achieve their sustainability goals. Together, we're united in our efforts to deliver a clean energy future. As a growing green business, we are committed to driving our renewable targets, supporting local communities grow sustainably.""

To build the Peyton Creek II and Lane City onshore wind farms, RWE has brought together leading renewable industry companies Vestas, Wanzek Construction, Inc., a MasTec Renewables company, and RES, a global renewable energy solutions company.

RWE will use the V163 4.5 MW turbines from Vestas North America. RWE has enlisted Wanzek and RES to lead construction activities at Peyton Creek II and Lane City on behalf of RWE.

Construction of the Peyton Creek Wind Complex is underway. The 243 MW project is located near RWE's Peyton Creek I wind farm in Bay City, Texas, which has been in operation since March 2020. Construction of the Lane City project will start this summer. It has a capacity of 203 MW.

The projects underscore RWE's leadership position as a preeminent clean energy player and will expand its footprint in Texas. Texas is RWE's largest U.S. market, with 33 operational renewable projects totaling 4.3 GW of installed capacity, enough to power 2.76 million homes per year. Once the two projects are completed, RWE's renewables footprint in Texas will grow to 4.8 GW, strengthening its position in this section of the ERCOT market. This will add to RWE's current renewables portfolio in the U.S. of 9.3 GW across wind, solar and batteries.

U.S. Opposes European Plan to Censure Iran Over Nuclear Work

The Biden administration is pressing European allies to back off plans to rebuke Iran for advances in its nuclear program as it seeks to keep tensions with Tehran from escalating before the autumn's U.S. presidential election, according to diplomats involved in discussions.

The U.S. is arguing against an effort by Britain and France to censure Iran at the International Atomic Energy Agency's member state board in early June, the diplomats said. The U.S. has pressed a number of other countries to abstain in a censure vote, saying that is what Washington will do, they said.

U.S. officials deny lobbying against a resolution.

Gold Prices Drift Higher Ahead of U.S. Inflation Data -- Market Talk

0815 GMT - Gold futures rise 0.2% to $2,339.9 a troy ounce ahead of key U.S. inflation data later this week. The precious metal made small gains, recouping some of the losses sustained in Friday's session, when it closed at its lowest level in two weeks. The market has shifted focus to the next U.S. Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation, set for release on Friday. The data will be scrutinized for hints as to the Fed's pathway toward monetary easing, as high interest rates typically depress demand for the non-interest-bearing bullion. Gold fell over the course of last week, after Federal Reserve minutes released Wednesday included downbeat commentary on the prospect of rate cuts. (joseph.hoppe@wsj.com)

Hitachi Energy will supply its HVDC Light voltage source converter (VSC) stations in the first stage of the project, which involves an approximate 345km cable route HVDC system to enable the flow of renewable power in both directions between the Victorian and Tasmanian states.

Hitachi Energy's tech will convert alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC) for long-distance transmission and DC to AC, where the power is returned to the grid.

The Marinus Link will use advanced converter technology at both ends of the link to stabilise and integrate more renewables into the power grid.

The connection will enable the Tasmanian state to import excess supply of solar and wind produced in Victoria, while reserving its hydro and storing the extra energy.

Clean hydropower can then feed the mainland grid when it is needed most, acting as a large battery for the nation. Moreover, it strengthens the security of supply in the Australian power grid in which electricity is increasingly generated from sustainable energy.

Upon completion of both project stages, Marinus Link will have a total capacity of 1,500MW, equal to the power needed for 1.5 million Australian homes.

In line with Australia's net zero ambitions, as coal-fueled generation is retired, this link will result in saving up to 140 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent emissions by 2050, equal to taking approximately 1 million cars off the road.

Marinus Link is considered a project of national significance that will play a fundamental role in the two states' energy ecosystems in which power infrastructure requires a major overhaul to satisfy the growing electrical demands.

Commenting in a release, Marinus Link CEO Caroline Wykamp said, ""With our essential HVDC systems secured, Marinus Link is poised for delivery by the end of the decade. Marinus Link is a cornerstone project of the Australian Government's Rewiring the Nation Plan and is classified as urgent in the Australian Energy Market Operator's national energy plan.

But the notable exception is the PM's appearance that Mr Albanese and his fiancee, Jodie Haydon, made alongside Mr Joyce at a Qantas event in March 2023.

At the time, the PM shared photographs of himself and Ms Haydon alongside the then-Qantas CEO celebrating the national carrier's centenary.

But there's no trace of it in the newly-published diary details, which the PM's staff can redact if certain meetings or travel schedules could pose a threat to safety.

An appearance Mr Albanese and his fiancee, Jodie Haydon, made at a Qantas event in March 2023 is notably absent from the diary

Qantas decked out several planes in Yes23 merchandise and publicly supported the Voice

At the time, the PM was desperately trying to pitch his Indigenous Voice to Parliament referendum to the Australian public.

'Wonderful to hear the news that Qantas supports recognising Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in our constitution,' he said after the event.

'Here's to another 100 years.'

In turn, Qantas decked out several planes in Yes23 merchandise and publicly supported the Voice.

Mr Joyce would go on to face intense criticism for his handling of several crises in the top job at Qantas. He stepped down two months ahead of his planned retirement in September 2023 amid all the backlash.

The PM held catch ups with the referendum working group and key figures scattered throughout the diary, but a clear standout is his numerous meetings with CEOs in the resources sector.

It was quietly released to former independent senator Rex Patrick under Freedom of Information laws, offering an insight into the day-to-day requirements of running the country.

Mr Albanese spoke with the boss of BHP, Mike Henry, for 15 minutes back in February 2023, as well as Jakob Stausholm from BHP's rival Rio Tinto in May.

Meg O'Neill, the CEO of oil and gas giant Woodside, scored a 30 minute slot with the PM in February during a visit to Perth.

Beyond Australia, Mr Albanese met with CEO of Germany energy company RWE, Markus Krebber, as well as CEO of BlackRock Inc Larry Fink.

Outside of the resources sector, the PM has made plenty of time for sporting bosses.

Gillon McLachlan from the AFL, Peter Vlandys from NRL, Nick Hockley from Cricket Australia and Craig Tiley from Tennis Australia all met with Mr Albanese throughout 2023, as did FIFA president Gianni Infantino.

Greens leader Adam Bandt formally met with the PM seven times, the same number of times as Opposition Leader Peter Dutton.

Despite their repeated - and often heated - political brawls in the chamber and in the media, both Mr Dutton and Mr Albanese have indicated they have a decent relationship behind closed doors

Despite their repeated - and often heated - political brawls in the chamber and in the media, both Mr Dutton and Mr Albanese have indicated they have a decent relationship behind closed doors.

Just weeks after winning the election, Mr Albanese said: 'Peter Dutton, I must say, I have a much better relationship with Peter Dutton than I had with Scott Morrison.

'Peter Dutton has never broken a confidence that I've had with him.'

It comes after Mr Patrick successfully fought to have some of Mr Albanese's 2022 diary released under the same laws, despite opposition from the PM and his office.

Some 734 meetings and appointments from that period were redacted by government officials and therefore not available to the public, but Daily Mail Australia analysed the remaining contents of the diary on that occasion.

NRL chairman Peter V'Landys received a meeting with the PM in 2023

Tennis Australia boss Craig Tiley also met with the PM

Mr Dutton was one of the only figures to have repeated face-to-face meetings with Mr Albanese during that period.

The schedule offers an insight into the day-to-day life of a PM. Over that period, Mr Albanese regularly worked seven-day weeks, met with a wide variety of parliamentary colleagues and caught up with business heavyweights.

But any potentially juicy meetings or appointments Mr Albanese attended during that period weren't made available to the public as they were considered to be confidential information under s37 of the Freedom of Information Act.

That section states that releasing such details could 'endanger the life or physical safety of any person' or 'disclose, or enable a person to ascertain, the existence or identity of a confidential source of information'.

During Mr Albanese's first 100 days, the PM carved out repeated meetings with his inner circle of senior ministers - namely Foreign Minister Penny Wong and Finance Minister Katy Gallagher.

Both those ministers described by an anonymous Labor insider in a Nine newspapers report this week as figures who are so close to Mr Albanese they are like 'deputy PMs'.

Then there is Mr Dutton.

The duo first had a brief 15-minute meeting on July 26, the diary said. That was followed by 30 minutes on September 5, again on September 12, and again on October 27, joined on that occasion by Indigenous Australians Minister Linda Burney.

That could well be related to Mr Albanese's push for an Indigenous Voice to Parliament - which failed after Mr Dutton refused to provide bipartisan support for the measure.

A spokesperson said: 'The Government works constructively across the Parliament.

'The Prime Minister regularly meets or has discussions with the Opposition Leader.'

While appearances with the referendum working group and key figures are scattered throughout the diary, a clear standout is in fact his meetings with CEOs in the resources sector

The PM had just one official meeting with Qantas CEO Alan Joyce between May and December 2022 schedule in his diary.

This meeting took place just a month after Qatar Airways made the now infamous pitch to have more flight routes into Australia.

The pair met from 11am to 11.30am on Wednesday, November 23, in the midst of a jam-packed day for the PM in which he had breakfast with the Governor-General, followed by five meetings in the morning with people whose names were redacted from his diary.

Transport Minister Catherine King received a departmental brief the following January, but did not formally block the request until July.

Toward the end of 2023, when the decision was made public, Ms King faced intense scrutiny about the decision, and both she and Mr Albanese were grilled over whether Qantas had any influence over the decision.

An appearance Mr Albanese and his fiancee, Jodie Haydon, made at a Qantas event in March 2023 is notably absent from the diary

Qantas decked out several planes in Yes23 merchandise and publicly supported the Voice

At the time, the PM was desperately trying to pitch his Indigenous Voice to Parliament referendum to the Australian public.

'Wonderful to hear the news that Qantas supports recognising Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in our constitution,' he said after the event.

'Here's to another 100 years.'

In turn, Qantas decked out several planes in Yes23 merchandise and publicly supported the Voice.

Mr Joyce would go on to face intense criticism for his handling of several crises in the top job at Qantas. He stepped down two months ahead of his planned retirement in September 2023 amid all the backlash.

The PM held catch ups with the referendum working group and key figures scattered throughout the diary, but a clear standout is his numerous meetings with CEOs in the resources sector.

It was quietly released to former independent senator Rex Patrick under Freedom of Information laws, offering an insight into the day-to-day requirements of running the country.

Mr Albanese spoke with the boss of BHP, Mike Henry, for 15 minutes back in February 2023, as well as Jakob Stausholm from BHP's rival Rio Tinto in May.

Meg O'Neill, the CEO of oil and gas giant Woodside, scored a 30 minute slot with the PM in February during a visit to Perth.

Beyond Australia, Mr Albanese met with CEO of Germany energy company RWE, Markus Krebber, as well as CEO of BlackRock Inc Larry Fink.

Outside of the resources sector, the PM has made plenty of time for sporting bosses.

Gillon McLachlan from the AFL, Peter Vlandys from NRL, Nick Hockley from Cricket Australia and Craig Tiley from Tennis Australia all met with Mr Albanese throughout 2023, as did FIFA president Gianni Infantino.

Greens leader Adam Bandt formally met with the PM seven times, the same number of times as Opposition Leader Peter Dutton.

Despite their repeated - and often heated - political brawls in the chamber and in the media, both Mr Dutton and Mr Albanese have indicated they have a decent relationship behind closed doors

Despite their repeated - and often heated - political brawls in the chamber and in the media, both Mr Dutton and Mr Albanese have indicated they have a decent relationship behind closed doors.

Just weeks after winning the election, Mr Albanese said: 'Peter Dutton, I must say, I have a much better relationship with Peter Dutton than I had with Scott Morrison.

'Peter Dutton has never broken a confidence that I've had with him.'

It comes after Mr Patrick successfully fought to have some of Mr Albanese's 2022 diary released under the same laws, despite opposition from the PM and his office.

Some 734 meetings and appointments from that period were redacted by government officials and therefore not available to the public, but Daily Mail Australia analysed the remaining contents of the diary on that occasion.

NRL chairman Peter V'Landys received a meeting with the PM in 2023

Tennis Australia boss Craig Tiley also met with the PM

Mr Dutton was one of the only figures to have repeated face-to-face meetings with Mr Albanese during that period.

The schedule offers an insight into the day-to-day life of a PM. Over that period, Mr Albanese regularly worked seven-day weeks, met with a wide variety of parliamentary colleagues and caught up with business heavyweights.

But any potentially juicy meetings or appointments Mr Albanese attended during that period weren't made available to the public as they were considered to be confidential information under s37 of the Freedom of Information Act.

That section states that releasing such details could 'endanger the life or physical safety of any person' or 'disclose, or enable a person to ascertain, the existence or identity of a confidential source of information'.

Peter Dutton's meetings with the PM

During Mr Albanese's first 100 days, the PM carved out repeated meetings with his inner circle of senior ministers - namely Foreign Minister Penny Wong and Finance Minister Katy Gallagher.

Both those ministers described by an anonymous Labor insider in a Nine newspapers report this week as figures who are so close to Mr Albanese they are like 'deputy PMs'.

Then there is Mr Dutton.

The duo first had a brief 15-minute meeting on July 26, the diary said. That was followed by 30 minutes on September 5, again on September 12, and again on October 27, joined on that occasion by Indigenous Australians Minister Linda Burney.

That could well be related to Mr Albanese's push for an Indigenous Voice to Parliament - which failed after Mr Dutton refused to provide bipartisan support for the measure.

A spokesperson said: 'The Government works constructively across the Parliament.

'The Prime Minister regularly meets or has discussions with the Opposition Leader.'

While appearances with the referendum working group and key figures are scattered throughout the diary, a clear standout is in fact his meetings with CEOs in the resources sector

Anthony Albanese's meeting with Alan Joyce before Qatar decision

The PM had just one official meeting with Qantas CEO Alan Joyce between May and December 2022 schedule in his diary.

This meeting took place just a month after Qatar Airways made the now infamous pitch to have more flight routes into Australia.

The pair met from 11am to 11.30am on Wednesday, November 23, in the midst of a jam-packed day for the PM in which he had breakfast with the Governor-General, followed by five meetings in the morning with people whose names were redacted from his diary.

Transport Minister Catherine King received a departmental brief the following January, but did not formally block the request until July.

Toward the end of 2023, when the decision was made public, Ms King faced intense scrutiny about the decision, and both she and Mr Albanese were grilled over whether Qantas had any influence over the decision.

Enthusiasm for artificial intelligence helped drive a rally across equity markets in 2023, propelling Nvidia and Dutch semiconductor equipment supplier ASML (ASML.AS) into the spotlight.

Nvidia shares are hovering close to record highs ahead of its quarterly earnings due late on Wednesday. However, some of the sheen has rubbed off Europe's AI-linked megacaps, prompting investors to seek out cheaper alternatives.

Stock pickers are now looking at companies and sectors that are likely to be long-term AI beneficiaries.

""The first phase of AI was obviously chipmakers like Nvidia. Then you've already seen the second wave move to the industrial companies which actually supply the components to the data centres,"" said Bernie Ahkong, CIO Global Multi-Strategy Alpha at UBS O'Connor.

""And now we're just starting to get the third phase into utility/power firms in the past several weeks.""

Data centres, which are essential to the rise of generative AI, need huge amounts of energy and this is expected to surge as demand for the centres accelerates.

The International Energy Agency estimates total power consumption from data centres will top 1,000 terawatt hours (TWh) by 2026 - roughly what Japan consumes now - from 460 TWh in 2022.

""One of the most interesting ways within Europe to play AI on a multi-year basis actually is via some of these utilities companies,"" UBS O'Connor's Ahkong said.

Demand for data centre space in Europe is also set to outstrip delivery of new stock for the third straight year and AI demand will exacerbate the issue, said Kevin Restivo, who heads European data centre research at real estate services provider CBRE.

In the last five weeks, the utilities index (.SX6P) has risen over 9 per cent, driven largely by expectations for interest rate cuts, versus a 4.7 per cent rise in the main STOXX 600 (.STOXX) index. But they are still lagging the rest of the market year-to-date, up just 0.2 per cent versus a 9 per cent rise in the benchmark index.

Bank of America said in a recent note European utilities bosses are talking about AI, but upside potential from data centres is ""anecdotal at best"".

Even so, the bank says plenty of companies could benefit from a boom in AI-linked power demand, from Fortum (FORTUM.HE), Verbund (VERB.VI) and renewables supplier EDP (EDP.LS), to larger players like RWE (RWEG.DE), Iberdrola (IBE.MC), Enel (ENEI.MI) and Engie (ENGIE.PA).

A year ago, investors had been jittery around the disruptive potential of AI for anything from IT services to media, education and consulting.

""How I look at AI in the UK, the US has the enablers, we've got the adopters,"" Trevor Green, head of UK equities for Aviva Investors, said.

""When investors will get particularly interested is when we can actually quantify this in revenue potential. The providers are rightly still being a bit evasive on this as we are at such an early stage of adoption,"" he said.

He highlighted the London Stock Exchange (LSEG.L), information and analytics group RELX (REL.L) and software group Sage (SGE.L) as examples of companies that have been working on AI for years.

""Now we are properly starting to see revenue-generating opportunities from it,"" he said.

Marcel Stotzel, co-portfolio manager of Fidelity European Fund and Fidelity European Trust, says a lot of the AI hype has been around the big US names behind the technology.

In the past year, shares in the likes of OpenAI backer Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Alphabet's Google (GOOGL.O) have shot up 33 per cent-41 per cent.

Meanwhile, some European companies have been quietly using AI to develop new products that are already benefiting their customers, said Stotzel.

""This has resulted in the European-listed beneficiaries trading at more attractive valuations,"" he said, listing German software company SAP (SAPG.DE) and Swiss drugmaker Roche (ROG.S) among those his team are focused on to play the AI theme.

Miners are another area of investor interest, particularly for copper , which has hit record highs above $11,000 a metric ton this week, spurred largely by a shortage of material for prompt delivery.

Commodity trader Trafigura believes copper demand linked to data centres and AI could add up to one million tons by 2030 and exacerbate supply deficits towards the end of the decade.

""The copper boom is also part of the AI craze,"" Kathleen Brooks, research director at trading platform XTB, said.",cyprus-mail.com,news,Cyprus Mail,,0.3098039215686275,454395787,1,https://cms.cyprus-mail.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/ai-artificial-intelligence.jpg,

Through the acquisition, RWE will take over a mature pipeline of solar and battery storage development projects, predominantly located in the central and southern regions of England. A large proportion of the projects already have grid connections and land secured.

It is anticipated that the first projects may be operational as early as the end of 2024.

RWE is a leading global player in renewables and expects to invest more than €50bn by 2030 to grow its green core business internationally, with around £15bn earmarked for the UK.

Stephen Rigby, the London-based corporate partner who led the Norton Rose Fulbright team, commented: ""This was an exciting and significant project, which will strengthen RWE's renewables business in the UK. We were delighted to help RWE continue to grow and diversify its portfolio through the addition of these solar and battery development projects.""

Just under 400 guests gathered to celebrate the regional energy industry and also support a worthy cause, creating a night to remember.

SNS has become a highlight in the energy sector's social calendar - and this year's event, compered by EEEGR executive chair Kevin Keable, did not disappoint.

Attendees were treated to an evening of exquisite dining, live entertainment and inspiring speeches from representatives from RWE and NARS (Norfolk Accident Rescue Service), the chosen charity for SNS2024.

The atmosphere was one of camaraderie and jovial spirit, as guests came together to enjoy the festivities and contribute to a noble cause.

One of the evening's highlights was the charity speech, made by Steve Maddams who works as an energy brand specialist for LOCALiQ / Insight Energy and also responds for NARS.

Dinner guests bid enthusiastically for the auction prize of an electric flight with Saxon Air and VIP tickets to the Old Buckenham Airshow, and their generosity contributed significantly to the night's fundraising efforts.

In total, the gala raised an impressive £3,021 for NARS, Norfolk's dedicated emergency medical charity.

The Utah Frontier Observatory for Research in Geothermal Energy (FORGE) said on May 23 it made a major geothermal breakthrough, having established enhanced connectivity, fluid flow and energy transfer between two enhanced geothermal system wells.

The project is part of a global field lab managed by the University of Utah's Energy & Geoscience Institute and sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy.

""These stimulations and the short-term circulation test are the culmination of more than two years of planning and in-depth data analysis,"" John McLennan, the professor who oversaw the activities, said in a news release. ""Enfranchising the knowledge gained from previous activities, and with advice from a diverse team of specialists from industry and academia, the Utah FORGE team was able to achieve outstanding results.""

The production well was hydraulically fractured in eight stages over a two-week period. Four stages were injected. To locate fractures intersecting the injection well, fiber optic cables were monitored. ""The recorded fiber optic signatures highlighted intervals of fracture intersection or proximity,"" Utah FORGE said. ""These intervals were selected and perforated for subsequent stimulation. Stimulating both wells ensured connectivity.""

Connectivity was established with no induced seismicity greater than magnitude 1.9, according to the release.

A circulation test followed stimulation. Utah FORGE said water was injected -- at up to 15 bbl per minute -- into the well for nine hours. That led to up to 8 bbl per minute of production, with an efficiency rate of about 70% recovery. Hot water produced confirmed the potential of enhanced geothermal systems (EGS), Utah FORGE said.

Considered a form of next-generation geothermal technology, EGS has the potential to move the U.S. toward its emissions reduction goals. Harnessed heat can be used to generate electricity or for heating or cooling via direct use.

Next steps include more fieldwork, including a 30-day circulation test planned in July, according to a news release.

Here's a look at other renewable energy news this week.

Waste management company WM has opened a $55 million RNG site in Lewisville, Texas, near Dallas, where it plans to produce about 1.2 million MMBtu per year of RNG.

Called DFW RNG, the facility will process landfill gas captured at the company's DFW Landfill, WM said in a May 22 news release.

The facility opening came about four years after WM opened its Skyline RNG facility in Ferris, Texas, south of Dallas.

The waste management company plans to invest more than $1 billion from 2022 to 2026 in renewable energy. The plan includes more than 20 RNG facilities, which could power up to 1.7 million homes, the company said.

California-based Ocean Pacific (OP) has landed private equity firm Cresta Fund Management as a controlling investor, allowing the company to expand its capabilities.

The backing will enable OP, which develops compressed natural gas and provides engineering, design and construction services to third-party CNG station operators, to begin commercialization and operation of fueling stations, Cresta said in a May 22 news release.

While CNG is an alternative lower-emission fossil fuel, RNG can used in CNG form to fuel CNG vehicles.

""Our investment in Ocean Pacific aligns perfectly with our strategy to seek opportunities to build low-carbon molecule infrastructure that provides a solution for the energy transition,"" said Chris Rozzell, Managing Partner at Cresta. ""OP's leadership in the CNG market, combined with our capital and both operational and development expertise, will significantly enhance the availability of clean fuel alternatives.""

OP has designed more than 400 CNG fueling stations, according to the release.

U.S.-based Tesla reportedly broke ground this week on a megafactory in Shanghai, China, where it plans to begin mass producing batteries in 2025, according to Chinese state media.

The company plans to initially produce 10,000 Megapack units per year at the nearly 200,000-square-meter plant. The plant, announced in April 2023, is located in the Lin-gang Special Area of the China (Shanghai) Pilot Free Trade Zone.

""I believe the new plant is a milestone for both Shanghai and Tesla,"" Tesla vice president Tao Lin told China's Xinhua in an exclusive interview. She added, ""In a more open environment, we can create a new Tesla speed at the Megapack factory, and supply the global market with large-scale energy-storage batteries manufactured in China.""

Portuguese Company Eyes Two Lithium Refineries in Iberia by 2030

A newly established Portuguese company backed by a wealthy business conglomerate hopes to build two lithium refineries in the Iberian Peninsula by 2030, its chief executive said on May 21.

Lifthium, helmed by CEO Duarte Braga, said the lithium refineries would be built in the northern Portuguese municipality of Estarreja, and in Torrelaverga, in the Spanish region of Cantabria.

With some 60,000 tonnes of known reserves, Portugal is already Europe's biggest producer of lithium, traditionally mined for ceramics.

Along with neighboring Spain, the country wants to take advantage of local lithium deposits, aiming to cover the entire value chain from mining and refining to cell and battery manufacturing to battery recycling.

The plan is in line with Europe's drive to reduce its dependence on countries such as China for key materials for the green transition.

""Almost 80% of lithium refining comes from China and what we want to try to do is to reverse (that trend),"" Braga told members of Portugal's foreign press association.

Canada-based E3 Lithium on May 23 said the Saskatchewan property it acquired in 2021 has inferred mineral resources of about 2.5 million tonnes of lithium carbonate equivalent.

The resource estimate is based on results of a technical report, the company said.

""The resource over our Saskatchewan Property represents an exciting development prospect for E3 Lithium and reinforces the company's position for lithium development in Western Canada, adding to our globally significant lithium resources,"" E3 Lithium CEO Chris Doornbos said in the release. ""Saskatchewan is still maturing its resources base and this inaugural 2.5 Mt LCE resource adds to this new and developing lithium jurisdiction.""

The area covers about 67,000 hectares (about 165,560 acres) of crown mineral permits within the Estevan Lithium District in southeast Saskatchewan. E3 Lithium said elevated lithium concentrations of interest are in the Duperow Formation, which was broken into six zones based on geological characteristics. Lithium concentrations near E3's land holdings have been as high as 259 mg/liter in the Duperow, the company said.

Aerospace corporation Airbus has formed partnerships in three cities -- Atlanta, Houston and Vancouver -- to launch studies focused on developing hydrogen hubs at major airports in North America, the company said May 21.

In Canada, Airbus and ZeroAvia signed a memorandum of understanding with the Montréal-Trudeau International Airport (YUL), Toronto Pearson International Airport (YYZ) and Vancouver International Airport (YVR) to study the feasibility of a hydrogen infrastructure at airports in Canada, according to a news release.

In Georgia, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL), Delta Air Lines and Plug Power agreed to study the feasibility of a hydrogen-based hub. Airbus said ""the study will help define the infrastructure, operational viability and safety and security requirements needed to implement hydrogen as a fuel source for future aircraft operations at ATL.""

In Houston, Airbus has partnered with the Center for Houston's Future (CHF) and Houston Airports to study the feasibility of a hydrogen hub at George Bush Intercontinental Airport. The focus will be on pinpointing opportunities and barriers, infrastructure development and usage at the airport.

Airbus, which launched its ZEROe hydrogen-powered aircraft project in 2020, aims to bring to market the world's first hydrogen-powered commercial aircraft by 2035.

""By embarking on these exploratory endeavors, we are taking proactive measures to understand the requirements for establishing hydrogen hubs at major airports across North America,"" said Karine Guenan, Airbus vice president of ZEROe Ecosystem. ""This strategic initiative reflects our dedication to driving innovation and shaping the future of air travel in a manner that is environmentally responsible and technologically advanced. Through collaboration with key stakeholders, we aim to pave the way for a future where hydrogen-powered flight becomes a tangible reality.""

Danish company Ørsted has secured an investment of $680 million in tax equity financing from J.P. Morgan for a portfolio of solar and storage assets in Texas and Arizona, the clean energy developer said on May 23.

The tax equity allows for tax credit transferability under the Inflation Reduction Act, which corporate buyers can purchase to support clean energy storage projects in the U.S. Additionally, the Biden administration is undertaking a separate effort to identify areas in 11 western states best suited for solar energy development, which it expects to finalize by the end of the year.

European panel manufacturers are also looking to develop projects outside of the EU, as they are weighed by competition from China and the U.S. whose governments give more support to their producers.

The investment will help fund the completion of its Arizona project along with its 250-megawatt (MW) solar project in Texas, the company said.

Ørsted's 300 MW Arizona facility will receive a one-time investment tax credit investment for its battery storage system, which has become a priority technology amid rising renewable energy capacity. Arizona's solar farm will generate production tax credits for the next decade.

J.P Morgan, before this deal, had investments in 1.8 gigawatts (GW) of Ørsted's 5.7 GW onshore portfolio in the U.S.

The company expects commercial operations for both projects to begin in 2024.

Recurrent Energy, a unit of solar technology firm Canadian Solar, said on May 23 it has secured multi-currency revolving credit facility of up to 1.3 billion euros (US$1.41 billion) with 10 banks.

The credit facility will be used for construction of renewable energy projects in several European countries. Recurrent Energy and the participating financial institutions signed the deal in Seville, Spain.

The facility will be available for three years with optional extensions. It is initially sized at 674 million euros but includes potential upsizing to about 1.3 billion euros.

""This agreement solidifies Recurrent Energy's growth strategy and our transformation into one of the world's leading independent renewable energy producers and developers,"" Recurrent Energy CEO Ismael Guerrero said.

Rising renewable energy capacity and the deployment of electric vehicles are expected to make energy storage a priority technology. The revolving credit facility will provide flexible financing for the construction of solar and battery energy storage projects across Spain, Italy, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, France and Germany.

As renewable energy expands across Europe to meet decarbonization goals, battery usage needs to grow to smooth out the intermittent supply of renewable energy.

Microsoft Corp. has inked two 15-year power purchase agreements with RWE for power from two new wind farms in Texas, the renewable energy company said May 23.

The deals were reached as the tech company moves toward completely powering its operations with renewable energy by 2025.

As part of the PPA, electricity will come RWE's 243-MW Peyton Creek II onshore wind farm and the 203-MW Lane City wind farm. Construction is underway for Peyton Creek II, which is near Peyton Creek I in Bay City, Texas, RWE said. The company recently made a final investment decision to construct Lane City, which will be located in Wharton County, Texas. Construction is set to start this summer.

The company said it plans to use Vestas' V163 4.5-MW turbines. Wanzek and RES will lead construction activities for both sites, RWE said.

The final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) for the combined 2.8-GW Atlantic Shores Offshore Wind project has been released by the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM).

Atlantic Shores Offshore Wind, a 50-50 joint venture between Shell New Energies and EDF Renewables Offshore Development, proposed developing the project in two parts. Combined, the development will include up to 200 wind turbines and up to 10 offshore substations. If approved by regulators, the development could generate enough power for about 1 million homes, according to the BOEM.

""Completing this environmental analysis is a significant milestone in the administration's drive to realize clean energy ambitions that will enhance the lives of Americans now and for generations to come,"" BOEM Director Elizabeth Klein said in a news release May 23.

The Biden-Harris administration aims to deploy 30 GW of offshore wind energy capacity by 2030. So far, eight commercial-scale offshore wind developments with a combined capacity of over 10 GW have been approved since the administration's start.

Atlantic Shores is located about nine miles offshore New Jersey on a more than 102,000-acre lease area. Developers are targeting first power in 2027.

Brazil-based Aliança Energia has inaugurated the 109-MW Acauã Wind Complex, located in the state of Rio Grande do Norte, the company said May 21.

The wind complex is comprised of four wind farms in the municipalities of Santana do Matos, Lagoa Nova, São Vicente and Lieutenant Laurentino Cruz. The complex produces enough power for about 580,000 homes, according to Aliança Energia.

The complex features 26 wind turbines, a 17.7-km long transmission line and 53 galvanized steel towers, which connects to a substation integrating electricity into the National Interconnected System, the company said.

Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners (CIP) completed construction of the Changfang-Xidao offshore wind farms in Taiwan, the company's first offshore wind project in the Asia-Pacific region.

""The inauguration of Changfang-Xidao is a landmark for CIP as well as for the offshore wind industry in Taiwan,"" said Christina Grumstrup Sørensen, senior partner at CIP. ""In the past seven years, the development and construction team, suppliers, partners and shareholders have demonstrated the power of close collaboration.""

Located 11 km off the west coast of Taiwan, the wind farms include 62 Vestas V174 turbines and jacket foundations supplied by Taiwan's Century Wind Power. Changfang-Xidao is expected to generate enough power for about 650,000 households when the project becomes fully operational, CIP said.

CIP's Flagship funds CI II and CI III are the majority owners in the project. Thailand-based Global Power Synergy Public Co. and Taiwanese life insurance companies Taiwan Life and Transglobe Life hold minority stakes.

Iberdrola has selected Havfram to install wind turbines at the Windanker project in the German Baltic Sea, according to a May 21 news release.

The MoU will strengthen collaboration between supply chains in Norway and the east of England.

NOW, an industry network with almost 400 members, has also set up a dedicated working group to get its members involved in UK projects. Norway's government has set a target for 30GW of offshore wind capacity by 2040.

EEEGR represents about 200 members in England, working across every energy sector.

Chair of EEEGR, Kevin Keable, said: ""This could be really important for our members to access the opportunity to find business in Norway, using skills and techniques developed in our region. We hope that our members can forge profitable and rewarding partnerships with our Norwegian neighbours.""

The east of England has emerged as an offshore wind hub in the UK with large developers, including Scottish Power Renewables, RWE and Ørsted, operating in the region. The area also benefits from a strong supply chain.

Indeed, at the beginning of this month, the Crown Estate published a report that found the UK's offshore wind market represents more than 40% of European offshore wind capacity, having grown to 93GW in 2023. The report also showed that 10GW of UK offshore wind was added to the market and produced 49TWh of electricity, a record amount of generation.

NOW's manager said: ""East of England is one of the major offshore wind hubs in the largest market in Europe. With the North Sea as a common sea basin with Norway, it will certainly benefit our members to strengthen the collaboration with the industry in this region.""

Alfred Risan, leader of NOW's working group for the UK, added: ""This MoU is a two-way street, also opening doors for UK companies targeting the Norwegian offshore wind market.

""With pooling the resources and capabilities in the two countries in areas such as early development, balance of plants, fabrication, installation and O&M that will create strong synergies and commercial opportunities.""",current-news.co.uk,news,Current,Molly Green,0.388235294117647,454243590,1,https://www.current-news.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Morven-Wind-Contract_Image.jpg,

Under the PPAs, Microsoft will purchase clean electricity from two new RWE onshore wind farms in Texas.

The official groundbreaking for the RWE Peyton Creek II onshore wind farm has just taken place and for the Lane City project, RWE made the investment decision. The two onshore wind projects have a combined capacity of 446 MW.

""As RWE, we are excited to be working with Microsoft to provide the clean electricity they need to achieve their sustainability goals. Together, we're united in our efforts to deliver a clean energy future. As a growing green business, we are committed to driving our renewable targets, supporting local communities grow sustainably,"" Andrew Flanagan, CEO of RWE Clean Energy.

To build the Peyton Creek II and Lane City onshore wind farms, RWE has brought together leading renewable industry companies Vestas, Wanzek Construction, Inc., a MasTec Renewables company, and RES, a global renewable energy solutions company.

RWE will use the V163 4.5 MW turbines from Vestas North America. RWE has enlisted Wanzek and RES to lead construction activities at Peyton Creek II and Lane City on behalf of RWE.

Construction of the Peyton Creek Wind Complex is underway. The 243 MW project is located near RWE's Peyton Creek I wind farm in Bay City, Texas, which has been in operation since March 2020. Construction of the Lane City project will start this summer. It has a capacity of 203 MW.

The projects underscore RWE's position as a preeminent clean energy player and will expand its footprint in Texas. Texas is RWE's largest US market, with 33 operational renewable projects totaling 4.3 GW of installed capacity, enough to power 2.76 million homes per year. Once the two projects are completed, RWE's renewables footprint in Texas will grow to 4.8 GW, strengthening its position in this section of the ERCOT market. This will add to RWE's current renewables portfolio in the US of 9.3 GW across wind, solar and batteries.

RWE is committed to partnering with the communities in which it owns and operates renewables facilities to ensure long-term economic benefits, employment opportunities and tax revenues to support local schools, law enforcement, fire districts and other essential services. Both Peyton Creek II and Lane City are expected to generate between 250-300 jobs each during construction and 20 full-time jobs once operational. Additionally, Peyton Creek II will provide approximately US$300 million to the local tax base in Matagorda County and Lane City will provide US$300 million to the local tax base in Wharton County.

It has an installed capacity of 60 megawatts and has been powering the electricity needs for the equivalent of all the homes in King's Lynn (48,000) for two decades.

Located on the Scroby Sands prehistoric sandbank in the North Sea, 2.5 kilometres off the coast of Great Yarmouth, it was one of the first of a group of projects to be built in coastal locations with relatively shallow waters close to shore.

The 30 turbines are located in water from 13 to 20 metres deep. Each turbine has three 40-metre blades that rotate around a centre-point some 60 metres above the mean sea level.

""However, due to natural changes in the marine environment and coastal erosion, the sandbank has risen over time, effectively isolating four turbines from being accessed by service vessels,"" explained Phillip Croston-Clegg, Scroby Sands' general manager.

""To that end, RWE, in partnership with Commercial Rib Charters (CRC), initiated an offshore wind revolution, with the innovative design and build of a world-first amphibious crew transfer vessel for reaching offshore wind farms in shallow waters.

""The unique vessel, named the CRC Walrus, it is a fully seaworthy crew transfer vessel, which can also drive on land, providing a unique access solution for some of the industry's first-generation assets affected by very dynamic seabed conditions.""

A fire in the nacelle of one of the turbines in August 2023 resulted in the loss of that turbine. The decision to remove or re-plant the affected turbine is not yet confirmed. RWE is reviewing technical solutions for both options due to the complex and amphibious nature of the specific location.

All remaining turbines continue to be operational.

As RWE celebrates Scroby Sands' 20th birthday, it is reviewing what the next five years for the wind farm will look like, and its end-of-life management.

In addition to Scroby Sands, RWE has an extensive portfolio of offshore wind projects in East Anglia: three operational sites and five projects in development, including the recently acquired Norfolk Vanguard East and West and Norfolk Boreas projects.

Scroby Sands sparked an offshore wind revolution with the innovative design and build of a world-first amphibious vessel for reaching offshore wind farms in shallow waters.

The unique crew transfer vessel was initially designed to reach turbines at Scroby Sands, which have become stranded by the natural rising tide of the sandbank on which it is built.

The CRC Walrus took its maiden voyage in early January 2023 with positive results, achieving speeds of 24 knots on water and 6 km/h on land.

The 12-meter vessel has a 1,000kg cargo capacity and is capable of safely transferring 10 technicians and two crew to any of the turbines within the Scroby Sands array, including on the raised sandbank.

The design means that the two wheels at the front and one at the back can be deployed, similar to an aircraft, when transferring from deeper water into shallow water and sand.

Sven Utermöhlen, CEO of offshore wind at RWE Renewables, said: ""The new amphibious maintenance vessel at Scroby Sands is really exciting; it's a great testimony to the talent of our employees and contractors, and once again demonstrates RWE and its partners leading the way in future-proofing offshore wind.

CRC Walrus has enabled access to the four turbines on Scroby Sands that have been stranded by rising tides (Image: RWE)

""Innovation is a critical part of the energy transition, supporting the growth of the offshore industry and ensuring the long-life operations of our offshore wind fleet in the UK and around the world.""

The fully seaworthy vessel, which can also drive on land, provided a unique access solution for some of the industry's first-generation assets affected by very dynamic seabed conditions.

Natural changes in the marine environment and coastal erosion effectively isolated four turbines from being accessed by service vessels.

The bespoke solution was jointly developed in record time between RWE's operations team, its technical innovation team and its vessel provider Commercial Rib Charter (CRC), which contracted naval architects Chartwell Marine to carry out the design to the specifications requested.

The vessel was built by Isle of Wight based boat builders Diverse Marine, and is operated for RWE by CRC on a six-year contract.

The fully seaworthy vessel is named 'CRC Walrus' in honour of R.J. Mitchells' classic 1930s Supermarine amphibious biplane.

When offshore photographers and filmmakers Alan O'Neill and Andrew Pinder went off Great Yarmouth to capture the construction of Scroby Sands, they had to hire a fishing boat because crew transfer vessels didn't exist.

It was one of the first offshore wind farms that Alan and Andrew photographed and filmed. This year, Alan's CHPV business marks its 60th anniversary, having photographed and filmed on offshore gas assets as well as being involved at the start of the wind industry.

It has an installed capacity of 60 megawatts and has been powering the electricity needs for the equivalent of all the homes in King's Lynn (48,000) for two decades.

Located on the Scroby Sands prehistoric sandbank in the North Sea, 2.5 kilometres off the coast of Great Yarmouth, it was one of the first of a group of projects to be built in coastal locations with relatively shallow waters close to shore.

The 30 turbines are located in water from 13 to 20 metres deep. Each turbine has three 40-metre blades that rotate around a centre-point some 60 metres above the mean sea level.

""However, due to natural changes in the marine environment and coastal erosion, the sandbank has risen over time, effectively isolating four turbines from being accessed by service vessels,"" explained Phillip Croston-Clegg, Scroby Sands' general manager.

""To that end, RWE, in partnership with Commercial Rib Charters (CRC), initiated an offshore wind revolution, with the innovative design and build of a world-first amphibious crew transfer vessel for reaching offshore wind farms in shallow waters.

""The unique vessel, named the CRC Walrus, it is a fully seaworthy crew transfer vessel, which can also drive on land, providing a unique access solution for some of the industry's first-generation assets affected by very dynamic seabed conditions.""

A fire in the nacelle of one of the turbines in August 2023 resulted in the loss of that turbine. The decision to remove or re-plant the affected turbine is not yet confirmed. RWE is reviewing technical solutions for both options due to the complex and amphibious nature of the specific location.

All remaining turbines continue to be operational.

As RWE celebrates Scroby Sands' 20th birthday, it is reviewing what the next five years for the wind farm will look like, and its end-of-life management.

In addition to Scroby Sands, RWE has an extensive portfolio of offshore wind projects in East Anglia: three operational sites and five projects in development, including the recently acquired Norfolk Vanguard East and West and Norfolk Boreas projects.

Scroby Sands sparked an offshore wind revolution with the innovative design and build of a world-first amphibious vessel for reaching offshore wind farms in shallow waters.

The unique crew transfer vessel was initially designed to reach turbines at Scroby Sands, which have become stranded by the natural rising tide of the sandbank on which it is built.

The CRC Walrus took its maiden voyage in early January 2023 with positive results, achieving speeds of 24 knots on water and 6 km/h on land.

The 12-meter vessel has a 1,000kg cargo capacity and is capable of safely transferring 10 technicians and two crew to any of the turbines within the Scroby Sands array, including on the raised sandbank.

The design means that the two wheels at the front and one at the back can be deployed, similar to an aircraft, when transferring from deeper water into shallow water and sand.

Sven Utermöhlen, CEO of offshore wind at RWE Renewables, said: ""The new amphibious maintenance vessel at Scroby Sands is really exciting; it's a great testimony to the talent of our employees and contractors, and once again demonstrates RWE and its partners leading the way in future-proofing offshore wind.

""Innovation is a critical part of the energy transition, supporting the growth of the offshore industry and ensuring the long-life operations of our offshore wind fleet in the UK and around the world.""

The fully seaworthy vessel, which can also drive on land, provided a unique access solution for some of the industry's first-generation assets affected by very dynamic seabed conditions.

Natural changes in the marine environment and coastal erosion effectively isolated four turbines from being accessed by service vessels.

The bespoke solution was jointly developed in record time between RWE's operations team, its technical innovation team and its vessel provider Commercial Rib Charter (CRC), which contracted naval architects Chartwell Marine to carry out the design to the specifications requested.

The vessel was built by Isle of Wight based boat builders Diverse Marine, and is operated for RWE by CRC on a six-year contract.

The fully seaworthy vessel is named 'CRC Walrus' in honour of R.J. Mitchells' classic 1930s Supermarine amphibious biplane.

When offshore photographers and filmmakers Alan O'Neill and Andrew Pinder went off Great Yarmouth to capture the construction of Scroby Sands, they had to hire a fishing boat because crew transfer vessels didn't exist.

Interim Financial Results for the six months ended 31 March 2024

This announcement contains regulated information.

* Two quarterly dividends were paid during the period totalling 4.00p per share. With effect from the dividend paid in February 2024, the quarterly dividend was increased by 5.1% to 2.05p per share (8.2p per share per annum)

* The Company continues to buy back shares while the share price is at a significant discount to the NAV; your board considers this to be in

the best interests of shareholders

* Continuing growth in earnings and dividends from companies in the portfolio suggests compelling value and is at odds with currently low

valuation multiples for these essential assets businesses

1. Please refer to Alternative Performance Measures in the Interim Report.

2. Dividends paid (annualised) as a percentage of share price.

3. Gearing is the Company's borrowings (including the net amounts due from/to brokers) less cash divided by net assets attributable to shareholders.

4. The ongoing charges figure is calculated in accordance with guidance issued by the Association of Investment Companies (""AIC"") as the

operating costs (annualised) divided by the average NAV (with income) throughout the period.

5. The Company was incorporated on 27 June 2016 and its investment activities began on 13 September 2016 when the liquid assets of Ecofin Water & Power Opportunities plc (""EWPO"") were transferred to it. The formal inception date for the measurement of the Company's performance is 26 September 2016, the date its shares were listed on the London Stock Exchange.

6. Total return includes dividends paid and reinvested immediately. Please also refer to the Alternative Performance Measures in the Interim Report.

7. The S&P Global Infrastructure Index and MSCI World Utilities Index are the global sector indices deemed the most appropriate for performance comparison purposes. The Company does not have a formal benchmark index. The other indices are provided for general interest.

I am pleased to report that your Company's net asset value (NAV) increased by 9.0% over the six months to 31 March 2024, including the reinvestment of dividends. This exceeded the comparative global sector indices, the S&P Global Infrastructure Index and the MSCI World Utilities Index, which both increased by 8.2% (total return in sterling). The share price total return was more modest at 3.2% because the discount widened, averaging 14.2% during the six months. Investment trusts generally continued to be out of favour, as evidenced by unusually

large share price discounts to NAV.

As our Investment Manager explains in more detail, performance was encouragingly strong in the North American part of the portfolio. Exposure to select US utilities had already been increased, stock selection was beneficial, and utility valuations finally began to recover. Despite falling European natural gas and power prices for much of the half-year, the portfolio's diversified pan-European group of shares, spanning utilities, transportation infrastructure and environmental services, also contributed positively to the NAV. Our modest level of gearing enhanced the NAV as well, helped by the fact that the cost of borrowings was once again lower than the portfolio's dividend yield.

Continuation vote

Shareholders demonstrated their support for the Company by voting overwhelmingly in favour of the continuation vote put to shareholders at the recent Annual General Meeting (AGM). The next continuation vote will be at the AGM in 5 years' time.

Dividends

In light of growth in investment income and earnings per share, we were pleased to announce in December a 5.1% increase in the quarterly dividend to 2.05p per share (8.20p per annum) with effect from the dividend paid in February 2024. Growth in our portfolio's income continued during the half-year to 31 March: compared with the same period last year, investment income and revenue per share increased by 10.8% and 11.4% respectively. At the current share price and increased dividend rate, the Company's shares yield 4.4%.

Share price and buybacks

When our shares were trading at a premium to net asset value, we issued over 12 million new shares to investors. Subsequently, and alongside much of the rest of the investment trust sector, our share price sank to a double digit percentage discount. We think it is right to balance our willingness to issue at a premium with a willingness to buy back shares. Accordingly, during the half-year we used the authority granted by shareholders to repurchase a total of 1.3 million shares (£2.1 million), with an additional 3.3 million shares repurchased since 31 March. This has enhanced NAV to the benefit of shareholders.

At the AGM, Iain McLaren retired from the board and Joanna Santinon succeeded him as chair of the audit committee. Susannah Nicklin was appointed Senior Independent Director.

Outlook

Continuing growth in earnings and dividends is expected from companies in the portfolio. The currently low valuation multiples for many of these essential assets businesses in both absolute terms and relative to broader markets strongly suggest that these companies are significantly undervalued relative to their prospects for growth, earnings and cash generation.

In the current economic environment, we believe that the portfolio has some significant strengths.

First, a high proportion of portfolio companies have revenues which are inflation-linked and based on long term contracts.

Secondly, your Company's utility exposure includes leading power generators and owners of major transmission and distribution grids. These network operators are as fundamental to the delivery of the energy transition as renewable energy sources, and they are stepping up capital investments meaningfully.

Your Investment Manager expects attractive returns will be earned on these investments.

Thirdly, portfolio companies providing transportation infrastructure and environmental services have attractive and growing dividend yields based on long term earnings growth derived from demand and strong pricing power.

After a difficult 18 months, we are confident that we passed a turning point in February and that the prospect for shareholders has become much brighter. Since then, the share price has appreciated by 21% (11% since the end of March) and we have declared a second quarterly dividend of 2.05p.

After sharp declines in August and September last year as interest rates spiked, EGL's NAV and share price recovered in the final calendar quarter of 2023. This proved to be a false dawn with both falling back to their 2023 lows by February 2024 while equity market momentum was centred around technology sectors and expectations for interest rate cuts were scaled back. February has proved to have been a decisive turning point though with a marked improvement in EGL's performance since then.

During the half-year we remained focussed on the underlying performance of portfolio companies which, on both sides of the Atlantic, were mostly delivering good results, eye-catching dividend growth and return-enhancing capital expenditure plans. In the US, power demand dynamics strengthened (due to the economy generally as well as GenAI, datacentres, re-shoring, EVs) and utility valuations stabilised, helped by a renaissance for nuclear power and positive news from bellwether NextEra Energy. These factors, along with a notable improvement in forward power prices since February, resulted in a strong rally in the NAV in the half-year's final month, March. Over the six months to 31 March, the NAV increased by 9.0%.

Performance summary

Returns were strong and ahead of local sector indices in the US and European parts of the portfolio, and overall performance benefitted from last year's exercise to increase the US allocation in view of depressed utility valuations. The lion's share of the NAV advance during the half-year was attributable to large US utilities NextEra Energy, American Electric Power, Constellation Energy, Edison International and Vistra, together over 22% of the portfolio. Non-OECD holdings in Australia and Hong Kong-listed Chinese names, notably Xinyi Energy, continued to be weak.

By sub-sector, the brightest spots were nuclear power producers (net cashflow positive nuclear specialists Constellation and Vistra), transportation infrastructure (ENAV, Ferrovial, Vinci), and network infrastructure owner/operators with a growth acceleration underway (E.ON, National Grid, American Electric Power, Public Service Enterprise Group). Although it didn't perform as well during the half-year, we include SSE in this high growth power transmission group where networks comprise a large proportion of cash flow and capital investment. Some European power generators and integrated utilities lagged, principally RWE. RWE cautioned in January that lower commodity prices could impact 2024 earnings, causing weakness in the European utility sector more widely, even though many integrated utilities - EDP, Enel, Iberdrola - would benefit near term as buyers of power.

Constellation (pure nuclear) and Vistra (nuclear and other baseload power) performed remarkably well - Vistra +99% since its addition to the portfolio in November and Constellation +70% over the six months to 31 March - capturing investors' interest as direct plays on power demand growth from GenAI and datacentres. Nuclear power offers 24/7 year-round decarbonised electricity, the Production Tax Credit in the IRA provides a floor tariff for nuclear electricity, and these two companies' results were starting to beat earnings forecasts.

NextEra Energy delivered two strong earnings reports during the period to which the shares barely reacted. It took until the company's analysts' day in March, devoted to renewables development expertise and competitive advantages, for the shares to gather positive momentum. The shelving of a federal investigation into a complaint alleging the company's Florida utility had violated political campaign fundraising laws also lifted an overhang for the shares.

Purchases & sales

Along with Vistra, Snam, a regulated natural gas transportation and storage infrastructure company in Europe, was added to the portfolio and the positions in E.ON, Edison International, Vinci and Veolia were increased significantly. These purchases further increased the portfolio's exposure to energy transmission and distribution (regulated growth), baseload nuclear power provision (unregulated growth) and transportation and environmental services (inflation-linked growth). Power price exposure was lowered via partial sales of Drax, AES, EDP and Iberdrola. Endesa and APA Group were exited. In the sector allocation table, E.ON was reclassified as regulated (from integrated).

Income and gearing

Income from investments continues to grow. Compared with last year, dividend receipts increased by 10.8% and the revenue return per share increased by 11.4%.

Gearing averaged 11% during the half-year. Borrowings, which had been significantly reduced by December 2023, were built back up by the end of March, not least because the positive spread between dividend yields and the cost of borrowings had been reestablished.

Outlook

The upswing in portfolio performance that began in March has persisted. We expect that valuation multiples in EGL's listed infrastructure sectors, which remain near historic lows relative to broad market averages, will continue to expand. There are plenty of compelling investment opportunities with the earnings momentum we're seeing and dividends yields in the region of 3-8%. Utilities in the portfolio will continue to grow their earnings, almost irrespective of the economic backdrop due to the proportions of revenues which are fully contracted or regulated. The adoption of artificial intelligence and datacentres are supporting our expectation for power demand growth in the US and, moreover, datacentre owners are showing a willingness to pay a premium for reliable and clean electricity, recognising that electricity is not plentiful and that uninterrupted clean energy is not a commodity. The growth the sector should experience globally will also reflect the quantum increase in investments in electricity networks we are seeing. A pronounced acceleration in capex growth by power grid operators is underway, motivated by the ever increasing installed base of renewables capacity for which new transmission and distribution connections are required, the electrification of economies and the associated need for grid upgrades. Investment need and allowed returns for these regulated activities are usually highly correlated.

Beyond power utilities, we continue to like the opportunities amongst companies operating and investing to upgrade environmental services and transportation infrastructure. These parts of the portfolio contribute growth, a degree of cyclicality, inflation protection (airports and toll roads, for example, have long term pricing power in relation to inflation) and provide diversification. Very large sums have been raised by private equity since December 2023 to devote to infrastructure investment globally, adding to already record levels of available cash. In view of the significant gap in valuations between listed and private infrastructure, merger and acquisition activity is returning to this strategy's sectors and should provide support for a re-rating of the growth opportunity.

The total column of the Condensed Statement of Comprehensive Income is the profit and loss account of the Company.

The revenue and capital columns are supplementary to this and are published under guidance from the AIC.

All revenue and capital returns in the above statement derive from continuing operations. No operations were acquired or discontinued during the six months ended 31 March 2024.

The Company has no other comprehensive income and therefore the net return on ordinary activities after taxation is also the total comprehensive income for the period.

1. The special reserve may be used, where the board considers it appropriate, by the Company for the purposes of paying dividends to

shareholders and, in particular, smoothing payments of dividends to shareholders.

The Condensed Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard (""FRS"") 104 Interim Financial Reporting and with the Statement of Recommended Practice 'Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies and Venture Capital Trusts' issued in July 2022. The Condensed Financial Statements are prepared in Sterling which is the functional currency of the Company and rounded to the nearest £'000. They have also been prepared on a going concern basis and approval as an investment trust has been granted by HMRC.

The Condensed Financial Statements have been prepared using the same accounting policies as the preceding Financial Statements which were prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 102.

The financial information contained in this Interim Report does not constitute statutory accounts as defined in Sections 434-436 of the Companies Act 2006. The financial information for the periods ended 31 March 2024 and 31 March 2023 has not been audited.

The information for the year ended 30 September 2023 has been extracted from the latest published audited Financial Statements which have been filed with the Registrar of Companies. The report of the Auditor on those accounts contained no qualification or statement under Section 498 of the Companies Act 2006.

Income from investments, including taxes deducted at source, is included in revenue by reference to the date on which the investment is quoted ex-dividend. Special dividends are credited to capital or revenue, according to the circumstances. The fixed returns on debt securities are recognised on a time apportionment basis so as to reflect the effective yield on the debt securities. Interest receivable from cash and short-term deposits is treated on an accruals basis.

All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis. Expenses are charged to the revenue account except where they directly relate to the acquisition or disposal of an investment, in which case they are charged to the capital account; in addition, expenses are charged to the capital account where a connection with the maintenance or enhancement of the value of the investments can be demonstrated. In this respect, since 1 October 2022 the management fee and overdraft interest have been allocated 60% to the capital account and 40% to the revenue account (previously 50% to the capital account and 50% to the revenue account).

The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year to date and takes into account, if applicable, taxation deferred because of timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes. Deferred taxation is provided using the liability method on all timing differences, calculated at the rate at which it is anticipated the timing differences will reverse. Deferred tax assets are recognised only when, on the basis of available evidence, it is more likely than not that there will be taxable profits in future against which the deferred tax asset can be offset.

Due to the Company's status as an investment trust company and the intention to continue meeting the conditions required to obtain approval in the foreseeable future, the Company has not provided deferred tax on any capital gains and losses arising on the revaluation or disposal of investments.

The tax effect of different items of income/gain and expenditure/loss is allocated between capital and revenue within the Condensed Statement of Comprehensive Income on the same basis as the particular item to which it relates using the Company's effective rate of tax for the year, based on the marginal basis.

For the purposes of preparing the Condensed Financial Statements, the Company has applied Sections 11 and 12 of FRS 102 in respect of financial instruments. All investments are measured initially and subsequently at fair value and transaction costs are expensed immediately. Investment transactions are accounted for on a trade date basis. The fair value of the financial instruments in the Condensed Statement of Financial Position is based on their quoted bid price at the reporting date, without deduction of the estimated future selling costs. Changes in the fair value of investments held at fair value through profit or loss and gains and losses on disposal are recognised in the Condensed Statement of Comprehensive Income as ""Gains on investments held at fair value through profit or loss"". Also included within this caption are transaction costs in relation to the purchase or sale of investments, including the difference between the purchase price of an investment and its bid price at the date of purchase.

Cash comprises cash in hand and demand deposits. Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and that are subject to insignificant risk of change in value.

Short-term borrowings, which comprise of prime brokerage borrowings, are recognised initially at the fair value of the consideration received, net of any issue expenses, and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The finance costs, being the difference between the net proceeds of borrowings and the total amount of payments required to be made in respect of those borrowings, accrue evenly over the life of the borrowings and are allocated 40% to revenue and 60% to capital.

The directors are of the opinion that the Company is engaged in a single segment of business activity, being investment business.

Consequently, no business segmental analysis is provided.

The balance classified as share premium includes the premium above nominal value received by the Company on issuing shares net

The special reserve arose following court approval in November 2016 to transfer £123,609,000 from the share premium account. This reserve is distributable and may be used, where the board considers it appropriate, by the Company for the purposes of paying dividends to shareholders and, in particular, augmenting or smoothing payments of dividends to shareholders. There is no guarantee that the board will in fact make use of this reserve for the purpose of the payment of dividends to shareholders. The special reserve can also be used to fund the cost of share buy-backs.

Gains and losses on disposal of investments and changes in fair values of investments are transferred to the capital account. Foreign exchange differences of a capital nature are also transferred to the capital account. The capital element of the management fee and relevant finance costs are charged to this account. Any associated tax relief is also credited to this account.

This reserve reflects all income and costs which are recognised in the revenue column of the Statement of Comprehensive Income.

The Company's special reserve, capital reserve and revenue reserve may be distributed by way of dividend.

Monetary assets and liabilities and non-monetary assets held at fair value in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the Condensed Statement of Financial Position date. Transactions involving foreign currencies are converted at the rate ruling on the date of the transaction. Gains and losses on the translation of foreign currencies are recognised in the revenue or capital account of the Condensed Statement of Comprehensive Income depending on the nature of the underlying item.

Dividends are recognised in the period in which they are paid.

During the six months ended 31 March 2024, the Company received no special dividends (31 March 2023: £nil and 30 September 2023: £83,000).

During the period the Company suffered withholding tax on overseas dividend income of £602,000 (31 March 2023: £392,000).

At 31 March 2024 there were 114,920,697 ordinary shares of 1p each in issue of which 770,179 were held in treasury (with no voting rights) (31 March 2023: 101,363,423 of which nil were held in treasury; 30 September 2023: 115,495,663 of which nil were held in treasury). During the half-year ended 31 March 2024, 544,966 shares were bought back for cancellation and 770,179 were bought back to treasury at a total cost of £2,083,000 (31 March 2023: 2,411,000 shares were issued for net proceeds of £5,153,000 and 30 September 2023: 4,581,577 shares were issued for net proceeds of £9,793,000 and 1,054,337 shares were bought back for cancellation for a net payment of £1,819,000).

Since 31 March 2024 the Company has bought back 3,298,488 ordinary shares to treasury for a net cost of £5,713,246.

The capital reserve reflected in the Condensed Statement of Financial Position at 31 March 2024 includes gains of £16,226,000 (31 March 2023: gains of £37,832,000 and 30 September 2023: losses of £1,225,000) which relate to the revaluation of investments held at the reporting date.

A second interim dividend for 2024 of 2.05p will be paid on 31 May 2024 to shareholders on the register on 3 May 2024. The ex-dividend date was 2 May 2024.

During the period expenses were incurred in acquiring or disposing of investments classified as fair value through profit or loss. These have been expensed through capital and are included within gains on investments in the Condensed Statement of Comprehensive Income. The total costs were as follows:

The above transaction costs are calculated in line with AIC's Statement of Recommended Practice (SORP). The transaction costs in the Company's Key Information Document are calculated on a different basis and in line with the EU's Packaged Retail Investment and Insurance-based Products (PRIIPs) regulations.

FRS 102 requires an entity to classify fair value measurements using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements. The fair value hierarchy shall have the following levels:

Level 1: unadjusted quoted prices in an active market for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date;

Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable (i.e. developed using market data) for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and

Level 3: inputs are unobservable (i.e. for which market data is unavailable) for the asset or liability.

The financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value in the Condensed Statement of Financial Position are grouped into the fair value hierarchy at the reporting date as follows:

The fair value of the Company's investments in equities and preference shares has been determined by reference to their quoted bid prices at the reporting date. Equities and preference shares included in Fair Value Level 1 are actively traded on recognised stock exchanges. Investments categorised as Level 2 are not considered to trade in active markets.

11. Related party transactions and transactions with the Investment Manager

Fees payable to the directors and their interests in shares of the Company are considered to be related party transactions and are disclosed within the Directors' Remuneration Report on pages 30 to 31 of the 2023 annual report. The balance of fees due to directors at the period end was £nil (31 March 2023: £nil and 30 September 2023: £nil).

The Company has an agreement with Ecofin Advisors Limited for the provision of investment management services.

The investment management fee is calculated at 1.00% per annum of the Company's NAV on the first £200 million and 0.75% per annum of NAV thereafter, payable quarterly in arrears. The management fee was chargeable 50% to revenue and 50% to capital until 30 September 2022. With effect from 1 October 2022 the management fee is chargeable 40% to revenue and 60% to capital.

During the period £1,088,000 (31 March 2023: £1,164,000 and 30 September 2023: £2,259,000) of investment management fees were earned by the Manager, with a balance of £545,000 (31 March 2023: £580,000 and 30 September 2023: £523,000) being payable to Ecofin Advisors Limited at the period end.

A statement reconciling the movement in net funds to the net cash flow has not been presented as there are no differences from the above analysis.

The principal and emerging risks and uncertainties that could have a material impact on the Company's performance have not changed from those set out on pages 15 to 18 of the Company's Annual Report for the year ended 30 September 2023.

The directors consider that the Chairman's Statement and the Investment Manager's Report set out herein, the above disclosure on related party transactions and the Directors' Responsibility Statement below, together constitute the Interim Management Report of the Company for the six months ended 31 March 2024 and satisfy the requirements of Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules 4.2.3 to 4.2.11 of the Financial Conduct Authority.

The Interim Report has not been reviewed or audited by the Company's Auditor.

The directors listed in the Interim Report confirm that to the best of their knowledge:

(i) the condensed set of Financial Statements has been prepared in accordance with FRS 104 (Interim Financial Reporting) and give

a true and fair review of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit and loss of the Company as required by Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rule 4.2.4 R;

Ocean Infinity will survey the subsea terrain at each of the proposed wind turbine foundation sites for DBS West offshore wind farm.

Colin McAllister, development project manager, DBS offshore wind farms, explained: ""These geophysical surveys will deliver detailed data about conditions on and under the surface of the seabed. Combining this with geotechnical data we are also collecting from the turbine foundation sites will deliver exceptional levels of detail about the subsea conditions which is invaluable. It enables us to identify challenges at the development stage and to put in place appropriate mitigations where required.""

Commercial director at Ocean Infinity, Maxime Even, added: ""This is Ocean Infinity's first 3D ultra high-resolution seismic survey project awarded by RWE, which we are very excited about. Our mission has always been to enable the planet to thrive, and this project is another step in helping us on that journey. We are being given the opportunity to continue our support in the growing offshore renewables sector, contributing to the overall global energy transition. This has always been our goal and is a huge win for us.""

Surveys at the turbine foundation sites will be undertaken by the vessel Deep Helder from early June 2024 and will continue for about 30 days, depending on weather conditions.

Ocean Infinity uses high-definition survey techniques to scan the seafloor and the sub-sea bottom, to provide high-resolution 3D geological data deep below each proposed wind turbine site. This data-intense investigation can highlight seafloor changes, map extent, orientation and tilt of sedimentary units as well as boulders, throughout the entire wind turbine foundation.

DBS comprises two separate sites, DBS East and DBS West located on Dogger Bank, a shallow area of the North Sea over 100km off the North East coast of England. Both DBS project developments are being led by RWE who will deliver project development, construction, and operations on behalf of the partners RWE and Masdar.

The projects will make an important economic contribution to the region, a major contribution to the delivery of net zero in the UK, and the UK's broader economic growth and energy security. Based on an estimated capacity of 3 gigawatts (GW), once fully operational, the DBS projects could be capable of generating enough electricity to meet the average annual domestic energy needs of around three million typical UK homes.",hydro-international.com,news,Hydro International,,0.3098039215686275,454236237,13,https://www.hydro-international.com/cache/d/6/2/b/c/d62bcf8b85674dfc89c9b1cc3c8762026175dd79.jpeg,eng-9588779

(MTPA) Stands with the ALS Community","JERSEY CITY, N.J., May 23, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma America, Inc. (MTPA) is aware of recent external challenges facing the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) treatment landscape. We know firsthand the great need for ALS treatments and when there is a setback for one of us, the entire community is affected.

We want to reiterate that we remain focused on our mission to support the broader community through research, treatments, advocacy and patient resources.

We are dedicated to advancing our understanding of ALS through ongoing research, including continuing to evaluate the full potential of FDA-approved RADICAVA ORS® (edaravone) and intravenous (IV) RADICAVA® (edaravone). The U.S. approval of RADICAVA IV was based on Study 19 (MCI186-19), a randomized placebo-controlled Phase 3 study which was conducted prospectively in 137 people who met criteria identified from an exploratory analysis of the Phase 3 MCI186-16 study. In Study 19, on average, patients on RADICAVA® lost 2.49 fewer points on the ALSFRS-R vs those in the placebo arm (p=0.0013).1

RADICAVA ORS® offers the same drug as RADICAVA IV® in a different formulation.1,2 RADICAVA IV and RADICAVA ORS help slow the loss of physical function in patients with ALS by 33 percent vs. placebo, measured over 24-weeks by the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R).1,2 The safety profile of RADICAVA IV was demonstrated in pooled placebo-controlled trials in which 184 patients with ALS were administered RADICAVA IV (60 mg) in 24-week treatment cycles.1 The safety profile of RADICAVA ORS was demonstrated in a 6-month, Phase 3, open-label clinical trial in 185 patients.1 In addition to contusion, gait disturbance, and headache reported with RADICAVA, fatigue was observed in 7.6% (14/185) of patients receiving RADICAVA ORS®.1 Please see Important Safety Information below and Full Prescribing Information here.

Over the past years, we have conducted real-world evidence (RWE) studies* to evaluate RADICAVA IV-treated ALS patients with non-RADICAVA patients.1 We are also gathering data on related factors, including healthcare resource utilization and patient outcomes. We believe the data gathered from RWE underscores our commitment to transparency and evidence-based practices.

To date, in the U.S., RADICAVA IV and RADICAVA ORS have been used to treat over 14,600 people with ALS, with over 1.8-million days of therapy, and have been prescribed by more than 2,300 HCPs.4-6 RADICAVA ORS and RADICAVA IV have been supported by a robust set of data from multiple MTPA-sponsored clinical trials, post-hoc analysis and RWE studies evaluating the efficacy and safety. These results have been published in over 40 peer-reviewed articles.

Representatives from Equinor, Centrica and SSE Thermal revealed the plans in the Houses of Parliament to an audience of MPs, civil servants, industry bodies and other stakeholders.

The project, named H2H Easington, includes proposals to develop a multi-stage green and blue hydrogen production facility, which will grow over time as the hydrogen economy does. Additionally, proposals for a green hydrogen electrolyser have been submitted to the government as part of the second Hydrogen Allocation Round process.

The partnership will also explore the possibility of a dedicated pipeline linking H2H Easington to Equinor's proposed H2H Saltend hydrogen production facility, as well as Equinor and SSE Thermal's proposed hydrogen storage facility in East Yorkshire. These projects together form the Humber Hydrogen Hub.

Graham Stuart MP, member of parliament for Beverley and Holderness said: ""This is an exciting collection of projects which can help to deliver on the UK's net zero goals and hydrogen targets whilst also supporting the Government's levelling up agenda. I'm particularly proud to have such key strategic energy sites within my constituency that are attracting investment from large companies, creating new jobs for local people and supply chain opportunities for local businesses. It shows that East Yorkshire is an internationally renowned location for low carbon technologies, and this can only help to boost prosperity across the region.""

Dan Sadler, director for hydrogen at Equinor's UK Low Carbon Solutions, said: ""The proposals we've set out today demonstrate the commitment to the decarbonisation of the Humber by three of the largest players in UK energy, each with a track record of delivering ambitious schemes that reflect the changing demands of our economy.

""This is a unique opportunity to link these key sites in the Humber, pairing hydrogen production with users and storage sites to create the foundational requirements for an expanding hydrogen economy throughout the 2030s and 40s. It will help to reduce emissions whilst also stimulating economic growth.""

This is far from the first major hydrogen project in development in the UK. GreenPower was recently granted planning permission to develop its Argyll Hydrogen Hub on the west coast of Scotland, a project set to support the decarbonisation of the local Glenshellach Industrial Estate.

Meanwhile, RWE has been developing plans for a green hydrogen facility in Pembroke, Wales, that will produce around two tonnes of hydrogen per hour. In England, a hydrogen electrolyser facility was recently granted planning consent in Bradford.

However, concerns about the infrastructure required to transport hydrogen economically have been raised. Speaking at Solar Media's Green Hydrogen Summit EU 2024, Alejandra Pérez-Plá, regional manager - Mediterranean at financial advisory firm Global Capital Finance, declared the issue ""a chicken and egg problem"", noting that while the facilities to produce green hydrogen are strong, there is a lack of economically viable infrastructure to transport it.",current-news.co.uk,news,Current,Kit Million Ross,0.2313725490196079,454161468,1,https://www.current-news.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Screenshot-2024-05-23-120451.jpg,eng-9593160

WILMINGTON, Del.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--AstraZeneca and Alexion (NASDAQ:ALXN), AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) Rare Disease, will showcase 14 studies, including real-world evidence (RWE), from their portfolio and pipeline of investigational amyloidosis therapies at the International Symposium on Amyloidosis (ISA), in Rochester, MN from May 26""30, 2024.

Presentations will include a new subgroup analyses of the Phase 3 NEURO-TTRansform study of WAINUA™ (eplontersen), which was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in December 2023 for the treatment of the polyneuropathy of hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis in adults, commonly referred to as hATTR-PN or ATTRv-PN.1 Additionally, clinical data will be presented on ALXN2220 and anselamimab, which are being evaluated in Phase III clinical trials for ATTR and light chain (AL) amyloidosis, respectively.

Sarah Walters, Vice President, US Cardiovascular, Renal & Metabolic Diseases, AstraZeneca, said: AstraZeneca is dedicated to advancing the science and improving the lives of patients that are impacted by this devastating disease. Our data at the 2024 International Symposium on Amyloidosis demonstrate the leadership commitment AstraZeneca, Alexion and our partners Ionis and Neuroimmune have to develop best in class treatment options to serve a broad range of amyloidosis patients.

Christophe Hotermans, Senior Vice President, Head of Global Medical Affairs, Alexion, said: With the largest and fastest-growing pipeline of investigational amyloidosis therapies, we are working to advance multiple modalities with the potential to halt, reduce or reverse organ damage. Key presentations at the ISA Annual Meeting include live-cell imaging and Phase I clinical data evaluating the ability of ALXN2220 to remove amyloid from cardiac tissue, to support its further study as a potential treatment for advanced ATTR cardiomyopathy. Additionally, findings on epidemiology and patient renal outcomes will reinforce the urgency for differentiated amyloidosis diagnosis and additional treatment options in AL amyloidosis.

Robust evidence program increases understanding of amyloidosis patient characteristics and treatment effectiveness.

In addition to sub-analyses of the NEURO-TTRansform data, AstraZeneca will present US patient characteristics data, preliminary data from the OverTTuRe study measuring prevalence and characteristics of phenotypes in patients with ATTR amyloidosis in the United States and Japan; as well as the MaesTTRo study design, part of a global, multi-study, real-world evidence program designed to fill the evidence gaps of the effectiveness of treatments for ATTR.

WAINUA is currently being evaluated in the Phase 3 CARDIO-TTRansform study for adults with cardiomyopathy of transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (ATTR-CM), a systemic, progressive and fatal condition that typically leads to progressive heart failure and often death within three-to-five years from disease onset.2-5 The CARDIO-TTRansform Phase 3 study is fully enrolled with more than 1,400 patients""making it the largest study in this patient population to date.6

As part of a global development and commercialization agreement, AstraZeneca and Ionis are commercializing WAINUA for the treatment of hATTR-PN in the US and are seeking regulatory approval in Europe and other parts of the world.6

Novel investigational amyloid depleter assets demonstrate potential to improve outcomes for amyloidosis patients

High-resolution live-cell imaging will offer new insight into the underlying cellular mechanism of antibody-mediated amyloid removal with ALXN2220. Results will show the addition of ALXN2220 to ATTR patient-derived cardiac tissue triggered phagocytosis, including recruitment of macrophages to amyloid deposits, detachment, internalization and degradation of ATTR amyloid.

An encore poster presentation will report results from the first-in-human study of ALXN2220. Initial treatment with ALXN2220 was well tolerated with a transient increase in C-reactive proteins, suggesting initial targeted immune activation and recruitment of phagocytic immune cells. Additionally, an encore poster presentation will describe the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) model used for the selection of the dose range, dose escalation, dosing interval and study duration.

Further, a poster will outline the baseline demographics and characteristics of the 406 participants of the Alexion CARES clinical program evaluating anselamimab in patients with Mayo Stage IIIa and IIIb AL amyloidosis, which includes the largest prospective AL amyloidosis study to date in advanced stage AL amyloidosis.

Advancing understanding of the amyloidosis landscape

A retrospective chart analysis from the US EMR TriNetX database will report outcomes in AL amyloidosis patients with renal involvement receiving bortezomib or daratumumab. Only half of patients were renal-responders and few achieved renal complete response (renCR, proteinuria ‰¤200 mg/day), underscoring the unmet medical need for this patient subset.

Retrospective analyses will also be presented across three posters on the incidence and prevalence of AL and ATTR amyloidosis, reinforcing the importance of timely diagnosis of amyloidosis and continued monitoring.

AstraZeneca and Alexion, AstraZeneca Rare Disease, will showcase 14 studies, including real-world evidence (RWE), from their portfolio and pipeline of investigational amyloidosis therapies at the International Symposium on Amyloidosis (ISA), in Rochester, MN from May 26-30, 2024.

Presentations will include a new subgroup analyses of the Phase 3 NEURO-TTRansform study of WAINUA(eplontersen), which was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in December 2023 for the treatment of the polyneuropathy of hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis in adults, commonly referred to as hATTR-PN or ATTRv-PN. Additionally, clinical data will be presented on ALXN2220 and anselamimab, which are being evaluated in Phase III clinical trials for ATTR and light chain (AL) amyloidosis, respectively.

Sarah Walters, Vice President, US Cardiovascular, Renal & Metabolic Diseases, AstraZeneca, said: ""AstraZeneca is dedicated to advancing the science and improving the lives of patients that are impacted by this devastating disease. Our data at the 2024 International Symposium on Amyloidosis demonstrate the leadership commitment AstraZeneca, Alexion and our partners Ionis and Neuroimmune have to develop best in class treatment options to serve a broad range of amyloidosis patients.""

Christophe Hotermans, Senior Vice President, Head of Global Medical Affairs, Alexion, said: ""With the largest and fastest-growing pipeline of investigational amyloidosis therapies, we are working to advance multiple modalities with the potential to halt, reduce or reverse organ damage. Key presentations at the ISA Annual Meeting include live-cell imaging and Phase I clinical data evaluating the ability of ALXN2220 to remove amyloid from cardiac tissue, to support its further study as a potential treatment for advanced ATTR cardiomyopathy. Additionally, findings on epidemiology and patient renal outcomes will reinforce the urgency for differentiated amyloidosis diagnosis and additional treatment options in AL amyloidosis.""

Robust evidence program increases understanding of amyloidosis patient characteristics and treatment effectiveness.

In addition to sub-analyses of the NEURO-TTRansform data, AstraZeneca will present US patient characteristics data, preliminary data from the OverTTuRe study measuring prevalence and characteristics of phenotypes in patients with ATTR amyloidosis in the United States and Japan; as well as the MaesTTRo study design, part of a global, multi-study, real-world evidence program designed to fill the evidence gaps of the effectiveness of treatments for ATTR.

WAINUA is currently being evaluated in the Phase 3 CARDIO-TTRansform study for adults with cardiomyopathy of transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (ATTR-CM), a systemic, progressive and fatal condition that typically leads to progressive heart failure and often death within three-to-five years from disease onset. The CARDIO-TTRansform Phase 3 study is fully enrolled with more than 1,400 patients-making it the largest study in this patient population to date.

As part of a global development and commercialization agreement, AstraZeneca and Ionis are commercializing WAINUA for the treatment of hATTR-PN in the US and are seeking regulatory approval in Europe and other parts of the world.

Novel investigational amyloid depleter assets demonstrate potential to improve outcomes for amyloidosis patients

High-resolution live-cell imaging will offer new insight into the underlying cellular mechanism of antibody-mediated amyloid removal with ALXN2220. Results will show the addition of ALXN2220 to ATTR patient-derived cardiac tissue triggered phagocytosis, including recruitment of macrophages to amyloid deposits, detachment, internalization and degradation of ATTR amyloid.

An encore poster presentation will report results from the first-in-human study of ALXN2220. Initial treatment with ALXN2220 was well tolerated with a transient increase in C-reactive proteins, suggesting initial targeted immune activation and recruitment of phagocytic immune cells. Additionally, an encore poster presentation will describe the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) model used for the selection of the dose range, dose escalation, dosing interval and study duration.

Further, a poster will outline the baseline demographics and characteristics of the 406 participants of the Alexion CARES clinical program evaluating anselamimab in patients with Mayo Stage IIIa and IIIb AL amyloidosis, which includes the largest prospective AL amyloidosis study to date in advanced stage AL amyloidosis.

Advancing understanding of the amyloidosis landscape

A retrospective chart analysis from the US EMR TriNetX database will report outcomes in AL amyloidosis patients with renal involvement receiving bortezomib or daratumumab. Only half of patients were renal-responders and few achieved renal complete response (renCR, proteinuria ≤200 mg/day), underscoring the unmet medical need for this patient subset.

Retrospective analyses will also be presented across three posters on the incidence and prevalence of AL and ATTR amyloidosis, reinforcing the importance of timely diagnosis of amyloidosis and continued monitoring.

A comprehensive list of AstraZeneca key abstracts to be presented at the 2024 International Symposium on Amyloidosis includes:

WAINUA injection, for subcutaneous use, 45 mg is indicated for the treatment of the polyneuropathy of hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis in adults.

Reduced Serum Vitamin A Levels and Recommended Supplementation WAINUA leads to a decrease in serum vitamin A levels. Supplement with recommended daily allowance of vitamin A. Refer patient to an ophthalmologist if ocular symptoms suggestive of vitamin A deficiency occur.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

Most common adverse reactions (≥9% in WAINUA-treated patients) were vitamin A decreased (15%) and vomiting (9%).

NEURO-TTRansform is a global, open-label, randomized trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of eplontersen in patients with hATTR-PN.The trial enrolled adult patients with hATTR-PN Stage 1 or Stage 2 compared to the external placebo group from the NEURO-TTR registrational trial that Ionis completed in 2017.The comparison of efficacy and safety for WAINUA versus external placebo was based on data up to week 66, and all patients were followed on treatment until week 85, when they had the option to transition into an open-label extension study, which is still ongoing.

WAINUA

WAINUA (eplontersen) is a ligand-conjugated antisense oligonucleotide (LICA) medicine designed to reduce the production of transthyretin, or TTR protein. WAINUA has been approved in the US for the treatment of the polyneuropathy of hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis in adults (also referred to as hATTR-PN).

AstraZeneca in amyloidosis

Amyloidosis is a group of complex rare diseases caused by abnormal proteins that misfold and clump together to form toxic amyloids that deposit in tissues or organs, including the heart, kidneys and peripheral nerves. The build-up of these toxic amyloids can result in significant organ damage and organ failure that can severely impact quality of life and ultimately be fatal. AstraZeneca and its Rare Disease Unit, Alexion, are developing and evaluating multiple modalities with the potential to halt and reduce organ damage across various types of amyloidosis. The Company is uniquely positioned to lead therapeutic and diagnostic advances for people living with amyloidosis with the largest and fastest-growing pipeline of investigational amyloidosis therapies to address the spectrum of patient needs.

EEGR and NOW share a joint focus on developing world leading supply chains in offshore wind.

These two organisations share the North Sea and have different strengths that will create valuable synergies. Norwegian Offshore Wind sees U.K. as the most attractive offshore wind market in Europe and has set up a dedicated working group to get their members into the U.K. projects.

""East of England is one of the major offshore wind hubs in the largest market in Europe. With the North Sea as a common sea basin with Norway, it will certainly benefit our members to strengthen the collaboration with the industry in this region,"" said Arvid Nesse, manager of Norwegian Offshore Wind, representing close to 400 member companies.

East of England has emerged as one the main offshore wind hubs in the UK. Several of the large developers such as Scottish Power Renewables, RWE and Orsted are located in the region with large offshore wind projects such as Norfolk and East Anglia under development. Furthermore, this region is home to a strong supply chain, and Port of Great Yarmouth is the installation base for Norfolk offshore Wind zone and O&M base for Dudgeon and Sheringham shoal.

""With pooling the resources and capabilities in the two countries in areas such as early development, balance of plants, fabrication, installation and O&M that will create strong synergies and commercial opportunities,"" added Alfred Risan, who is heading up the industry-led working group for UK in Norwegian Offshore Wind.

RWE pilot study to assess how artificial structures at offshore wind farms in the Baltic Sea promote biodiversity

As a leading player in offshore wind, RWE is investigating how artificial reefs at offshore wind farms in the Baltic Sea can affect the marine ecosystem and whether they can create an attractive marine habitat, particularly for blue mussels, algae and fish species. In partnership with Linnaeus University and cable service provider Baltic Offshore Kalmar AB, RWE is conducting a pilot study in the Swedish Baltic Sea. After month of preparation, collection of water samples and seabed assessments, the study has entered its practical phase with the installation of artificial reefs at RWE's Kårehamn wind farm (48 MW, 16 turbines) 7 km off the Swedish coast. 180 carbon neutral, plastic-free reef cubes® have been deployed on the seabed to assess how marine life is settling here. The research is planned to continue until 2026. The reef cubes were designed and manufactured by ARC Marine, a leading supplier of nature inclusive solutions, who also won RWE's ""Innovation Ecology Award"" in 2022.

Sven Utermöhlen, CEO RWE Offshore Wind: ""As a global leading offshore player, we are responsible for operating wind farms in harmony with nature. To deliver green electricity, we invest billions of euros annually in wind power. We are committed to expanding our portfolio in an environmentally friendly way. With this in mind, we have set ourselves ambitious sustainability targets. This study is a significant step forward. Assessing how our activities may help to promote biodiversity will enable us to take the long-term sustainability of offshore wind farms to the next level.""

Catherine Legrand, Professor in Marine Ecology at Linnaeus University: ""Research on the ecological impact of offshore wind farms is continuously increasing, however few studies include multiple interactions between the wind farm activities and the ecosystem. The study at the Kårehamn wind farm is unique in many aspects. As a shared marine space, an offshore wind farm offers excellent potential to produce green electricity, as well as providing habitat provision for marine life with no conflict. It is both exciting and challenging to follow the biodiversity of marine life almost in real time at the wind farm site.""

Kårehamn biodiversity pilot study

The objective of the study is to assess how artificial structures at offshore wind farms can promote biodiversity and support ecosystem services, such as habitat provision, nutrient cycling and water quality, hence contributing to the restoration and preservation of the Baltic Sea.

The study started in 2023 with the collection of information for the baseline scenario. This included a survey of the underwater area including sampling from the seabed and eDNA sampling to assess the ecosystem and to identify the species in the region, such as mussels, vegetation and fish. By understanding the biodiversity, the team could predict the possible impacts of the subsequent project phases more effectively and plan accordingly.

During the installation, 180 reef cube® structures have been submerged on the seabed at Kårehamn wind farm using different sizes, which vary from 15x15 cm to 75x75 cm. The rationale for selecting this location is the previously observed development of species on the foundations of the wind turbines. The intention is to create artificial reefs for habitats and species to grow and hide in, with a special focus on macroalgae, blue mussels and various species of fish.

In the colonisation phase from 2024 to 2026 the submerged cubes and the surrounding ecosystem will be examined. This will provide valuable data and learnings for the sustainable design of future offshore wind projects.",w3.windfair.net,news,w3.windfair.net,,0.2549019607843137,454147162,26,,eng-9588779

Anavex Life Sciences (NASDAQ:AVXL), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, develops innovative treatments for neurodegenerative diseases. Its leading drug candidate, Anavex 2-73 (Blarcamesine), is advancing through different phases of clinical trials for several indications. The unique mechanism of action of Anavex 2-73 targets the Sigma-1 and muscarinic receptors in the brain, enhancing neuroprotection and cognitive function. AVXL also develops other drug candidates like Anavex 3-71 for schizophrenia and Anavex 1066 for neuropathic pain. However, I believe that its main value driver is Blarcamesine. While it leads to statistically significant results that might eventually lead to FDA approval, I think its modest efficacy will lead to a limited market impact. This, coupled with an already embedded premium relative to peers, leads me to rate AVXL as a ""hold"" for now.

Blarcamesine: Business Overview

Anavex is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company based in New York City. Founded in 2004, it focuses on researching and developing new drugs to help patients with neurological diseases. AVXL's drug candidates can potentially treat patients with Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Rett syndrome, Fragile X syndrome, Infantile Spasms, and Angelman syndrome.

AVXL is still in the clinical stage and pre-revenues. However, the company's leading drug candidate, Anavex 2-73, also known as Blarcamesine, is progressing along Phase 2b/3 of its clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease and has planned Phase 3 for Parkinson's dementia, planned studies for Preclinical, Phase 1/2 for Parkinson's, Phase 3 for Rett syndrome in adult, Phase 2 for pediatric patients of Rett syndrome with FDA's designation as Fast Track, Rare Pediatric Orphan Drug, planned Phase 2/3 for Infantile Spams, and Phase 1 for Fragile X Syndrome and Angelman Syndrome.

Blarcamesine's action mechanism targets the brain's Sigma-1 and muscarinic receptors. The Sigma-1 receptor is a protein in the neurons' endoplasmic reticulum and contributes to cellular homeostasis, which is vital for cell survival. Its activation modulates ion channel regulation, neurotransmitter release, and mitochondrial function to protect neurons from damage. On the other hand, Muscarinic are acetylcholine receptors in the central nervous system [CNS] involved in cognitive functions such as learning and memory. Blarcamesine interacts with these receptors to enhance neurotransmission and synaptic functions that maintain neuronal communication. This way, the drug acts as a neuroprotective agent and improves patient cognitive capacity, treating neurodegenerative diseases. In my view, this is AVXL's main value driver.

Nevertheless, AVXL's pipeline also has additional drug candidates, but their development is much more in the early stages compared to Blarcamesine. For instance, Anavex 3-71 (AF710B) is completing Phase 1 and has presented plans for the advancement to Phase 2/3 for Frontotemporal Dementia with the FDA's Orphan Drug Designation and also for Neurodegenerative diseases and Alzheimer's Disease. It is in Phase 2 for schizophrenia treatment. Another drug, Anavex 1066, is in preclinical studies for visceral and acute & neuropathic pain.

AVXL's Strategic Advancements in Neurological Treatments

During AVXL's latest earnings call, management touched on the FDA's new guidance that could serve as a sufficient primary endpoint for early AD. The FDA noted that the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale [ADAS-Cog] alone could be enough, which is vital because AVXL's Blarcamesine study design on AD had dual endpoints (ADAS-Cog and ADCS-ADL). Hence, this is promising because the newly issued FDA guidance makes Blarcamesine's trials precisely what the FDA looks for when evaluating a drug candidate. Accordingly, AVXL will now focus on the ADAS-Cog (a cognitive test) as the primary endpoint in clinical trials for the early stage of this condition. Moreover, this guidance also provides an additional path for the ongoing market authorization submission to the European Medicine Agency [EMA] for Blarcamesine for Alzheimer's treatment.

The following news was also announced related to this drug for Alzheimer's disease: First, the full data for Phase 2b/3 for Blarcamesine will be published in a peer-reviewed journal. Second, RNA sequencing analysis will announce interim data by mid-2024. Additionally, the ATTENTION-AD extension trial will present interim results in Q2 2024. These outcomes foster optimism in this new Alzheimer's disease treatment.

For Rett syndrome, AVXL's executives commented on the positive feedback from patients and healthcare personnel in the trials. Topline results from Phase 2/3 clinical trials showed that the patients aged 5-17 presented some improvements as measured by the Rett Syndrome Behavior Questionnaire (RSBQ). This co-primary endpoint was met, but the other (Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) scale) wasn't. However, positive real-world evidence [RWE] feedback from Rett syndrome patients under Compassionate Use Authorization supported a Phase 3 trial. So AVXL plans to do a 12-week efficacy study and a presentation at the 2024 IRSF Rett Syndrome Scientific Meeting.

Lastly, AVXL also announced a six-month trial in Phase 2b/3 in Q2, 2024 for Blarcamesine for Parkinson's disease. For Fragile X Syndrome, the biomarker data supports initiating a Phase 2/3 trial. Also, Anavex 3-71 is in the Phase 2 clinical trial for schizophrenia and has completed enrollment of the first cohort of patients. Therefore, AVXL seems to be successfully advancing its pipeline for complex neurodegenerative conditions.

Slight Premium, Modest Efficacy: Valuation Analysis

From a valuation perspective, the company trades at a relatively small market cap of $368.2 million. AVXL's balance sheet holds $139.4 million in cash and equivalents against no debt, with an equity book value of $135.0 million as of Q1, 2024. Moreover, I estimate its latest quarterly cash burn was $11.7 million, implying an annualized cash burn rate of $46.8 million. I obtained these figures by adding its most recent quarterly CFOs and Net CAPEX and annualizing them. This means that based on its current liquidity and cash burn, the company has a cash runway of about three years, which is healthy as there is ample room to maneuver as needed. Additionally, AVXL has a purchase agreement for its shares with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC of up to $150.0 million worth of the company's shares. As of Q1, 2024, AVXL still has $114.7 million left to issue, providing an additional funding source if required.

Unfortunately, neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's are notably tricky. These diseases seem akin to emergent properties of several different pathways and functions that decay over time and give rise to these conditions. This is key because companies targeting a specific cause or item highly correlated to these conditions might not be enough to generate significant cognitive improvements for patients.

Therefore, potential investors must realize that Blarcamesine is not a cure for AD, nor does it seem to reverse its symptoms in any meaningful way. Early data suggests it provides a minimal improvement compared to the placebo. For context, the ADAS-Cog13 test goes from 0-85, with higher scores corresponding to more cognitive deterioration. AVXL's trials on Blarcamesine showed that in 48 weeks, patients receiving this drug candidate had a 1.783-point difference in scores compared to the placebo. For the ADAS-Cog13 test, a 2-point increase is the ""minimal deterioration"" threshold, implying that cognitive deterioration from AD is only noticeable with every 2-point score increase. So, Blarcamesine's data shows very small cognitive improvements compared to the placebo.

Naturally, the idea is that over time, those with Blarcamesine will deteriorate considerably less because the score gap will widen over time. But after 48 weeks, the improvement barely comes close to the ""minimal deterioration"" threshold difference, so it's still far away from being a cure for AD or a revolutionary treatment, in my view. At best, Blarcamesine seems like a small improvement over the current treatment regime. This matters because AVXL's value proposition with Blarcamesine isn't remarkable if all it does is show a barely noticeable cognitive improvement after 48 weeks. So, even if approved, Blarcamesine could have a relatively unremarkable competitive edge.

Moreover, since the only applicable valuation multiple for AVXL at this juncture is its P/B ratio, the stock also seems relatively in line with the rest of its sector. AVXL's book value by Q1 2024 was $135.0 million, which translates to a P/B ratio of 2.7. For comparison, the stock's sector median P/B ratio is 2.5, so AVXL appears to have some premium embedded in it. In my view, the lack of considerable cognitive improvements with Blarcamesine on AD and the stock's already above-average valuation multiple leads me to rate it a ""hold"" at these levels.

Risks to Consider

Lastly, it's worth noting that AVXL burns about $46.8 million in cash annually. So, its book value at ceteris paribus will likely decrease considerably over time. Moreover, while it's true that Blarcamesine has completed a phase 3 trial for AD, I don't think the results are exciting for patients. Also, Blarcamesine's trials for PD have only progressed to phase 2, but they focused on measuring tolerability rather than efficacy in treating the disease. As for Blarcamesine for Rett syndrome, it seems that the improvement is noticeable for patients, and it's supported by one of AVXL's trials meeting one co-primary endpoint. However, once again, this improvement doesn't appear to be life-changing either.

My biggest concern with AVXL's IP portfolio is that it hinges on Blarcamesine's efficacy. I think it'll probably go through the FDA approval process successfully, but I doubt the data suggests it'll have a strong competitive edge. Since the sector is incredibly competitive, I don't think slight improvements over placebo are enough to carve a sizeable market share upon a tentative FDA approval. Over time, AVXL's lack of revenues could continue eroding shareholder value in my view.

Neutral: Conclusion

Overall, AVXL is an interesting company because Blarcamesine does seem to target a general mechanism that theoretically should prevent neurodegeneration. However, Blarcamesine's clinical trial data doesn't show a meaningful or revolutionary result for patients with AD or PD so far. This doesn't mean that the drug won't meet the FDA's approval standards or that it doesn't serve as a potentially viable complementary treatment. However, it suggests that Blarcamesine's competitive profile won't be meaningful even if approved because the improvements over placebo were barely noticeable. Still, the company has healthy financials and enough backing to fund its research for the foreseeable future. So, the picture may improve as trials progress. However, I think a ""hold"" rating makes sense for now. After all, AVXL already trades at a slight premium relative to peers.

PDC has a track record of successfully conducting over 150 clinical trials.

Roquefort Therapeutics has signed a term sheet to grant an exclusive worldwide license for its Midkine antibody portfolio to PDC FZ-LLC, part of the PDC group. This is a strategic out-licencing deal in which Roquefort Therapeutics receives $10M total initial consideration value and a guaranteed share of the trade sale proceeds on successful completion of Phase 1 clinical trials. PDC will develop one or more of the Midkine antibodies within a new Special Purpose Vehicle (""SPV"") to complete the Phase 1 clinical trial and then seek a trade sale of the SPV. The term sheet is non-binding, except for certain provisions including exclusivity to 31 December 2024. Completion of the transaction is subject to due diligence and the negotiation of a definitive licence agreement.

A summary of the agreed commercial terms in the term sheet are listed below:

· Initial consideration value of US$10 million, which includes non-dilutive equity in the SPV;

· Exclusive worldwide licence granted to the SPV for 20 years;

· Within 3 years, PDC to develop at least one of the Midkine antibodies within the SPV to the completion of a Phase 1 trial and then, upon success, to complete a trade sale of the SPV; and

· Roquefort Therapeutics will receive circa 24% from any successful trade sale proceeds, which if the Phase 1 trial is successful, this 24% is projected to be worth up to US$50M (gross) based on similar phase 1 trade sales.

Roquefort Therapeutics is now working with PDC to complete due diligence and has commenced the drafting of the definitive licence agreement. Further updates will be provided by the Company as this progresses and becomes binding.

Ajan Reginald, Roquefort Therapeutics CEO commented:

""We are pleased to announce this therapeutic licencing deal with an initial payment which is likely to include $1.25-2.5M upfront and a 24% share of what is substantial potential upside. PDC is a great partner with a strong track record of completing clinical trials and we are confident they will accelerate development of the Midkine antibodies into the clinic. Upon a successful Phase 1 exit, this would create significant returns to the SPV shareholders. We believe this is a good deal for all parties and it validates our business model and highlights our deal making capabilities. We expect to conclude this licensing agreement as soon as possible.

In the meantime, we remain focused on completing the other licencing deals that we are negotiating and look forward to updating the market in due course.""

""PDC is the leading clinical trial organisation in the MEA region with an excellent track record of completing clinical trials. To date we have successfully completed more than 150 clinical trials with leading Big Pharma and Biotech companies. We are encouraged by the Midkine preclinical data from Roquefort Therapeutics and are delighted to license these Midkine antibodies and are confident in our ability to successfully complete the Phase 1 trials which should lead to a trade sale with significant value upside.""

Turkey has emerged as the largest coal-fired electricity producer in Europe as major EU economies have continued to shut down coal power plants and boost renewable energy generation.

In the first four months of this year, Turkey was the top coal power producer in Europe, overtaking Germany, according to data from energy think tank Ember cited by Reuters columnist Gavin Maguire.

This development highlights the diverging paths the EU and Turkey have taken in securing electricity supply. While the EU bloc -- including top coal power producer Germany -- is looking to reduce reliance on coal as much as possible, Turkey is importing and using more coal to meet its rising electricity demand as coal has become more economically viable to burn in power plants than imported natural gas.

In 2023, Turkey overtook Poland to become Europe's second-largest coal-fired power generator, behind Germany, Ember said in its Türkiye Electricity Review 2024 in March. At the same time, Turkey's dependence on imported coal for electricity generation continued to increase, Ember's energy analyst Bahadir Gumus says.

Coal's share in Turkey's total power generation hit a record high of 36% last year, compared to a 12% share in the European Union. Turkey is dependent on coal imports from Russia -- with which Ankara has kept friendly diplomatic and trade relations after the Russian invasion of Ukraine -- and Russian coal imports held a 73% share in Turkey's electricity generation, according to Ember's data.

Unlike the EU, Turkey doesn't have a ban on imports of Russian energy products.

As coal prices fell more than natural gas prices after the 2022 spike, gas-fired power generation in Turkey fell for the second year in a row in 2023, marking its lowest generation over four years.

""Türkiye's growing reliance on fossil fuels in electricity generation pushes Türkiye further from the path of clean energy transition,"" Ember's Gumus said.

This year, Turkey generated 36 terawatt hours (TWh) of coal-fired electricity between January and April, surpassing Germany's coal power output of 34.6 TWh and Poland's 31.3 TWh, per Ember's data.

Germany, until recently Europe's top coal-fired power producer, shut down additional coal plants this spring.

At the beginning of the 2023/2024 winter, Germany's government said it was bringing back online several coal-fired units for the winter in an attempt to save natural gas and avoid power supply shortfalls.

Without Russian gas supply, the recent energy and gas crisis in Germany -- and in Europe -- has been keeping utilities and governments on edge and ready to have mothballed coal-fired power plants on stand-by in the coldest winter days to ensure the security of electricity supply.

After the end of the winter, German utility RWE shut down permanently five coal power plant units, removing 2,100 megawatts (MW) of lignite capacity permanently from the grid. RWE has already decommissioned 12 lignite-fired power plant units with a total output of 4,200 MW since the end of 2020 and is confident it would complete its coal phase-out by 2030.

In total, Germany shut down permanently 15 coal-fired power plants last month.

""Several coal-fired power plants that were still on the grid as a precautionary measure over the last two years are therefore now superfluous and can be taken off the grid for good,"" Economy Minister Robert Habeck told German agency dpa in early April, adding these were ""neither necessary nor economical.""

In 2023, lignite-powered electricity production in Germany slumped to the lowest level since 1963, while hard coal-powered plants produced the lowest electricity volumes since 1955, according to data compiled by the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE.

In Germany's neighbor to the east, Poland, the biggest state utilities are preparing for a surge in clean energy investments in 2025, hoping that the government would move ahead with a plan to spin off coal assets that have been restricting the companies' access to financial markets.

Poland's power grid operator said in March that it would spend $16 billion on upgrading and expanding its power grid to accommodate additional renewable and nuclear capacity.",oilprice.com,news,OilPrice.com,,0.4274509803921569,454114980,5,https://d32r1sh890xpii.cloudfront.net/article/718x300/2024-05-22_kuytwpjkbm.jpg,eng-9588267

In partnership with Linnaeus University and cable service provider Baltic Offshore Kalmar AB, RWE is conducting a pilot study in the Swedish Baltic Sea. After month of preparation, collection of water samples and seabed assessments, the study has entered its practical phase with the installation of artificial reefs at RWE's Kårehamn wind farm (48 MW, 16 turbines) 7 km off the Swedish coast. 180 carbon neutral, plastic-free reef cubes® have been deployed on the seabed to assess how marine life is settling here. The research is planned to continue until 2026. The reef cubes were designed and manufactured by ARC Marine, a leading supplier of nature inclusive solutions, who also won RWE's ""Innovation Ecology Award"" in 2022.

Sven Utermöhlen, CEO RWE Offshore Wind: ""As a global leading offshore player, we are responsible for operating wind farms in harmony with nature. To deliver green electricity, we invest billions of euros annually in wind power. We are committed to expanding our portfolio in an environmentally friendly way. With this in mind, we have set ourselves ambitious sustainability targets. This study is a significant step forward. Assessing how our activities may help to promote biodiversity will enable us to take the long-term sustainability of offshore wind farms to the next level.""

Catherine Legrand, Professor in Marine Ecology at Linnaeus University: ""Research on the ecological impact of offshore wind farms is continuously increasing, however few studies include multiple interactions between the wind farm activities and the ecosystem. The study at the Kårehamn wind farm is unique in many aspects. As a shared marine space, an offshore wind farm offers excellent potential to produce green electricity, as well as providing habitat provision for marine life with no conflict. It is both exciting and challenging to follow the biodiversity of marine life almost in real time at the wind farm site.""

Kårehamn biodiversity pilot study

The objective of the study is to assess how artificial structures at offshore wind farms can promote biodiversity and support ecosystem services, such as habitat provision, nutrient cycling and water quality, hence contributing to the restoration and preservation of the Baltic Sea.

The study started in 2023 with the collection of information for the baseline scenario. This included a survey of the underwater area including sampling from the seabed and eDNA sampling to assess the ecosystem and to identify the species in the region, such as mussels, vegetation and fish. By understanding the biodiversity, the team could predict the possible impacts of the subsequent project phases more effectively and plan accordingly.

During the installation, 180 reef cube® structures have been submerged on the seabed at Kårehamn wind farm using different sizes, which vary from 15×15 cm to 75×75 cm. The rationale for selecting this location is the previously observed development of species on the foundations of the wind turbines. The intention is to create artificial reefs for habitats and species to grow and hide in, with a special focus on macroalgae, blue mussels and various species of fish.

In the colonisation phase from 2024 to 2026 the submerged cubes and the surrounding ecosystem will be examined. This will provide valuable data and learnings for the sustainable design of future offshore wind projects.",evwind.es,news,AEEolica,,0.3254901960784313,454102003,18,,eng-9588779

Enthusiasm for artificial intelligence helped drive a rally across equity markets in 2023, propelling Nvidia and Dutch semiconductor equipment supplier ASML into the spotlight.

Nvidia shares are hovering close to record highs ahead of its quarterly earnings due late on Wednesday. However, some of the sheen has rubbed off Europe's AI-linked megacaps, prompting investors to seek out cheaper alternatives.

Stock pickers are now looking at companies and sectors that are likely to be long-term AI beneficiaries.

""The first phase of AI was obviously chipmakers like Nvidia. Then you've already seen the second wave move to the industrial companies which actually supply the components to the data centres,"" said Bernie Ahkong, CIO Global Multi-Strategy Alpha at UBS O'Connor.

""And now we're just starting to get the third phase into utility/power firms in the past several weeks.""

FIRING UP THE DATA CENTRES

Data centres, which are essential to the rise of generative AI, need huge amounts of energy and this is expected to surge as demand for the centres accelerates.

The International Energy Agency estimates total power consumption from data centres will top 1,000 terawatt hours (TWh) by 2026 - roughly what Japan consumes now - from 460 TWh in 2022.

""One of the most interesting ways within Europe to play AI on a multi-year basis actually is via some of these utilities companies,"" UBS O'Connor's Ahkong said.

Demand for data centre space in Europe is also set to outstrip delivery of new stock for the third straight year and AI demand will exacerbate the issue, said Kevin Restivo, who heads European data centre research at real estate services provider CBRE.

In the last five weeks, the utilities index has risen over 9%, driven largely by expectations for interest rate cuts, versus a 4.7% rise in the main STOXX 600 index. But they are still lagging the rest of the market year-to-date, up just 0.2% versus a 9% rise in the benchmark index.

Bank of America said in a recent note European utilities bosses are talking about AI, but upside potential from data centres is ""anecdotal at best"".

Even so, the bank says plenty of companies could benefit from a boom in AI-linked power demand, from Fortum, Verbund and renewables supplier EDP, to larger players like RWE, Iberdrola, Enel and Engie.

ADOPTERS VERSUS ENABLERS

A year ago, investors had been jittery around the disruptive potential of AI for anything from IT services to media, education and consulting.

""How I look at AI in the UK, the US has the enablers, we've got the adopters,"" Trevor Green, head of UK equities for Aviva Investors, said.

""When investors will get particularly interested is when we can actually quantify this in revenue potential. The providers are rightly still being a bit evasive on this as we are at such an early stage of adoption,"" he said.

He highlighted the London Stock Exchange, information and analytics group RELX and software group Sage as examples of companies that have been working on AI for years.

""Now we are properly starting to see revenue-generating opportunities from it,"" he said.

Marcel Stotzel, co-portfolio manager of Fidelity European Fund and Fidelity European Trust, says a lot of the AI hype has been around the big U.S. names behind the technology.

In the past year, shares in the likes of OpenAI backer Microsoft and Alphabet's Google have shot up 33%-41%.

Meanwhile, some European companies have been quietly using AI to develop new products that are already benefiting their customers, said Stotzel.

""This has resulted in the European-listed beneficiaries trading at more attractive valuations,"" he said, listing German software company SAP and Swiss drugmaker Roche among those his team are focused on to play the AI theme.

Miners are another area of investor interest, particularly for copper, which has hit record highs above $11,000 a metric ton this week, spurred largely by a shortage of material for prompt delivery.

Commodity trader Trafigura believes copper demand linked to data centres and AI could add up to one million tons by 2030 and exacerbate supply deficits towards the end of the decade.

""The copper boom is also part of the AI craze,"" Kathleen Brooks, research director at trading platform XTB, said.

To ensure the results are robust, monitoring was repeated at 12 other RWE solar farms without extra biodiversity measures and in undeveloped control areas involving agricultural fields and meadows. Monitoring covered insects, birds, bats and other mammals and species such as reptiles, and also flora. For this research project, RWE is working closely together with scientists from Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznan.

Anna Januszewska, Environmental Expert and Project Manager RWE Poland, said: ""The operation of photovoltaic farms in balance with nature is made possible by constant research and observation. The use of high-quality data is crucial to our sustainability ambitions, as well as to our business. These activities are aimed at making RWE a leader in sustainable development in Poland and beyond.""

The results from the initial measurements indicate that solar farms offer a pleasant environment for the development of many plant and animal species. The flora in the area of photovoltaic plants is similar to that found in meadows, although the actual species in each area differ slightly. The occurrence of insect species is at a similar level to the surrounding natural areas or agricultural fields. The lack of typical agricultural treatments, such as mowing or fertilisation, provides insects with the right conditions for life and development. Research conducted by scientists also confirms that photovoltaic sites are unique refuges for insects, which find stable conditions for development and overwintering there, and when the next season begins they can colonise the surrounding agricultural land. This is also important for agricultural production. Insect predator populations reduce the incidence of pests in agricultural fields. The measurements confirm that photovoltaic installations are also extremely attractive areas for various bird species, especially during the breeding season. The study will continue during the next 12 months to gather more valid data about the positive impact of photovoltaic farms on biodiversity.

As one of the world's leading companies in the field of renewable energies, RWE is resolutely pressing ahead with its portfolio expansion in Poland. The company has an installed onshore wind capacity of over 540 MW in the country. RWE is also diversifying its Polish renewable energy portfolio by investing in photovoltaic projects. The company is currently constructing solar farms representing more than 100 MW of capacity in Poland.

RWE has installed artificial reefs at its Kårehamn wind farm, off the Swedish coast, to assess marine life settlements as part of a pilot study on biodiversity at offshore wind farms.

In partnership with Linnaeus University and cable service provider Baltic Offshore Kalmar, RWE is conducting a pilot study which has just entered practical phase with the installation of 180 carbon neutral, plastic-free reef cubes.

The reef cubes were designed and manufactured by ARC Marine, a leading supplier of nature inclusive solutions.

The cubes, which vary from 15x15 cm to 75x75 cm in size, have been installed at the 48 MW Kårehamn offshore wind farm, which features 16 turbines located 7 km off the Swedish coast.

The objective of the study is to assess how artificial structures at offshore wind farms can promote biodiversity and support ecosystem services, such as habitat provision, nutrient cycling and water quality, hence contributing to the restoration and preservation of the Baltic Sea.

The study started in 2023 with the collection of information for the baseline scenario. This included a survey of the underwater area including sampling from the seabed and eDNA sampling to assess the ecosystem and to identify the species in the region, such as mussels, vegetation and fish.

By understanding the biodiversity, the team could predict the possible impacts of the subsequent project phases more effectively and plan accordingly.

The rationale for selecting this location is the previously observed development of species on the foundations of the wind turbines. The intention is to create artificial reefs for habitats and species to grow and hide in, with a special focus on macroalgae, blue mussels and various species of fish.

In the colonisation phase from 2024 to 2026 the submerged cubes and the surrounding ecosystem will be examined. This will provide valuable data and learnings for the sustainable design of future offshore wind projects.

""As a global leading offshore player, we are responsible for operating wind farms in harmony with nature. To deliver green electricity, we invest billions of euros annually in wind power. We are committed to expanding our portfolio in an environmentally friendly way. With this in mind, we have set ourselves ambitious sustainability targets.

The wind farm is located 195km from the UK's nearest coastal point. It will have a single offshore converter platform, with the electricity generated transported to landfall 220km away in Redcar, Teesside.

Following the installation of subsea cable infrastructure in 2023, the project has moved forward with the installation of the first of 100 foundations over a 593km² area.

Dutch offshore construction company Van Oord is executing the installation using the vessel Aeolus, which is expected to install three foundation monopiles per cycle.

This phase of the project can be influenced by sea conditions and is expected to be completed by spring 2025.

Manufactured by EEW in Rostock, Germany, each of the foundation monopiles is 92m tall with a diameter of 8.8m and weighs up to 1,530t.

100 Siemens Gamesa 14MW offshore wind turbines will be used, with completion targeted for the end of 2026.

Each turbine will be 252m tall and will feature a 108m blade made of carbon and fibreglass with a rotor diameter of 222m. The turbines will cover an area of 39,000m².

The Sofia offshore wind farm will generate sufficient electricity to power 1.2 million UK homes.

RWE offshore wind CEO Sven Utermöhlen stated: ""Sofia is RWE's largest offshore wind construction project to date, and its furthest from shore. Installing the first monopile is a highly symbolic moment in the construction of every offshore wind farm. After 14 years of planning and preparation, this is a great achievement for the entire RWE team.

""I'd like to thank everyone involved for their contribution. Building a project of this size and scale is a great opportunity to demonstrate our expertise in delivering offshore wind energy around the globe.""

The operations and maintenance for the wind farm will be conducted from RWE's new Grimsby Hub, which also supports the company's Triton Knoll offshore wind farm and future projects.

However, some of the sheen has rubbed off Europe's AI-linked megacaps, prompting investors to seek out cheaper alternatives.

Stock pickers are now looking at companies and sectors that are likely to be long-term AI beneficiaries.

""The first phase of AI was obviously chipmakers like Nvidia. Then you've already seen the second wave move to the industrial companies which actually supply the components to the data centres,"" said Bernie Ahkong, CIO Global Multi-Strategy Alpha at UBS O'Connor.

""And now we're just starting to get the third phase into utility/power firms in the past several weeks.""

Data centres, which are essential to the rise of generative AI, need huge amounts of energy and this is expected to surge as demand for the centres accelerates.

The International Energy Agency estimates total power consumption from data centres will top 1,000 terawatt hours (TWh) by 2026 - roughly what Japan consumes now - from 460 TWh in 2022.

""One of the most interesting ways within Europe to play AI on a multi-year basis actually is via some of these utilities companies,"" UBS O'Connor's Ahkong said.

Demand for data centre space in Europe is also set to outstrip delivery of new stock for the third straight year and AI demand will exacerbate the issue, said Kevin Restivo, who heads European data centre research at real estate services provider CBRE.

In the last five weeks, the utilities index has risen over 9%, driven largely by expectations for interest rate cuts, versus a 4.7% rise in the main STOXX 600 index. But they are still lagging the rest of the market year-to-date, up just 0.2% versus a 9% rise in the benchmark index.

Bank of America said in a recent note European utilities bosses are talking about AI, but upside potential from data centres is ""anecdotal at best"".

Even so, the bank says plenty of companies could benefit from a boom in AI-linked power demand, from Fortum, Verbund and renewables supplier EDP, to larger players like RWE, Iberdrola, Enel and Engie.

A year ago, investors had been jittery around the disruptive potential of AI for anything from IT services to media, education and consulting.

""How I look at AI in the UK, the US has the enablers, we've got the adopters,"" Trevor Green, head of UK equities for Aviva Investors, said.

""When investors will get particularly interested is when we can actually quantify this in revenue potential. The providers are rightly still being a bit evasive on this as we are at such an early stage of adoption,"" he said.

He highlighted the London Stock Exchange, information and analytics group RELX and software group Sage as examples of companies that have been working on AI for years.

""Now we are properly starting to see revenue-generating opportunities from it,"" he said.

Marcel Stotzel, co-portfolio manager of Fidelity European Fund and Fidelity European Trust, says a lot of the AI hype has been around the big U.S. names behind the technology.

In the past year, shares in the likes of OpenAI backer Microsoft and Alphabet's Google have shot up 33%-41%.

Meanwhile, some European companies have been quietly using AI to develop new products that are already benefiting their customers, said Stotzel.

""This has resulted in the European-listed beneficiaries trading at more attractive valuations,"" he said, listing German software company SAP and Swiss drugmaker Roche among those his team are focused on to play the AI theme.

Miners are another area of investor interest, particularly for copper, which has hit record highs above $11,000 a metric ton this week, spurred largely by a shortage of material for prompt delivery.

Commodity trader Trafigura believes copper demand linked to data centres and AI could add up to one million tons by 2030 and exacerbate supply deficits towards the end of the decade.

""The copper boom is also part of the AI craze,"" Kathleen Brooks, research director at trading platform XTB, said.

German utility company RWE has announced installation of the first offshore turbine foundation at the 1.4GW Sofia offshore wind farm in the UK North Sea.

The first monopile foundation installation was carried out by Van Oord's offshore installation vessel Aeolus. All the 100 foundations at the offshore wind project are anticipated to be in place by spring 2025.

The Sofia offshore wind farm is located on Dogger Bank, 195km from the closest point on the UK's northeast coast.

Expected to be commissioned in 2026, the facility will produce clean energy sufficient to deliver electricity to the equivalent of 1.2 million households in the UK.

The offshore wind project will have a single offshore converter platform, transmitting the generated electricity 220km to the landfall in Redcar, Teesside.

It will feature 100 Siemens Gamesa SG 14-222 DD offshore wind turbines, each with a capacity of 14MW. The turbine installation at the Sofia offshore wind farm is slated to be completed by the end of 2026.

RWE offshore wind CEO Sven Utermöhlen said: ""Installing the first monopile is a highly symbolic moment in the construction of every offshore wind farm. After 14 years of planning and preparation, this is a great achievement for the entire RWE team.

""I'd like to thank everyone involved for their contribution. Building a project of this size and scale is a great opportunity to demonstrate our expertise in delivering offshore wind energy around the globe.""

Installation of the first turbine foundation comes after the deployment of the key subsea cable infrastructure at the offshore wind project. It marks the commencement of offshore construction within the array itself.

The 1.4-GW Sofia windfarm is RWE's largest offshore windfarm to date. Following installation of the subsea cable infrastructure for the project, installation of the first foundation marks the start of offshore construction phase.

RWE chief executive offshore wind Sven Utermöhlen said, ""Sofia is RWE's largest offshore wind construction project to date, and its furthest from shore.

""Installing the first monopile is a highly symbolic moment in the construction of every offshore wind farm. After 14 years of planning and preparation, this is a great achievement for the entire RWE team.""

The Sofia windfarm is on Dogger Bank, 195 km from the nearest point on the UK's northeast coast, and will have a single offshore converter platform, with the electricity generated transported to landfall 220 km away in Redcar on Teesside.

The windfarm will use 100 Siemens Gamesa 14-MW offshore wind turbines (the company's SG 14-222 DD model), and is due to be completed by the end of 2026. A total of 44 of the project's 100 turbines will be equipped with recyclable blades.

Operation and maintenance activity for the windfarm will be located at RWE's 'Grimsby Hub,' which also supports the company's Triton Knoll windfarm.

The turbines are being installed by Van Oord, using its vessel Aeolus. The vessel and its crew will install three foundations per cycle, with a transit time of up to 16 hours. The total duration of the campaign phase will depend on sea conditions, but all 100 foundations are expected to be installed by spring 2025.

RWE said that following the installation of subsea cable infrastructure, the installation of the first foundation marks the start of offshore construction within the array itself.

The foundation was installed by contractor Van Oord's Aeolus vessel. This is the first of 100 monopile foundations that will be installed at the 593 sq km array.

Van Oord will be responsible for installing all of the foundations, under its engineering, procurement, construction and installation (EPCI) contract with RWE, which also covers array cables.

The monopiles are up to 8.8m in diameter, up to 92m in length and up to 1,530 tonnes in weight. They are being manufactured by EEW in Germany and then transported by barges to the UK's Port of Tyne, which is serving as the storage and marshalling base for the foundations.

For the Sofia offshore wind farm, extended monopile foundations are being used, which Van Oord said eliminates the need for a transition piece.

To complete the foundations, the monopiles will be equipped with secondary steel components such as main access platforms, internal platforms, boat landings and upper ladders. These secondary steel components are being manufactured by various suppliers in the Netherlands and Poland before being transported to the Port of Tyne.

Van Oord intends to deploy its Calypso cable-laying vessel and Dig-it trencher later in 2024 to install 360km of array cables.

This comes after Van Oord previously collaborated with RWE on the Rampion, Humber Gateway, Robin Rigg and London Array wind farms.

The Aeolus vessel will install three foundations per cycle, with a transit time of up to 16 hours. While the duration of this phase of the campaign will depend on sea conditions, all 100 foundations are expected to be installed by spring 2025.

RWE said that this follows the installation of the high-voltage direct current (HVDC) export cable, which started last year.

The company has talked up the significance of the latest steps taken at the Sofia wind farm site.

""Sofia is RWE's largest offshore wind construction project to date, and its furthest from shore,"" stated RWE Offshore Wind CEO Sven Utermohlen. ""Installing the first monopile is a highly symbolic moment in the construction of every offshore wind farm.""

Sofia will have a capacity of 1.4GW and will use 14MW Siemens Gamesa (SG 14-222 DD) turbines, which RWE described as the most advanced offshore wind turbine technology available. It is due to enter service by the end of 2026.

RWE also noted that of 44 of the wind farm's 100 turbines would be equipped with recyclable blades.

This comes amid broader advances to build out offshore wind capacity, both by RWE and other players.

The Sofia wind farm was originally known as the Dogger Bank Teesside B project, and received planning consent in 2015 along with three other project areas within the Dogger Bank Zone. Since then, the projects' ownership has undergone changes, with RWE taking full ownership of Dogger Bank Teesside B, which was subsequently renamed Sofia, while withdrawing from the other three projects.

The other projects collectively became the Dogger Bank Wind Farm and are now being progressed by Equinor, SSE and Vargronn. On May 14, the partners announced that the installation of monopile foundations and transition pieces for the Dogger Bank B phase of the project had begun.

This came after Seaway7 recently completed the installation of all 95 transition pieces on Dogger Bank A.

Elsewhere in the Dogger Bank area, meanwhile, RWE is also taking steps forward on its early-stage Dogger Bank South (DBS) offshore wind farm projects, which it is developing jointly with Masdar.

On May 16, RWE and Masdar announced that they had contracted data acquisition firm Ocean Infinity for 3D ultra-high resolution seismic geophysical surveys at DBS West.

Miners are another area of investor interest, particularly for copper, which has hit record highs above $11,000 a metric ton this week, spurred largely by a shortage of material for prompt delivery.

Commodity trader Trafigura believes copper demand linked to data centres and AI could add up to one million tons by 2030 and exacerbate supply deficits towards the end of the decade.

""The copper boom is also part of the AI craze,"" Kathleen Brooks, research director at trading platform XTB, said.

LONDON, May 22 (Reuters) - European stock pickers are turning to more established sectors like utilities, professional data providers and even copper miners to tap into the next wave of the AI boom, a year after AI chipmaker Nvidia's emergence as a driving force.

Enthusiasm for artificial intelligence helped drive a rally across equity markets in 2023, propelling Nvidia and Dutch semiconductor equipment supplier ASML into the spotlight.

Nvidia shares are hovering close to record highs ahead of its quarterly earnings due late on Wednesday. However, some of the sheen has rubbed off Europe's AI-linked megacaps, prompting investors to seek out cheaper alternatives.

Stock pickers are now looking at companies and sectors that are likely to be long-term AI beneficiaries.

""The first phase of AI was obviously chipmakers like Nvidia. Then you´ve already seen the second wave move to the industrial companies which actually supply the components to the data centres,"" said Bernie Ahkong, CIO Global Multi-Strategy Alpha at UBS O´Connor.

""And now we´re just starting to get the third phase into utility/power firms in the past several weeks.""

FIRING UP THE DATA CENTRES

Data centres, which are essential to the rise of generative AI, need huge amounts of energy and this is expected to surge as demand for the centres accelerates.

The International Energy Agency estimates total power consumption from data centres will top 1,000 terawatt hours (TWh) by 2026 - roughly what Japan consumes now - from 460 TWh in 2022.

""One of the most interesting ways within Europe to play AI on a multi-year basis actually is via some of these utilities companies,"" UBS O'Connor's Ahkong said.

Demand for data centre space in Europe is also set to outstrip delivery of new stock for the third straight year and AI demand will exacerbate the issue, said Kevin Restivo, who heads European data centre research at real estate services provider CBRE.

In the last five weeks, the utilities index has risen over 9%, driven largely by expectations for interest rate cuts, versus a 4.7% rise in the main STOXX 600 index. But they are still lagging the rest of the market year-to-date, up just 0.2% versus a 9% rise in the benchmark index.

Bank of America said in a recent note European utilities bosses are talking about AI, but upside potential from data centres is ""anecdotal at best"".

Even so, the bank says plenty of companies could benefit from a boom in AI-linked power demand, from Fortum, Verbund and renewables supplier EDP, to larger players like RWE, Iberdrola, Enel and Engie.

ADOPTERS VERSUS ENABLERS

A year ago, investors had been jittery around the disruptive potential of AI for anything from IT services to media, education and consulting.

In the past year, shares in the likes of OpenAI backer Microsoft and Alphabet's Google have shot up 33 per cent-41 per cent.

LONDON, May 22 (Reuters) - European stock pickers are turning to more established sectors like utilities, professional data providers and even copper miners to tap into the next wave of the AI boom, a year after AI chipmaker Nvidia's emergence as a driving force.

Enthusiasm for artificial intelligence helped drive a rally across equity markets in 2023, propelling Nvidia and Dutch semiconductor equipment supplier ASML into the spotlight.

Nvidia shares are hovering close to record highs ahead of its quarterly earnings due late on Wednesday. However, some of the sheen has rubbed off Europe's AI-linked megacaps, prompting investors to seek out cheaper alternatives.

Stock pickers are now looking at companies and sectors that are likely to be long-term AI beneficiaries.

""The first phase of AI was obviously chipmakers like Nvidia. Then you've already seen the second wave move to the industrial companies which actually supply the components to the data centres,"" said Bernie Ahkong, CIO Global Multi-Strategy Alpha at UBS O'Connor.

""And now we're just starting to get the third phase into utility/power firms in the past several weeks.""

Data centres, which are essential to the rise of generative AI, need huge amounts of energy and this is expected to surge as demand for the centres accelerates.

The International Energy Agency estimates total power consumption from data centres will top 1,000 terawatt hours (TWh) by 2026 - roughly what Japan consumes now - from 460 TWh in 2022.

""One of the most interesting ways within Europe to play AI on a multi-year basis actually is via some of these utilities companies,"" UBS O'Connor's Ahkong said.

Demand for data centre space in Europe is also set to outstrip delivery of new stock for the third straight year and AI demand will exacerbate the issue, said Kevin Restivo, who heads European data centre research at real estate services provider CBRE.

In the last five weeks, the utilities index has risen over 9%, driven largely by expectations for interest rate cuts, versus a 4.7% rise in the main STOXX 600 index. But they are still lagging the rest of the market year-to-date, up just 0.2% versus a 9% rise in the benchmark index.

Bank of America said in a recent note European utilities bosses are talking about AI, but upside potential from data centres is ""anecdotal at best"".

Even so, the bank says plenty of companies could benefit from a boom in AI-linked power demand, from Fortum, Verbund and renewables supplier EDP, to larger players like RWE, Iberdrola, Enel and Engie.

A year ago, investors had been jittery around the disruptive potential of AI for anything from IT services to media, education and consulting.

""How I look at AI in the UK, the US has the enablers, we've got the adopters,"" Trevor Green, head of UK equities for Aviva Investors, said.

""When investors will get particularly interested is when we can actually quantify this in revenue potential. The providers are rightly still being a bit evasive on this as we are at such an early stage of adoption,"" he said.

He highlighted the London Stock Exchange, information and analytics group RELX and software group Sage as examples of companies that have been working on AI for years.

""Now we are properly starting to see revenue-generating opportunities from it,"" he said.

Marcel Stotzel, co-portfolio manager of Fidelity European Fund and Fidelity European Trust, says a lot of the AI hype has been around the big U.S. names behind the technology.

The accords follow the signing of an agreement last November that reserves the engineering and production capacity to develop three major HVDC projects that will enable electricity transmission from offshore wind farms to onshore connection points.

Under the split-contract model, RWE will assign onshore construction work during the development phase of the projects.

Aibel will have EPC responsibility for the design, construction and commissioning of the offshore platforms. Hitachi Energy will provide its voltage source converter systems to allow alternating current (AC) to be converted to direct current (DC) for long-distance transmission to shore, where the electricity will be converted back to AC for the grid.

This would be an important milestone for Tata Steel UK in its path toward low-carbon transformation as it will ensure the company has one of the key infrastructure in place to operate the new EAF. Tata Steel had announced that it will decommission both blast furnaces at Port Talbot in 2024 and build a new EAF, reducing CO2 emissions by 5 million mt/year.

Tata Steel expects to place equipment orders for the EAF by September, start construction by August 2025 and produce liquid steel by end-2027. During the interim period, the company will send to the UK slabs for rerolling from its Netherlands site, a move not approved by the unions due to the possibility of 2,800 redundancies and fears that the new EAF would never happen. Unions did not reply to S&P Global Commodity Insights for a comment.

Tata Steel's Port Talbot site at Margam is served by a 275-kV substation linked to the larger 400 kV Swansea North substation. Swansea is linked to the southwest Welsh coast by four high voltage power lines to Pembroke docks, home to RWE's 2.2-GW gas-fired power station -- the region's largest by some way. Future power flows to and from Pembroke are set to increase once the 500-MW Greenlink Interconnector to Ireland is completed by end-2024.

Beyond this, the Crown Estate's Celtic Sea Offshore Wind Leasing Round 5 was launched in February for up to 4.2 GW of floating wind in a first phase off the coasts of south Wales and southwest England.

This has led to the Future Port Talbot project, transforming the port into a hub for floating wind farm manufacturing.

Tata's UK blast furnaces have an installed capacity of 5 million mt/year, but in the last few years it produced 3.2 million mt/year and is the UK's biggest single carbon polluter. The UK produced in total 5.62 million of crude steel in 2023, according to the latest data.

The blast furnace and basic oxygen furnace process releases the highest carbon emissions: 2.33 mt of CO2 emission per ton of crude steel. The direct reduced iron and electric arc furnace (DRI-EAF) process releases 1.37 mtCO2e/mt. The scrap steel and electric arc furnace (scrap-EAF) process releases the lowest carbon emissions at 0.66 mt of CO2. In Europe, 57% of steel is produced via the BF route that uses coal as a raw material and the rest from EAFs that use scrap as a raw material, so many European steelmakers are switching their production routes.

Hot-rolled coil prices in the UK fell in the week to May 16 as trading activity remained low and distributors started to offload ex-stock material at competitive rates.

Platts, part of Commodity Insights, assessed UK HRC down GBP5/mt on the day at GBP605/mt basis DDP West Midlands May 16.

With a capacity of 1.4 gigawatts (GW), Sofia is RWE's largest offshore wind farm to date. After its expected commissioning in 2026, the project will be capable of generating enough electricity to power the equivalent of 1.2 million typical UK homes.

Following the installation of the essential subsea cable infrastructure, this installation marks the start of offshore construction within the array itself. It is the first of 100 foundations to be installed at the 593km² array.

Sven Utermöhlen, CEO RWE Offshore Wind: ""Sofia is RWE's largest offshore wind construction project to date, and its furthest from shore. Installing the first monopile is a highly symbolic moment in the construction of every offshore wind farm. After 14 years of planning and preparation, this is a great achievement for the entire RWE team. I'd like to thank everyone involved for their contribution. Building a project of this size and scale is a great opportunity to demonstrate our expertise in delivering offshore wind energy around the globe.""

Sofia Offshore Wind Farm is located on Dogger Bank, 195 kilometres from the nearest point on the UK's north east coast, and will have a single offshore converter platform, with the electricity generated transported to landfall 220 kilometres away in Redcar, Teesside.

The wind farm will use 100 Siemens Gamesa 14 megawatt (MW) offshore wind turbines (SG 14-222 DD), the most advanced offshore wind turbine technology available, and is scheduled to be completed by the end of 2026. A total of 44 of the project's 100 turbines will be equipped with recyclable blades. Once completed, each 14 MW turbine will be 252 metres tall, with a 108 metre carbon and fibreglass blade and a 222 metre diameter rotor sweeping an area of 39,000 m2.

Operations and maintenance activities for the wind farm will be located at RWE's new offshore wind operations base 'Grimsby Hub', which also supports RWE's Triton Knoll Offshore Wind Farm and future projects.

Van Oord, an international marine contractor, owns and operates the vessel 'Aeolus' that carries out the work to install the foundations at the wind farm array on Dogger Bank. Following the successful construction of the Rampion, Humber Gateway, Robin Rigg and London Array wind farms, Sofia is the fifth major offshore wind project the company is delivering in collaboration with RWE.

The vessel and crew will deliver the installation of three foundations per cycle, with a transit time of up to 16 hours. The total duration of this campaign phase will depend on sea conditions, but all 100 foundations are expected to be installed by spring 2025. This follows the installation of the high voltage direct current (HVDC) export cable which started during 2023.

The work also signals a new chapter for the Port of Tyne, which has undergone a significant upgrade in order to support this work.

The UK plays a key role in RWE's strategy to grow its offshore wind portfolio

RWE is a leading partner in the delivery of the UK's Net Zero ambitions and energy security, as well as in contributing to the UK build-out target for offshore wind of 50 GW by 2030. RWE already operates 10 offshore wind farms across the UK. Including the three Norfolk offshore wind projects from Vattenfall, RWE is developing nine offshore wind projects in the UK, representing a combined potential installed capacity of around 9.8 GW, with RWE's pro rata share amounting to 7 GW. RWE's unparalleled track record of more than 20 years in offshore wind has resulted in 19 offshore wind farms in operation.

At the foot of the Sophienhöhe hill in the Hambach opencast mine, the company has now fully commissioned a further photovoltaic plant with integrated battery storage system. The new plant was installed on a gravel field near the shore of the future Hambach Lake. Until the lake is completely filled with water, around 40 years from now, the area is being put to good temporary use to produce green energy and benefit the environment.

The RWE Neuland Solar Farm has a capacity of 12 megawatts peak (8.4 MWac). Its 22,000 solar modules produce enough green electricity to supply the equivalent of more than

3,100 households.

Bifacial modules, which are photosensitive on both sides, were installed. In addition to sunlight hitting the panels directly, they can also utilise light reflected by the ground. This makes these modules extremely efficient. The battery storage system is designed for a two-hour charging and supply cycle of over eight megawatt hours, functioning as a buffer between generation and grid.

Katja Wünschel, CEO RWE Renewables Europe & Australia: ""RWE Neuland Solar Farm is already the fourth large solar project we have commissioned in the Rhenish mining area within a very short period of time, again in combination with a battery storage system. We are stepping up the pace, in particular in our home market in Germany. We plan to implement wind and solar projects with a total capacity of at least 1,000 megawatts by 2030 in North Rhine-Westphalia alone.""

Lars Kulik, CTO Lignite at RWE Power: ""This solar farm is the visible manifestation of how structural change and energy transition can succeed. Until the lake at Hambach opencast mine is completely filled with water, we have around 40 years to put the area to good temporary use to generate green electricity. In this way, even opencast mines that are still active can already contribute towards the energy transition.""

Next to the RWE Neuland Solar Farm, another photovoltaic plant is currently under construction - the RWE Neuland 1 Solar Farm. During the first construction phase, 36,700 modules with a combined capacity of 20 megawatts peak (17.6 MWac) are being installed. The second construction phase is due to be completed this summer, expanding the plant's capacity by another 15.2 megawatts peak (12 MWac). A further solar farm at Hambach opencast mine is already at the planning stage.

RWE is planning to jointly operate the solar projects at the Hambach opencast mine with Neuland Hambach GmbH. The company is coordinating the structural change around the opencast mine and is playing a key role in shaping it. The two parties recently signed an agreement to formalise their collaboration.

RWE is continuing to expand renewables in Germany at pace

RWE has more than 20 years of experience in developing, constructing and operating renewable energy plants. In its home market of Germany, the company is operating onshore wind and solar farms with a total installed capacity of around 700 megawatts - including four combined solar-storage plants in the Rhenish mining area. In addition, the company's first Agri-PV demonstration plant has been built on recultivated land, which was previously part of the Garzweiler opencast mine. In total, RWE is planning to invest around 11 billion euros net in green generation capacities in Germany over the next seven years.

RWE is looking for locations across all of Germany to further drive the expansion of renewables. Whenever a site is deemed suitable for wind turbines or solar plants, the company looks after all aspects of the planning and building process as well as the operation of the plant.",evwind.es,news,AEEolica,,0.1529411764705881,454015255,46,,eng-9586896

The 1.4-GW project is located on Dogger Bank, 195 km from the coast of north-east England.

RWE awarded Van Oord the design, engineering, procurement, construction and installation contract for the monopile foundations and array cables.

Van Oord Offshore Wind UK is managing the work from its MPI Offshore office in Stokesley, Teesside.

The company's flexible fallpipe vessels Bravenes and Nordnes placed scour protection at the locations where the monopiles will be installed. Each will have a diameter of up to 8.8 m, a length of up to 92 m and a weight of up to 1,530 metric tons.

Following manufacture by EEW in Rostock, Germany, the structures are being transported by barges to the Port of Tyne near Newcastle, which serves as the storage and marshalling base for the wind turbine generator foundations.

The extended monopile design avoids the need for a transition piece. To complete the foundations, the monopiles will include secondary steel components comprising main access platforms, internal platforms, boat landings and upper ladders.

Various suppliers in the Netherlands and Poland are producing the secondary steel components, again for transport to the Port of Tyne.

This asset is located within the PacifiCorp region and will ""provide regional grid support consistent with PacifiCorp's resource planning forecasts"", RWE said.

In its 2023 Integrated Resource Plan (IRP), Pacificorp - which operates in the Western US - said that it intends to have installed 20GW worth of solar and wind capacity across its markets by 2032.

RWE also acquired the 199MW/796 MWh four-hour duration Remington BESS in Marion County, Oregon. Both Cedar Ridge and Remington expand RWE's existing footprint in the Pacific Northwest of the US.

Hanson Wood, head of development for utility-scale renewables at RWE Clean Energy said: ""RWE is excited to close on our first acquisitions with Galehead, in particular the Remington and Cedar Ridge projects which allow us to expand our presence in the Pacific Northwest market where there is robust demand for low-cost, clean power.""

The smallest of the three assets RWE acquired is the 100MWac Champlain solar project in Washington County, New York, where RWE said that there is growing electricity demand. The site is in the mid-stages of development, though the company did not confirm when it is expected online.

RWE is the US renewables project subsidiary of German energy company RWE Group and was formerly known as Con Edison Clean Energy. The parent company saw its global earnings from solar and wind assets increase significantly last year compared with 2022, rising to around US$1.35 billion. This is largely due to the acquisition of Con Edison (as it was then known) in the US in March 2023, which came with a 24GW project pipeline of solar, storage and wind assets.

The power cable will connect the energy grids of the two countries and ensure flexibility in the transportation of renewable energies, said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs Robert Habeck (Greens) at a symbolic ground-breaking ceremony on Tuesday. ""The more interconnected Europe is, the larger the network is, the more efficiently the system can be operated and controlled and the greater the goal of decarbonization, i.e. a climate-neutral electricity supply, can be achieved.""

Habeck spoke of a ""really big project"" that would also connect the two countries' key wind power generation regions. Surplus wind power in particular, which is produced in the German North Sea but cannot yet be transported onshore due to bottlenecks in the electricity grid, could be exported to the UK via the submarine cable. The United Kingdom currently imports more electricity than it exports.

The Vice-Chancellor performed the ground-breaking ceremony together with the British Minister of State for Trade Policy, Gregory Hands, Lower Saxony's Minister for Economic Affairs, Olaf Lies (SPD), and the Chairwoman of the project company Neuconnect, Julia Prescot. Planning for the project began at the end of 2016. Construction work has already started in the UK. The cable, which will run largely through the North Sea, is scheduled to go into operation in 2028.

Neuconnect Chairwoman Julia Prescot said that private sector investment is needed to implement the energy transition - the electricity highway is an example of this. ""We are the largest Anglo-German investment project,"" she said. The investment costs of almost three billion euros are being borne by an international consortium. Participants include the French investor Meridiam, the Allianz Group and the Japanese energy suppliers Kansai Electric Power and Tepco as well as a consortium of more than 20 banks. According to the project company, there will be no state subsidies.

The line, called Neuconnect, will be able to transport up to 1.4 gigawatts of electricity in both directions - roughly equivalent to the output of a nuclear power plant and, according to the project company, enough energy for around 1.5 million households. The 725-kilometer-long cable will connect the German transmission grid from Wilhelmshaven with the British grid on the Isle of Grain in the English county of Kent at the mouth of the Thames.

According to the Federal Network Agency, such electricity highways between countries, also known as interconnectors, can improve energy security and boost competition, which can lead to lower electricity prices. According to the agency, direct connections between electricity markets increase sales opportunities. The countries could thus mutually benefit from the most favorable generation conditions. Germany currently has 54 such interconnectors and 16 more are planned.

Lower Saxony's Economics Minister Lies said that the energy transition also focuses on the north-west of Lower Saxony and the region around Wilhelmshaven. ""Without Lower Saxony, the energy transition and achieving the climate targets in Germany would not be possible."" It is important that this region also benefits economically. ""We also want the locations that will be energy locations in the future, because large quantities of renewable energies are available, to also be locations for further economic development.""

The British Minister of State for Trade Policy, Gregory Hands, spoke of a ""symbolic moment for both countries"". The new power line is a ""flagship project"" that illustrates how closely Germany and the United Kingdom are working together to make the two economies climate-neutral. ""We want to make the North Sea Europe's green energy hub and cooperation between Germany and the UK will be crucial to achieving this.""

According to experts, the UK's importance as an electricity market will continue to grow with the electricity link to Germany. ""The British Isles are already the second-largest offshore wind market in the world after China,"" Marc Lehnfeld from the German government-owned company Germany Trade and Invest (GTAI) told the German Press Agency in London. So far, the UK is still a net importer of electricity. However, the British government wants to significantly increase offshore wind capacity from 15 to 50 gigawatts (GW) by 2030. This will also boost export potential, said Lehnfeld.

German companies are also involved in the British offshore wind energy market. ""RWE is one of the largest developers in the country with ten current and nine planned offshore wind projects,"" said Lehnfeld. ""EnBW is also currently developing three offshore wind farms on the British coast.""/len/DP/tih",marketscreener.com,news,Market Screener,,0.192156862745098,453995241,1,,

It will enable HexCam to control drones remotely from its base at Felthorpe Airfield, near Norwich, and carry out BVLOS flights along the onshore construction corridor of the Norfolk Offshore Wind Zone (NWOZ) on behalf of J. Murphy & Sons.

HexCam has provided aerial survey and mapping services to J. Murphy & Sons and Vattenfall (now RWE) for the past three years. It is currently carrying out monthly 'construction progress' surveys along the western third of the NWOZ cable corridor between Necton and the River Wensum at Elsing.

The speed at which it completes these surveys will be further enhanced by its participation in the CAA BVLOS sandbox project.

""We used to be limited to flying out just 500 metres from where we were standing. Then we'd have to pack everything down, relocate by 950m along a corridor, and do it all again,"" said director Rowley Cory-Wright.

With its enhanced CAA permissions, HexCam is now able to fly out to 2,500 metres as well as use a dual-pilot system that allows control to be passed between two pilots - delivering huge efficiency gains.

""We can now complete the western third of the corridor in about six hours, from only seven take-off and landing sites,"" said Rowley.

A 'visual observer' (VO) located between the pilots helps to maintain sight of the drone, but HexCam is now testing Electronic Conspicuity (EC) devices, which sit on the drone and communicate its location to other airspace users.

As part of the BVLOS project, the company is working with project partners to develop a fixed-wing drone, which can travel further than a 'quadcopter' drone.

StirlingX, a GALLOS company, is providing HexCam with the Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) 'Sparrow Hawk' fixed-wing drone that will be conducting BVLOS flights along the NOWZ onshore construction corridor. The first short-range test flights have already been completed and will be extended in the coming months.

HexCam has also partnered with Global Drone Training to ensure its team is fully qualified to conduct BVLOS flights, while Norwich Airport is overseeing the airspace integration and helping to test Electronic Conspicuity measures.

It will enable HexCam to control drones remotely from its base at Felthorpe Airfield, near Norwich, and carry out BVLOS flights along the onshore construction corridor of the Norfolk Offshore Wind Zone (NWOZ) on behalf of J. Murphy & Sons.

HexCam has provided aerial survey and mapping services to J. Murphy & Sons and Vattenfall (now RWE) for the past three years. It is currently carrying out monthly 'construction progress' surveys along the western third of the NWOZ cable corridor between Necton and the River Wensum at Elsing.

The speed at which it completes these surveys will be further enhanced by its participation in the CAA BVLOS sandbox project.

""We used to be limited to flying out just 500 metres from where we were standing. Then we'd have to pack everything down, relocate by 950m along a corridor, and do it all again,"" said director Rowley Cory-Wright.

With its enhanced CAA permissions, HexCam is now able to fly out to 2,500 metres as well as use a dual-pilot system that allows control to be passed between two pilots - delivering huge efficiency gains.

""We can now complete the western third of the corridor in about six hours, from only seven take-off and landing sites,"" said Rowley.

A 'visual observer' (VO) located between the pilots helps to maintain sight of the drone, but HexCam is now testing Electronic Conspicuity (EC) devices, which sit on the drone and communicate its location to other airspace users.

As part of the BVLOS project, the company is working with project partners to develop a fixed-wing drone, which can travel further than a 'quadcopter' drone.

StirlingX, a GALLOS company, is providing HexCam with the Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) 'Sparrow Hawk' fixed-wing drone that will be conducting BVLOS flights along the NOWZ onshore construction corridor. The first short-range test flights have already been completed and will be extended in the coming months.

HexCam has also partnered with Global Drone Training to ensure its team is fully qualified to conduct BVLOS flights, while Norwich Airport is overseeing the airspace integration and helping to test Electronic Conspicuity measures.

With a capacity of 1.4 GW, Sofia is RWE's largest offshore wind farm to date. After its expected commissioning in 2026, the project will be capable of generating enough electricity to power the equivalent of 1.2 million typical UK homes.

Following the installation of the essential subsea cable infrastructure, this installation marks the start of offshore construction within the array itself. It is the first of 100 foundations to be installed at the 593 km array.

Sven Utermöhlen, CEO RWE Offshore Wind, said: ""Sofia is RWE's largest offshore wind construction project to date, and its furthest from shore. Installing the first monopile is a highly symbolic moment in the construction of every offshore wind farm. After 14 years of planning and preparation, this is a great achievement for the entire RWE team. I'd like to thank everyone involved for their contribution. Building a project of this size and scale is a great opportunity to demonstrate our expertise in delivering offshore wind energy around the globe.""

Sofia offshore wind farm is located on Dogger Bank, 195 km from the nearest point on the UK's north east coast, and will have a single offshore converter platform, with the electricity generated transported to landfall 220 km away in Redcar, Teesside.

The wind farm will use 100 Siemens Gamesa 14 MW offshore wind turbines (SG 14-222 DD), the most advanced offshore wind turbine technology available, and is scheduled to be completed by the end of 2026. A total of 44 of the project's 100 turbines will be equipped with recyclable blades. Once completed, each 14 MW turbine will be 252 m tall, with a 108 m carbon and fibreglass blade, and a 222 m diameter rotor sweeping an area of 39 000 m.

Operations and maintenance activities for the wind farm will be located at RWE's new offshore wind operations base 'Grimsby Hub', which also supports RWE's Triton Knoll offshore wind farm and future projects.

Van Oord, an international marine contractor, owns and operates the vessel Aeolus that carries out the work to install the foundations at the wind farm array on Dogger Bank. Following the successful construction of the Rampion, Humber Gateway, Robin Rigg, and London Array wind farms, Sofia is the fifth major offshore wind project the company is delivering in collaboration with RWE.

The vessel and crew will deliver the installation of three foundations per cycle, with a transit time of up to 16 hours. The total duration of this campaign phase will depend on sea conditions, but all 100 foundations are expected to be installed by spring 2025. This follows the installation of the high voltage direct current (HVDC) export cable which started during 2023.

The work also signals a new chapter for the Port of Tyne, which has undergone a significant upgrade in order to support this work.

Individuals who lost family members during extreme weather events including Greek wildfires, Storm Alex across Europe and Cyclone Idai in Zimbabwe, or survived these events, filed the case in a French court alongside non-profit groups, the environmental group Bloom said.

The case filed on Tuesday names TotalEnergies' directors, led by chief executive Patrick Pouyanné, and comes ahead of the energy major's annual meeting on Friday.

The accusation of criminal responsibility for the widespread fallout from extreme weather events is unique, legal academics say, and relies on a body of science that attributes such events to climate change caused by greenhouse gases from the burning of fossil fuels.

Environmental crime cases against large corporations have typically focused on specific events, such as oil spills, where the impact is able to be clearly assessed, leaving the field relatively untested.

Other ongoing criminal cases against TotalEnergies have focused on green claims in its advertising and on the potential impact of its oil pipeline project in Tanzania and Uganda.

The Paris criminal prosecutor will have three months to decide whether to launch an investigation into the case, the plaintiffs said, after which they will have the option of referring the case to an investigating judge.

TotalEnergies, BlackRock and Norges Bank Investment Management did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Significant legal action by campaign groups against polluters, including British energy company Shell, German utility RWE and Swiss cement producer Holcim, have so far involved activists pressing for financial damages or changes to companies' business models, without alleging criminal behaviour.

The maximum penalty for involuntary manslaughter in France is five years in prison, while other accusations in the complaint, including damaging biodiversity and deliberately endangering the lives of others, can also carry prison terms.

The possibility of a sentence would be a ""significant"" deterrent to oil and gas companies continuing to expand production, said Donald Braman, associate professor at George Washington University Law School and co-author of a paper on the potential use of homicide charges in climate litigation.

""The public censure and exposure of wrongdoing that comes with a criminal prosecution is significantly more influential on shareholders, executives and companies in general than civil actions,"" he said. ""It's not murder because they're not intending to kill people, but it [climate change] is killing . . . more than you would typically see in a homicide case.""

The Bloom activist group said the case aimed to ""bridge the gap that exists between the absolute scientific certainty of who bears the responsibility for the destruction of the world by climate change and the absence of clear sentencing by courts against climate crimes"".",ft.com,news,Financial Times News,,-0.0980392156862745,453986057,1,https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2F__origami%2Fservice%2Fimage%2Fv2%2Fimages%2Fraw%2Fhttps%253A%252F%252Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%252Fproduction%252F13400652-2868-491b-b6d8-b95a29eef123.jpg%3Fsource%3Dnext-article%26fit%3Dscale-down%26quality%3Dhighest%26width%3D700%26dpr%3D1?source=next-opengraph&fit=scale-down&width=900&overlay=https://www.ft.com/__assets/creatives/x/ft-overlay.png&overlay_height=0.15&overlay_y=30&overlay_gravity=south_east,eng-9586172

Power purchase agreement is also called as ""Green Power Purchase Agreements"" (Green PPAs). The power purchase agreements operate over the medium or long term (5 to 20 years). In the agreement, the developer sells the power generated to the host customer at a fixed rate which is typically lower than the local utility's retail rate. Several benefits are associated with PPA such as a fixed long-term rate and guarantees of origin of renewable assets. All regions are engaged in the development of the power sabing solutions which can help to lower the global footprints and cost saving on power consumptions. The adoption of green energy is increasing in Asia, and Australia which is creating power purchase agreement market opportunity.

Lower power prices encourage customers to sign PPAs and make fewer purchases of electricity from utilities which is boosting the power purchase agreement market share in the energy industry. PPA ensure developer to receives the income from the sales of electricity as well as any tax credits and other incentives generated from the system which is uplifting the power purchase agreement market size in forecasted period. At the end of the PPA contract term, a customer may be able to extend the PPA or choose to buy the solar energy system from the developer.

Large corporates are entering into PPA to buy electricity from renewable energy projects located near to their premises (on-site projects) and sometime remote from their location (off-site). As per power purchase agreement market forecast, corporates are entering to PPA to promote energy conservation and energy efficiency which help the business to complete the sustainability policies. In all regions, the consumption of green energy is increasing on high rate which foster the power purchase agreement market growth. With implementation of the proposed programs to build a energy efficient corporate building will help to boost the power purchase agreement market trend in near future.

LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 20, 2024-- DexCom, Inc. (Nasdaq: DXCM), a global leader in real-time continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) for people with diabetes, today announced both the launch of Dexcom ONE+, a CGM device that easily tracks real-time glucose readings to help improve diabetes management, and the Dexcom State of Type 2 Report. The report is a first-of-its-kind look at the Type 2 landscape today and examines the preferences and behaviours of those living with the condition, as well as their caretakers and healthcare professionals. It is hoped that the report will serve as a valuable resource for healthcare professionals supporting those living with Type 2 diabetes and empower those with Type 2 to feel less isolated. Additionally, Dexcom ONE+ can offer a diabetes management solution specifically suited to those living with Type 2 diabetes.

As the UK observes Type 2 Diabetes Prevention Week, the first-ever State of Type 2 Report, from Dexcom, discovered that nearly half (49%) of individuals with Type 2 diabetes were unaware of the condition's effects when diagnosed. Now, 63% are encountering difficulties in managing their diabetes, including challenges related to improving their diet or their mental health, in fact 42% of people with diabetes and caregivers surveyed say living with Type 2 has negatively impacted their mental health or that of the person they care for, of those respondents anxiety (61%) and depression (52%) are the most commonly reported effects of living with Type 2 diabetes . Furthermore, when asked, close to half (48%) believe that being able to monitor their glucose levels would help them better manage their condition, while 39% feel that greater knowledge about available care options would be beneficial.

However, the good news for those struggling to manage Type 2 diabetes is that a recent study has shown a link between real-time CGM usage, such as Dexcom ONE+, and improved management of the condition. The study showed that by bringing awareness to the impact of food and exercise choices on an individual's glucose levels, people became more motivated to continue making positive choices, likely leading to significant glycaemic benefits.

""The Dexcom State of Type 2 report reveals that people trying to manage their Type 2 diabetes face significant impacts on all areas of their lives including, and perhaps particularly, their mental health,"" says Karen Baxter, Vice President, Northern Europe, South Africa, Israel, and Malta at Dexcom. ""We're proud to have developed a sensor that addresses the unmet needs of the Type 2 community. Feedback from users and healthcare professionals already using Dexcom ONE+ indicates that the sensor is easy to use and motivational, as it provides a clearer understanding of how food and exercise choices affect glucose levels. Seeing real-time feedback can help alleviate the frustration many people, especially those with Type 2 diabetes, experience in understanding and managing their condition.""

About Dexcom ONE+

Dexcom ONE+ incorporates 25 years of Dexcom's research into real-time CGM and the unique needs of different diabetes communities. Developed based on feedback from consumers and healthcare professionals from the previous generation Dexcom ONE sensor the result is a more flexible and easier to use CGM system, better suited to the needs of those managing Type 2 diabetes, whilst also improving the sensor experience for those living with Type 1.

For people managing diabetes using fingerpricks and regularly injecting insulin, their lives can feel overwhelmed by diabetes. Dexcom ONE+ was developed to take away some of this burden, it's easy to get started with** and is designed to be easy to live with, even for those with no experience of using a CGM system. Like all Dexcom CGM, Dexcom ONE+ gives a clear picture of what glucose levels are doing in real-time, without painful fingerpricks*, therefore making it easier for people to achieve lasting results. Importantly, for loved ones, Dexcom ONE+ also allows a user to easily share their glucose numbers with up to ten people, offering everyone a little more peace of mind.

Features that set Dexcom ONE+ apart from other CGM systems include multiple possibilities for personalisation and flexibility. Dexcom CGM systems also offer the most discretion, with three wear location options and are the only CGM systems to offer a 'delay first high' option,a customisable feature which allows a user to set a time before which their sensor will not alert them to a 'high' glucose reading, helping to avoid alert fatigue and rebound hypoglycaemia due to over treatment. Furthermore, designed to fit seamlessly into a user's life, Dexcom ONE+ also has the highest waterproof rating when compared to other CGM brands, allowing users to confidently continue using their device while showering or exercising.

Dexcom ONE+ is suitable for people living with both Type 1 and Type 2, is covered for some people on prescription via the NHS and is also available to purchase online. People living with diabetes and caregivers should speak to their doctor about the best options for them.

More on the Dexcom State of Type 2 Report

More than five million people in the UK are living with diabetes - and 90% of this group have Type 2, according to Diabetes UK. The first-of-its-kind Dexcom State of Type 2 Report was designed to offer insights into the realities of living with the condition.

""As the State of Type 2 Report reveals, living with Type 2 diabetes can come with psychological as well as physical challenges,"" says Dr. Rose Stewart, Consultant Clinical Psychologist and chair of the UK Diabetes Psychology Network. ""Many people living with Type 2 diabetes feel like they don't understand their condition, and feel like it is beyond their control - this combination of issues can contribute to more problems managing diabetes and detrimental mental health challenges. Fortunately, with tech advancements, people living with Type 2 can now feel empowered to better understand their condition, feel like they can manage it effectively and live more confidently. Using technology like a CGM paired with health boosting activities - whether that be exercise, relaxation, enjoying time with loved ones or something else -can help people confidently tackle type 2 along with the stresses it creates every day.""

Notes to Editors

Additional context, findings, and key highlights from the Dexcom State of Type 2 Report include:

Understanding at Diagnosis: Awareness of type 2 diabetes is low prior to diagnosis, with just 10% of patients knowing a lot about type 2 before diagnosis. Once diagnosed, healthcare practitioners find that patients are most concerned with long-term complications (29%), fear of diabetes related health issues (28%) and how much it will impact their day-to-day lives (27%).

Mental Health Challenges: Living with type 2 diabetes takes a toll on mental health. Nearly half (42%) of patients and caregivers surveyed said that living with type 2 has negatively impacted their mental health, or that of the person they care for. Anxiety (61%) and depression (52%) are the most commonly reported effects of living with type 2.

Balancing Nutrition: Patients and caregivers recognise the importance of proper nutrition to manage type 2, with 81% saying they are aware eating healthily would positively affect their diabetes. Still, there's room for education and excitement when it comes to eating, with over a quarter (27%) of patients and caregivers agreeing they don't think they have the right education on food, and 39% saying they find eating after their type 2 diagnosis boring.

Technological Advancements: Technology like CGM makes it easy to manage type 2 diabetes. While only 9% of patients and caregivers fully understand what a CGM system is - and 70% are unaware it's available on prescription for some people with type 2 - most know that it will help improve their lives with diabetes: in fact, 40% say being able to see glucose numbers in real time and having access to CGM would have the most positive effect on their type 2 diabetes or that of the person they care for. Additionally, 83% of patients say if their healthcare team offered them a CGM they would try it.

The Future of Type 2 Diabetes: Sixty-two percent of healthcare practitioners expect the number of patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes will increase in the next 10 years - with 97% anticipating CGM will become standard practice for caring for patients with type 2 diabetes.

Will Dexcom ONE+ replace the current Dexcom ONE?

Dexcom ONE+ has been developed based on feedback from consumers and healthcare professionals from the previous generation Dexcom ONE sensor. Patients currently using Dexcom ONE will be transitioned once Dexcom ONE+ is available in their area, so they can benefit from this new and improved generation of Dexcom sensor.

""The British Isles are already the second largest offshore wind market in the world after China,"" Marc Lehnfeld from the German government-owned company Germany Trade and Invest (GTAI) told the German Press Agency in London.

So far, the UK is still a net importer of electricity. However, the British government wants to significantly increase offshore wind capacity from 15 to 50 gigawatts GW by 2030. This will also boost export potential, said Lehnfeld.

Groundbreaking ceremony in Wilhelmshaven

Federal Economics Minister Robert Habeck is expected to attend the ground-breaking ceremony for the German landfall point of the electricity highway in Wilhelmshaven on Tuesday (today). The 725-kilometre-long underwater power cable will connect the energy grids of Great Britain and Germany for the first time. The so-called interconnector can transport up to 1.4 gigawatts of electricity in both directions - that is enough energy for around 1.5 million households. The construction costs of almost three billion euros are being borne by a consortium of investors.

According to the Federal Network Agency, interconnectors can improve energy security and boost competition, which can lead to lower electricity prices. According to the agency, direct connections between electricity markets increase sales opportunities. The countries could thus mutually benefit from the most favorable generation conditions.

According to the Federal Network Agency, Germany currently has 54 such interconnectors, which connect the country with all nine neighboring countries as well as Sweden and Norway - four of which are submarine cables. 16 further interconnectors, including Neuconnect, are currently being planned.

""The Neuconnect electricity link will be the first direct German-British interconnector,"" said GTAI expert Lehnfeld. ""In addition to the political signal of rapprochement, the interconnector underlines the importance of the energy industry for both countries."" The electricity connection allows for a better balance between the two electricity markets. According to preliminary data, around 24 terawatt hours more electricity was imported to the UK than exported in 2023. ""The interconnector therefore opens up a new market for German electricity producers,"" said Lehnfeld.

German companies are among the most important players in the British market

In view of the British plans, however, the sales direction could change in the future. The world's largest wind farm projects, Dogger Bank and Hornsea, are under construction in the North Sea.

German companies are also involved in the British offshore wind energy market. ""RWE is one of the largest developers in the country with ten current and nine planned offshore wind projects,"" said Lehnfeld. ""EnBW is also currently developing three offshore wind farms on the British coast.""

However, the industry is also under pressure. ""Significantly higher costs for the wind turbines themselves, but also on the financing side, are stalling the development of further wind farms for the time being,"" said Lehnfeld. The current sixth round of funding for renewable energy projects could provide a boost. At 800 million pounds, the majority of the funding pot is reserved for offshore wind energy.

However, the Renewable UK association and the Offshore Renewable Energy (ORE) Catapult innovation center have criticized that the volume of funding will not be enough to close the gaps left by the last round of funding, which came to nothing./bvi/DP/zb",marketscreener.com,news,Market Screener,,0.2862745098039217,453960639,1,,

This would be an important milestone for Tata Steel UK in its path toward low-carbon transformation as it will ensure the company has one of the key infrastructure in place to operate the new EAF. Tata Steel had announced that it will decommission both blast furnaces at Port Talbot in 2024 and build a new EAF, reducing CO2 emissions by 5 million mt/year.

Tata Steel expects to place equipment orders for the EAF by September, start construction by August 2025 and produce liquid steel by end-2027. During the interim period, the company will send to the UK slabs for rerolling from its Netherlands site, a move not approved by the unions due to the possibility of 2,800 redundancies and fears that the new EAF would never happen. Unions did not reply to S&P Global Commodity Insights for a comment.

Tata Steel's Port Talbot site at Margam is served by a 275-kV substation linked to the larger 400 kV Swansea North substation. Swansea is linked to the southwest Welsh coast by four high voltage power lines to Pembroke docks, home to RWE's 2.2-GW gas-fired power station -- the region's largest by some way. Future power flows to and from Pembroke are set to increase once the 500-MW Greenlink Interconnector to Ireland is completed by end-2024.

Beyond this, the Crown Estate's Celtic Sea Offshore Wind Leasing Round 5 was launched in February for up to 4.2 GW of floating wind in a first phase off the coasts of south Wales and southwest England.

This has led to the Future Port Talbot project, transforming the port into a hub for floating wind farm manufacturing.

The blast furnace and basic oxygen furnace process releases the highest carbon emissions: 2.33 mt of CO2 emission per ton of crude steel. The direct reduced iron and electric arc furnace (DRI-EAF) process releases 1.37 mtCO2e/mt. The scrap steel and electric arc furnace (scrap-EAF) process releases the lowest carbon emissions at 0.66 mt of CO2. In Europe, 57% of steel is produced via the BF route that uses coal as a raw material and the rest from EAFs that use scrap as a raw material, so many European steelmakers are switching their production routes.

Hot-rolled coil prices in the UK fell in the week to May 16 as trading activity remained low and distributors started to offload ex-stock material at competitive rates.

""It's not great but it has to be done,"" he says.

The chairman of the East of England Energy Group (EEEGR) lives almost directly along the line of planned new pylons set to slice through the countryside from Norwich to Tilbury bringing green energy to people's homes. He will have a direct view from his house.

Many in the countryside - through Norfolk, Suffolk and Essex - are up in arms about the plans.

But Kevin - a long-time industry professional - sees the big grid upgrade as a practical necessity to power the UK through the energy transition.

This week energy professionals will be descending on East Anglia for a major conference which will be setting the scene for a vast ramping-up of the region's position in the fast-growing sector.

SNS2024 - a two-day event based on developing energy projects around the Southern North Sea - is organised by EEEGR - the East's sector trade body. It kicks off at the Royal Norfolk showground on Wednesday, May 15.

It will span East Anglia's traditional energy industry - gas - and the new generation - wind and new nuclear. It will also encompass the vital supply grid, energy storage and carbon capture.

All of these are seen as vital components in the UK's so-called ""energy transition"" - moving it from fossil fuels to low and no-carbon alternatives over the next 26 years in order to combat global warming and preserve the Earth's diminishing resources.

Twenty years ago when EEEGR first started hosting the conferences, the picture was very different to today, says Kevin.

Back then it was all about the region's gas industry and the offshore wind industry was in its infancy.

Around a third of the UK's entire gas supply still flows through the Bacton terminal on the east Norfolk coast.

Kevin doesn't see the taps being turned off any time soon - in fact, he thinks we will still need gas for the next 20 to 30 years while we transition from carbon fuels.

But today there are about a thousand turbine blades turning in the Southern North Sea - and many more are in the pipeline. These have got bigger and more efficient in producing large quantities of green electricity to power the nation.

So much so that it's not always possible - even now - to harness it all. Kevin likens getting it into the electricity infrastructure to getting on to a very busy motorway.

""Some of that electricity can't get into the grid at the moment,"" he explains. Thus the need for more infrastructure - including the pylons.

Building the grid is in many ways the hard part, he explains. By comparison, building the turbines is easy.

The sea bed - seen by many as the better route for the grid - still contains unexploded ordnance from the war and is not the professionals' favoured route for reasons of cost and practicality.

""We are now really talking about the energy transition so we have people talking about wind of course but we have also got people talking about gas and carbon capture and the grid which will be needed to make this work,"" explains Kevin.

Even now, he believes that the industry is only at Everest basecamp - preparing to scale the heights and complete the transition.

""It's about collaboration. This conference is about how we can collaborate together to make this energy transition work,"" he says.

Among the big-hitters at the conference will be ScottishPower Renewables, Sizewell C, National Grid, oil and gas giant Perenco, RWE - new owner of the Norfolk offshore wind projects - and global energy skills leader OPITO.

Delegates will be looking at opportunities in the Southern North Sea - the so-called ""Sea of Opportunity"" - and the challenges their industry faces - including getting that energy to customers and recruiting the vast workforce it will need.

""We have a real skills shortage in this region,"" says Kevin. ""We really want to take firm action.""

Among the answers may be addressing a big gender imbalance in the industry. While globally, women making up 39 per cent of the workforce they account for just 16pc in the energy sector as a whole. Oil and gas employs about 22pc women and renewables 32pc - with wind at 21pc.

There are opportunities to discuss too - including sharing expertise and technology with projects in other locations, such as in Scandinavia.

Among the delegates will be representatives of Norwegian Offshore Wind, the country's trade body. Representatives from the US offshore wind industry will also be attending - along with Celtic Sea delegates.

In the past, different sectors within the energy industry have operated in silos, says Kevin, but he detects a different mood now.

""In the past I would have said it's not feasible (to work together) because they are all competitors,"" he says. But now, collaboration is key.

""We are already on that pathway. I have been in discussions with government representatives recently and they are saying if we don't pull together this is not going to work and we are going to have to make it work,"" he says.

""There's a lot of common ground. The industry is going to be competing for skilled people and that's a real issue for us all.""",eveningnews24.co.uk,news,Norwich Evening News,,0.1607843137254903,453913594,1,https://www.eveningnews24.co.uk/resources/images/18102741/,

(Nasdaq: DXCM), a global leader in real-time continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) for people with diabetes, today announced both the launch of Dexcom ONE+, a CGM device that easily tracks real-time glucose readings to help improve diabetes management, and the Dexcom State of Type 2 Report. The report is a first-of-its-kind look at the Type 2 landscape today and examines the preferences and behaviours of those living with the condition, as well as their caretakers and healthcare professionals. It is hoped that the report will serve as a valuable resource for healthcare professionals supporting those living with Type 2 diabetes and empower those with Type 2 to feel less isolated. Additionally, Dexcom ONE+ can offer a diabetes management solution specifically suited to those living with Type 2 diabetes.

As the UK observes Type 2 Diabetes Prevention Week, the first-ever State of Type 2 Report, from Dexcom, discovered that nearly half (49%) of individuals with Type 2 diabetes were unaware of the condition's effects when diagnosed. Now, 63% are encountering difficulties in managing their diabetes, including challenges related to improving their diet or their mental health, in fact 42% of people with diabetes and caregivers surveyed say living with Type 2 has negatively impacted their mental health or that of the person they care for, of those respondents anxiety (61%) and depression (52%) are the most commonly reported effects of living with Type 2 diabetes . Furthermore, when asked, close to half (48%) believe that being able to monitor their glucose levels would help them better manage their condition, while 39% feel that greater knowledge about available care options would be beneficial.

However, the good news for those struggling to manage Type 2 diabetes is that a recent study2 has shown a link between real-time CGM usage, such as Dexcom ONE+, and improved management of the condition. The study showed that by bringing awareness to the impact of food and exercise choices on an individual's glucose levels, people became more motivated to continue making positive choices, likely leading to significant glycaemic benefits2.

The Dexcom State of Type 2 report reveals that people trying to manage their Type 2 diabetes face significant impacts on all areas of their lives including, and perhaps particularly, their mental health, says Karen Baxter (NYSE:BAX), Vice President, Northern Europe, South Africa, Israel, and Malta at Dexcom. We're proud to have developed a sensor that addresses the unmet needs of the Type 2 community. Feedback from users and healthcare professionals already using Dexcom ONE+ indicates that the sensor is easy to use and motivational, as it provides a clearer understanding of how food and exercise choices affect glucose levels. Seeing real-time feedback can help alleviate the frustration many people, especially those with Type 2 diabetes, experience in understanding and managing their condition.

About Dexcom ONE+

Dexcom ONE+ incorporates 25 years of Dexcom's research into real-time CGM and the unique needs of different diabetes communities. Developed based on feedback from consumers and healthcare professionals from the previous generation Dexcom ONE sensor the result is a more flexible and easier-,4, to use CGM system, better suited to the needs of those managing Type 2 diabetes, whilst also improving the sensor experience for those living with Type 1.

For people managing diabetes using fingerpricks and regularly injecting insulin, their lives can feel overwhelmed by diabetes. Dexcom ONE+ was developed to take away some of this burden, it's easy to get started with and is designed to be easy to live with, even for those with no experience of using a CGM system. Like all Dexcom CGM, Dexcom ONE+ gives a clear picture of what glucose levels are doing in real-time, without painful fingerpricks, therefore making it easier- for people to achieve lasting results §,5,¡¡,7,8. Importantly, for loved ones, Dexcom ONE+ also allows a user to easily share their glucose numbers with up to ten people, offering everyone a little more peace of mind .

Features that set Dexcom ONE+ apart from other CGM systems include multiple possibilities for personalisation and flexibility. Dexcom CGM systems also offer the most discretion, with three wear location options¡ 3,6 and are the only CGM systems to offer a ~delay first high' option3 § §, a customisable feature which allows a user to set a time before which their sensor will not alert them to a ~high' glucose reading, helping to avoid alert fatigue and rebound hypoglycaemia due to over treatment^,9. Furthermore, designed to fit seamlessly into a user's life, Dexcom ONE+ also has the highest waterproof rating when compared to other CGM brands , allowing users to confidently continue using their device while showering or exercising.

Dexcom ONE+ is suitable for people living with both Type 1 and Type 2, is covered for some people on prescription via the NHS and is also available to purchase online. People living with diabetes and caregivers should speak to their doctor about the best options for them.

More on the Dexcom State of Type 2 Report

More than five million people in the UK are living with diabetes "" and 90% of this group have Type 2, according to Diabetes UK. The first-of-its-kind Dexcom State of Type 2 Report was designed to offer insights into the realities of living with the condition.

As the State of Type 2 Report reveals, living with Type 2 diabetes can come with psychological as well as physical challenges, says Dr. Rose Stewart, Consultant Clinical Psychologist and chair of the UK Diabetes Psychology Network (LON:NETW). Many people living with Type 2 diabetes feel like they don't understand their condition, and feel like it is beyond their control "" this combination of issues can contribute to more problems managing diabetes and detrimental mental health challenges. Fortunately, with tech advancements, people living with Type 2 can now feel empowered to better understand their condition, feel like they can manage it effectively and live more confidently. Using technology like a CGM paired with health boosting activities "" whether that be exercise, relaxation, enjoying time with loved ones or something else ""can help people confidently tackle type 2 along with the stresses it creates every day.

Notes to Editors

Additional context, findings, and key highlights from the Dexcom State of Type 2 Report include:

Understanding at Diagnosis: Awareness of type 2 diabetes is low prior to diagnosis, with just 10% of patients knowing a lot about type 2 before diagnosis. Once diagnosed, healthcare practitioners find that patients are most concerned with long-term complications (29%), fear of diabetes related health issues (28%) and how much it will impact their day-to-day lives (27%).

Mental Health Challenges: Living with type 2 diabetes takes a toll on mental health. Nearly half (42%) of patients and caregivers surveyed said that living with type 2 has negatively impacted their mental health, or that of the person they care for. Anxiety (61%) and depression (52%) are the most commonly reported effects of living with type 2.

Balancing Nutrition: Patients and caregivers recognise the importance of proper nutrition to manage type 2, with 81% saying they are aware eating healthily would positively affect their diabetes. Still, there's room for education and excitement when it comes to eating, with over a quarter (27%) of patients and caregivers agreeing they don't think they have the right education on food, and 39% saying they find eating after their type 2 diagnosis boring.

Technological Advancements: Technology like CGM makes it easy to manage type 2 diabetes. While only 9% of patients and caregivers fully understand what a CGM system is "" and 70% are unaware it's available on prescription for some people with type 2 "" most know that it will help improve their lives with diabetes: in fact, 40% say being able to see glucose numbers in real time and having access to CGM would have the most positive effect on their type 2 diabetes or that of the person they care for. Additionally, 83% of patients say if their healthcare team offered them a CGM they would try it.

The Future of Type 2 Diabetes: Sixty-two percent of healthcare practitioners expect the number of patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes will increase in the next 10 years "" with 97% anticipating CGM will become standard practice for caring for patients with type 2 diabetes.1

Will Dexcom ONE+ replace the current Dexcom ONE?

Dexcom ONE+ has been developed based on feedback from consumers and healthcare professionals from the previous generation Dexcom ONE sensor. Patients currently using Dexcom ONE will be transitioned once Dexcom ONE+ is available in their area, so they can benefit from this new and improved generation of Dexcom sensor.

(Nasdaq: DXCM), a global leader in real-time continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) for people with diabetes, today announced both the launch of Dexcom ONE+, a CGM device that easily tracks real-time glucose readings to help improve diabetes management, and the Dexcom State of Type 2 Report. The report is a first-of-its-kind look at the Type 2 landscape today and examines the preferences and behaviours of those living with the condition, as well as their caretakers and healthcare professionals. It is hoped that the report will serve as a valuable resource for healthcare professionals supporting those living with Type 2 diabetes and empower those with Type 2 to feel less isolated. Additionally, Dexcom ONE+ can offer a diabetes management solution specifically suited to those living with Type 2 diabetes.

As the UK observes Type 2 Diabetes Prevention Week, the first-ever State of Type 2 Report, from Dexcom, discovered that nearly half (49%) of individuals with Type 2 diabetes were unaware of the condition's effects when diagnosed. Now, 63% are encountering difficulties in managing their diabetes, including challenges related to improving their diet or their mental health, in fact 42% of people with diabetes and caregivers surveyed say living with Type 2 has negatively impacted their mental health or that of the person they care for, of those respondents anxiety (61%) and depression (52%) are the most commonly reported effects of living with Type 2 diabetes . Furthermore, when asked, close to half (48%) believe that being able to monitor their glucose levels would help them better manage their condition, while 39% feel that greater knowledge about available care options would be beneficial.

However, the good news for those struggling to manage Type 2 diabetes is that a recent study2 has shown a link between real-time CGM usage, such as Dexcom ONE+, and improved management of the condition. The study showed that by bringing awareness to the impact of food and exercise choices on an individual's glucose levels, people became more motivated to continue making positive choices, likely leading to significant glycaemic benefits2.

The Dexcom State of Type 2 report reveals that people trying to manage their Type 2 diabetes face significant impacts on all areas of their lives including, and perhaps particularly, their mental health, says Karen Baxter (NYSE:BAX), Vice President, Northern Europe, South Africa, Israel, and Malta at Dexcom. We're proud to have developed a sensor that addresses the unmet needs of the Type 2 community. Feedback from users and healthcare professionals already using Dexcom ONE+ indicates that the sensor is easy to use and motivational, as it provides a clearer understanding of how food and exercise choices affect glucose levels. Seeing real-time feedback can help alleviate the frustration many people, especially those with Type 2 diabetes, experience in understanding and managing their condition.

About Dexcom ONE+

Dexcom ONE+ incorporates 25 years of Dexcom's research into real-time CGM and the unique needs of different diabetes communities. Developed based on feedback from consumers and healthcare professionals from the previous generation Dexcom ONE sensor the result is a more flexible and easier-,4, to use CGM system, better suited to the needs of those managing Type 2 diabetes, whilst also improving the sensor experience for those living with Type 1.

For people managing diabetes using fingerpricks and regularly injecting insulin, their lives can feel overwhelmed by diabetes. Dexcom ONE+ was developed to take away some of this burden, it's easy to get started with and is designed to be easy to live with, even for those with no experience of using a CGM system. Like all Dexcom CGM, Dexcom ONE+ gives a clear picture of what glucose levels are doing in real-time, without painful fingerpricks, therefore making it easier- for people to achieve lasting results §,5,¡¡,7,8. Importantly, for loved ones, Dexcom ONE+ also allows a user to easily share their glucose numbers with up to ten people, offering everyone a little more peace of mind .

Features that set Dexcom ONE+ apart from other CGM systems include multiple possibilities for personalisation and flexibility. Dexcom CGM systems also offer the most discretion, with three wear location options¡ 3,6 and are the only CGM systems to offer a ~delay first high' option3 § §, a customisable feature which allows a user to set a time before which their sensor will not alert them to a ~high' glucose reading, helping to avoid alert fatigue and rebound hypoglycaemia due to over treatment^,9. Furthermore, designed to fit seamlessly into a user's life, Dexcom ONE+ also has the highest waterproof rating when compared to other CGM brands , allowing users to confidently continue using their device while showering or exercising.

Dexcom ONE+ is suitable for people living with both Type 1 and Type 2, is covered for some people on prescription via the NHS and is also available to purchase online. People living with diabetes and caregivers should speak to their doctor about the best options for them.

More on the Dexcom State of Type 2 Report

More than five million people in the UK are living with diabetes "" and 90% of this group have Type 2, according to Diabetes UK. The first-of-its-kind Dexcom State of Type 2 Report was designed to offer insights into the realities of living with the condition.

As the State of Type 2 Report reveals, living with Type 2 diabetes can come with psychological as well as physical challenges, says Dr. Rose Stewart, Consultant Clinical Psychologist and chair of the UK Diabetes Psychology Network. Many people living with Type 2 diabetes feel like they don't understand their condition, and feel like it is beyond their control "" this combination of issues can contribute to more problems managing diabetes and detrimental mental health challenges. Fortunately, with tech advancements, people living with Type 2 can now feel empowered to better understand their condition, feel like they can manage it effectively and live more confidently. Using technology like a CGM paired with health boosting activities "" whether that be exercise, relaxation, enjoying time with loved ones or something else ""can help people confidently tackle type 2 along with the stresses it creates every day.

Notes to Editors

Additional context, findings, and key highlights from the Dexcom State of Type 2 Report include:

Understanding at Diagnosis: Awareness of type 2 diabetes is low prior to diagnosis, with just 10% of patients knowing a lot about type 2 before diagnosis. Once diagnosed, healthcare practitioners find that patients are most concerned with long-term complications (29%), fear of diabetes related health issues (28%) and how much it will impact their day-to-day lives (27%).

Mental Health Challenges: Living with type 2 diabetes takes a toll on mental health. Nearly half (42%) of patients and caregivers surveyed said that living with type 2 has negatively impacted their mental health, or that of the person they care for. Anxiety (61%) and depression (52%) are the most commonly reported effects of living with type 2.

Balancing Nutrition: Patients and caregivers recognise the importance of proper nutrition to manage type 2, with 81% saying they are aware eating healthily would positively affect their diabetes. Still, there's room for education and excitement when it comes to eating, with over a quarter (27%) of patients and caregivers agreeing they don't think they have the right education on food, and 39% saying they find eating after their type 2 diagnosis boring.

Technological Advancements: Technology like CGM makes it easy to manage type 2 diabetes. While only 9% of patients and caregivers fully understand what a CGM system is "" and 70% are unaware it's available on prescription for some people with type 2 "" most know that it will help improve their lives with diabetes: in fact, 40% say being able to see glucose numbers in real time and having access to CGM would have the most positive effect on their type 2 diabetes or that of the person they care for. Additionally, 83% of patients say if their healthcare team offered them a CGM they would try it.

The Future of Type 2 Diabetes: Sixty-two percent of healthcare practitioners expect the number of patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes will increase in the next 10 years "" with 97% anticipating CGM will become standard practice for caring for patients with type 2 diabetes.1

Will Dexcom ONE+ replace the current Dexcom ONE?

Dexcom ONE+ has been developed based on feedback from consumers and healthcare professionals from the previous generation Dexcom ONE sensor. Patients currently using Dexcom ONE will be transitioned once Dexcom ONE+ is available in their area, so they can benefit from this new and improved generation of Dexcom sensor.

Notes to Editors

Additional context, findings, and key highlights from the Dexcom State of Type 2 Report include:

Understanding at Diagnosis: Awareness of type 2 diabetes is low prior to diagnosis, with just 10% of patients knowing a lot about type 2 before diagnosis. Once diagnosed, healthcare practitioners find that patients are most concerned with long-term complications (29%), fear of diabetes related health issues (28%) and how much it will impact their day-to-day lives (27%).

Mental Health Challenges: Living with type 2 diabetes takes a toll on mental health. Nearly half (42%) of patients and caregivers surveyed said that living with type 2 has negatively impacted their mental health, or that of the person they care for. Anxiety (61%) and depression (52%) are the most commonly reported effects of living with type 2.

Balancing Nutrition: Patients and caregivers recognise the importance of proper nutrition to manage type 2, with 81% saying they are aware eating healthily would positively affect their diabetes. Still, there's room for education and excitement when it comes to eating, with over a quarter (27%) of patients and caregivers agreeing they don't think they have the right education on food, and 39% saying they find eating after their type 2 diagnosis boring.

Technological Advancements: Technology like CGM makes it easy to manage type 2 diabetes. While only 9% of patients and caregivers fully understand what a CGM system is - and 70% are unaware it's available on prescription for some people with type 2 - most know that it will help improve their lives with diabetes: in fact, 40% say being able to see glucose numbers in real time and having access to CGM would have the most positive effect on their type 2 diabetes or that of the person they care for. Additionally, 83% of patients say if their healthcare team offered them a CGM they would try it.

The Future of Type 2 Diabetes: Sixty-two percent of healthcare practitioners expect the number of patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes will increase in the next 10 years - with 97% anticipating CGM will become standard practice for caring for patients with type 2 diabetes.

Will Dexcom ONE+ replace the current Dexcom ONE?

Dexcom ONE+ has been developed based on feedback from consumers and healthcare professionals from the previous generation Dexcom ONE sensor. Patients currently using Dexcom ONE will be transitioned once Dexcom ONE+ is available in their area, so they can benefit from this new and improved generation of Dexcom sensor.

The company currently operates in 30 countries including France, Belgium and Germany, working with clients such as RWE, RES, EDF and Boralex.

While SkyVisor's UK operations are currently remote, it said it is considering potential locations for a physical base in the event of future expansion.

""We are thrilled to introduce SkyVisor's advanced drone inspection capabilities to the UK market, where the demand for efficient asset management solutions especially for the offshore wind market is ever-growing,"" said SkyVisor CEO Paul Fontaine.

""The UK's offshore wind turbine market really faces the reality of an aging fleet and there is a crucial need for thorough inspections, especially of the blades, which are essential for turbine performance.""

The group added that it expects to reach €1mn (£855,000) of revenue from UK operations by 2026.

SkyVisor is looking to provide its drone inspection services to both freshly commissioned turbines and ageing ones. In particular, SkyVisor noted that it plans to address under-inspection of turbine blades - a challenge due to the difficulty accessing them.

According to the company, human inspections typically require three to four hours per turbine, while SkyVisor claimed its solution streamlines the process to 18 minutes per turbine. This means a single inspection team can assess up to 18 turbines in a single day, compared to two turbines achievable through human contact methods.

Adapting to the UK's regulatory landscape, SkyVisor has tailored its solutions to comply with local legislation and adhere to industry standards.

The company's expansion coincides with the implementation of more expansive drone legislation effective January 1, 2024, offering a framework that facilitates broader drone usage across various industries, including renewable energy.",energyvoice.com,news,Energy Voice,Michael Behr,0.09019607843137245,453881122,1,https://www.energyvoice.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/05/Capture-decran-2019-01-18-a-19.02.52-6-210ipycb8.jpg,

Statkraft, Europe's largest renewable energy producer, said this month that it was reviewing its annual targets for new renewables capacity, while Portuguese energy company EDP is cutting back its plans, citing high interest rates and lower power prices.

At the same time, Denmark's Ørsted -- the world's largest offshore wind developer -- has slashed its renewable targets for 2030 by more than 10GW, enough to supply potentially millions of homes, after it was forced to abandon two large projects in the US because of rising costs.

""We are seeing continued growth [of renewables], but at a slower pace,"" Birgitte Ringstad Vartdal, chief executive of Statkraft, which is owned by the Norwegian state, told the Financial Times.

Spanish energy giant Iberdrola said in April it would adopt a more ""selective"" approach to renewables and increase its focus on electricity grids. It no longer has an 80GW renewables target for 2030, but highlights its pipeline of 100GW.

Italian utility Enel announced in November that it would cut its investment in renewables, from €17bn between 2023 and 2025 to €12.1bn between 2024 and 2026. However, the company said it planned to continue increasing renewables capacity with partners to reach its target of 73GW by 2026.

""There has been a big reality check around renewables growth,"" said Norman Valentine, head of renewables research at consultancy Wood Mackenzie. ""There's been a huge change in the cost environment.""

The picture is not universal: Germany's RWE significantly increased its renewables target in November last year, from 50GW by 2030 to 65GW.

There is a growing political focus on the need to develop renewables, with countries agreeing at the COP28 climate summit in November to work towards tripling capacity to 11,000GW by 2030.

However, rising interest rates over the past few years have pushed up the costs of financing new projects, creating difficulties for some developers. Raw material costs have also risen, while in some markets, electricity prices have fallen. The often slow process of regulatory approval also creates challenges.

Some companies, including Enel, have said they want to invest more in upgrading electricity networks, which will be vital in the transition from fossil fuel to clean electric power. Iberdrola is planning to spend about 60 per cent of a planned €41bn of investment in the electricity grid.

Ralph Ibendhal, head of Emea energy transition at RBC Capital Markets, noted that high interest rates meant renewables developers had to compete harder for investors.

""A 7-9 per cent return at project level looks less attractive when base rates are 5 per cent,"" he said. ""Many utilities also have opportunities to invest in other areas of their business (such as regulated networks) instead.""

Deepa Venkateswaran, head of utilities at Bernstein, said that companies were investing more in networks in the expectation of improved returns given their importance to the energy transition.

Iberdrola and French utility Engie have also recently cut or delayed targets for producing ""green"" hydrogen -- a potential replacement for fossil fuels in several industries that is heavily dependent on subsidies. Iberdrola said it was ""still waiting for funds to come through"" for projects.

Despite the current challenges, Vartdal at Statkraft said she was confident the economics of projects would improve. Ibendhal, at RBC, agreed.

Another stumble for offshore wind in New York has highlighted shifting sentiment in the offshore wind turbine market.

Last month, New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) chose not to sign offtake agreements with three planned offshore wind projects after designated turbine supplier GE Vernova decided to switch to a smaller turbine.

The 1.4 GW Attentive Energy One (TotalEnergies and Corio Generation), 1.3 GW Community Offshore Wind (RWE and National Grid) and 1.3 GW Excelsior Wind (Vineyard Offshore) projects were all awarded provisional contracts in a competitive auction in October 2023.

GE Vernova decided to switch from its latest 18 MW turbines to a 15.5/16.5 MW platform and this caused ""technical and commercial complexities"" which meant the project could not proceed under the awarded contract terms, a NYSERDA spokesperson said. Most U.S. offshore wind projects set to be built over the next few years plan to install turbines in the 11 to 15 MW range.

The developers declined to comment on their plans for the projects but they have indicated their continued interest in the New York market, NYSERDA said. Last month, New York announced plans for two more offshore wind solicitations this summer and in 2025.

After years of rapid increases in turbine capacities, GE Vernova's decision reflects a trend by western original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) of introducing fewer new turbines and focusing on existing models for longer.

GE Vernova did not give a reason for its turbine switch, but it follows a difficult few years in which volatile costs and delivery challenges have delayed projects and severely dented the revenues of turbine suppliers.

The hunger for larger turbines led to some developers bidding projects based on turbines in early development stages, which can lead to offtake awards that are at higher risk of abandonment by awardees, a spokesperson for Danish turbine supplier Vestas told Reuters Events.

Vestas plans to focus on its 15 MW offshore wind turbine. This size is ""best positioned to enable greater certainty of on-time, successful project delivery,"" the spokesperson said.

Standardisation

Over the past decade, offshore wind developers in Europe and U.S. sought larger turbines to lower the cost of energy per kilowatt hour and win state-backed power contracts in competitive auctions.

The maximum size of new offshore wind turbines has risen from around 8 MW to around 15 MW amid an ""arms race"" among leading OEMs, said Signe Sorensen, Senior Research Analyst for the Americas at Aegir Insights.

CHART: Global average offshore wind turbine capacities

Intense competition squeezed the margins of turbine suppliers, while volatile global costs and logistics issues since the coronavirus pandemic have prompted offshore wind investors, developers and suppliers to reassess project risks.

On the U.S. East Coast, soaring costs and high interest rates prompted multiple cancellation of offshore wind contracts, delaying projects and curbing progress in building out new supply chain facilities.

Under financial pressure, western wind turbine suppliers are producing less turbine variants than Chinese rivals.

Since 2020, western suppliers have announced 29 new variants of onshore and offshore wind turbines, compared with over 426 from China, according to Endri Lico, principal analyst for Global Wind Technology and Supply Chain at Wood Mackenzie.

""The main reason is due to OEMs profitability pressure and their need to simplify their product portfolio,"" Lico told Reuters Events.

Focusing on one model size could lead to reduced manufacturing costs thanks to standardization and industrialization, hence providing western OEMs and their component suppliers with the ""clearest path to return to profitability,"" Lico said.

A focus on more mature existing technology would enable the supply chain to ""reap the quality and cost benefit of consistent volume and an industrialized wind turbine technology over many years,"" the Vestas spokesperson said.

""Designing technology with the current supply chain in mind will result in cost predictability, shorter execution times, and industry scalability,"" the spokesperson said.

Timing risk

Developers look to optimise power generation and in some cases smaller turbines can be more cost-competitive because they can produce more power at slower wind speeds, feature more mature technology, or are more readily available.

Developer Ocean Winds, a 50/50 joint venture owned by EDP Renewables and ENGIE, selects the best turbine size for a given project while also ""considering time to market,"" a company spokesperson said.

CHART: Global offshore wind turbine market share for operating projects (end of 2022)

The pioneering 800 MW Vineyard Wind project in Massachusetts (Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners and Avangrid) is currently installing an earlier turbine model by GE Vernova designed to operate at 14.7 MW. Meanwhile, the 2.6 GW Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project will install 14.7 MW Siemens Gamesa turbines (SGRE) in the next few years while Orsted has chosen the 11 MW Siemens Gamesa models for the 924 MW Sunrise Wind project in New York.

Vestas has received firm orders for 15 MW turbines from projects in Poland, Germany and the Netherlands and has signed conditional agreements to supply the turbine to Equinor's Empire 1 and 2 projects in New York, the company said. Empire Wind 1 is slated to start producing power in 2026 but Empire Wind 2 has yet to secure an offtake agreement.

The standardisation of turbines at existing capacities would reduce the need for new larger vessels or significant upgrades to existing vessels.

A lack of U.S. wind turbine installation vessels remains a significant risk for project developers, exposing companies to global vessel supply markets and workarounds using barges to transport into and out of East Coast ports.

""The cost savings from the larger turbines are partially lost to increased vessel costs,"" Sorensen noted.

Bidding year

A raft of U.S. offshore wind auctions this year will indicate whether developers will be happy to focus on 15 MW turbines in their mid-term growth plans.

Developers including Orsted, Avangrid, Vineyard Offshore, EDP and Engie bid to secure up to 6 GW of new offshore wind capacity in the latest power auctions by three New England states. Together, the East Coast states of New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Maryland plan to tender for around 16 GW of offshore wind power in 2024.

Lico expects GE Vernova, Vestas and Siemens Gamesa to focus on the 14 to 15 MW range until 2029-2030, when they could start launching bigger models.

""They will continue to co-exist with the next-generation turbine for some years (beginning of '30s) until we fully transition to 20 MW [plus],"" he said.

Developers will continue to be tempted by larger turbines and lower costs, and ongoing innovations by Chinese suppliers could spur western suppliers to refocus towards larger units.

Indeed, Siemens Gamesa has announced plans to develop ""the world's largest offshore turbine generator"" and has received funding from the European Union for a prototype model.

""If the competitors keep going bigger, GE Vernova and Vestas may have to as well, no matter their preferences,"" Sorensen said.",energynow.ca,news,Energy News for the Canadian Oil & Gas Industry | EnergyNow.ca,,0.2705882352941176,453727085,1,https://energynow.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Sun-Wind-1200x810-1-1024x691.jpg,eng-9585568

Scotland's green energy revolution is underway and presents an era defining economic opportunity for our country and our people. We know that tackling climate change is an environmental imperative as well as our moral obligation. But with the right approach it can also present perhaps the greatest socioeconomic opportunity of our time. This past week has provided a clear snapshot of how Scotland is right now - transforming to become a renewable energy powerhouse. On Monday the First Minister was in the Highlands to welcome a £100 million investment by the Scottish National Investment Bank and the UK Infrastructure Bank in the Ardersier Port development. The Port is one of the largest regeneration projects in the Highlands for decades and will support fixed and floating offshore wind installations, enabling an estimated 3,000 jobs and providing retraining opportunities. The following day I was pleased to attend the groundbreaking in Nigg for Sumitomo's new high voltage cable manufacturing plant - the only one of its kind in the UK and the Japanese company's first such plant in Europe - which will create around 330 jobs. Thanks to our multi-agency approach to building relationships with Sumitomo we were able to provide £24.5 million of public sector funds to attract this £350 million foreign investment, demonstrating the importance of international partnerships and public and private sector cooperation in achieving our economic ambitions. Like Ardersier Port, the Nigg site is part of the new Inverness and Cromarty Firth Green Freeport, which is already proving attractive to investors and underlining that Scotland is open for business with unique selling points. Hydrogen has the potential to play a significant role in our in future energy mix too, particularly for industry, and this week brought further progress in that field.

But with the right approach it can also present perhaps the greatest socioeconomic opportunity of our time.

This past week has provided a clear snapshot of how Scotland is right now - transforming to become a renewable energy powerhouse.

On Monday the First Minister was in the Highlands to welcome a £100 million investment by the Scottish National Investment Bank and the UK Infrastructure Bank in the Ardersier Port development. The Port is one of the largest regeneration projects in the Highlands for decades and will support fixed and floating offshore wind installations, enabling an estimated 3,000 jobs and providing retraining opportunities.

The following day I was pleased to attend the groundbreaking in Nigg for Sumitomo's new high voltage cable manufacturing plant - the only one of its kind in the UK and the Japanese company's first such plant in Europe - which will create around 330 jobs.

Thanks to our multi-agency approach to building relationships with Sumitomo we were able to provide £24.5 million of public sector funds to attract this £350 million foreign investment, demonstrating the importance of international partnerships and public and private sector cooperation in achieving our economic ambitions.

Like Ardersier Port, the Nigg site is part of the new Inverness and Cromarty Firth Green Freeport, which is already proving attractive to investors and underlining that Scotland is open for business with unique selling points.

Hydrogen has the potential to play a significant role in our in future energy mix too, particularly for industry, and this week brought further progress in that field. Energy company RWE announced plans for hydrogen production within the Grangemouth industrial cluster in collaboration with INEOS and the Scottish Government is committed to supporting these ambitious plans to secure a long-term future for the complex.

More widely, green hydrogen created with renewable electricity offers a significant export opportunity for Scotland, with growing markets in the rest of the UK and Europe. The Scottish Government's Hydrogen Action Plan sets out an ambition for at least 5GW of installed renewable and low-carbon hydrogen production capacity by 2030 and 25GW by 2045. We will shortly be publishing an export plan for hydrogen detailing how this opportunity will be realised.

Our government is determined to create the right conditions for investment that benefits of people and planet. This year we will also produce our Energy Strategy and Just Transition Plan, outlining actions to safeguard Scotland's energy security and further maximise the benefits of a just transition to net zero. In addition there will be a specific just transition plan for Grangemouth.

And our Green Industrial Strategy will prioritise the areas with the most significant economic opportunities for Scotland and provide, with precision and clarity, the opportunity of entering the Scottish market at this incredibly important time.

According to ONS estimates, in 2022 Scotland's net zero economy generated £13 billion in turnover and supported nearly 26,000 full-time equivalent jobs across Scotland. Analysis shows that with the right support the number of low carbon energy production jobs is estimated to rise from 19,000 in 2019 to 77,000 by 2050 as the result of a just energy transition.

We have much work to do and collaboration is essential to achieve our goals. But this week has shown we are building momentum and emphasised once again that reducing emissions and economic growth go hand-in hand.

Enters Into Software Right-of-Use Agreement With Digital Commerce Payments Inc.,"Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - May 17, 2024) - Venzee Technologies Inc. (TSXV: VENZ) (""Venzee""), is pleased to announce that it has entered into a software right-of-use agreement (the ""Agreement"") with Digital Commerce Payments Inc. (""DCP""), an existing consultant of Venzee, dated May 16, 2024.

Subject to the terms and conditions of the Agreement, Venzee will acquire the exclusive right to use certain e-commerce shelf capability software (the ""DCP Software"") developed by DCP for consideration of CDN$4,250,000 (the ""Purchase Price""), payable in cash or common shares (""Shares"") in the capital of Venzee (the ""Consideration"") on the closing date (the ""Transaction"").

Venzee and DCP management are excited to announce the entering into of the Agreement under which Venzee will acquire the DCP Software, as this strategic partnership is expected to materially expand Venzee's current product and service offerings for new and existing customers in order to increase revenue and profit margins. The DCP Software will enhance the scope and management functionality, and broaden the capabilities of Venzee's existing e-commerce software (the ""Venzee Software""), while expanding the total addressable market, as the Venzee Software serves only as a data connector, whereas the DCP Software acts a data connector and inventory management solution. More specifically, the DCP Software, once integrated into Venzee's existing business, is expected to automate the connection of multiple retail channels within a customer organization's ERP system. The DCP Software can be used in multiple geographic locations and has multi-lingual capabilities. The DCP Software also includes features enabling digital shelf capability, including AI-enabled product description recommendations, and such features can return order information from e-commerce platforms to enable customers to achieve a more dynamic experience in understanding the best markets to sell products. This is functionality not currently available under the existing Venzee Software.

It is currently expected that the Purchase Price will be satisfied in Shares at a deemed issue price of CDN$0.22 per Share pursuant to the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange (the ""TSXV""), resulting in the issuance of an aggregate consideration of 19,318,182 Shares (the ""Consideration Shares""). Closing of the Transaction is subject to certain conditions, including receipt of the approval of the TSXV and certain shareholder approvals as more specifically set out below.

Pateno Payments Inc., an affiliate and joint actor of DCP, currently holds CDN$290,000 aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures (""Convertible Debentures"") of Venzee that are convertible into an aggregate of 409,955 units (""Debenture Units"") of Venzee comprised of one Share (each, a ""Debenture Share"") and one Share purchase warrant (each, a ""Debenture Warrant""), with each Debenture Warrant exercisable into a Share for a period of five years from the date of issuance of the Convertible Debentures at a price of $0.80 per Share. As a result of the issuance of Consideration Shares, assuming the conversion of the Convertible Debentures and exercise of the Debenture Warrants and taking account of the current ownership of Shares held by Mr. Jeffrey J. Smith (""Mr. Smith"" and, together with Pateno Payments Inc., the ""Joint Actors""), a principal and joint actor of DCP and a director of Venzee, DCP and its Joint Actors are expected to hold approximately 41.62% of the issued and outstanding Shares on a partially diluted basis following the completion of the Transaction.

Additional details relating to the Transaction and anticipated value of the DCP Software will be set out in the management information circular of Venzee (the ""Circular"") to be mailed to Venzee shareholders in connection with the contemplated annual and special meeting (the ""Meeting"") of shareholders, at which shareholders will be asked to consider and, if thought advisable, approve the Transaction.

Background to the Transaction

On March 23, 2023, Venzee entered into a consulting services agreement with DCP (the ""Consulting Agreement"") pursuant to which DCP was engaged to provide consulting and advisory services to Venzee and currently owes DCP an aggregate of CDN$210,000 of unpaid consulting fees (the ""Unpaid Consulting Fees"") under such agreement. Since the entering into of the Consulting Agreement, DCP has also advanced CDN$450,000 Venzee by way of the Notes (as defined below) in order to fund Venzee's ongoing operations. During the provision of consulting and advisory services by DCP under the Consulting Agreement, Venzee and DCP identified certain weaknesses concerning Venzee's business and concerns with respect to the functionality of the existing Venzee Software. In order to address and rectify these deficiencies, DCP staff and contractors developed the DCP Software, which has attained levels of functionality in testing that the Venzee Software has been unable to achieve to date, as described above.

The independent members of Venzee's board of directors (the ""Board"") engaged RwE Growth Partners Inc. (""RwE"") to prepare and deliver to the Board and the special committee of the Board an opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Transaction and the Consideration (the ""Fairness Opinion""). The Fairness Opinion was based on a variety of factors, including Venzee's debt obligations, Venzee's existing operations, and its view as to the value of the Agreement with the intended commercialization integration into Venzee's intellectual property. As part of the fairness Opinion, RwE calculated the fair value of the Agreement at USD$3,280,000. The Fairness Opinion provides that, as of the date of the Transaction, and based upon and subject to the assumptions, limitations and qualifications stated in such opinion, the Transaction and the Consideration are fair, from a financial point of view, to the Venzee shareholders.

Despite the gender gap slightly narrowing, with women's representation in the sector increasing from 30.9% to 34.1%, there remains work to be done to promote diversity and inclusion.

Women continue to be underrepresented in tech roles across Europe, occupying only 22% of all tech positions. Addressing this gender gap could unlock a GDP increase of up to £514.3 billion ($650.5 billion) by 2027, highlighting the crucial need for gender diversity in technology.

The Women in Tech Panel & Networking Event titled 'From Bytes to Brilliance - Celebrating Women's Impact in Tech' will take place on 23 May.

This panel will be moderated by Germany Chapter Director for the Women in Tech Global Movement, Noha Salama MBA PMP.

The session will feature speakers like IT Lead Service for Core and Data at ING Deutschland, Agathe Engelmann; Deputy Mayor of Frankfurt am Main, Eileen O'Sullivan; Associated Partner and Head of AI at MHP as part of the Porsche Company, Dr. Alexandra Denise Holtschulte; and Minister at the Hessian Ministry for Digitalisation and Innovation, Prof. Dr Kristina Sinemus.

The panel will celebrate the contributions of women in tech, discuss the current landscape, and outline steps to foster a more inclusive industry.

Following the panel discussion, Tech Show Frankfurt has invited attendees to a networking event by ING Deutschland. This event, held within the Cloud Expo Europe & Cloud & Cyber Security Expo VIP Lounge, will be open to those keen to act as champions for women in tech.

Tech Show Frankfurt said this informal gathering aims to provide a valuable opportunity to connect with fellow attendees, share experiences, and build lasting professional relationships.

Both the panel and networking event are visible on the webpage, ensuring attendees can easily find and participate in the sessions of their choice.

Tech Show Frankfurt has also partnered in with Women in DevOps, Women in Big Data and Women in AI to advance the conversation on diversity and inclusion.

The Women in DevOps panel on 23 May will feature prominent voices in the field, including Senior Principal Consultant, Billie Spencer, and Global Ambassador and Marketing Executive, Alfie Rice,

Women in DevOps is a global movement that aims to promote gender equity and close the DevOps gender gap. This session will explore the unique challenges and opportunities for women in DevOps, and how cognitive diversity enhances team performance and innovation.

As a community, Women in DevOps intends to empower and amplify women's voices and all underrepresented groups, inspiring the next generation of DevOps leaders.

On May 22, Co-Lead of the Women in Big Data Munich Chapter, Katerina Andreeva, will lead this insightful presentation titled 'Cognitive Diversity in Data-Driven Organisations'. Andreeva will discuss how diverse perspectives within data teams drive better decision-making and innovation.

The presentation 'AI for power plants: mara tell me what should I do next?' features Co-Founder and Co-Director of Women in Big Data Berlin, Katarzyna Stoltmann, and Agile Project Manager and Coach at RWE Generation SE, Samuel Orlando Franz.

On 23 May, Munich City Lead, Auxane Boch, and Ambassador for Germany, Shannon Kehoe, will conduct an interactive workshop on the ethical considerations in generative AI.

The session will start with an introduction to Ethics in AI, followed by interactive exercises on ethical thinking in GenAI use cases and contexts.

Participants will explore issues of bias and diversity and discuss opportunities for GenAI to foster positive outcomes.

At Tech Show Frankfurt, attendees can also gain insights from Tijen Onaran, Founder of Global Digital Women, whose pioneering work has championed gender equality in the tech landscape.

Joining her will be Stefanie Babka, Global Head of Data Culture at Merck KGaA, whose expertise in fostering data-driven cultures intends to illuminate strategies for organisational transformation.

Participants will have the opportunity to gain perspectives from Product Owner and Platform Engineer at RTL Technology, Nilanjana Saha, and Senior Director of Business Development and Head of AI at VIRTUS Data Centres, Claudia McHugh, both professionals driving innovation in their respective fields.

Tech Show Frankfurt said it was confident these dynamic speakers, along with many others, will inspire

E.ON SE (EONGY) recently announced a dividend of $0.58 per share, payable on 2024-05-28, with the ex-dividend date set for 2024-05-17. As investors look forward to this upcoming payment, the spotlight also shines on the company's dividend history, yield, and growth rates. Using the data from GuruFocus, let's look into E.ON SE's dividend performance and assess its sustainability.

Since completing the transformative deal with RWE in 2019, E.ON SE has two core businesses: energy networks and customer solutions. Its retail supply serves around 47 million customers primarily in Germany, the United Kingdom, Eastern Europe, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Sweden. Its networks business operates in Germany, Sweden, Eastern Europe, and Turkey.

E.ON SE has maintained a consistent dividend payment record since 1998. Dividends are currently distributed on a yearly basis. Below is a chart showing annual Dividends Per Share for tracking historical trends.

As of today, E.ON SE currently has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 3.83% and a 12-month forward dividend yield of 4.04%. This suggests an expectation of increased dividend payments over the next 12 months.

Over the past three years, E.ON SE's annual dividend growth rate was 3.50%. Extended to a five-year horizon, this rate increased to 9.20% per year. And over the past decade, E.ON SE's annual dividends per share growth rate stands at -3.80%.

Based on E.ON SE's dividend yield and five-year growth rate, the 5-year yield on cost of E.ON SE stock as of today is approximately 5.95%.

To assess the sustainability of the dividend, one needs to evaluate the company's payout ratio. The dividend payout ratio provides insights into the portion of earnings the company distributes as dividends. A lower ratio suggests that the company retains a significant part of its earnings, thereby ensuring the availability of funds for future growth and unexpected downturns. As of 2023-12-31, E.ON SE's dividend payout ratio is 0.09.

E.ON SE's profitability rank, offers an understanding of the company's earnings prowess relative to its peers. GuruFocus ranks E.ON SE's profitability 6 out of 10 as of 2023-12-31, suggesting fair profitability. The company has reported net profit in 7 years out of the past 10 years.

To ensure the sustainability of dividends, a company must have robust growth metrics. E.ON SE's growth rank of 6 out of 10 suggests that the company has a fair growth outlook.

Revenue is the lifeblood of any company, and E.ON SE's revenue per share, combined with the 3-year revenue growth rate, indicates a strong revenue model. E.ON SE's revenue has increased by approximately 15.40% per year on average, a rate that outperforms approximately 72.78% of global competitors.

The company's 3-year EPS growth rate showcases its capability to grow its earnings, a critical component for sustaining dividends in the long run. During the past three years, E.ON SE's earnings increased by approximately 143.60% per year on average, a rate that outperforms approximately 98.14% of global competitors.

With a robust dividend history, promising yield projections, and strong growth metrics, E.ON SE appears well-positioned to sustain and potentially increase its dividend payouts. The company's strategic focus on essential energy services, combined with its financial health and growth trajectory, underscores its capacity to provide value to shareholders. For investors seeking dividend growth stocks, E.ON SE presents a compelling case.

Within this framework, the Chief Human Rights Officer (CHRO) is responsible for monitoring human rights risk management as a whole. The respective Human Rights Officers (HROs) are responsible for compliance with human rights due diligence in the subsidiaries. The Human Rights Expert Team is based in the Group Sustainability department at RWE AG. This team is responsible for the further development, management and implementation of the human rights strategy. If necessary,

it supports the specialist departments involved in the operational processes and the subsid- iaries.

Describe how the strategy is integrated into operational processes and procedures.

The complaints procedure includes three channels for reporting human rights or environmental risks or violations to RWE. External persons and interest groups can contact us directly via e-mail (humanrights@rwe.com) or contact an external law firm. If requested, anonymity can be maintained. RWE employees also have the option of submitting complaints via the internal ""Business Keeper Monitoring System"" tool. The human rights experts from the Human Rights Expert Team then process all complaints received.

The Human Rights Expert Team carries out annual and ad hoc risk analyses for the entire Group, including the subsidiaries. With the support of an external provider, a differentiated risk analysis is carried out for the company's own business division and for all direct suppliers in the supply chain.

As a further preventive measure, RWE has introduced a qualification process for potential suppliers in which they are subjected to a review; suppliers undergo a screening focused on ESG, environmental protection, human rights and labour rights and a responsible supply chain. Whether suppliers have to undergo this screening depends on a fixed turnover threshold of 50,000 euros or more.

In a first step, the respective procurement departments carry out the so-called basic checks. This involves a media screening of the relevant suppliers.

Based on the results of the basic checks, an extended check can be triggered. For this pur- pose, the potential suppliers receive predefined questionnaires for self-disclosure, which the employees of the procurement departments evaluate.

Finally, an advanced check can be carried out, which can be triggered by the results of the basic and extended checks, risk analyses or complaints received. An advanced check can also be triggered independently of the results of the extended checks if the supplier has a risk that is identified by the abstract risk analysis (country or sector).

The Advanced Check is the responsibility of RWE AG's Human Rights Expert Team. It is a detailed questionnaire that is specifically tailored to the situation and the supplier to be checked, which is designed to identify environmental and human rights risks. Any gaps identified are recorded in agreement with the supplier in a Human Rights Action Plan, which is intended to close these gaps. To this end, special measures and tasks are defined, the implementation of which is intended to minimise the risks. If the measures adopted do not lead to a satisfactory solution that meets both the legal and RWE's own internal require- ments, further formal reviews or a formal audit process may follow. RWE also reserves the right to reject suppliers or cancel existing contractual relationships..

To ensure that the human rights and environmental due diligence obligations are effective and complied with, RWE has introduced processes to monitor the due diligence obligations.",marketscreener.com,news,Market Screener,,0.1294117647058823,453636302,38,,

RWE and Masdar have awarded Ocean Infinity the contract for 3D Ultra High Resolution seismic geophysical surveys at Dogger Bank South (DBS) West Offshore Wind Farm.

Ocean Infinity will survey the subsea terrain at each of the proposed wind turbine foundation sites for DBS West offshore wind farm.

Surveys at the turbine foundation sites will be undertaken by the vessel Deep Helder (pictured) from early June 2024 and will continue for about 30 days, depending on weather conditions.

Ocean Infinity uses high-definition survey techniques to 'scan' the seafloor and the sub sea bottom, to provide high resolution 3D geological data deep below each proposed wind turbine site.

This data-intense investigation can highlight seafloor changes, map extent, orientation and tilt of sedimentary units as well as boulders, throughout the entire wind turbine foundation.

Colin McAllister, development project manager, DBS offshore wind farms, said: ""These geophysical surveys will deliver detailed data about conditions on and under the surface of the seabed.

""Combining this with geotechnical data we are also collecting from the turbine foundation sites will deliver exceptional levels of detail about the subsea conditions which is invaluable.

""It enables us to identify challenges at the development stage and to put in place appropriate mitigations where required.""

Commercial director at Ocean Infinity, Maxime Even, added: ""This is Ocean Infinity's first 3D Ultra High Resolution Seismic survey project awarded by RWE, which we are very excited about.

""Our mission has always been to enable the planet to thrive, and this project is another step in helping us on that journey.

""We are being given the opportunity to continue our support in the growing offshore renewables sector, contributing to the overall global energy transition. This has always been our goal and is a huge win for us.""

DBS comprises two separate sites, DBS East and DBS West located on Dogger Bank, a shallow area of the North Sea over 100km off the North East coast of England.

Both DBS project developments are being led by RWE who will deliver project development, construction, and operations on behalf of the partners RWE and Masdar.

Based on an estimated capacity of 3GW, once fully operational, the DBS projects could be capable of generating enough electricity to meet the average annual domestic energy needs of around three million typical UK homes.

The next development milestone for the projects will be the submission of an application for a Development Consent Order, expected to be during the second quarter of 2024.

The first things all of us wanted to do as soon as we discovered we could stand up and walk. Track and Field kids - a bit older - are finding Ukiah High School's stadium and all-weather track a beautiful place to practice these timeless skills. The UHS Wildcat Girls and Boys teams shone this spring in North Bay League competition, with some qualifying for post-league season championship meets. This weekend, senior Arlena Franco and juniors Savannah Nelsen and Nicole Muniz will represent Ukiah in the prestigious Meet of Champions (MOC) in Dublin, Contra Costa County. To qualify, Nelsen won both her events (discus, 113' 4''; shot put 34' 8'') in the Redwood Empire (RWE) meet at Santa Rosa JC's Bailey Field. Muniz placed 3rd in long jump (16' ""3"") and 10th in triple jump (33' 2''), Franco 6th in shot (32' 3''). Their marks are all PR's (personal records). They'll compete for top places to qualify for the State Championships in Clovis.

By virtue of their high places, the Ukiah High School Girls Team placed 6th in the entire Redwood Empire meet! They were 5th in the North Bay League.

Twelve other Varsity Wildcat girls and boys won spots in the Redwood meet by their performances in the North Bay League (NBL) Championships at Santa Rosa HS, several finishing just shy of 6 top RWE places to advance to MOC. Junior Jackson Giglio (that's Gee-lee-oh) raced to 10th in 400 meters; soph Cheveyo Minz-Kammer PR'd at 5'10"" in high jump, tied for 8th; senior Jack Rahn braved afternoon heat and a very talented field to place 12th in the 3200M (2 miles) in 10:12. In the 110M high hurdles, junior Parker Mitchell (11th, 17.13), soph Caelen Brown (13th, 17.63), and junior Andrew McNiel (14th, 17.78), showed their potential. McNiel PR'd in 300M hurdles in 45.18 for 13th.

A rare achievement was freshwoman Lucy Lunceford's PR for 19th in the very fast 100M dash, against mostly upper class girls. She - and most of Ukiah's top athletes - will return next year and beyond.

In the tough 4 X 400meter relay at Redwood, seniors Eva Bailey and Josie Bogner teamed with juniors Ashley Reed and Nicole Muniz for 15th at 4:35.59. The boys' 4 X 4 team of Kobi Hasunuma, Oscar Ruiz, Giglio, and Minz-Kammer - all underclassmen - were 20th at 3:51.59, though slowed by an opponent's interference. Oscar also placed 11th in NBL at 1600M in 4:52.

Worthy of note are the Wildcat Junior Varsity girls and boys, who completed their seasons successfully at the North Bay League meet May 2. Several shone with future promise. In events requiring great bravery: soph Estelle Coltrain (2nd pole vault, 7th long jump); frosh Josette Mealey (4th pole vault), frosh Katia Sandoval and soph Valerie Trouette, 4th & 8th in 110M hurdles; Troutte 5th in the gruelling 300M hurdles; Sandoval and Coltrain 6th & 7th in long jump. JV's Bennett Gaylord and Jessica Kraemer competed through the season in shot and disc, though shy of NBL contention. Our JV girls team was 3rd in NBL!

On the JV boys side, versatile freshman Chris Thompson won the NBL discus and 200M race, also 3rd at 100M. Sophs Gavin Falleri (1st in 3200, 5th in 1600) and Grayson Rosenberg (2nd in pole vault and triple jump) stood out. Carlos Orozco made great strides forward in the 400M with a close 2nd place. Of special note is first year runner Zavion Estrada, taking on all 3 distance races at NBL, 800, 1600, and 3200M, finishing all in PR times. Freshmen Kaden Shaw and Ari Walker have been strong competitors in running, jumping and throwing events this year, and have bright futures in T&F, as do Colton Gaylord and Blake Christensen - also frosh - JV regulars in the throws.

On May 10, hundreds of family members cheered from the shady west bleachers as our elementary school athletes in their cool team shirts played excitedly all over the track and field. On May 8 & 15, the local middle school teams put on similar shows with plenty of spectators. On May 29, the biggest middle school meet, including teams from other area towns, will compete, starting 4 p.m. It's a great place to be, an answer to the question, ""where do the children play?""

Few genes seem to be associated with the progression to EoE with upregulation of a previously attenuated Th2 signal. These genes, including GATA3 as a Th1/Th2 switch regulator, may represent potential therapeutic targets in early disease pathogenesis.

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the esophagus that is defined clinically by symptoms of esophageal dysfunction and histologically by an eosinophil-predominant infiltration of the esophageal squamous epithelium with at least 15 eosinophils in at least one high-power field (hpf) (). EoE is considered an antigen-mediated allergic inflammation, where food-borne antigens trigger a Th2 response with upregulation of cytokines such as interleukine (IL-5) and IL-13, consecutively promoting eosinophil infiltration to the site of inflammation (). Long-term follow-up has revealed EoE's potential to progress to a fibrostenotic phenotype with development of esophageal strictures (). Swallowed topical corticosteroids are the most widely used therapeutic modality with proven efficacy in both short- and long-term management (). In addition, the anti-IL4/IL13 antibody dupilumab has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) (). However, alternative treatment options are needed, given the limited antifibrotic efficacy of available therapies and a loss of response over time ().

EoE variants have been recently characterized as conditions with symptoms of esophageal dysfunction resembling EoE, but either absence of esophageal eosinophilia or eosinophil counts not fulfilling the diagnostic cutoff of 15 eos/hpf (). They seem to be a heterogenous group, including at least 3 different subtypes, namely EoE-like esophagitis, lymphocytic esophagitis, and nonspecific esophagitis. Mechanistically, EoE variants stand out for epithelial barrier dysfunction, absence of an EoE-typical Th2 response, but molecular fingerprints that partially overlap with classical EoE (). They can therefore be considered as noneosinophilic subgroups of a larger disease spectrum, where EoE represents the most extreme phenotype. However, it remains unknown whether or not one or several EoE variants can progress to EoE over time. In addition, disease course and severity of these variants with regards to their stricturing potential -- a common feature of classic EoE -- have yet to be determined. As the role of eosinophils as the main driver of symptoms and inflammation in EoE has been questioned lately (), follow-up analyses of EoE variants (with progression to EoE over time) will also provide potential insights in the (noneosinophil) pathogenesis of EoE paving the road for alternative therapeutic agents.

In this article, we present a multicenter long-term cohort study of patients with EoE variants with clinical, histological, and molecular data, elucidating the potential to progress to EoE over time with a particular focus on modulator genes that are upregulated in this progression process.

In this multicenter study including patients from 6 EoE referral centers, we analyzed clinical, histological, and molecular follow-up data of patients with EoE variants. The study was approved by the local ethics committee of each of the participating centers.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria for this cohort have been previously published (). Briefly, patients were included if they had typical EoE symptoms, but proven absence of esophageal eosinophilia of 15 eosinophils (eos) per hpf, despite no antieosinophil treatment with the availability of at least 6 esophageal biopsies following a structured biopsy protocol (3 from the distal and 3 from the proximal esophagus). Patients were excluded for other diseases associated with eosinophil infiltration of the esophageal mucosa such as gastroesophageal reflux disease and eosinophilic gastroenteritis. Gastroesophageal reflux disease was excluded as previously described (). The structured data collection was performed by means of a standardized spreadsheet. All data were anonymized. For details, see Supplementary Material, https://links.lww.com/CTG/B87.

All 8 individual components of the validated EoE histological scoring system, in addition to peak eosinophil count per hpf, as well as lymphocytic infiltration and presence of acute inflammatory cells were assessed by 2 EoE reference pathologists (M.C. and C.B.) at baseline and during follow-up visits (). As previously published, EoE variants were classified into EoE-like esophagitis (<15 eos/hpf, but otherwise typical histological EoE features), lymphocytic esophagitis (lymphocyte-predominant inflammation with high numbers of intraepithelial lymphocytes (≥30 per hpf) and typical peripapillar infiltration), and nonspecific esophagitis (histological infiltration of lymphocytes or neutrophils not fulfilling the numerical and distributional criteria of lymphocytic esophagitis) ().

Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded esophageal biopsies were shipped at room temperature according to a material transfer agreement from each participating center to the Swiss EoE Clinic. The samples were sectioned, and slides were subsequently processed for immunofluorescent analyses as previously described (). For details on determined proteins and analyses, see Supplementary Material, https://links.lww.com/CTG/B87.

Esophageal biopsies from a subset of patients with EoE-like esophagitis and progression to EoE in the follow-up (5 patients, time point 0 = diagnosis of EoE-like esophagitis and time point 1 = diagnosis of EoE) were processed for next-generation RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and RNA-seq libraries were prepared as previously described (). Active EoE (n = 10) and esophagus-healthy individuals (n = 7) already included in our cohort and analyzed by RNA-seq in a previous publication () served as controls (see Supplementary Material, https://links.lww.com/CTG/B87).

For statistical analyses, GraphPad Prism software version 8.3.0 and R version 3.6.0 were used. Quantitative data are shown as mean with SD or median with interquartile range (IQR). Categorical data were compared using χ test or Fisher exact test; quantitative data were compared using 2-samples t-test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test (depending on whether or not data was normally distributed); for time to progression to EoE during follow-up, Kaplan-Meier curves were computed. For analysis of immunostaining data (at baseline and at follow-up), one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to analyze quantitative data for statistical significance. For the purpose of this study, P value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

From our previous characterization study including 69 patients with EoE variants, we identified a total of 54 with available follow-up data (Figure 1a). Median age at diagnosis of these patients was 47.9 years (IQR 31.9-63.0) with a median duration of symptoms of 26.5 months (IQR 11.9-74.9). Approximately 28 were females (51.9%), and 50 subjects were of White descent (92.6%). Data from 3 visits per patient (IQR 3-4, range 2-10) were available for analysis with a median follow-up time of 17.3 months (IQR 6.6-33.4, range 0.4-89.6). Based on H&E histology at baseline (reviewed by an expert EoE pathologist), 29 patients were diagnosed with EoE-like esophagitis (53.7%), 7 with lymphocytic esophagitis (13.0%), and 18 with nonspecific esophagitis (33.3%). For details, see Table 1.

Endoscopic dilation was needed in 16 subjects: in 7 patients with EoE-like esophagitis (24.1%), in 5 with lymphocytic esophagitis (71.4%), and in 4 subjects with nonspecific esophagitis (22.2%). For details, see Table 1.

In 8 patients, EoE developed during the follow-up period with a median time to EoE of 14 months (IQR 3.6-37.6). Such progression was only seen in patients with EoE-like esophagitis at baseline: Progression to EoE increased over time, from 17.6% at 1 year, to 32.0% at 3 years, and 62.2% at 6 years (Figure 1b), with a considerable and significant increase in peak eosinophil counts in these patients (median fold increase of 6.9, see Supplementary Figure 1, https://links.lww.com/CTG/B87). Seven of these patients had detectable, but little esophageal eosinophil infiltration at baseline endoscopy visit (median 4 eos/hpf, IQR 3.5-8.6, range 3-11), whereas one patient neither had epithelial nor subepithelial eosinophil infiltration (0 eos/hpf). None of the patients had significant subepithelial eosinophil levels. Compared with the 21 EoE-like esophagitis patients without progression, peak eosinophil counts at baseline were significantly higher (median 3.9 vs 1.0 eos/hpf, P = 0.027). However, there was no such difference when looking at histological disease activity beyond eosinophilia (EoE histological scoring system stage and grade), presence of basal zone hyperplasia, or endoscopic disease activity graded by the EREFS score. In addition, there were no differences between the 2 groups with regards to family history for EoE, presence of allergies, need for endoscopic dilation, response to steroid treatment, and diagnostic confirmation time. There was a trend toward a lower proportion of females (12.5% vs 47.6%, P = 0.081) and a lower age at diagnosis in patients with progression to EoE over time (33.5 vs 47.9 years, P = 0.093). For details about the comparison of EoE-like esophagitis patients with vs without progression to EoE, see Table 2.

Transition from one EoE variant (baseline) to another variant (during follow-up) was seen in 19 patients (35.2%, Figure 1c) based on conventional H&E histology: 6 patients from EoE-like to nonspecific esophagitis; 6 patients from nonspecific to EoE-like esophagitis; 3 from EoE-like to lymphocytic esophagitis; 2 from lymphocytic to EoE-like esophagitis; 1 from lymphocytic to nonspecific esophagitis; and 1 from nonspecific esophagitis to lymphocytic esophagitis. Six of these 19 patients with transition from one variant to another showed further transition or progression with one patient transitioning from EoE-like to nonspecific esophagitis and then EoE (Figure 1d).

In 5 of the 8 patients who progressed from an EoE variant (EoE-like esophagitis at baseline) to EoE at follow-up, tissue for sequential RNA-seq analyses (time point 0 diagnosis of EoE-like esophagitis = baseline; time point 1 diagnosis of EoE = follow-up) was available. For details on these patients, see Supplementary Table 1 (Supplementary Material, https://links.lww.com/CTG/B87). RNA-seq analyses revealed upregulation of the same top pathways (at the time of EoE diagnosis during follow-up visit) as in classical EoE (compared with esophagus healthy controls) with the typical involvement of the Th2 pathway and upregulation of IL5, IL13 or the eotaxin 3 receptor CCR3 (Figure 2a). For a heatmap, see Figure 2b. Indeed, comparative analyses demonstrated strongly overlapping pathways and upstream regulators in these newly developed EoE cases (follow-up visit) compared with classic EoE (see Supplementary Figure 2a, Supplementary Material, https://links.lww.com/CTG/B87). Nonetheless, when comparing them directly with classical EoE (without previous EoE-like esophagitis), a total of 173 differentially expressed genes were identified (see Supplementary Table 2, https://links.lww.com/CTG/B88). For a volcano plot, see Supplementary Figure 2b (Supplementary Material, https://links.lww.com/CTG/B87).

Surprisingly, only 7 genes were significantly upregulated during progression from EoE-like esophagitis to EoE (baseline vs follow-up visit, Figure 2c), the most upregulated of them were associated with eosinophil recruitment to the esophageal mucosa such as TSG6, ALOX15, and SLC26A4. Looking at disease pathways, mRNA profiles at the time of EoE-like esophagitis diagnosis (baseline) and at the time of progression to EoE (follow-up visit) showed considerable overlaps with one exception: an attenuated Th2 signal at baseline, with activation during progression to EoE (Figure 2d).

To confirm the involvement of above-mentioned proteins in the progression from EoE-like esophagitis (baseline) to EoE (at follow-up visit), we performed immunostaining for 2 of the top differentially expressed genes (TSG6 and ALOX15) and EPX as positive control. Immunostaining for ALOX15 and TSG6 showed increases in their protein expression during progression from baseline to EoE (follow-up visit), comparable with patients with already established EoE, and paralleling an increase in EPX (Figure 3). Two patients with considerable EPX expression at baseline (which was not appreciated as eosinophil infiltration on conventional histology) were excluded from analysis. Given significant upregulation of a previously attenuated Th2 pathway, we next looked into known switch regulators for Th1 and Th2 lineages such as GATA3 and T-bet. Immunostaining revealed a significantly increased number of both GATA3- and T-bet-positive cells during progression from EoE-like esophagitis (baseline) to EoE (follow-up visit), similarly to what is seen in classical EoE. A significant increase in the GATA3 to T-bet ratio (4.7-fold) during progression from EoE-like esophagitis (baseline) to EoE (follow-up visit) potentially indicates a switch from a Th1- to a Th2-dominant inflammatory response associated with this progression and EoE in general (Figure 4).

EoE variants have been recently identified as non-EoE subgroups of a larger disease spectrum (). Still, as of yet, it remains unknown whether one or several EoE variants can progress to EoE over time and whether or not these variants can present features of fibrotic disease. Based on our analysis, including follow-up data of 54 patients over 17 months, our main findings are (i) endoscopic dilation for stricturing disease is frequently needed in EoE variants; (ii) transition from one variant to another variant or progression to EoE occurs in 50% of patients; and (iii) few genes appear to be associated with progression to EoE with upregulation of a previously attenuated Th2 signal.

Endoscopic dilation is needed in almost a third of the patients diagnosed with an EoE variant, particularly patients with lymphocytic esophagitis. However, both EoE-like esophagitis and even nonspecific esophagitis patients show a stricturing potential. This finding corresponds with our previous results, indicating a severe clinical presentation with frequent bolus impactions in EoE variants, some patients even necessitating endoscopic bolus removal (). It also goes in line with previous RNA-seq data indicating involvement of profibrotic pathways (). Thus, follow-up endoscopies in patients with EoE variants should be considered, particularly those with worsening symptoms, to assess for and treat esophageal strictures. Given the limited follow-up, the need for repetitive dilation could not be assessed in the current study. Thus, it remains unclear whether underlying disease needs to be treated as in EoE or whether (one-time) dilation could be sufficient. However, data on transition and progression indicate ongoing underlying disease activity. Longer follow-up will finally help to answer this open question. In addition, it remains to be determined whether or not treatment with steroids could interfere with the stricturing potential. At least, its positive impact on clinical disease severity has been suggested in our previous publication (). Nonetheless, data on steroids' antifibrotic efficacy in the treatment of EoE have been limited ().

Transition from one variant to another variant occurs frequently in the follow-up of EoE variant patients. Indeed, more than a third of the studied patients showed a change in histological features over time (baseline vs follow-up visit). This is particularly noteworthy because the histological presentation based on H&E coloration was distinct at baseline and diagnostic criteria for each variant mutually exclusive. Thus, sampling error or difference in (histological) disease presentation at various levels in the esophagus does not appear to be the case. The assessment of at least 6 biopsies (3 from the distal and 3 from the proximal esophagus) further limits such bias. Furthermore, it is intriguing to see that even lymphocytic esophagitis patients can change its histological presentation over time as lymphocytic esophagitis has been considered an entity distinct from EoE in the past and also shows some considerable differences with regards to age, atopic comorbidities, and family history (). Our data, by contrast, suggest a disease spectrum, including all the 3 variants EoE-like esophagitis, nonspecific esophagitis, and lymphocytic esophagitis. Of note, 6 patients (thus one-third of all patients with transitioning disease) showed more than 1 transition over time, suggesting a considerable flux in disease presentation. Nevertheless, these observations based on H&E histology need further confirmation by sequential RNA-seq data.

Progression to EoE was seen in 8 patients over time. All of them presented with EoE-like esophagitis at baseline (with one of them showing transition to nonspecific esophagitis before progressing to EoE). Probability of progression to EoE increased in EoE-like esophagitis patients over time, with 17.6% at 1 year, to 32.0% at 3 years, and 62.2% at 6 years. These data indicate that longer follow-up could actually result in a higher detection of EoE. Such longer follow-up with a larger sample size will eventually answer the question whether all these patients end up with being diagnosed with EoE and if not, which baseline factors are predictive for such progression. It would be particularly intriguing to look at deeper tissue because subepithelial changes might be responsible for some inflammatory changes not captured within the esophageal mucosa. However, the few patients with subepithelial tissue available in this study did not reveal any important findings. Deeper tissue might lead to clearer insights, but subepithelial tissue is unfortunately not captured very often with a standard biopsy forceps (). The current analysis highlights the presence of a potential disease spectrum, where EoE only represents the most prominent and severe phenotype. Nevertheless, although one patient transitioned to nonspecific esophagitis before the progression to EoE, no such progression was seen in patients with lymphocytic esophagitis. Longer follow-up data will finally answer the question whether or not such progression can occur over time in this subgroup. However, given the possibility of lymphocytic esophagitis transitioning to the 2 other variants, a progression to EoE at least has to be considered warranting close follow-up with repetitive biopsies in these patients.

Intriguingly, longitudinal RNA-seq data revealed that only few genes are upregulated during progression from EoE-like esophagitis (baseline) to EoE (follow-up visit). Both eosinophil- and non-eosinophil-associated genes have been identified. Tertiary analyses further revealed the upregulation of a previously attenuated Th2 pathway. Immunostaining confirmed the involvement of the top upregulated genes (TSG6 and ALOX15) during progression to EoE and also their involvement in classical EoE (without previously detected EoE-like esophagitis). In addition, the switch from a Th1 to a Th2 inflammatory response has been confirmed by an increase of the GATA3 to T-bet ratio. ALOX15 and TSG6 (also known as TNFAIP6) have been previously shown to be increased in active EoE- and IL-13-treated epithelial cells, without any further experimental exploration (). Thus, their exact role in EoE remains elusive, but both genes have been previously implicated in other atopic diseases (). In-depth exploration of these genes and GATA3 as a key Th1/Th2 switch regulator should be considered, particularly given their potential role in early disease pathophysiology. However, further studies are needed to prove whether or not the newly developed EoE is exactly the same as classical EoE without previous EoE-like disease. Although our data indicate progression to EoE, these patients still show some features of persisting EoE-like esophagitis (such as a Th1 signal), which, however, might be lost over time.

Our study has several strengths and limitations. It is the first follow-up study of patients with EoE variants, further supporting the concept of a disease spectrum. The inclusion of sequential RNA-seq data and immunofluorescence experiments confirming the RNA-seq results make our data more robust. Limitations of our cohort have been previously discussed in detail (). One major limitation is the short follow-up of only 17 months in the median. For some patients, only 1 or 2 follow-up visits were available. Therefore, it remains unclear whether or not some patients may have progressed to EoE after a longer follow-up time, particularly patients diagnosed with lymphocytic esophagitis. Longitudinal RNA-seq was only performed in patients with progression to EoE; thus, no data are available for patients transitioning form one variant to another variant. However, in-depth description of these variants including RNA-seq has been previously published by our group (). We cannot exclude the possibility of a referral bias, particularly in light of a relatively high percentage of patients with a positive family history. Thus, our findings are not applicable 1:1 to nonexpert centers. It is difficult to know whether some of our patients actually had burned-out EoE at baseline. However, historical data on long-term follow-up of patients with long-lasting untreated EoE show ongoing inflammation together with the development of fibrosis; thus, burned-out EoE -- although theoretically logical -- has not been described in the literature (). Although the patients included in this study showed increased EoE Endoscopic Reference Score (EREFS) scores, only 3 patients had moderate rings and 3 had severe rings. Thus, the presence of burned-out (fibrotic-only) disease at baseline is unlikely, and if it occurs, it would have been observed in no more than 11%. Finally, as treatment was not assessed in a systematic manner in the follow-up, possible confounding of our results cannot be excluded. However, a chart re-review of our EoE-like esophagitis patients with progression did not reveal a lower percentage of patients receiving proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) or steroid treatment, compared with nonprogressors. In fact, the opposite was seen (75% vs 48%; P = 0.2378). Thus, nonprogression was not biased by an eventual overtreatment with swallowed topical corticosteroids (STC). On the other side, one could assume that at least some of the patients who were treated with STC, but did not progress to EoE, might have in the absence of steroid treatment.

In conclusion, frequent transition from one EoE variant to another and progression to classic EoE over time suggest the presence of a disease spectrum. Disease monitoring can potentially detect such progression to EoE over time. Few genes seem to be associated with such progression to EoE during follow-up with upregulation of a previously attenuated Th2 signal. These genes, including GATA3 as a key Th1/Th2 switch regulator, may represent potential therapeutic targets. Further studies are needed to identify risk factors for progression to EoE over time and to characterize the role of the identified genes in more detail.

In fact, everyone knows that Germany would have to phase out coal completely by 2030 in order to fulfill its commitments to the Paris Climate Agreement. The measures proposed in the coal commission´s report would result in more greenhouse gases being emitted in the electricity sector than allowed under the Paris climate agreement. The energy sector is failing. That is bad and it puts pressure on CO2-intensive sectors such as transportation and buildings. Unfortunately, these sectors seem even harder and more complicated to decarbonize. Germany will not reach its 2020 climate target, this is now postponed to mid 2020.

The Coal Commission made recommendations on how to organize structural change in the coal mining regions in terms of industrial and employment policy. The central theme of the Coal Commission on the policy side was to cushion the impact of structural change.

The prime ministers of the coal states have demanded billions of euros for the structural change and will probably get them. The Coal Commission proposes a law to secure €1.3 billion annually over 20 years, distributed to all four coal mining regions. In addition, €0.7 billion per year are to be made available by the federal government independently of the budget. Together, this amounts to the €40 billion over 20 years that are currently being cited again and again in the media. It is not yet clear which region will get how much. An allocation formula still has to be found. A colorful bouquet of proposals for structural development in the coal mining regions - around 180 pages - was appended to the report. The projects can be broadly categorized in five main areas of action:

The Commission's recommendations include a ""coal-region bonus"" for transport infrastructure projects to speed up their implementation in the four mining regions. In general, the Commission is advocating various fast-track procedures and processes to access, deploy and ensure the effectiveness of financial resources. The Commission recommends in several places in the report that the funds be used for sustainable infrastructure, industries and economic sectors. The extent to which this will succeed - especially as coal-related and energy-intensive industries remain and are to be researched - is a critical question. At first glance, not all proposed projects are low-carbon or ""green"".

1.3 Energy industries and electricity prices

Phasing out coal will cost a thing. Looks like the phase out will be a golden hand shake for coal companies. Operators will be given generous compensation should their plants be mothballed or closed ahead of time. Manufactures may also get a compensation if electricity prices rise as a result of lower supply from comparably inexpensive coal-fired plants. The current relief scheme for these indirect costs will expire in 2020. The government wants to apply to the EU (under state aid rules) for an extension of this compensation. The ""electricity price compensation"" for energy-intensive companies should continue until 2030. The commission also proposes mechanism to keep down electricity prices for private consumers.

1.4 Measures for employees

First and foremost, the decision to set up the Commission for Growth, Structural Change and Employment mandates the creation of a concrete perspective for new, future-oriented jobs in the affected regions.

As security for older employees in lignite mining (aged 58 and over), the Commission recommends an adjustment allowance (Anpassungsgeld, APG) from federal funds to compensate for shortfalls prior to their pensions. There would be a similar provision for employees in hard coal-fired power plants.

In addition to the adjustment allowance, the social security of employees will necessitate numerous collective agreements (securing qualified employment through placement, compensation for wage losses, training and further education, etc.).

There is uncertainty as to whether the companies will be able to bear these costs: ""The trade unions must therefore be involved in the negotiations with the companies and, in addition to possible property compensation, a component for ensure social equality must be provided. If a negotiated solution is not reached, alternative solutions will be needed with regard to the participation of companies and the public sector in securing social equality."" (p. 115)

1.5 Uncertainty for villages and ""Hambi""

It is uncertain if more villages will be devastated because there is lignite underground. Uncertainity remains for example in Keyenberg, Kuckum, Berverath, Upper and Unterwestrich around the Garzweiler open pit as well as for Proschim (Lausitz) and Pödelwitz (Central Germany). Investigations by the German Institute for Economic Research (DIW) show that no further villages would have to be dredged because there are sufficient amounts of coal in the already approved open-pit fields.

The preservation of Hambach Forest was and remains symbolically important for the (participating) environmental associations. Page 71 of the report states that the Commission considers the preservation of Hambach Forest to be ""desirable"". A crystal-clear commitment to preserving Hambach Forest would have been welcome from the perspective of the environmental associations, and even more so from the point of view of residents and climate activists.

The opencast mining and power plant operators should be pleased to get planning security and a lot of money for shutting down - a golden parachute this generous is never provided in the normal course of business, only by the government. Selling coal-fired power has been mostly a loss-making business in recent years. If RWE and other operators are now claiming technical and financial difficulties with the decommissioning, this may have to do with the fact that they want to drive up compensation costs. It is noteworthy that the RWE share price has been on the upswing over the last few days with a ""buy"" recommendation. In several interviews, the head of the IG BCE mining union seemed quite satisfied. Benefits for the employees will include ""adjustment allowances"" and compensation for pension losses. ""After tough negotiations, we have an outcome that we can work with,"" was the shared verdict of German Trade Union Confederation (DGB) board member Stefan Körzell, German services trade union (ver.di) board member Andreas Scheidt and IG BCE chairman Michael Vassiliadis after the Commission's late-night concluding round.

Criticism is being leveled above all by those who seek to shut down the mining and burning of coal as quickly as possible to protect people and villages at the edges of opencast mines, and by those who want to protect homelands, environment and climate in Germany and worldwide. The exit date 2038 is clearly too late for the climate. From the point of view of the involved environmental associations (BUND, DNR and Greenpeace), the adopted plan is a minimum consensus that demands a great deal from them. In a joint press release, BUND, DNR and Greenpeace state:

""It would actually take considerably more, above all for the path to 2030. This is the entry into the exit, not more but also not less. The bottom line is that the door to Germany's phase-out of coal has finally been opened, the first coal-fired power plants will soon be taken off the grid, and Hambach Forest will be preserved.""

With the exception of a minority vote against the symbolically important exit date, the environmental associations accept the report. They are hoping for a revision clause to allow for an earlier phase-out - a review in 2032 is supposed to determine whether the date can be brought forward to 2035. As expected, environmental associations, organizations and actors who were not involved in the Commission are wording their criticisms more sharply. A few examples:

Campact: ""The decision of the Coal Commission does not create the peace we had hoped for, but instead continues to fuel the conflict over coal. Leaving coal-fired power plants on the grid for another 19 years, phasing them out far too slowly, is far too little for the climate. This will meet the resistance of the climate movement.""

Oxfam: Coal Commission sacrifices climate targets: The Coal Commission has de facto abandoned Germany's climate targets for 2020. It accepts that Germany will fail to meet its commitments to international climate protection.""

Ende Gelände: ""What the Coal Commission is proposing is not a consensus. This puts the 1.5°C target out of reach. The corporations are getting money for nothing, and the future of Hambi (Hambach Forest) and the villages remains unclear. Another 20 years of coal-fired power is 20 years too many. We will fight this! In Hambi, we made the impossible possible. The protests yesterday were only the beginning, and we'll be back next Friday.""

Hannelore Wodtke, town councilor of Welzow, was the only participant who ended up voting against the overall report - in particular because the Commission left the fate of the village of Proschim uncertain:

""The rescue of the village of Proschim from resettlement has been overdue for years. Under pressure from the state governments of Saxony and Brandenburg, the Coal Commission leaves the affected people continuing to face an uncertain future. Apparently, Kretschmer and Woidke still let (Czech energy group) EPH dictate their policies.""

The Commission's proposal will now be considered by the German government, which will need to agree how to implement their recommendations. The decisive question will be what policymakers do with the Commission's recommendations.

For the affected villages, the situation remains uncertain and the question of whether they will need to be relocated may only be resolved in the mid-2020s.

4.1 January 2016: recommendation for the establishment of a round table

In January 2016, Agora Energiewende, an energy think tank, published Elf Eckpunkte für einen Kohlekonsens (""Eleven central components for a coal consensus""). The first recommendation for action: The German federal government should promptly convene a ""national coal consensus round table"" in order to ""reach findings with broad political and social support already in 2016, to ensure ... early planning security for all involved parties regarding the impending decarbonization."" The coal consensus should also include a legally regulated phase-out of coal to start in 2018 and be complete by 2040 at the latest, no new construction of lignite or hard coal-fired power plants, no new opencast mines, the establishment of a structural change fund for the affected regions and electricity price compensation for energy-intensive industry should the exchange electricity price rise unexpectedly.

4.2 June 2018: the Coal Commission is set up

In June 2018, the federal government moved to set up the Commission for Growth, Structural Change and Employment (Kommission Wachstum, Strukturwandel und Beschäftigung, KWSB). In principle, this is the round table with representatives of environmental associations, trade unions, business and energy associations, the affected regions and scientists that Agora Energiewende had advocated two and a half years earlier.

The Coal Commission was given a mandate to develop a plan to gradually reduce and shut down coal-fired power generation, including a completion date and the necessary accompanying legal, economic, social, renaturalization and structural measures. The plan was to be completed prior to the UN climate conference in Katowice in early December 2018. This timing was intentional: Federal Environment Minister Svenja Schulze was to take the international stage to announce that Germany, the world champion lignite user, is setting a rational course to address climate change. Everyone knows that Germany has been diligently expanding renewable energies and shutting down dangerous nuclear energy. However, everyone also knows that coal is largely responsible for Germany's failure to meet its climate targets and the stagnation of its transition to renewable energy.

4.3 November 2018: the final report is delayed

Contrary to what she had hoped, the German Environment Minister went to Poland without a plan to phase out coal. The reasons for the delay, it is universally understood, were interventions by the premiers of Brandenburg, Saxony and Saxony-Anhalt. They had insisted that the report must contain more extensive and detailed structural aid for Lusatia and central Germany. In the argumentation, climate protection, economic development and social participation were positioned as opposing interests. Brandenburg Premier Woidke was not alone in linking possible state election successes of the right-wing populist AfD party to an early phase-out of coal. This is understandable on one hand - at least from the point of view of the premiers, who do not want to lose to the AfD in the upcoming state elections. On the other hand, it is also an argument that plays into the hands of populists, distracts from the premiers' own failures and ignores the citizens who live on the edge of opencast mines, whose health is routinely impacted by power plants, and whose homeland is being eaten away by the excavators.

4.4 January 2019: the Coal Commission presents its final report

The Coal Commission published its report in January 2019 after a delay of about two months. The fact that the Commission is opening the door to the phase-out of coal and proposes mandating it by law was generally welcomed by all parties and the media.",boell.de,news,Heinrich-Böll-Stiftung,,-0.0980392156862745,453581679,5,https://www.boell.de/sites/default/files/styles/social_media/public/uploads/2019/02/ergebnisse_und_einschaetzung_zur_kohlekommission.jpg.jpeg?itok=9aWKCeIF,

He's jumping right into the renewable energy field after graduation, working as a wind turbine technician for one of the leading onshore wind companies.

He's moving from Rochester to get closer to his job at RWE Renewables, which starts on June 3. He'll be working at Munnsville Wind Farm, a 34.5 MW project located in Madison County. RWE constructs, owns and operates some of the highest-performing wind, solar and energy storage projects in the United States.

Ivers was among the graduates who received their academic degrees during SUNY Morrisville's commencement ceremony on May 11. He graduated with an associate's degree in renewable energy technology.

Cheering grads on were family, friends, and proud faculty and staff. SUNY Morrisville President David Rogers was joined by school deans and members of the college council in presiding over the ceremony, which began with the Syracuse Scottish Pipe Band leading graduates into the formal commencement exercises. The stage was adorned with ferns and flowers grown by students in the college's horticulture program.

Excitement was heightened by graduates' stories -- many sharing careers they already have lined up, and others about furthering their education, like Nickolas Dalton, who earned an associate's degree in individual studies and is coming back to pursue a bachelor's degree in applied psychology.

Ivers specifically sought SUNY Morrisville to pursue a career in onshore wind. He transferred from another college, completing the program in just a year.

In his new position, he'll be performing general maintenance and electrical troubleshooting, among other tasks and ""all things I have done in class. I knew after completing the program, I would be in the job I wanted based on what I learned, skills and real-world experience,"" Ivers said in a news release from the college.

He's not alone.

William Burns graduated with a bachelor's of business administration degree in automotive management. He has a job lined up as a mechanic at Firematic Supply Co., where he will be responsible for repairing and maintaining emergency fire and rescue apparatus.

""SUNY Morrisville played a vital role in obtaining this job by giving me the skills and opportunity to participate as an intern with the company, who then offered me a position upon graduation,"" Burns said.

Aurora Haines is a wildlife specialist with the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Services, in Rensselaer. She graduated from the environmental and natural resources management bachelor's degree program.

Vincent Swinnich's automotive management bachelor's of business administration degree was the stepping stone for his job as a field engineer for Lockheed Martin doing defense work.

""The combination of hands-on automotive work and business -- so many of the skills I gained transfer to what I will be doing in my new position,"" he said.

Successfully lining up careers out of the gate was a sentiment shared by other graduates, too, including Jake Hartnett, who earned a bachelor' of technology degree in renewable energy. Hartnett finished an internship with Nickels Energy Solutions that led to his full-time job as a solar project manager, where he'll be responsible for designing and planning residential solar projects from start to finish.

""SUNY Morrisville played a vital role in me obtaining this through an in-depth, hands-on curriculum, great internship opportunities and caring educators with real-world experience,"" Hartnett said. ""For this position in particular, networking through classmates and industry partners of the program helped me get a foot in the door.""

Agricultural business students Kierra Kenyon, Lauren Schampier and Gavin Gates all landed jobs, too: Kenyon as a business assistant at Dairy One Cooperative, Inc.; Schampier as a loan coordinator for Farm Credit East; and Gavin Gates, a sales manger for Agri-plastics in Cortland.

The skills to succeed are a major factor in a SUNY Morrisville education. ""For the last few years, all of us here have worked to give you the knowledge, the skills and the attitude you will need to succeed,"" Rogers said. ""Be proud to tell the world, by your words and your work, that you are a graduate of SUNY Morrisville and the State University of New York,"" he said.

In his parting words to fellow classmates, Jarred Butler, an automotive graduate and former student government organization president, shared this: ""Don't forget to enjoy your time, not only in college, but in life, too. Days can easily slip away from us so we must make them count. Live with reason. Do something YOU want to do. This is the start of a new chapter.""

Faculty speaker Richard Marcoux acknowledged the faculty's pride in their graduates.

""The relationships and friendships you made, how you showed up not only for yourself but for others, how you engaged in making Morrisville a better place, demonstrate your maturation as an adult and citizen,"" Marcoux, a professor of computer & information technologies, said. ""As a community, we take pride in what you have accomplished and our part in that accomplishment.""

SUNY Morrisville's curricula are enriched with applied learning and pave the way for opportunity at the Morrisville and Norwich campuses. An action-oriented, interactive learning lab, the college is a national leader in technology and has been lauded for its exemplary, innovative and effective community service programs.

Full transcript - RWE AG PK (RWEOY) Q1 2024:

Thomas Denny: And good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining the Q1 2024 RWE Investor Analyst Conference Call today. Our CFO, Michael Muller, will guide you through our key highlights and financial performance for the first quarter and the outlook for the current year. And with that, let me hand over to you, Michael.

Michael Muller: Yes. Thanks, Thomas, and good afternoon to all of you. First quarter was a solid start into 2024. Adjusted EBITDA stood at €1.7 billion, driven by good wind conditions in our offshore business, capacity additions in the onshore business and a good trading performance. Earnings in flexible generation were lower after exceptional market conditions in the previous year. We confirm our full year guidance at the lower end of our guidance range. We've also made significant progress on offshore portfolio optimization. We have derisked our 3 gigawatts DogaBank South project by selling down 49% to our partner Mazda, and we have acquired the highly attractive 4.2 gigawatts Norfork project portfolio from Battenfeld. These well-developed U.K. offshore projects are eligible for CFD auctions in the coming years. In April, we issued the first U.S. green bonds. With this transaction, we have successfully reentered the U.S. debt market. In the future, we want to be a regular issuer in the U.S. bond market. The USD 2 billion bond has maturities of 10 and 30 years. We saw a high demand from investors with the bonds being oversubscribed 3.8x. The final book order book volume was close to USD 7.6 billion. The high level of interest demonstrates our ability to access debt capital markets, enabling us to finance our growth investments at attractive rates. Let's now take a closer look at the Q1 2024 financials. After the exceptional earnings in the first quarter of last year, EBITDA in Q1 2024 stood at €1.7 billion, thanks to a good performance. In offshore wind, adjusted EBITDA was €548 million, and earnings were up mainly on the back of better wind conditions. Onshore Wind and Solar recorded an EBITDA of €341 million. This was driven by organic growth and the full contribution of the CEB assets. Adjusted EBITDA of the flexible generation business was €552 million. As expected, we have seen a lower earnings development in line with normalized market conditions after the exceptional year in 2023. Our Supply & Trading business had a good start into 2024, and Q1 results stood at €251 million. On the back of the strong operational performance, adjusted net income amounted to €801 million. The year-on-year adjusted financial result is almost stable. For adjusted tax, we applied the general tax rate of 20% for the RWE Group. And finally, adjusted minority interest reflects lower earnings contributions from minority partners. The adjusted operating cash flow was minus €379 million at the end of Q1 and is mostly driven by seasonal effects in operating working capital. Changes in operating working capital were marked by the seasonal purchase of CO2 certificates compensated by positive effects from the reduction of trade receivables and withdrawals for gas in storage. Net debt increased to €11.2 billion due to investments and by timing effects. In total, we invested €2.3 billion net into our grain growth. This includes the acquisition of the Norfolk offshore projects from Battenfeld and our sell-down of 49% of the Docavan-South projects to Mazda. Other changes in net financial debt amounted to €1.9 billion. This includes timing effects from hedging and trading activities. Our net position from variation margins for power generation hedging stood at minus €1.4 billion, representing an outflow of €2.8 billion. This includes net variation margins from the sale of electricity as well as purchases of the respective fuels and CO2 certificates. We expect other changes in net financial debt to revert over the course of the year. For 2024, we confirm our outlook despite the faster normalization in European commodity markets. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between €5.2 billion and €5.8 billion. Adjusted EBIT is assumed to be between €3.2 billion and €3.8 billion and net income will range from €1.9 billion to €2.4 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBIT and net income at the lower end of the guidance ranges. The dividend target is €1.1 per share for this year. And with that, let me hand back to Thomas for Q&A.

Thomas Denny: Thank you, Michael. We'll now start the Q&A session. Operator, please begin.

Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, if you would like to ask a question [Operator's instructions] we'll pause for just a moment while waiting for the queue for questions. Thank you. We'll now take our first question from Robert Pulleyn of Morgan Stanley.

Robert Pulleyn: Two questions from me, please. Firstly, revisiting a theme that's been going on a year. May we ask what benefit, if any, you're seeing from rising power demand from the data center theme, both in the U.S. and in Europe. And of course, in your European markets, what this might mean for long-term power demand trends? And secondly, if I may, given a U.S. politicians comment about offshore wind over the weekend in the U.S., may we ask how you assess the risks for that industry under the next U.S. administration from 2025. And in particular, do you see permitting risks if RWE is indeed successful in the New York and New Jersey auctions this year. And assigned to that, do those auctions have flexibility on the commissioning date would be very interesting.

Michael Muller: Yes, Rob, thanks for the question. Let's start with the data center topic, which is a hot topic currently in all the discussions. I mean, I can confirm you that we obviously are also strongly engaging with tech companies around PPAs. And actually, we are about to communicate another PPA we signed with a big tech company just recently over 400 megawatts at an attractive price. And that brings us overall to almost half of the volume of our U.S. capacities under construction being contracted to tech companies. So indeed, we do see strong interest for those companies in greening up their portfolio. And maybe that brings me also to the next aspect around offshore. I mean, obviously, we have also read the announcements. We don't have any more insights into the exact campaign. But if we look at the U.S., we see a continuing strong trend for green electrons. It's on the PPA side, we just discussed, but the same is true. I mean if you think about New York, I mean, if New York wants to decarbonize, they essentially need offshore wind. So therefore, we see the trend for offshore as yes, unbroken, so it stays intact. I mean, you already hinted to the right point. I mean, if you think about our New York portfolio, we have a lease there. And now we have the options to go into CFD auctions and to develop the project. I mean we still see demand for those projects. But at the same time, we also do have flexibility in developing the project and also looking for different offtakes. So it is something we'll observe, but it's nothing where you see me today being nervous.

Alberto Gandolfi: Thank you, thank you for taking my questions Michael and Thomas. My first question is on guidance. If I look at your Slide 8, you're really stressing everywhere, lower end, lower and lower end. But if I take your net income for Q1 and I simply add the E.ON dividend you're due to receive, you'll be at €1 billion, so you'll be at more than 50% of the full year. So can I just ask you, I mean, in hindsight, where you to rush perhaps in downgrading guidance on the 25th of January. And again, with the benefit of hindsight, why sticking to the low end and not essentially mark to market the fact that commodities, pulp prices are going to spread have expanded a little bit, and the outlook appears even better on the horizon as we discussed, more PPAs, better returns. We are hearing from many players, power demand inflecting. So I'm just curious to see why you stick to such a cautious message. If there's anything that I'm not seeing here? And the second, I know you don't comment, but if we may not talk specifically about Amprion, but it's been reported that it's potentially for sale. But let's say, if it's not Amprion, is there anything that perhaps you may consider noncore that is perhaps for sale? And I'm quite intrigued by this route because it as far as I understand, it was besides the typical asset rotation, none of this was included in your CMD. So if you were to divest an asset that gives you proceed of a couple of periods, what would that be used for? I see that you're talking about net debt normalizing by year-end. So is RWE going to reduce leverage further. Is there a special dividend you're thinking or something else? Any cash return to shareholders? Or are you going to use this to create your own dignit foundation because perhaps the government has been dragging their feet?

Michael Muller: I mean let's start with the guidance. I mean, my comment here would be, we are just a quarter into the year. And therefore, we stick to the guidance we have put forward and also our communication towards the lower end. Yes, I think what you rightly raised is kind of the commodity markets have stabilized in the meantime. So while we went with the message in January, we saw a continuing trend of lower carbon and gas prices and therefore, power prices. I mean, that went down to kind of the minimum in Feb and since then has recovered. I mean, especially on the CO2 side, it came back to, I would say, normalized levels yet days is probably more potential going forward. But yes, I mean, market prices have stabilized, and that is obviously also helping income. I mean you saw that in our full year guidance or full year communication, we showed how much of our existing fleet in renewables is still exposed to market prices. And there is still something also in 2024, and that is benefiting from higher prices. I guess the more important topic you raised is the long-term outlook where, I mean, we always said that despite we see a quicker normalization in the first years, we continue to stick to our guidance and also our view in the later years because on the one hand side, in our plans, we already baked in a normalization of prices. And at the same time, there is also some potential improvement to come. So therefore, I would say it's too early to judge about full year, and I can just reiterate that our long-term outlook for 2027 and 2030 perfectly stays intact. Talking about Amprion, I mean, let me first say, Amprion is a financial investment, which we are very happy with. I mean they are strongly performing yet unburned tonnes with a high investment need. And therefore, it's very clear that when we discuss capital allocation, we also discuss the capital that is needed with Amprion. And therefore, that's what we communicated. We are obviously and I think that's kind of usual hygiene, you should have when looking at capital allocation are looking into options around financing and in general, loss options around Amprion. So that's the comment here. I mean the other one on divestments. Yes, you're fully right. Divestments, on the one hand side was leads to cash in and therefore, delever again. And at the same time, you should also expect book gains on those which we haven't baked into our plan. That's also very important to notice. I mean, I would consider divestments as being part of our capital allocation, yes? So therefore, I can just reiterate what we said at the full year numbers. I mean, when we look at capital allocation, we do see currently attractive returns. Clearly, projects are meeting the returns we have put forward at the Capital Market Day. Please bear also in mind this is kind of our return expectations. Obviously, every project should strive to outperform our return expectations, and that is also something we are seeing in projects where we actually see FID. So therefore, I can just confirm we do see valuable projects in our pipeline, and that is something we will consider when we look at capital allocation, including when we free up capital divestments.

Alberto Gandolfi: Michael, sorry, but if I can just clarify this point, which I think is extremely important. Thank you, all very clear by the way. Let's say you were to receive, I don't know, I'm too there a number, €1 billion in Amprion. Is your inclination to return this capital to shareholders or to put it at use somewhere else?

Michael Muller: I mean, so I wouldn't talk specifically about Ampion. I mean what we said is that when we look at capital allocation, we look at where do we see investment opportunities. We currently see attractive investment opportunities in our projects. Yet we also said that if the conditions change, returning capital, more capital to our shareholders would be in the option space and something to look at.

Operator: The next question comes from Peter Bisztyga of Bank of America (NYSE: BAC ).

Peter Bisztyga: So first one, just coming back to this data center point. In ERCOT, we've seen forward curves already moved up by more than 20%. You've got, I think, 10 terawatt hours of exposure in that market. And I guess what I'm wondering is whether the clear impact of data center demand on those forward curves gives you an incentive to keep more of that business merchants going forwards? Or are you, in fact, seeing appetite for PPAs at premiums to even these higher forward prices? So that's kind of my first question. And then staying on that topic, are you seeing any difference in the premiums that data centers or hyperscalers are willing to pay for PPAs in the U.S. versus Europe, please? And are you having those kinds of conversations in Europe.

Michael Muller: Yes. Peter, happy to take the questions. I mean, first of all, ERCOT, I mean, indeed, how prices has gone up. I mean we also said that already in the course of last year, we gave the clear steer to our businesses, at least on new projects that they should go for contracted businesses. And that's I mean, we said 95% of the projects that have CODs last year were contracted and also the new assets have a high share of contracted. So that stays intact. So I wouldn't say we go for more merchants. At the same time, on the existing fleet, yes, we do see upside, and that's been part of the regular hedging activities with power prices going up. And obviously, we try to capture those business, those upsides on the existing fleets. Contracting existing assets in ERCOT, via PPA. To be honest, it's not so common. So you get the better prices with new assets, and that is really also then the focus. And on the existing one, it's really then optimizing in the current environment. Is there a big difference between the U.S. and Europe? I wouldn't say so. So we're also seeing demand from data center providers to purchase power in Europe? No, actually not. And also, I mean, you could imagine that maybe in Europe, they would even be more bullish on buying green molecules. That's actually the same also in the U.S. Yes. So no big difference.

Olly Jeffery: The first is on debt. Obviously, it's quite a high number in Q1. We've spoken about that reversing or elements of that reversing over the rest of the year. Could you give us kind of a band where you see that net debt figure possibly landing by the year-end? That would be helpful. And the second question is just current the trading business. We had a very strong Q1, far ahead of good guidance in that business. How do you feel about the outlook for that trading business for the rest of the year? Is there a change in the development of what we've just seen in Q1? Thank you.

Michael Muller: Yes. Olly, I mean, on net debt, I guess, that is the question. The market is really interested in. I mean, look, the big movements we have seen is working capital. So we do expect that to fully revert even more over the course of the year. When we think about other elements in the financial debt, so especially on around variation margins. We also expect that to revert over the course of the year. So I mean, if you do the math and you assume that kind of we continue with the run rate of the current investments we have, that should bring you by year-end about the same order of magnitude where we currently are with net debt so therefore, kind of balance impact the temporary effect or seasonal effect and then counterbalance by continuing investments through the course of the year. Around trading, I mean, you know that we don't, our perspective is always Q1 is pretty early. So it's not the point in time where we would kind of judge on the full year, and therefore, we keep the existing guidance intact. Obviously, we are very happy with the Q1 results.

Operator: And the next question comes from Deepa of Bernstein. Please go ahead. She dropped the line. While waiting for her to requeue, we shall go to Wierzbicka of UBS.

Wierzbicka Serwinowska: Hi it's Wierzbicka Serwinowska UBS. Two questions from me. The one is on the renewables. In Plant recently, the higher returns in the renewables project versus what they expected at the CMD in 2023? And do you see a similar trend? Do you also see returns going up versus what you saw last year? And maybe if you, would you be able to disclose some items on the latest renewable projects that you are developing to give us more confidence that basically investing renewables give shareholders a better value. And the second one is on the European data centers, would you be able to disclose how much PPA in terms of the two hours have you signed so far in Europe?

Michael Muller: Yes, Deepa, First, on the returns, I mean, I would kind of stick to the numbers we have put forward at the Capital Market Day. I think the important point here, and that is something we also had in quite some discussions on the road is kind of the range we put forward is the range for what we call the hurdle rates, so that needs to be met in projects. Yes, what you typically would see there are projects that are also exceeding those returns. And actually, the way how we see the project is not to just meet the hurdle rate, but to exceed it. And therefore, that also gives me confidence that we do have really value-accretive projects that meet the return expectations and even go beyond that. I mean on data center demands to be fair, kind of the high ratio of tech companies purchasing power from us in the U.S., we don't see that yet in Europe. At the same time, we do have ongoing requests from data centers in Europe on PPAs. And we are also seeing data centers now being built up. I mean, you may have seen that there was in the press that we sold land in the RinesLiknite area to Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), which wants to build a data center, and they also want to build a second one, I think, in the Frankfurt area. And clearly, those data centers go along with the demand for green power. And that's actually what we're also seeing. There are requests for PPA offers, and that is something I would also expect to pick up in Germany in Europe. And if I can add one shouldn't forget that also in Europe, many of the assets that we built in onshore and solar space actors because that's a very risky, very high price alternative as well.

Wierzbicka Serwinowska: Okay. So there is no number of terawatt hours that you can give us in the for data centers in Europe in your portfolio?

Deepa Venkateswaran: I think there was a technical problem. So I don't know if anyone's already asked the question I'm about to ask. So I had 2 questions. One is you mentioned about the PPA in the U.S. for 400 megawatts. So more broadly, I wanted to see now that you've finished this quarter, what are you seeing in terms of PPA pricing, particularly versus where baseload power prices are trending both in the U.S. and Europe? And are you seeing a green premium from your buyers? So that was the first question. The second one, just a clarification on net debt. Just recapping my understanding is, on the one hand, you're guiding to a normalization on variation margin, probably more than a normalization of working capital with inflows but also you're highlighting that the CapEx run rate is similar to first Q, so around 10 billion-ish, which is probably lesser than most of us have in our model. So could you just clarify that? And does this mean also that if you're spending €10 billion this year out of the €55 billion program, then in later years, there's some farm down or something, which kind of compensates. Could you comment on that?

Michael Muller: Yes. Deepa, I mean, let's start with the net debt and then the fund- assumptions, I couldn't have phrased it better. So everything is correct what you said. And then on PPAs, I mean, look, the difficulty is, first of all, we don't communicate prices. We have contracted with customers. And the second one, PPA prices also very much depend on where they are. So I mean, if you go to some of the East Coast states, especially the more Noel, the higher the prices get so they get pretty much sometimes even to levels you see in Europe even above that. If you go to some other areas where it's easier to build renewables, but also the costs are lower price levels are lower. And then it's a question if you go for yes, unit contingents, busbar PPAs, or what's kind of the setup is. So it's difficult to say. But I mean, what is fair to say there is demand for green molecules and that is helping, yes, to achieve attractive returns in our renewable projects. And that's in the end. I mean, in the end, I don't care so much about the absolute price of the PPA. I care about the economics of the specific projects. And that is the important view, and that is indeed something where we see, as I said, meeting our return expectations and even exceeding them.

Operator: We'll now take our next question from Harry Wyburd of BNP Paribas (OTC: BNPQY ).

Harry Wyburd: It's just 1 and a half question. Firstly, just on the debt. Could I just clarify, so you're saying that you expect year-end net debt to be where it is now at about €11 billion. Is that assuming neutral variation margin? Or is it assuming the variation margin going where it is at GBP 1.4 billion? First one and the second one, on Flexion, I just wondered, given that commodity prices have rebounded, have you seen market conditions in flexible generation also rebound in the last few weeks in line with power prices? Or have you seen a divergence in profitability there from a sort of linear relationship with power prices? And are you seeing any regional differences in Flexion if you look at some of some metrics, it suggests that the U.K. market perhaps is looking a bit weaker in terms of intraday volatility than the continence. I'd be interested to know if that's something that you've seen as well.

Michael Muller: Yes, I mean, let's first talk about the variation margins. I mean, roughly, we assume like other changes in net debt, about €2 billion to revert over the course of the year. So that's roughly the ballpark number. On flexible generation, my comment would be the following. What we see is that the intraday and they have volatility, that is clearly picking up again. So while I would say maybe the fab around that. We saw a slight deterioration here still, and then we always said that this intraday that optimization is fairly stable. I mean it was maybe down to 90% of the level we would expect. And that has clearly recovered. So we see further strengthening here. The other topic is more of what we described as kind of the time value. So what we have seen is that the overall curve has come down and especially optimizing between hours that has deteriorated. We haven't seen a significant pickup here. But what is at least important is it has stabilized. So therefore, kind of the guidance that we have out there can be clearly confirmed but clearly, with now I mean, people are also a little bit more concerned around gas. I mean, going into the winter and let's see what happens, there is clearly upside because, I mean, you know our fleet is, in the end, long volatility. So in case volatility picks up again, we would clearly benefit with our fleet there.

Operator: Thank you. Once again, as a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, if you would like to ask a question [Operator's instructions] Thank you there are no further questions in queue. I will now hand it back to Thomas for closing remarks.

Thomas Denny: Excellent. Thank you all. Thanks for the good discussion and for dialing in today. If you have further questions on any of the topics, feel free to reach out to the IR team. And apart from that, I wish you a great afternoon, and speak soon. Thank you.

Full transcript - RWE AG PK (RWEOY) Q1 2024:

Thomas Denny: And good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining the Q1 2024 RWE Investor Analyst Conference Call today. Our CFO, Michael Muller, will guide you through our key highlights and financial performance for the first quarter and the outlook for the current year. And with that, let me hand over to you, Michael.

Michael Muller: Yes. Thanks, Thomas, and good afternoon to all of you. First quarter was a solid start into 2024. Adjusted EBITDA stood at €1.7 billion, driven by good wind conditions in our offshore business, capacity additions in the onshore business and a good trading performance. Earnings in flexible generation were lower after exceptional market conditions in the previous year. We confirm our full year guidance at the lower end of our guidance range. We've also made significant progress on offshore portfolio optimization. We have derisked our 3 gigawatts DogaBank South project by selling down 49% to our partner Mazda, and we have acquired the highly attractive 4.2 gigawatts Norfork project portfolio from Battenfeld. These well-developed U.K. offshore projects are eligible for CFD auctions in the coming years. In April, we issued the first U.S. green bonds. With this transaction, we have successfully reentered the U.S. debt market. In the future, we want to be a regular issuer in the U.S. bond market. The USD 2 billion bond has maturities of 10 and 30 years. We saw a high demand from investors with the bonds being oversubscribed 3.8x. The final book order book volume was close to USD 7.6 billion. The high level of interest demonstrates our ability to access debt capital markets, enabling us to finance our growth investments at attractive rates. Let's now take a closer look at the Q1 2024 financials. After the exceptional earnings in the first quarter of last year, EBITDA in Q1 2024 stood at €1.7 billion, thanks to a good performance. In offshore wind, adjusted EBITDA was €548 million, and earnings were up mainly on the back of better wind conditions. Onshore Wind and Solar recorded an EBITDA of €341 million. This was driven by organic growth and the full contribution of the CEB assets. Adjusted EBITDA of the flexible generation business was €552 million. As expected, we have seen a lower earnings development in line with normalized market conditions after the exceptional year in 2023. Our Supply & Trading business had a good start into 2024, and Q1 results stood at €251 million. On the back of the strong operational performance, adjusted net income amounted to €801 million. The year-on-year adjusted financial result is almost stable. For adjusted tax, we applied the general tax rate of 20% for the RWE Group. And finally, adjusted minority interest reflects lower earnings contributions from minority partners. The adjusted operating cash flow was minus €379 million at the end of Q1 and is mostly driven by seasonal effects in operating working capital. Changes in operating working capital were marked by the seasonal purchase of CO2 certificates compensated by positive effects from the reduction of trade receivables and withdrawals for gas in storage. Net debt increased to €11.2 billion due to investments and by timing effects. In total, we invested €2.3 billion net into our grain growth. This includes the acquisition of the Norfolk offshore projects from Battenfeld and our sell-down of 49% of the Docavan-South projects to Mazda. Other changes in net financial debt amounted to €1.9 billion. This includes timing effects from hedging and trading activities. Our net position from variation margins for power generation hedging stood at minus €1.4 billion, representing an outflow of €2.8 billion. This includes net variation margins from the sale of electricity as well as purchases of the respective fuels and CO2 certificates. We expect other changes in net financial debt to revert over the course of the year. For 2024, we confirm our outlook despite the faster normalization in European commodity markets. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between €5.2 billion and €5.8 billion. Adjusted EBIT is assumed to be between €3.2 billion and €3.8 billion and net income will range from €1.9 billion to €2.4 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBIT and net income at the lower end of the guidance ranges. The dividend target is €1.1 per share for this year. And with that, let me hand back to Thomas for Q&A.

Thomas Denny: Thank you, Michael. We'll now start the Q&A session. Operator, please begin.

Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, if you would like to ask a question [Operator's instructions] we'll pause for just a moment while waiting for the queue for questions. Thank you. We'll now take our first question from Robert Pulleyn of Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS ).

Robert Pulleyn: Two questions from me, please. Firstly, revisiting a theme that's been going on a year. May we ask what benefit, if any, you're seeing from rising power demand from the data center theme, both in the U.S. and in Europe. And of course, in your European markets, what this might mean for long-term power demand trends? And secondly, if I may, given a U.S. politicians comment about offshore wind over the weekend in the U.S., may we ask how you assess the risks for that industry under the next U.S. administration from 2025. And in particular, do you see permitting risks if RWE is indeed successful in the New York and New Jersey auctions this year. And assigned to that, do those auctions have flexibility on the commissioning date would be very interesting.

Michael Muller: Yes, Rob, thanks for the question. Let's start with the data center topic, which is a hot topic currently in all the discussions. I mean, I can confirm you that we obviously are also strongly engaging with tech companies around PPAs. And actually, we are about to communicate another PPA we signed with a big tech company just recently over 400 megawatts at an attractive price. And that brings us overall to almost half of the volume of our U.S. capacities under construction being contracted to tech companies. So indeed, we do see strong interest for those companies in greening up their portfolio. And maybe that brings me also to the next aspect around offshore. I mean, obviously, we have also read the announcements. We don't have any more insights into the exact campaign. But if we look at the U.S., we see a continuing strong trend for green electrons. It's on the PPA side, we just discussed, but the same is true. I mean if you think about New York, I mean, if New York wants to decarbonize, they essentially need offshore wind. So therefore, we see the trend for offshore as yes, unbroken, so it stays intact. I mean, you already hinted to the right point. I mean, if you think about our New York portfolio, we have a lease there. And now we have the options to go into CFD auctions and to develop the project. I mean we still see demand for those projects. But at the same time, we also do have flexibility in developing the project and also looking for different offtakes. So it is something we'll observe, but it's nothing where you see me today being nervous.

Robert Pulleyn: Okay. Thank you very much.

Operator: The next question comes from Alberto Gandolfi of Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS ).

Alberto Gandolfi: Thank you, thank you for taking my questions Michael and Thomas. My first question is on guidance. If I look at your Slide 8, you're really stressing everywhere, lower end, lower and lower end. But if I take your net income for Q1 and I simply add the E.ON dividend you're due to receive, you'll be at €1 billion, so you'll be at more than 50% of the full year. So can I just ask you, I mean, in hindsight, where you to rush perhaps in downgrading guidance on the 25th of January. And again, with the benefit of hindsight, why sticking to the low end and not essentially mark to market the fact that commodities, pulp prices are going to spread have expanded a little bit, and the outlook appears even better on the horizon as we discussed, more PPAs, better returns. We are hearing from many players, power demand inflecting. So I'm just curious to see why you stick to such a cautious message. If there's anything that I'm not seeing here? And the second, I know you don't comment, but if we may not talk specifically about Amprion, but it's been reported that it's potentially for sale. But let's say, if it's not Amprion, is there anything that perhaps you may consider noncore that is perhaps for sale? And I'm quite intrigued by this route because it as far as I understand, it was besides the typical asset rotation, none of this was included in your CMD. So if you were to divest an asset that gives you proceed of a couple of periods, what would that be used for? I see that you're talking about net debt normalizing by year-end. So is RWE going to reduce leverage further. Is there a special dividend you're thinking or something else? Any cash return to shareholders? Or are you going to use this to create your own dignit foundation because perhaps the government has been dragging their feet?

Michael Muller: I mean let's start with the guidance. I mean, my comment here would be, we are just a quarter into the year. And therefore, we stick to the guidance we have put forward and also our communication towards the lower end. Yes, I think what you rightly raised is kind of the commodity markets have stabilized in the meantime. So while we went with the message in January, we saw a continuing trend of lower carbon and gas prices and therefore, power prices. I mean, that went down to kind of the minimum in Feb and since then has recovered. I mean, especially on the CO2 side, it came back to, I would say, normalized levels yet days is probably more potential going forward. But yes, I mean, market prices have stabilized, and that is obviously also helping income. I mean you saw that in our full year guidance or full year communication, we showed how much of our existing fleet in renewables is still exposed to market prices. And there is still something also in 2024, and that is benefiting from higher prices. I guess the more important topic you raised is the long-term outlook where, I mean, we always said that despite we see a quicker normalization in the first years, we continue to stick to our guidance and also our view in the later years because on the one hand side, in our plans, we already baked in a normalization of prices. And at the same time, there is also some potential improvement to come. So therefore, I would say it's too early to judge about full year, and I can just reiterate that our long-term outlook for 2027 and 2030 perfectly stays intact. Talking about Amprion, I mean, let me first say, Amprion is a financial investment, which we are very happy with. I mean they are strongly performing yet unburned tonnes with a high investment need. And therefore, it's very clear that when we discuss capital allocation, we also discuss the capital that is needed with Amprion. And therefore, that's what we communicated. We are obviously and I think that's kind of usual hygiene, you should have when looking at capital allocation are looking into options around financing and in general, loss options around Amprion. So that's the comment here. I mean the other one on divestments. Yes, you're fully right. Divestments, on the one hand side was leads to cash in and therefore, delever again. And at the same time, you should also expect book gains on those which we haven't baked into our plan. That's also very important to notice. I mean, I would consider divestments as being part of our capital allocation, yes? So therefore, I can just reiterate what we said at the full year numbers. I mean, when we look at capital allocation, we do see currently attractive returns. Clearly, projects are meeting the returns we have put forward at the Capital Market Day. Please bear also in mind this is kind of our return expectations. Obviously, every project should strive to outperform our return expectations, and that is also something we are seeing in projects where we actually see FID. So therefore, I can just confirm we do see valuable projects in our pipeline, and that is something we will consider when we look at capital allocation, including when we free up capital divestments.

Alberto Gandolfi: Michael, sorry, but if I can just clarify this point, which I think is extremely important. Thank you, all very clear by the way. Let's say you were to receive, I don't know, I'm too there a number, €1 billion in Amprion. Is your inclination to return this capital to shareholders or to put it at use somewhere else?

Michael Muller: I mean, so I wouldn't talk specifically about Ampion. I mean what we said is that when we look at capital allocation, we look at where do we see investment opportunities. We currently see attractive investment opportunities in our projects. Yet we also said that if the conditions change, returning capital, more capital to our shareholders would be in the option space and something to look at.

Operator: The next question comes from Peter Bisztyga of Bank of America (NYSE: BAC ).

Peter Bisztyga: So first one, just coming back to this data center point. In ERCOT, we've seen forward curves already moved up by more than 20%. You've got, I think, 10 terawatt hours of exposure in that market. And I guess what I'm wondering is whether the clear impact of data center demand on those forward curves gives you an incentive to keep more of that business merchants going forwards? Or are you, in fact, seeing appetite for PPAs at premiums to even these higher forward prices? So that's kind of my first question. And then staying on that topic, are you seeing any difference in the premiums that data centers or hyperscalers are willing to pay for PPAs in the U.S. versus Europe, please? And are you having those kinds of conversations in Europe.

Michael Muller: Yes. Peter, happy to take the questions. I mean, first of all, ERCOT, I mean, indeed, how prices has gone up. I mean we also said that already in the course of last year, we gave the clear steer to our businesses, at least on new projects that they should go for contracted businesses. And that's I mean, we said 95% of the projects that have CODs last year were contracted and also the new assets have a high share of contracted. So that stays intact. So I wouldn't say we go for more merchants. At the same time, on the existing fleet, yes, we do see upside, and that's been part of the regular hedging activities with power prices going up. And obviously, we try to capture those business, those upsides on the existing fleets. Contracting existing assets in ERCOT, via PPA. To be honest, it's not so common. So you get the better prices with new assets, and that is really also then the focus. And on the existing one, it's really then optimizing in the current environment. Is there a big difference between the U.S. and Europe? I wouldn't say so. So we're also seeing demand from data center providers to purchase power in Europe? No, actually not. And also, I mean, you could imagine that maybe in Europe, they would even be more bullish on buying green molecules. That's actually the same also in the U.S. Yes. So no big difference.

Olly Jeffery: The first is on debt. Obviously, it's quite a high number in Q1. We've spoken about that reversing or elements of that reversing over the rest of the year. Could you give us kind of a band where you see that net debt figure possibly landing by the year-end? That would be helpful. And the second question is just current the trading business. We had a very strong Q1, far ahead of good guidance in that business. How do you feel about the outlook for that trading business for the rest of the year? Is there a change in the development of what we've just seen in Q1? Thank you.

Michael Muller: Yes. Olly, I mean, on net debt, I guess, that is the question. The market is really interested in. I mean, look, the big movements we have seen is working capital. So we do expect that to fully revert even more over the course of the year. When we think about other elements in the financial debt, so especially on around variation margins. We also expect that to revert over the course of the year. So I mean, if you do the math and you assume that kind of we continue with the run rate of the current investments we have, that should bring you by year-end about the same order of magnitude where we currently are with net debt so therefore, kind of balance impact the temporary effect or seasonal effect and then counterbalance by continuing investments through the course of the year. Around trading, I mean, you know that we don't, our perspective is always Q1 is pretty early. So it's not the point in time where we would kind of judge on the full year, and therefore, we keep the existing guidance intact. Obviously, we are very happy with the Q1 results.

Operator: And the next question comes from Deepa of Bernstein. Please go ahead. She dropped the line. While waiting for her to requeue, we shall go to Wierzbicka of UBS.

Wierzbicka Serwinowska: Hi it's Wierzbicka Serwinowska UBS. Two questions from me. The one is on the renewables. In Plant recently, the higher returns in the renewables project versus what they expected at the CMD in 2023? And do you see a similar trend? Do you also see returns going up versus what you saw last year? And maybe if you, would you be able to disclose some items on the latest renewable projects that you are developing to give us more confidence that basically investing renewables give shareholders a better value. And the second one is on the European data centers, would you be able to disclose how much PPA in terms of the two hours have you signed so far in Europe?

Michael Muller: Yes, Deepa, First, on the returns, I mean, I would kind of stick to the numbers we have put forward at the Capital Market Day. I think the important point here, and that is something we also had in quite some discussions on the road is kind of the range we put forward is the range for what we call the hurdle rates, so that needs to be met in projects. Yes, what you typically would see there are projects that are also exceeding those returns. And actually, the way how we see the project is not to just meet the hurdle rate, but to exceed it. And therefore, that also gives me confidence that we do have really value-accretive projects that meet the return expectations and even go beyond that. I mean on data center demands to be fair, kind of the high ratio of tech companies purchasing power from us in the U.S., we don't see that yet in Europe. At the same time, we do have ongoing requests from data centers in Europe on PPAs. And we are also seeing data centers now being built up. I mean, you may have seen that there was in the press that we sold land in the RinesLiknite area to Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), which wants to build a data center, and they also want to build a second one, I think, in the Frankfurt area. And clearly, those data centers go along with the demand for green power. And that's actually what we're also seeing. There are requests for PPA offers, and that is something I would also expect to pick up in Germany in Europe. And if I can add one shouldn't forget that also in Europe, many of the assets that we built in onshore and solar space actors because that's a very risky, very high price alternative as well.

Wierzbicka Serwinowska: Okay. So there is no number of terawatt hours that you can give us in the for data centers in Europe in your portfolio?

Deepa Venkateswaran: I think there was a technical problem. So I don't know if anyone's already asked the question I'm about to ask. So I had 2 questions. One is you mentioned about the PPA in the U.S. for 400 megawatts. So more broadly, I wanted to see now that you've finished this quarter, what are you seeing in terms of PPA pricing, particularly versus where baseload power prices are trending both in the U.S. and Europe? And are you seeing a green premium from your buyers? So that was the first question. The second one, just a clarification on net debt. Just recapping my understanding is, on the one hand, you're guiding to a normalization on variation margin, probably more than a normalization of working capital with inflows but also you're highlighting that the CapEx run rate is similar to first Q, so around 10 billion-ish, which is probably lesser than most of us have in our model. So could you just clarify that? And does this mean also that if you're spending €10 billion this year out of the €55 billion program, then in later years, there's some farm down or something, which kind of compensates. Could you comment on that?

Michael Muller: Yes. Deepa, I mean, let's start with the net debt and then the fund- assumptions, I couldn't have phrased it better. So everything is correct what you said. And then on PPAs, I mean, look, the difficulty is, first of all, we don't communicate prices. We have contracted with customers. And the second one, PPA prices also very much depend on where they are. So I mean, if you go to some of the East Coast states, especially the more Noel, the higher the prices get so they get pretty much sometimes even to levels you see in Europe even above that. If you go to some other areas where it's easier to build renewables, but also the costs are lower price levels are lower. And then it's a question if you go for yes, unit contingents, busbar PPAs, or what's kind of the setup is. So it's difficult to say. But I mean, what is fair to say there is demand for green molecules and that is helping, yes, to achieve attractive returns in our renewable projects. And that's in the end. I mean, in the end, I don't care so much about the absolute price of the PPA. I care about the economics of the specific projects. And that is the important view, and that is indeed something where we see, as I said, meeting our return expectations and even exceeding them.

Operator: We'll now take our next question from Harry Wyburd of BNP Paribas (OTC: BNPQY ).

Harry Wyburd: It's just 1 and a half question. Firstly, just on the debt. Could I just clarify, so you're saying that you expect year-end net debt to be where it is now at about €11 billion. Is that assuming neutral variation margin? Or is it assuming the variation margin going where it is at GBP 1.4 billion? First one and the second one, on Flexion, I just wondered, given that commodity prices have rebounded, have you seen market conditions in flexible generation also rebound in the last few weeks in line with power prices? Or have you seen a divergence in profitability there from a sort of linear relationship with power prices? And are you seeing any regional differences in Flexion if you look at some of some metrics, it suggests that the U.K. market perhaps is looking a bit weaker in terms of intraday volatility than the continence. I'd be interested to know if that's something that you've seen as well.

Michael Muller: Yes, I mean, let's first talk about the variation margins. I mean, roughly, we assume like other changes in net debt, about €2 billion to revert over the course of the year. So that's roughly the ballpark number. On flexible generation, my comment would be the following. What we see is that the intraday and they have volatility, that is clearly picking up again. So while I would say maybe the fab around that. We saw a slight deterioration here still, and then we always said that this intraday that optimization is fairly stable. I mean it was maybe down to 90% of the level we would expect. And that has clearly recovered. So we see further strengthening here. The other topic is more of what we described as kind of the time value. So what we have seen is that the overall curve has come down and especially optimizing between hours that has deteriorated. We haven't seen a significant pickup here. But what is at least important is it has stabilized. So therefore, kind of the guidance that we have out there can be clearly confirmed but clearly, with now I mean, people are also a little bit more concerned around gas. I mean, going into the winter and let's see what happens, there is clearly upside because, I mean, you know our fleet is, in the end, long volatility. So in case volatility picks up again, we would clearly benefit with our fleet there.

Operator: Thank you. Once again, as a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, if you would like to ask a question [Operator's instructions] Thank you there are no further questions in queue. I will now hand it back to Thomas for closing remarks.

Thomas Denny: Excellent. Thank you all. Thanks for the good discussion and for dialing in today. If you have further questions on any of the topics, feel free to reach out to the IR team. And apart from that, I wish you a great afternoon, and speak soon. Thank you.

CFO Michael Muller highlighted the company's adjusted EBITDA of €1.7 billion, primarily driven by favorable wind conditions and strong trading performance.

Despite an increase in net debt to €11.2 billion, due to significant investments in growth initiatives, RWE confirmed its full-year guidance at the lower end of the range. The company's issuance of U.S. green bonds marked a successful reentry into the U.S. debt market, indicating investor confidence in RWE's sustainable business model.

RWE's strategic decisions in the first quarter, such as the sell-down of DogaBank South and the acquisition of the Norfork project portfolio, demonstrate the company's focus on optimizing its offshore portfolio. The successful issuance of green bonds underscores RWE's commitment to sustainability and has been met with strong investor interest. While the company faces the challenge of increased net debt due to its growth investments, it remains confident in its financial strategy and the ability to generate attractive returns. The demand for Power Purchase Agreements, particularly for green energy, remains strong, offering RWE further opportunities in the renewable energy market. Despite some volatility and regional differences in profitability, RWE's outlook for the year remains stable, supported by its strategic investments and operational performance.

In light of RWE AG's recent financial performance and strategic initiatives, certain metrics and InvestingPro Tips can provide additional insights into the company's current standing and future prospects.

InvestingPro Data shows that RWE AG's market capitalization stands at a robust $28.82 billion USD, reflecting the company's significant presence in the energy sector. Despite a notable decline in revenue growth over the last twelve months, with a decrease of 21.61%, RWE's gross profit margin remains strong at 40.43%. This suggests that while the company is facing top-line pressure, it maintains a solid ability to control costs and generate profit from its revenues.

An InvestingPro Tip highlights that RWE AG is seen as a prominent player in the Independent Power & Renewable Electricity Producers industry. This is particularly relevant given the company's focus on sustainability and growth within the renewable energy market, as mentioned in the article.

Thomas Denny: And good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining the Q1 2024 RWE Investor Analyst Conference Call today. Our CFO, Michael Muller, will guide you through our key highlights and financial performance for the first quarter and the outlook for the current year. And with that, let me hand over to you, Michael.

Michael Muller: Yes. Thanks, Thomas, and good afternoon to all of you. First quarter was a solid start into 2024. Adjusted EBITDA stood at €1.7 billion, driven by good wind conditions in our offshore business, capacity additions in the onshore business and a good trading performance. Earnings in flexible generation were lower after exceptional market conditions in the previous year. We confirm our full year guidance at the lower end of our guidance range. We've also made significant progress on offshore portfolio optimization. We have derisked our 3 gigawatts DogaBank South project by selling down 49% to our partner Mazda, and we have acquired the highly attractive 4.2 gigawatts Norfork project portfolio from Battenfeld. These well-developed U.K. offshore projects are eligible for CFD auctions in the coming years. In April, we issued the first U.S. green bonds. With this transaction, we have successfully reentered the U.S. debt market. In the future, we want to be a regular issuer in the U.S. bond market. The USD 2 billion bond has maturities of 10 and 30 years. We saw a high demand from investors with the bonds being oversubscribed 3.8x. The final book order book volume was close to USD 7.6 billion. The high level of interest demonstrates our ability to access debt capital markets, enabling us to finance our growth investments at attractive rates. Let's now take a closer look at the Q1 2024 financials. After the exceptional earnings in the first quarter of last year, EBITDA in Q1 2024 stood at €1.7 billion, thanks to a good performance. In offshore wind, adjusted EBITDA was €548 million, and earnings were up mainly on the back of better wind conditions. Onshore Wind and Solar recorded an EBITDA of €341 million. This was driven by organic growth and the full contribution of the CEB assets. Adjusted EBITDA of the flexible generation business was €552 million. As expected, we have seen a lower earnings development in line with normalized market conditions after the exceptional year in 2023. Our Supply & Trading business had a good start into 2024, and Q1 results stood at €251 million. On the back of the strong operational performance, adjusted net income amounted to €801 million. The year-on-year adjusted financial result is almost stable. For adjusted tax, we applied the general tax rate of 20% for the RWE Group. And finally, adjusted minority interest reflects lower earnings contributions from minority partners. The adjusted operating cash flow was minus €379 million at the end of Q1 and is mostly driven by seasonal effects in operating working capital. Changes in operating working capital were marked by the seasonal purchase of CO2 certificates compensated by positive effects from the reduction of trade receivables and withdrawals for gas in storage. Net debt increased to €11.2 billion due to investments and by timing effects. In total, we invested €2.3 billion net into our grain growth. This includes the acquisition of the Norfolk offshore projects from Battenfeld and our sell-down of 49% of the Docavan-South projects to Mazda. Other changes in net financial debt amounted to €1.9 billion. This includes timing effects from hedging and trading activities. Our net position from variation margins for power generation hedging stood at minus €1.4 billion, representing an outflow of €2.8 billion. This includes net variation margins from the sale of electricity as well as purchases of the respective fuels and CO2 certificates. We expect other changes in net financial debt to revert over the course of the year. For 2024, we confirm our outlook despite the faster normalization in European commodity markets. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between €5.2 billion and €5.8 billion. Adjusted EBIT is assumed to be between €3.2 billion and €3.8 billion and net income will range from €1.9 billion to €2.4 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBIT and net income at the lower end of the guidance ranges. The dividend target is €1.1 per share for this year. And with that, let me hand back to Thomas for Q&A.

Thomas Denny: Thank you, Michael. We'll now start the Q&A session. Operator, please begin.

Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, if you would like to ask a question [Operator's instructions] we'll pause for just a moment while waiting for the queue for questions. Thank you. We'll now take our first question from Robert Pulleyn of Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS).

Robert Pulleyn: Two questions from me, please. Firstly, revisiting a theme that's been going on a year. May we ask what benefit, if any, you're seeing from rising power demand from the data center theme, both in the U.S. and in Europe. And of course, in your European markets, what this might mean for long-term power demand trends? And secondly, if I may, given a U.S. politicians comment about offshore wind over the weekend in the U.S., may we ask how you assess the risks for that industry under the next U.S. administration from 2025. And in particular, do you see permitting risks if RWE is indeed successful in the New York and New Jersey auctions this year. And assigned to that, do those auctions have flexibility on the commissioning date would be very interesting.

Michael Muller: Yes, Rob, thanks for the question. Let's start with the data center topic, which is a hot topic currently in all the discussions. I mean, I can confirm you that we obviously are also strongly engaging with tech companies around PPAs. And actually, we are about to communicate another PPA we signed with a big tech company just recently over 400 megawatts at an attractive price. And that brings us overall to almost half of the volume of our U.S. capacities under construction being contracted to tech companies. So indeed, we do see strong interest for those companies in greening up their portfolio. And maybe that brings me also to the next aspect around offshore. I mean, obviously, we have also read the announcements. We don't have any more insights into the exact campaign. But if we look at the U.S., we see a continuing strong trend for green electrons. It's on the PPA side, we just discussed, but the same is true. I mean if you think about New York, I mean, if New York wants to decarbonize, they essentially need offshore wind. So therefore, we see the trend for offshore as yes, unbroken, so it stays intact. I mean, you already hinted to the right point. I mean, if you think about our New York portfolio, we have a lease there. And now we have the options to go into CFD auctions and to develop the project. I mean we still see demand for those projects. But at the same time, we also do have flexibility in developing the project and also looking for different offtakes. So it is something we'll observe, but it's nothing where you see me today being nervous.

Robert Pulleyn: Okay. Thank you very much.

Operator: The next question comes from Alberto Gandolfi of Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).

Alberto Gandolfi: Thank you, thank you for taking my questions Michael and Thomas. My first question is on guidance. If I look at your Slide 8, you're really stressing everywhere, lower end, lower and lower end. But if I take your net income for Q1 and I simply add the E.ON dividend you're due to receive, you'll be at €1 billion, so you'll be at more than 50% of the full year. So can I just ask you, I mean, in hindsight, where you to rush perhaps in downgrading guidance on the 25th of January. And again, with the benefit of hindsight, why sticking to the low end and not essentially mark to market the fact that commodities, pulp prices are going to spread have expanded a little bit, and the outlook appears even better on the horizon as we discussed, more PPAs, better returns. We are hearing from many players, power demand inflecting. So I'm just curious to see why you stick to such a cautious message. If there's anything that I'm not seeing here? And the second, I know you don't comment, but if we may not talk specifically about Amprion, but it's been reported that it's potentially for sale. But let's say, if it's not Amprion, is there anything that perhaps you may consider noncore that is perhaps for sale? And I'm quite intrigued by this route because it as far as I understand, it was besides the typical asset rotation, none of this was included in your CMD. So if you were to divest an asset that gives you proceed of a couple of periods, what would that be used for? I see that you're talking about net debt normalizing by year-end. So is RWE going to reduce leverage further. Is there a special dividend you're thinking or something else? Any cash return to shareholders? Or are you going to use this to create your own dignit foundation because perhaps the government has been dragging their feet?

Michael Muller: I mean let's start with the guidance. I mean, my comment here would be, we are just a quarter into the year. And therefore, we stick to the guidance we have put forward and also our communication towards the lower end. Yes, I think what you rightly raised is kind of the commodity markets have stabilized in the meantime. So while we went with the message in January, we saw a continuing trend of lower carbon and gas prices and therefore, power prices. I mean, that went down to kind of the minimum in Feb and since then has recovered. I mean, especially on the CO2 side, it came back to, I would say, normalized levels yet days is probably more potential going forward. But yes, I mean, market prices have stabilized, and that is obviously also helping income. I mean you saw that in our full year guidance or full year communication, we showed how much of our existing fleet in renewables is still exposed to market prices. And there is still something also in 2024, and that is benefiting from higher prices. I guess the more important topic you raised is the long-term outlook where, I mean, we always said that despite we see a quicker normalization in the first years, we continue to stick to our guidance and also our view in the later years because on the one hand side, in our plans, we already baked in a normalization of prices. And at the same time, there is also some potential improvement to come. So therefore, I would say it's too early to judge about full year, and I can just reiterate that our long-term outlook for 2027 and 2030 perfectly stays intact. Talking about Amprion, I mean, let me first say, Amprion is a financial investment, which we are very happy with. I mean they are strongly performing yet unburned tonnes with a high investment need. And therefore, it's very clear that when we discuss capital allocation, we also discuss the capital that is needed with Amprion. And therefore, that's what we communicated. We are obviously and I think that's kind of usual hygiene, you should have when looking at capital allocation are looking into options around financing and in general, loss options around Amprion. So that's the comment here. I mean the other one on divestments. Yes, you're fully right. Divestments, on the one hand side was leads to cash in and therefore, delever again. And at the same time, you should also expect book gains on those which we haven't baked into our plan. That's also very important to notice. I mean, I would consider divestments as being part of our capital allocation, yes? So therefore, I can just reiterate what we said at the full year numbers. I mean, when we look at capital allocation, we do see currently attractive returns. Clearly, projects are meeting the returns we have put forward at the Capital Market Day. Please bear also in mind this is kind of our return expectations. Obviously, every project should strive to outperform our return expectations, and that is also something we are seeing in projects where we actually see FID. So therefore, I can just confirm we do see valuable projects in our pipeline, and that is something we will consider when we look at capital allocation, including when we free up capital divestments.

Alberto Gandolfi: Michael, sorry, but if I can just clarify this point, which I think is extremely important. Thank you, all very clear by the way. Let's say you were to receive, I don't know, I'm too there a number, €1 billion in Amprion. Is your inclination to return this capital to shareholders or to put it at use somewhere else?

Michael Muller: I mean, so I wouldn't talk specifically about Ampion. I mean what we said is that when we look at capital allocation, we look at where do we see investment opportunities. We currently see attractive investment opportunities in our projects. Yet we also said that if the conditions change, returning capital, more capital to our shareholders would be in the option space and something to look at.

Operator: The next question comes from Peter Bisztyga of Bank of America (NYSE:BAC).

Peter Bisztyga: So first one, just coming back to this data center point. In ERCOT, we've seen forward curves already moved up by more than 20%. You've got, I think, 10 terawatt hours of exposure in that market. And I guess what I'm wondering is whether the clear impact of data center demand on those forward curves gives you an incentive to keep more of that business merchants going forwards? Or are you, in fact, seeing appetite for PPAs at premiums to even these higher forward prices? So that's kind of my first question. And then staying on that topic, are you seeing any difference in the premiums that data centers or hyperscalers are willing to pay for PPAs in the U.S. versus Europe, please? And are you having those kinds of conversations in Europe.

Michael Muller: Yes. Peter, happy to take the questions. I mean, first of all, ERCOT, I mean, indeed, how prices has gone up. I mean we also said that already in the course of last year, we gave the clear steer to our businesses, at least on new projects that they should go for contracted businesses. And that's I mean, we said 95% of the projects that have CODs last year were contracted and also the new assets have a high share of contracted. So that stays intact. So I wouldn't say we go for more merchants. At the same time, on the existing fleet, yes, we do see upside, and that's been part of the regular hedging activities with power prices going up. And obviously, we try to capture those business, those upsides on the existing fleets. Contracting existing assets in ERCOT, via PPA. To be honest, it's not so common. So you get the better prices with new assets, and that is really also then the focus. And on the existing one, it's really then optimizing in the current environment. Is there a big difference between the U.S. and Europe? I wouldn't say so. So we're also seeing demand from data center providers to purchase power in Europe? No, actually not. And also, I mean, you could imagine that maybe in Europe, they would even be more bullish on buying green molecules. That's actually the same also in the U.S. Yes. So no big difference.

Olly Jeffery: The first is on debt. Obviously, it's quite a high number in Q1. We've spoken about that reversing or elements of that reversing over the rest of the year. Could you give us kind of a band where you see that net debt figure possibly landing by the year-end? That would be helpful. And the second question is just current the trading business. We had a very strong Q1, far ahead of good guidance in that business. How do you feel about the outlook for that trading business for the rest of the year? Is there a change in the development of what we've just seen in Q1? Thank you.

Michael Muller: Yes. Olly, I mean, on net debt, I guess, that is the question. The market is really interested in. I mean, look, the big movements we have seen is working capital. So we do expect that to fully revert even more over the course of the year. When we think about other elements in the financial debt, so especially on around variation margins. We also expect that to revert over the course of the year. So I mean, if you do the math and you assume that kind of we continue with the run rate of the current investments we have, that should bring you by year-end about the same order of magnitude where we currently are with net debt so therefore, kind of balance impact the temporary effect or seasonal effect and then counterbalance by continuing investments through the course of the year. Around trading, I mean, you know that we don't, our perspective is always Q1 is pretty early. So it's not the point in time where we would kind of judge on the full year, and therefore, we keep the existing guidance intact. Obviously, we are very happy with the Q1 results.

Operator: And the next question comes from Deepa of Bernstein. Please go ahead. She dropped the line. While waiting for her to requeue, we shall go to Wierzbicka of UBS.

Wierzbicka Serwinowska: Hi it's Wierzbicka Serwinowska UBS. Two questions from me. The one is on the renewables. In Plant recently, the higher returns in the renewables project versus what they expected at the CMD in 2023? And do you see a similar trend? Do you also see returns going up versus what you saw last year? And maybe if you, would you be able to disclose some items on the latest renewable projects that you are developing to give us more confidence that basically investing renewables give shareholders a better value. And the second one is on the European data centers, would you be able to disclose how much PPA in terms of the two hours have you signed so far in Europe?

Michael Muller: Yes, Deepa, First, on the returns, I mean, I would kind of stick to the numbers we have put forward at the Capital Market Day. I think the important point here, and that is something we also had in quite some discussions on the road is kind of the range we put forward is the range for what we call the hurdle rates, so that needs to be met in projects. Yes, what you typically would see there are projects that are also exceeding those returns. And actually, the way how we see the project is not to just meet the hurdle rate, but to exceed it. And therefore, that also gives me confidence that we do have really value-accretive projects that meet the return expectations and even go beyond that. I mean on data center demands to be fair, kind of the high ratio of tech companies purchasing power from us in the U.S., we don't see that yet in Europe. At the same time, we do have ongoing requests from data centers in Europe on PPAs. And we are also seeing data centers now being built up. I mean, you may have seen that there was in the press that we sold land in the RinesLiknite area to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which wants to build a data center, and they also want to build a second one, I think, in the Frankfurt area. And clearly, those data centers go along with the demand for green power. And that's actually what we're also seeing. There are requests for PPA offers, and that is something I would also expect to pick up in Germany in Europe. And if I can add one shouldn't forget that also in Europe, many of the assets that we built in onshore and solar space actors because that's a very risky, very high price alternative as well.

Wierzbicka Serwinowska: Okay. So there is no number of terawatt hours that you can give us in the for data centers in Europe in your portfolio?

Deepa Venkateswaran: I think there was a technical problem. So I don't know if anyone's already asked the question I'm about to ask. So I had 2 questions. One is you mentioned about the PPA in the U.S. for 400 megawatts. So more broadly, I wanted to see now that you've finished this quarter, what are you seeing in terms of PPA pricing, particularly versus where baseload power prices are trending both in the U.S. and Europe? And are you seeing a green premium from your buyers? So that was the first question. The second one, just a clarification on net debt. Just recapping my understanding is, on the one hand, you're guiding to a normalization on variation margin, probably more than a normalization of working capital with inflows but also you're highlighting that the CapEx run rate is similar to first Q, so around 10 billion-ish, which is probably lesser than most of us have in our model. So could you just clarify that? And does this mean also that if you're spending €10 billion this year out of the €55 billion program, then in later years, there's some farm down or something, which kind of compensates. Could you comment on that?

Michael Muller: Yes. Deepa, I mean, let's start with the net debt and then the fund- assumptions, I couldn't have phrased it better. So everything is correct what you said. And then on PPAs, I mean, look, the difficulty is, first of all, we don't communicate prices. We have contracted with customers. And the second one, PPA prices also very much depend on where they are. So I mean, if you go to some of the East Coast states, especially the more Noel, the higher the prices get so they get pretty much sometimes even to levels you see in Europe even above that. If you go to some other areas where it's easier to build renewables, but also the costs are lower price levels are lower. And then it's a question if you go for yes, unit contingents, busbar PPAs, or what's kind of the setup is. So it's difficult to say. But I mean, what is fair to say there is demand for green molecules and that is helping, yes, to achieve attractive returns in our renewable projects. And that's in the end. I mean, in the end, I don't care so much about the absolute price of the PPA. I care about the economics of the specific projects. And that is the important view, and that is indeed something where we see, as I said, meeting our return expectations and even exceeding them.

Operator: We'll now take our next question from Harry Wyburd of BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY).

Harry Wyburd: It's just 1 and a half question. Firstly, just on the debt. Could I just clarify, so you're saying that you expect year-end net debt to be where it is now at about €11 billion. Is that assuming neutral variation margin? Or is it assuming the variation margin going where it is at GBP 1.4 billion? First one and the second one, on Flexion, I just wondered, given that commodity prices have rebounded, have you seen market conditions in flexible generation also rebound in the last few weeks in line with power prices? Or have you seen a divergence in profitability there from a sort of linear relationship with power prices? And are you seeing any regional differences in Flexion if you look at some of some metrics, it suggests that the U.K. market perhaps is looking a bit weaker in terms of intraday volatility than the continence. I'd be interested to know if that's something that you've seen as well.

Michael Muller: Yes, I mean, let's first talk about the variation margins. I mean, roughly, we assume like other changes in net debt, about €2 billion to revert over the course of the year. So that's roughly the ballpark number. On flexible generation, my comment would be the following. What we see is that the intraday and they have volatility, that is clearly picking up again. So while I would say maybe the fab around that. We saw a slight deterioration here still, and then we always said that this intraday that optimization is fairly stable. I mean it was maybe down to 90% of the level we would expect. And that has clearly recovered. So we see further strengthening here. The other topic is more of what we described as kind of the time value. So what we have seen is that the overall curve has come down and especially optimizing between hours that has deteriorated. We haven't seen a significant pickup here. But what is at least important is it has stabilized. So therefore, kind of the guidance that we have out there can be clearly confirmed but clearly, with now I mean, people are also a little bit more concerned around gas. I mean, going into the winter and let's see what happens, there is clearly upside because, I mean, you know our fleet is, in the end, long volatility. So in case volatility picks up again, we would clearly benefit with our fleet there.

Operator: Thank you. Once again, as a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, if you would like to ask a question [Operator's instructions] Thank you there are no further questions in queue. I will now hand it back to Thomas for closing remarks.

Thomas Denny: Excellent. Thank you all. Thanks for the good discussion and for dialing in today. If you have further questions on any of the topics, feel free to reach out to the IR team. And apart from that, I wish you a great afternoon, and speak soon. Thank you.

CFO Michael Muller highlighted the company's adjusted EBITDA of €1.7 billion, primarily driven by favorable wind conditions and strong trading performance.

Despite an increase in net debt to €11.2 billion, due to significant investments in growth initiatives, RWE confirmed its full-year guidance at the lower end of the range. The company's issuance of U.S. green bonds marked a successful reentry into the U.S. debt market, indicating investor confidence in RWE's sustainable business model.

RWE's strategic decisions in the first quarter, such as the sell-down of DogaBank South and the acquisition of the Norfork project portfolio, demonstrate the company's focus on optimizing its offshore portfolio. The successful issuance of green bonds underscores RWE's commitment to sustainability and has been met with strong investor interest. While the company faces the challenge of increased net debt due to its growth investments, it remains confident in its financial strategy and the ability to generate attractive returns. The demand for Power Purchase Agreements, particularly for green energy, remains strong, offering RWE further opportunities in the renewable energy market. Despite some volatility and regional differences in profitability, RWE's outlook for the year remains stable, supported by its strategic investments and operational performance.

In light of RWE AG's recent financial performance and strategic initiatives, certain metrics and InvestingPro Tips can provide additional insights into the company's current standing and future prospects.

InvestingPro Data shows that RWE AG's market capitalization stands at a robust $28.82 billion USD, reflecting the company's significant presence in the energy sector.

Thomas Denny: And good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining the Q1 2024 RWE Investor Analyst Conference Call today. Our CFO, Michael Muller, will guide you through our key highlights and financial performance for the first quarter and the outlook for the current year. And with that, let me hand over to you, Michael.

Michael Muller: Yes. Thanks, Thomas, and good afternoon to all of you. First quarter was a solid start into 2024. Adjusted EBITDA stood at €1.7 billion, driven by good wind conditions in our offshore business, capacity additions in the onshore business and a good trading performance. Earnings in flexible generation were lower after exceptional market conditions in the previous year. We confirm our full year guidance at the lower end of our guidance range. We've also made significant progress on offshore portfolio optimization. We have derisked our 3 gigawatts DogaBank South project by selling down 49% to our partner Mazda, and we have acquired the highly attractive 4.2 gigawatts Norfork project portfolio from Battenfeld. These well-developed U.K. offshore projects are eligible for CFD auctions in the coming years. In April, we issued the first U.S. green bonds. With this transaction, we have successfully reentered the U.S. debt market. In the future, we want to be a regular issuer in the U.S. bond market. The USD 2 billion bond has maturities of 10 and 30 years. We saw a high demand from investors with the bonds being oversubscribed 3.8x. The final book order book volume was close to USD 7.6 billion. The high level of interest demonstrates our ability to access debt capital markets, enabling us to finance our growth investments at attractive rates. Let's now take a closer look at the Q1 2024 financials. After the exceptional earnings in the first quarter of last year, EBITDA in Q1 2024 stood at €1.7 billion, thanks to a good performance. In offshore wind, adjusted EBITDA was €548 million, and earnings were up mainly on the back of better wind conditions. Onshore Wind and Solar recorded an EBITDA of €341 million. This was driven by organic growth and the full contribution of the CEB assets. Adjusted EBITDA of the flexible generation business was €552 million. As expected, we have seen a lower earnings development in line with normalized market conditions after the exceptional year in 2023. Our Supply & Trading business had a good start into 2024, and Q1 results stood at €251 million. On the back of the strong operational performance, adjusted net income amounted to €801 million. The year-on-year adjusted financial result is almost stable. For adjusted tax, we applied the general tax rate of 20% for the RWE Group. And finally, adjusted minority interest reflects lower earnings contributions from minority partners. The adjusted operating cash flow was minus €379 million at the end of Q1 and is mostly driven by seasonal effects in operating working capital. Changes in operating working capital were marked by the seasonal purchase of CO2 certificates compensated by positive effects from the reduction of trade receivables and withdrawals for gas in storage. Net debt increased to €11.2 billion due to investments and by timing effects. In total, we invested €2.3 billion net into our grain growth. This includes the acquisition of the Norfolk offshore projects from Battenfeld and our sell-down of 49% of the Docavan-South projects to Mazda. Other changes in net financial debt amounted to €1.9 billion. This includes timing effects from hedging and trading activities. Our net position from variation margins for power generation hedging stood at minus €1.4 billion, representing an outflow of €2.8 billion. This includes net variation margins from the sale of electricity as well as purchases of the respective fuels and CO2 certificates. We expect other changes in net financial debt to revert over the course of the year. For 2024, we confirm our outlook despite the faster normalization in European commodity markets. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between €5.2 billion and €5.8 billion. Adjusted EBIT is assumed to be between €3.2 billion and €3.8 billion and net income will range from €1.9 billion to €2.4 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBIT and net income at the lower end of the guidance ranges. The dividend target is €1.1 per share for this year. And with that, let me hand back to Thomas for Q&A.

Thomas Denny: Thank you, Michael. We'll now start the Q&A session. Operator, please begin.

Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, if you would like to ask a question [Operator's instructions] we'll pause for just a moment while waiting for the queue for questions. Thank you. We'll now take our first question from Robert Pulleyn of Morgan Stanley.

Robert Pulleyn: Two questions from me, please. Firstly, revisiting a theme that's been going on a year. May we ask what benefit, if any, you're seeing from rising power demand from the data center theme, both in the U.S. and in Europe. And of course, in your European markets, what this might mean for long-term power demand trends? And secondly, if I may, given a U.S. politicians comment about offshore wind over the weekend in the U.S., may we ask how you assess the risks for that industry under the next U.S. administration from 2025. And in particular, do you see permitting risks if RWE is indeed successful in the New York and New Jersey auctions this year. And assigned to that, do those auctions have flexibility on the commissioning date would be very interesting.

Michael Muller: Yes, Rob, thanks for the question. Let's start with the data center topic, which is a hot topic currently in all the discussions. I mean, I can confirm you that we obviously are also strongly engaging with tech companies around PPAs. And actually, we are about to communicate another PPA we signed with a big tech company just recently over 400 megawatts at an attractive price. And that brings us overall to almost half of the volume of our U.S. capacities under construction being contracted to tech companies. So indeed, we do see strong interest for those companies in greening up their portfolio. And maybe that brings me also to the next aspect around offshore. I mean, obviously, we have also read the announcements. We don't have any more insights into the exact campaign. But if we look at the U.S., we see a continuing strong trend for green electrons. It's on the PPA side, we just discussed, but the same is true. I mean if you think about New York, I mean, if New York wants to decarbonize, they essentially need offshore wind. So therefore, we see the trend for offshore as yes, unbroken, so it stays intact. I mean, you already hinted to the right point. I mean, if you think about our New York portfolio, we have a lease there. And now we have the options to go into CFD auctions and to develop the project. I mean we still see demand for those projects. But at the same time, we also do have flexibility in developing the project and also looking for different offtakes. So it is something we'll observe, but it's nothing where you see me today being nervous.

Robert Pulleyn: Okay. Thank you very much.

Operator: The next question comes from Alberto Gandolfi of Goldman Sachs.

Alberto Gandolfi: Thank you, thank you for taking my questions Michael and Thomas. My first question is on guidance. If I look at your Slide 8, you're really stressing everywhere, lower end, lower and lower end. But if I take your net income for Q1 and I simply add the E.ON dividend you're due to receive, you'll be at €1 billion, so you'll be at more than 50% of the full year. So can I just ask you, I mean, in hindsight, where you to rush perhaps in downgrading guidance on the 25th of January. And again, with the benefit of hindsight, why sticking to the low end and not essentially mark to market the fact that commodities, pulp prices are going to spread have expanded a little bit, and the outlook appears even better on the horizon as we discussed, more PPAs, better returns. We are hearing from many players, power demand inflecting. So I'm just curious to see why you stick to such a cautious message. If there's anything that I'm not seeing here? And the second, I know you don't comment, but if we may not talk specifically about Amprion, but it's been reported that it's potentially for sale. But let's say, if it's not Amprion, is there anything that perhaps you may consider noncore that is perhaps for sale? And I'm quite intrigued by this route because it as far as I understand, it was besides the typical asset rotation, none of this was included in your CMD. So if you were to divest an asset that gives you proceed of a couple of periods, what would that be used for? I see that you're talking about net debt normalizing by year-end. So is RWE going to reduce leverage further. Is there a special dividend you're thinking or something else? Any cash return to shareholders? Or are you going to use this to create your own dignit foundation because perhaps the government has been dragging their feet?

Michael Muller: I mean let's start with the guidance. I mean, my comment here would be, we are just a quarter into the year. And therefore, we stick to the guidance we have put forward and also our communication towards the lower end. Yes, I think what you rightly raised is kind of the commodity markets have stabilized in the meantime. So while we went with the message in January, we saw a continuing trend of lower carbon and gas prices and therefore, power prices. I mean, that went down to kind of the minimum in Feb and since then has recovered. I mean, especially on the CO2 side, it came back to, I would say, normalized levels yet days is probably more potential going forward. But yes, I mean, market prices have stabilized, and that is obviously also helping income. I mean you saw that in our full year guidance or full year communication, we showed how much of our existing fleet in renewables is still exposed to market prices. And there is still something also in 2024, and that is benefiting from higher prices. I guess the more important topic you raised is the long-term outlook where, I mean, we always said that despite we see a quicker normalization in the first years, we continue to stick to our guidance and also our view in the later years because on the one hand side, in our plans, we already baked in a normalization of prices. And at the same time, there is also some potential improvement to come. So therefore, I would say it's too early to judge about full year, and I can just reiterate that our long-term outlook for 2027 and 2030 perfectly stays intact. Talking about Amprion, I mean, let me first say, Amprion is a financial investment, which we are very happy with. I mean they are strongly performing yet unburned tonnes with a high investment need. And therefore, it's very clear that when we discuss capital allocation, we also discuss the capital that is needed with Amprion. And therefore, that's what we communicated. We are obviously and I think that's kind of usual hygiene, you should have when looking at capital allocation are looking into options around financing and in general, loss options around Amprion. So that's the comment here. I mean the other one on divestments. Yes, you're fully right. Divestments, on the one hand side was leads to cash in and therefore, delever again. And at the same time, you should also expect book gains on those which we haven't baked into our plan. That's also very important to notice. I mean, I would consider divestments as being part of our capital allocation, yes? So therefore, I can just reiterate what we said at the full year numbers. I mean, when we look at capital allocation, we do see currently attractive returns. Clearly, projects are meeting the returns we have put forward at the Capital Market Day. Please bear also in mind this is kind of our return expectations. Obviously, every project should strive to outperform our return expectations, and that is also something we are seeing in projects where we actually see FID. So therefore, I can just confirm we do see valuable projects in our pipeline, and that is something we will consider when we look at capital allocation, including when we free up capital divestments.

Alberto Gandolfi: Michael, sorry, but if I can just clarify this point, which I think is extremely important. Thank you, all very clear by the way. Let's say you were to receive, I don't know, I'm too there a number, €1 billion in Amprion. Is your inclination to return this capital to shareholders or to put it at use somewhere else?

Michael Muller: I mean, so I wouldn't talk specifically about Ampion. I mean what we said is that when we look at capital allocation, we look at where do we see investment opportunities. We currently see attractive investment opportunities in our projects. Yet we also said that if the conditions change, returning capital, more capital to our shareholders would be in the option space and something to look at.

Peter Bisztyga: So first one, just coming back to this data center point. In ERCOT, we've seen forward curves already moved up by more than 20%. You've got, I think, 10 terawatt hours of exposure in that market. And I guess what I'm wondering is whether the clear impact of data center demand on those forward curves gives you an incentive to keep more of that business merchants going forwards? Or are you, in fact, seeing appetite for PPAs at premiums to even these higher forward prices? So that's kind of my first question. And then staying on that topic, are you seeing any difference in the premiums that data centers or hyperscalers are willing to pay for PPAs in the U.S. versus Europe, please? And are you having those kinds of conversations in Europe.

Michael Muller: Yes. Peter, happy to take the questions. I mean, first of all, ERCOT, I mean, indeed, how prices has gone up. I mean we also said that already in the course of last year, we gave the clear steer to our businesses, at least on new projects that they should go for contracted businesses. And that's I mean, we said 95% of the projects that have CODs last year were contracted and also the new assets have a high share of contracted. So that stays intact. So I wouldn't say we go for more merchants. At the same time, on the existing fleet, yes, we do see upside, and that's been part of the regular hedging activities with power prices going up. And obviously, we try to capture those business, those upsides on the existing fleets. Contracting existing assets in ERCOT, via PPA. To be honest, it's not so common. So you get the better prices with new assets, and that is really also then the focus. And on the existing one, it's really then optimizing in the current environment. Is there a big difference between the U.S. and Europe? I wouldn't say so. So we're also seeing demand from data center providers to purchase power in Europe? No, actually not. And also, I mean, you could imagine that maybe in Europe, they would even be more bullish on buying green molecules. That's actually the same also in the U.S. Yes. So no big difference.

Olly Jeffery: The first is on debt. Obviously, it's quite a high number in Q1. We've spoken about that reversing or elements of that reversing over the rest of the year. Could you give us kind of a band where you see that net debt figure possibly landing by the year-end? That would be helpful. And the second question is just current the trading business. We had a very strong Q1, far ahead of good guidance in that business. How do you feel about the outlook for that trading business for the rest of the year? Is there a change in the development of what we've just seen in Q1? Thank you.

Michael Muller: Yes. Olly, I mean, on net debt, I guess, that is the question. The market is really interested in. I mean, look, the big movements we have seen is working capital. So we do expect that to fully revert even more over the course of the year. When we think about other elements in the financial debt, so especially on around variation margins. We also expect that to revert over the course of the year. So I mean, if you do the math and you assume that kind of we continue with the run rate of the current investments we have, that should bring you by year-end about the same order of magnitude where we currently are with net debt so therefore, kind of balance impact the temporary effect or seasonal effect and then counterbalance by continuing investments through the course of the year. Around trading, I mean, you know that we don't, our perspective is always Q1 is pretty early. So it's not the point in time where we would kind of judge on the full year, and therefore, we keep the existing guidance intact. Obviously, we are very happy with the Q1 results.

Operator: And the next question comes from Deepa of Bernstein. Please go ahead. She dropped the line. While waiting for her to requeue, we shall go to Wierzbicka of UBS.

Wierzbicka Serwinowska: Hi it's Wierzbicka Serwinowska UBS. Two questions from me. The one is on the renewables. In Plant recently, the higher returns in the renewables project versus what they expected at the CMD in 2023? And do you see a similar trend? Do you also see returns going up versus what you saw last year? And maybe if you, would you be able to disclose some items on the latest renewable projects that you are developing to give us more confidence that basically investing renewables give shareholders a better value. And the second one is on the European data centers, would you be able to disclose how much PPA in terms of the two hours have you signed so far in Europe?

Michael Muller: Yes, Deepa, First, on the returns, I mean, I would kind of stick to the numbers we have put forward at the Capital Market Day. I think the important point here, and that is something we also had in quite some discussions on the road is kind of the range we put forward is the range for what we call the hurdle rates, so that needs to be met in projects. Yes, what you typically would see there are projects that are also exceeding those returns. And actually, the way how we see the project is not to just meet the hurdle rate, but to exceed it. And therefore, that also gives me confidence that we do have really value-accretive projects that meet the return expectations and even go beyond that. I mean on data center demands to be fair, kind of the high ratio of tech companies purchasing power from us in the U.S., we don't see that yet in Europe. At the same time, we do have ongoing requests from data centers in Europe on PPAs. And we are also seeing data centers now being built up. I mean, you may have seen that there was in the press that we sold land in the RinesLiknite area to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which wants to build a data center, and they also want to build a second one, I think, in the Frankfurt area. And clearly, those data centers go along with the demand for green power. And that's actually what we're also seeing. There are requests for PPA offers, and that is something I would also expect to pick up in Germany in Europe. And if I can add one shouldn't forget that also in Europe, many of the assets that we built in onshore and solar space actors because that's a very risky, very high price alternative as well.

Wierzbicka Serwinowska: Okay. So there is no number of terawatt hours that you can give us in the for data centers in Europe in your portfolio?

Deepa Venkateswaran: I think there was a technical problem. So I don't know if anyone's already asked the question I'm about to ask. So I had 2 questions. One is you mentioned about the PPA in the U.S. for 400 megawatts. So more broadly, I wanted to see now that you've finished this quarter, what are you seeing in terms of PPA pricing, particularly versus where baseload power prices are trending both in the U.S. and Europe? And are you seeing a green premium from your buyers? So that was the first question. The second one, just a clarification on net debt. Just recapping my understanding is, on the one hand, you're guiding to a normalization on variation margin, probably more than a normalization of working capital with inflows but also you're highlighting that the CapEx run rate is similar to first Q, so around 10 billion-ish, which is probably lesser than most of us have in our model. So could you just clarify that? And does this mean also that if you're spending €10 billion this year out of the €55 billion program, then in later years, there's some farm down or something, which kind of compensates. Could you comment on that?

Michael Muller: Yes. Deepa, I mean, let's start with the net debt and then the fund- assumptions, I couldn't have phrased it better. So everything is correct what you said. And then on PPAs, I mean, look, the difficulty is, first of all, we don't communicate prices. We have contracted with customers. And the second one, PPA prices also very much depend on where they are. So I mean, if you go to some of the East Coast states, especially the more Noel, the higher the prices get so they get pretty much sometimes even to levels you see in Europe even above that. If you go to some other areas where it's easier to build renewables, but also the costs are lower price levels are lower. And then it's a question if you go for yes, unit contingents, busbar PPAs, or what's kind of the setup is. So it's difficult to say. But I mean, what is fair to say there is demand for green molecules and that is helping, yes, to achieve attractive returns in our renewable projects. And that's in the end. I mean, in the end, I don't care so much about the absolute price of the PPA. I care about the economics of the specific projects. And that is the important view, and that is indeed something where we see, as I said, meeting our return expectations and even exceeding them.

Operator: We'll now take our next question from Harry Wyburd of BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY).

Harry Wyburd: It's just 1 and a half question. Firstly, just on the debt. Could I just clarify, so you're saying that you expect year-end net debt to be where it is now at about €11 billion. Is that assuming neutral variation margin? Or is it assuming the variation margin going where it is at GBP 1.4 billion? First one and the second one, on Flexion, I just wondered, given that commodity prices have rebounded, have you seen market conditions in flexible generation also rebound in the last few weeks in line with power prices? Or have you seen a divergence in profitability there from a sort of linear relationship with power prices? And are you seeing any regional differences in Flexion if you look at some of some metrics, it suggests that the U.K. market perhaps is looking a bit weaker in terms of intraday volatility than the continence. I'd be interested to know if that's something that you've seen as well.

Michael Muller: Yes, I mean, let's first talk about the variation margins. I mean, roughly, we assume like other changes in net debt, about €2 billion to revert over the course of the year. So that's roughly the ballpark number. On flexible generation, my comment would be the following. What we see is that the intraday and they have volatility, that is clearly picking up again. So while I would say maybe the fab around that. We saw a slight deterioration here still, and then we always said that this intraday that optimization is fairly stable. I mean it was maybe down to 90% of the level we would expect. And that has clearly recovered. So we see further strengthening here. The other topic is more of what we described as kind of the time value. So what we have seen is that the overall curve has come down and especially optimizing between hours that has deteriorated. We haven't seen a significant pickup here. But what is at least important is it has stabilized. So therefore, kind of the guidance that we have out there can be clearly confirmed but clearly, with now I mean, people are also a little bit more concerned around gas. I mean, going into the winter and let's see what happens, there is clearly upside because, I mean, you know our fleet is, in the end, long volatility. So in case volatility picks up again, we would clearly benefit with our fleet there.

REW, a German-based energy group, has announced plans to build a new green hydrogen plant in Grangemouth on the site of the current petrol refinery station operated by Ineos.

The company has secured a grid connection as well as shortlisting electrolyser suppliers as the project is hoped to make a positive impact towards the Scottish Government's Net Zero ambitions.

The current plans propose to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at the site and the initial projected capacity is to be up to 200MWe, with the ambition to potentially produce up to 3.6 tonnes of hydrogen per hour in future expansions.

Initial plans aim to have the site operational by 2029 with the next steps being submitting a planning application and running consultations on the project with local communities.

Sopna Sury, the chief operating officer at Hydrogen RWE Generation, said the project aligns with the Scottish Government's vision of a Just Transition and will put Scotland at the forefront of the green revolution.

She said: ""This is a significant step towards RWE's ambitions for the production of green hydrogen in Scotland.

""As one of the world's leading energy companies, RWE has significant experience in onshore and offshore wind, developing green hydrogen production plants and operating large-scale gas plants.

""This project at Grangemouth aligns with the Scottish Government's vision for a 'Just Transition', putting Scotland at the forefront of the green revolution while protecting jobs and decarbonising Grangemouth.""

Colin Pritchard, sustainability director at the Ineos Grangemouth site, said the proposed plans for the green hydrogen plant will place Grangemouth firmly at the heart of Scotland's future.

He said: ""We are pleased to support RWE in their investment in green hydrogen at our site in Grangemouth

""This perfectly augments our project to develop a low-carbon (blue) hydrogen production unit at Grangemouth, with the CO2 exported deep underground in the North Sea via the Acorn transport and storage system.

""Together these projects support delivery of our net zero roadmap and place Grangemouth at the heart of Scotland's future hydrogen economy.""",www-tmp.thenational.scot,news,The National,,0.2549019607843137,453511528,13,https://www.thenational.scot/resources/images/18082991/,

And good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining the Q1 2024 RWE Investor Analyst Conference Call today. Our CFO, Michael Muller, will guide you through our key highlights and financial performance for the first quarter and the outlook for the current year. And with that, let me hand over to you, Michael.

Michael Muller

Yes. Thanks, Thomas, and good afternoon to all of you. First quarter was a solid start into 2024. Adjusted EBITDA stood at €1.7 billion, driven by good wind conditions in our offshore business, capacity additions in the onshore business and a good trading performance. Earnings in flexible generation were lower after exceptional market conditions in the previous year.

We confirm our full year guidance at the lower end of our guidance range. We've also made significant progress on offshore portfolio optimization. We have derisked our 3 gigawatts DogaBank South project by selling down 49% to our partner Mazda, and we have acquired the highly attractive 4.2 gigawatts Norfork project portfolio from Battenfeld. These well-developed U.K. offshore projects are eligible for CFD auctions in the coming years.

In April, we issued the first U.S. green bonds. With this transaction, we have successfully reentered the U.S. debt market. In the future, we want to be a regular issuer in the U.S. bond market. The USD 2 billion bond has maturities of 10 and 30 years. We saw a high demand from investors with the bonds being oversubscribed 3.8x. The final book order book volume was close to USD 7.6 billion. The high level of interest demonstrates our ability to access debt capital markets, enabling us to finance our growth investments at attractive rates.

Let's now take a closer look at the Q1 2024 financials. After the exceptional earnings in the first quarter of last year, EBITDA in Q1 2024 stood at €1.7 billion, thanks to a good performance. In offshore wind, adjusted EBITDA was €548 million, and earnings were up mainly on the back of better wind conditions. Onshore Wind and Solar recorded an EBITDA of €341 million. This was driven by organic growth and the full contribution of the CEB assets. Adjusted EBITDA of the flexible generation business was €552 million.

As expected, we have seen a lower earnings development in line with normalized market conditions after the exceptional year in 2023. Our Supply & Trading business had a good start into 2024, and Q1 results stood at €251 million. On the back of the strong operational performance, adjusted net income amounted to €801 million. The year-on-year adjusted financial result is almost stable. For adjusted tax, we applied the general tax rate of 20% for the RWE Group.

And finally, adjusted minority interest reflects lower earnings contributions from minority partners. The adjusted operating cash flow was minus €379 million at the end of Q1 and is mostly driven by seasonal effects in operating working capital. Changes in operating working capital were marked by the seasonal purchase of CO2 certificates compensated by positive effects from the reduction of trade receivables and withdrawals for gas in storage. Net debt increased to €11.2 billion due to investments and by timing effects. In total, we invested €2.3 billion net into our grain growth.

This includes the acquisition of the Norfolk offshore projects from Battenfeld and our sell-down of 49% of the Docavan-South projects to Mazda. Other changes in net financial debt amounted to €1.9 billion. This includes timing effects from hedging and trading activities. Our net position from variation margins for power generation hedging stood at minus €1.4 billion, representing an outflow of €2.8 billion. This includes net variation margins from the sale of electricity as well as purchases of the respective fuels and CO2 certificates.

We expect other changes in net financial debt to revert over the course of the year. For 2024, we confirm our outlook despite the faster normalization in European commodity markets. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between €5.2 billion and €5.8 billion. Adjusted EBIT is assumed to be between €3.2 billion and €3.8 billion and net income will range from €1.9 billion to €2.4 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBIT and net income at the lower end of the guidance ranges. The dividend target is €1.1 per share for this year.

Thank you, Michael. We'll now start the Q&A session. Operator, please begin.

Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, if you would like to ask a question [Operator's instructions] we'll pause for just a moment while waiting for the queue for questions. Thank you. We'll now take our first question from Robert Pulleyn of Morgan Stanley.

Robert Pulleyn

Two questions from me, please. Firstly, revisiting a theme that's been going on a year. May we ask what benefit, if any, you're seeing from rising power demand from the data center theme, both in the U.S. and in Europe. And of course, in your European markets, what this might mean for long-term power demand trends?

And secondly, if I may, given a U.S. politicians comment about offshore wind over the weekend in the U.S., may we ask how you assess the risks for that industry under the next U.S. administration from 2025. And in particular, do you see permitting risks if RWE is indeed successful in the New York and New Jersey auctions this year. And assigned to that, do those auctions have flexibility on the commissioning date would be very interesting.

Michael Muller

Yes, Rob, thanks for the question. Let's start with the data center topic, which is a hot topic currently in all the discussions. I mean, I can confirm you that we obviously are also strongly engaging with tech companies around PPAs. And actually, we are about to communicate another PPA we signed with a big tech company just recently over 400 megawatts at an attractive price. And that brings us overall to almost half of the volume of our U.S. capacities under construction being contracted to tech companies. So indeed, we do see strong interest for those companies in greening up their portfolio. And maybe that brings me also to the next aspect around offshore. I mean, obviously, we have also read the announcements. We don't have any more insights into the exact campaign.

But if we look at the U.S., we see a continuing strong trend for green electrons. It's on the PPA side, we just discussed, but the same is true. I mean if you think about New York, I mean, if New York wants to decarbonize, they essentially need offshore wind. So therefore, we see the trend for offshore as yes, unbroken, so it stays intact. I mean, you already hinted to the right point.

I mean, if you think about our New York portfolio, we have a lease there. And now we have the options to go into CFD auctions and to develop the project. I mean we still see demand for those projects. But at the same time, we also do have flexibility in developing the project and also looking for different offtakes. So it is something we'll observe, but it's nothing where you see me today being nervous.

The next question comes from Alberto Gandolfi of Goldman Sachs.

Alberto Gandolfi

Thank you, thank you for taking my questions Michael and Thomas. My first question is on guidance. If I look at your Slide 8, you're really stressing everywhere, lower end, lower and lower end. But if I take your net income for Q1 and I simply add the E.ON dividend you're due to receive, you'll be at €1 billion, so you'll be at more than 50% of the full year. So can I just ask you, I mean, in hindsight, where you to rush perhaps in downgrading guidance on the 25th of January.

And again, with the benefit of hindsight, why sticking to the low end and not essentially mark to market the fact that commodities, pulp prices are going to spread have expanded a little bit, and the outlook appears even better on the horizon as we discussed, more PPAs, better returns. We are hearing from many players, power demand inflecting. So I'm just curious to see why you stick to such a cautious message. If there's anything that I'm not seeing here? And the second, I know you don't comment, but if we may not talk specifically about Amprion, but it's been reported that it's potentially for sale.

But let's say, if it's not Amprion, is there anything that perhaps you may consider noncore that is perhaps for sale? And I'm quite intrigued by this route because it as far as I understand, it was besides the typical asset rotation, none of this was included in your CMD. So if you were to divest an asset that gives you proceed of a couple of periods, what would that be used for? I see that you're talking about net debt normalizing by year-end. So is RWE going to reduce leverage further.

Is there a special dividend you're thinking or something else? Any cash return to shareholders? Or are you going to use this to create your own dignit foundation because perhaps the government has been dragging their feet?

Michael Muller

Yes, Albert, you ask now for a complete strategic review.

I mean let's start with the guidance. I mean, my comment here would be, we are just a quarter into the year. And therefore, we stick to the guidance we have put forward and also our communication towards the lower end. Yes, I think what you rightly raised is kind of the commodity markets have stabilized in the meantime. So while we went with the message in January, we saw a continuing trend of lower carbon and gas prices and therefore, power prices.

I mean, that went down to kind of the minimum in Feb and since then has recovered. I mean, especially on the CO2 side, it came back to, I would say, normalized levels yet days is probably more potential going forward. But yes, I mean, market prices have stabilized, and that is obviously also helping income. I mean you saw that in our full year guidance or full year communication, we showed how much of our existing fleet in renewables is still exposed to market prices. And there is still something also in 2024, and that is benefiting from higher prices.

I guess the more important topic you raised is the long-term outlook where, I mean, we always said that despite we see a quicker normalization in the first years, we continue to stick to our guidance and also our view in the later years because on the one hand side, in our plans, we already baked in a normalization of prices. And at the same time, there is also some potential improvement to come. So therefore, I would say it's too early to judge about full year, and I can just reiterate that our long-term outlook for 2027 and 2030 perfectly stays intact. Talking about Amprion, I mean, let me first say, Amprion is a financial investment, which we are very happy with. I mean they are strongly performing yet unburned tonnes with a high investment need.

And therefore, it's very clear that when we discuss capital allocation, we also discuss the capital that is needed with Amprion. And therefore, that's what we communicated. We are obviously and I think that's kind of usual hygiene, you should have when looking at capital allocation are looking into options around financing and in general, loss options around Amprion. So that's the comment here. I mean the other one on divestments. Yes, you're fully right.

Divestments, on the one hand side was leads to cash in and therefore, delever again. And at the same time, you should also expect book gains on those which we haven't baked into our plan. That's also very important to notice. I mean, I would consider divestments as being part of our capital allocation, yes? So therefore, I can just reiterate what we said at the full year numbers.

I mean, when we look at capital allocation, we do see currently attractive returns. Clearly, projects are meeting the returns we have put forward at the Capital Market Day. Please bear also in mind this is kind of our return expectations. Obviously, every project should strive to outperform our return expectations, and that is also something we are seeing in projects where we actually see FID. So therefore, I can just confirm we do see valuable projects in our pipeline, and that is something we will consider when we look at capital allocation, including when we free up capital divestments.

Alberto Gandolfi

Michael, sorry, but if I can just clarify this point, which I think is extremely important. Thank you, all very clear by the way. Let's say you were to receive, I don't know, I'm too there a number, €1 billion in Amprion. Is your inclination to return this capital to shareholders or to put it at use somewhere else?

Michael Muller

I mean, so I wouldn't talk specifically about Ampion. I mean what we said is that when we look at capital allocation, we look at where do we see investment opportunities. We currently see attractive investment opportunities in our projects. Yet we also said that if the conditions change, returning capital, more capital to our shareholders would be in the option space and something to look at.

The next question comes from Peter Bisztyga of Bank of America.

Peter Bisztyga

So first one, just coming back to this data center point. In ERCOT, we've seen forward curves already moved up by more than 20%. You've got, I think, 10 terawatt hours of exposure in that market. And I guess what I'm wondering is whether the clear impact of data center demand on those forward curves gives you an incentive to keep more of that business merchants going forwards? Or are you, in fact, seeing appetite for PPAs at premiums to even these higher forward prices?

So that's kind of my first question. And then staying on that topic, are you seeing any difference in the premiums that data centers or hyperscalers are willing to pay for PPAs in the U.S. versus Europe, please? And are you having those kinds of conversations in Europe.

Michael Muller

Yes. Peter, happy to take the questions. I mean, first of all, ERCOT, I mean, indeed, how prices has gone up. I mean we also said that already in the course of last year, we gave the clear steer to our businesses, at least on new projects that they should go for contracted businesses. And that's I mean, we said 95% of the projects that have CODs last year were contracted and also the new assets have a high share of contracted.

So that stays intact. So I wouldn't say we go for more merchants. At the same time, on the existing fleet, yes, we do see upside, and that's been part of the regular hedging activities with power prices going up. And obviously, we try to capture those business, those upsides on the existing fleets. Contracting existing assets in ERCOT, via PPA.

To be honest, it's not so common. So you get the better prices with new assets, and that is really also then the focus. And on the existing one, it's really then optimizing in the current environment. Is there a big difference between the U.S. and Europe?

I wouldn't say so. So we're also seeing demand from data center providers to purchase power in Europe? No, actually not. And also, I mean, you could imagine that maybe in Europe, they would even be more bullish on buying green molecules. That's actually the same also in the U.S.

And the next question comes from Olly Jeffrey of Deutsche Bank.

Olly Jeffery

The first is on debt. Obviously, it's quite a high number in Q1. We've spoken about that reversing or elements of that reversing over the rest of the year. Could you give us kind of a band where you see that net debt figure possibly landing by the year-end? That would be helpful.

And the second question is just current the trading business. We had a very strong Q1, far ahead of good guidance in that business. How do you feel about the outlook for that trading business for the rest of the year? Is there a change in the development of what we've just seen in Q1? Thank you.

Michael Muller

Yes. Olly, I mean, on net debt, I guess, that is the question. The market is really interested in. I mean, look, the big movements we have seen is working capital. So we do expect that to fully revert even more over the course of the year.

When we think about other elements in the financial debt, so especially on around variation margins. We also expect that to revert over the course of the year. So I mean, if you do the math and you assume that kind of we continue with the run rate of the current investments we have, that should bring you by year-end about the same order of magnitude where we currently are with net debt so therefore, kind of balance impact the temporary effect or seasonal effect and then counterbalance by continuing investments through the course of the year. Around trading, I mean, you know that we don't, our perspective is always Q1 is pretty early. So it's not the point in time where we would kind of judge on the full year, and therefore, we keep the existing guidance intact.

And the next question comes from Deepa of Bernstein. Please go ahead. She dropped the line. While waiting for her to requeue, we shall go to Wierzbicka of UBS.

Wierzbicka Serwinowska

Hi it's Wierzbicka Serwinowska UBS. Two questions from me. The one is on the renewables. In Plant recently, the higher returns in the renewables project versus what they expected at the CMD in 2023? And do you see a similar trend?

Do you also see returns going up versus what you saw last year? And maybe if you, would you be able to disclose some items on the latest renewable projects that you are developing to give us more confidence that basically investing renewables give shareholders a better value. And the second one is on the European data centers, would you be able to disclose how much PPA in terms of the two hours have you signed so far in Europe?

Michael Muller

Yes, Deepa, First, on the returns, I mean, I would kind of stick to the numbers we have put forward at the Capital Market Day. I think the important point here, and that is something we also had in quite some discussions on the road is kind of the range we put forward is the range for what we call the hurdle rates, so that needs to be met in projects. Yes, what you typically would see there are projects that are also exceeding those returns. And actually, the way how we see the project is not to just meet the hurdle rate, but to exceed it. And therefore, that also gives me confidence that we do have really value-accretive projects that meet the return expectations and even go beyond that.

I mean on data center demands to be fair, kind of the high ratio of tech companies purchasing power from us in the U.S., we don't see that yet in Europe. At the same time, we do have ongoing requests from data centers in Europe on PPAs. And we are also seeing data centers now being built up. I mean, you may have seen that there was in the press that we sold land in the RinesLiknite area to Microsoft, which wants to build a data center, and they also want to build a second one, I think, in the Frankfurt area. And clearly, those data centers go along with the demand for green power.

And that's actually what we're also seeing. There are requests for PPA offers, and that is something I would also expect to pick up in Germany in Europe. And if I can add one shouldn't forget that also in Europe, many of the assets that we built in onshore and solar space actors because that's a very risky, very high price alternative as well.

Wierzbicka Serwinowska

Okay. So there is no number of terawatt hours that you can give us in the for data centers in Europe in your portfolio?

And we'll now take our next question from Deepa of Bernstein.

Deepa Venkateswaran

I think there was a technical problem. So I don't know if anyone's already asked the question I'm about to ask. So I had 2 questions. One is you mentioned about the PPA in the U.S. for 400 megawatts.

So more broadly, I wanted to see now that you've finished this quarter, what are you seeing in terms of PPA pricing, particularly versus where baseload power prices are trending both in the U.S. and Europe? And are you seeing a green premium from your buyers? So that was the first question. The second one, just a clarification on net debt.

Just recapping my understanding is, on the one hand, you're guiding to a normalization on variation margin, probably more than a normalization of working capital with inflows but also you're highlighting that the CapEx run rate is similar to first Q, so around 10 billion-ish, which is probably lesser than most of us have in our model. So could you just clarify that? And does this mean also that if you're spending €10 billion this year out of the €55 billion program, then in later years, there's some farm down or something, which kind of compensates. Could you comment on that?

Michael Muller

Yes. Deepa, I mean, let's start with the net debt and then the fund- assumptions, I couldn't have phrased it better. So everything is correct what you said. And then on PPAs, I mean, look, the difficulty is, first of all, we don't communicate prices. We have contracted with customers.

And the second one, PPA prices also very much depend on where they are. So I mean, if you go to some of the East Coast states, especially the more Noel, the higher the prices get so they get pretty much sometimes even to levels you see in Europe even above that. If you go to some other areas where it's easier to build renewables, but also the costs are lower price levels are lower. And then it's a question if you go for yes, unit contingents, busbar PPAs, or what's kind of the setup is. So it's difficult to say.

But I mean, what is fair to say there is demand for green molecules and that is helping, yes, to achieve attractive returns in our renewable projects. And that's in the end. I mean, in the end, I don't care so much about the absolute price of the PPA. I care about the economics of the specific projects. And that is the important view, and that is indeed something where we see, as I said, meeting our return expectations and even exceeding them.

We'll now take our next question from Harry Wyburd of BNP Paribas.

Harry Wyburd

It's just 1 and a half question. Firstly, just on the debt. Could I just clarify, so you're saying that you expect year-end net debt to be where it is now at about €11 billion. Is that assuming neutral variation margin? Or is it assuming the variation margin going where it is at GBP 1.4 billion?

First one and the second one, on Flexion, I just wondered, given that commodity prices have rebounded, have you seen market conditions in flexible generation also rebound in the last few weeks in line with power prices? Or have you seen a divergence in profitability there from a sort of linear relationship with power prices? And are you seeing any regional differences in Flexion if you look at some of some metrics, it suggests that the U.K. market perhaps is looking a bit weaker in terms of intraday volatility than the continence. I'd be interested to know if that's something that you've seen as well.

Michael Muller

Yes, I mean, let's first talk about the variation margins. I mean, roughly, we assume like other changes in net debt, about €2 billion to revert over the course of the year. So that's roughly the ballpark number. On flexible generation, my comment would be the following. What we see is that the intraday and they have volatility, that is clearly picking up again.

So while I would say maybe the fab around that. We saw a slight deterioration here still, and then we always said that this intraday that optimization is fairly stable. I mean it was maybe down to 90% of the level we would expect. And that has clearly recovered. So we see further strengthening here.

The other topic is more of what we described as kind of the time value. So what we have seen is that the overall curve has come down and especially optimizing between hours that has deteriorated. We haven't seen a significant pickup here. But what is at least important is it has stabilized. So therefore, kind of the guidance that we have out there can be clearly confirmed but clearly, with now I mean, people are also a little bit more concerned around gas.

I mean, going into the winter and let's see what happens, there is clearly upside because, I mean, you know our fleet is, in the end, long volatility. So in case volatility picks up again, we would clearly benefit with our fleet there.

Thank you. Once again, as a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, if you would like to ask a question [Operator's instructions] Thank you there are no further questions in queue. I will now hand it back to Thomas for closing remarks.

Thomas Denny

Excellent. Thank you all. Thanks for the good discussion and for dialing in today. If you have further questions on any of the topics, feel free to reach out to the IR team.

Oil futures settled higher Wednesday, buoyed by a second straight weekly decline in U.S. crude supplies, as a slowdown in the U.S. inflation rate lifted prospects for interest-rate cuts and the potential for stronger energy demand.

Latin America's biggest oil producer Petrobras announced the exit of its CEO Jean Paul Prates, the fifth head of the company to be fired or quit in three years as the government battles for greater control over the group.

The outlook for higher electricity demand is lifting share prices to new heights at Vistra, NRG and Constellation Energy.

The International Energy Agency cut its forecast for oil-demand growth this year as subdued industrial activity and mild winter temperatures reduced gasoil consumption across some of the world's largest economies, particularly in Europe.

With an initial capacity of 200 megawatts of electricity (MWe), the plant could potentially produce 3.6 metric tons/hour of hydrogen when it comes online by 2029. RWE aims to expand the capacity to 600MWe in the future.

The first customer for the green hydrogen produced will be INEOS Grangemouth.

RWE will assist the chemical company in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and supporting its Net Zero 2045 target. The plant will be strategically located within the Grangemouth industrial complex, adjacent to the INEOS facility.

The energy producer has already completed crucial preparatory work, including concept, feasibility, and pre-Front-End Engineering Design (FEED) studies. A gridconnection is secured, and the company is currently shortlisting electrolyzersuppliers.

RWE is working on a planning application for the site, involving local community consultation.

Network industries, including electricity, natural gas, rail transportation and telecommunications, consist of potentially competitive activities, such as electricity generation, with naturally monopolistic ones, such as transmission and distribution of electricity. This combination produces a unique set of challenges to competition law and policy in designing a market structure and regulatory framework which maximise the benefits of liberalisation while effectively controlling any tendencies to monopolistic abuse. Mumbai, India where parallel licencing in electricity retail was introduced unintentionally illustrates this challenge.

The Electricity Act 2003 (EA 2003) provides for opening up electricity distribution to the private sector. Section 14 of EA 2003 which allows parallel licencing states that ""the appropriate commission may grant a licence to two or more persons for distribution of electricity through their own distribution system within the same area, subject to the conditions that the applicant for grant of licence. The grant of the licence within the same area, subject to the conditions that the applicant for grant of licence within the same area shall, without prejudice to the other conditions or requirements under this Act, comply with the additional requirements (including the capital adequacy, credit-worthiness, or code of conduct) as may be prescribed by the Central Government, and no such applicant who complies with all the requirements for grant of licence, shall be refused grant of licence on the ground that there already exists a licensee in the same area for the same purpose"".

Parallel licensing in Mumbai was initiated not through policy or a careful reading of Section 14 of EA 2003, but through litigation over power purchase agreements (PPAs) between existing players when EA 2003 was enacted. Analysis of the outcome may be seen both as a muddle or a model for delicencing electricity retail across India in the future.

The ""muddle"" lens of the electricity delicencing experiment in Mumbai exposes sub-optimal outcomes for customers and complex challenges for regulators, who need to balance the interests of the licensees and those of the consumers, and also for the judiciary that has to interpret Section 14 and related provisions of EA 2003. Despite multiple regulatory and judicial interventions since 2008, expected outcome of competitive tariff for consumers has not materialised. In addition, issues of cherry picking of consumers by one distribution licensee (DL) in the area served by the other, disputes over duplication of distribution networks, cherry picking of consumers, use of networks owned by one licensee by the other, and over cross subsidies over use of the distribution network, power purchase agreements (PPAs) continue to persist along with other challenges.

Since the introduction of parallel licencing in 2008, Tata Power Corporation -- Distribution (TPCD) and Reliance Infrastructure Distribution (erstwhile Bombay Suburban Electric Supply Limited or BSES, later acquired by Reliance Infrastructure limited [Rinfra] which was taken over by Adani Electricity Mumbai Limited [AEML] in 2017), the Brihanmumbai Electric Supply & Transport [BEST] and Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Corporation Limited [MSEDCL] have indulged in legal conflict over the interpretation of provisions in section 14 of EA 2003.

In 2008, the Supreme Court held that TPCD, that was a bulk supplier of electricity in Mumbai and was entitled to supply electricity in retail, directly to all consumers within its area of supply, as stipulated in its licences following provisions of EA 2003. Subsequently, the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC) confirmed TPCD as a DL for the entire city of Mumbai, covering the licence areas of both BEST and Rinfra. TPCD's distribution licence was valid up to August 2014. In 2014, TPCD secured a licence to distribute electricity in the entire Mumbai district, part of the Mumbai suburban district and the entire municipal corporation area(legally contested). The distribution licence (DL) was granted for a period of 25 years effective from August 2014 till August 2039. The DL covered an area overlapping the entire licensed area of Rinfra, BEST and MSEDCL.

Historically, TPCD was a power generator and bulk supplier of power in Mumbai. One of the bulk power purchasers with whom TPCD had signed PPAs was Rinfra. This relationship created unique challenges when TPCD entered distribution. As TPCD had access to low-cost power, it was able to offer lower tariffs to consumers in areas where it was a parallel licensee. This facilitated bulk consumers and eventually also domestic consumers to switch suppliers from Rinfra to TPCD. This was an intended outcome. However, TPCD had no incentive to supply power to Rinfra at competitive rates. This imposed additional costs on Rinfra in securing PPAs with alternative suppliers. For its part, Rinfra could impose wheeling charges on TPCD for transporting electricity on behalf of TPCD on its distribution network. These issues were part of the legal conflict between the players in the arena. The prospect of TPCD building its own distribution network, thus duplicating the existing network controlled by Rinfra was another contested issue. The result was a patchwork of temporary solutions imposed by the regulatory and other institutions such as cost plus mechanism for tariff determination. The cost-plus mechanism allowed parallel distributers in Mumbai to source expensive power purchased through short-term power markets and pass on the costs to the consumer. Customer interest was compromised as the cost of power procured through short-term markets was typically higher than that of power purchased through long-term PPAs. Customers also had to bear the risk of uncertainty in tariffs when a large share of the power supplied was procured through short-term markets. Structural barriers such as limitation in transmission capacity limited low-cost power procurement from outside the Mumbai area through competitive bidding. This meant a higher average tariff for consumers. When regulated tariff did not permit full cost recovery, DLs transformed unrecovered costs into regulatory assets, essentially costs recoverable from customers in the future through regulated tariffs. This was not an intended outcome of competition in retail electricity. Seen through the ""muddle"" lens, parallel licensing in Mumbai highlights inequitable outcomes for consumers reflected in high and uncertain tariffs and sub-optimal consequences of regulatory inadequacy reflected in incessant litigation. This is not an outcome that one would expect in Mumbai which exhibits high household density (number of consumers per unit area), a distribution network that is mostly underground that reduces losses, few agricultural consumers and higher household incomes compared to most of the rest of India all of which contribute to lower distribution losses and greater tolerance for higher electricity tariff. And yet parallel licencing has not been a great success.

The ""model"" lens highlights the introduction of private players in electricity distribution and the consequent improvement in the financial and technical efficiency of their operations. Even small improvements in the economic and technical efficiency of operations of private licensees' stands in contrast to the persistent underperformance of state-run distribution companies (discoms) that are forced to carry social burdens (sustaining employment and subsidies). The annual integrated rating and ranking of power sector utilities by power finance corporation (PFC) rates distribution companies on parameters based on (i) financial sustainability (average cost of supply[ACS]-annual revenue realised [ARR], days receivable, days payable to gencos and transcos, adjusted quick ratio, debt service coverage ratio, leverage [debt/earnings before interest, tax and amortization]) (ii) performance (distribution loss, billing efficiency, collection efficiency, corporate governance and (iii) external environment (subsidy realised, loss taken over by state government, government dues, tariff cycle timelines and auto pass-through of fuel costs). In the 12 annual rating and ranking of distribution companies for 2023, six out of the top ten ranks go to private companies and the top rank and rating goes to one of the parallel licensees in Mumbai, Adani Energy Mumbai Limited (AEML). AEML serves 7 divisions of Mumbai city and serves over 3 million retail customers. It has no agricultural consumers and over 14 percent of its customers are from the commercial & industrial segments. AEML had a billing efficiency of 93.7 percent and collection efficiency of 99.8 percent. Its days receivable was 17 and days payable was 38. The aggregate technical and commercial losses (AT&C) in the areas served by AEML fell from 11 percent to about 6 percent over 5 years. AEML also claims that it has increased the share of renewables from 3 percent to over 30 percent with 50,000 green tariff customers. In 2023, applications of Adani Electricity Navi Mumbai (AENML) and Torrent Power Ltd (TPL) were pending before MERC for parallel licences in the jurisdiction of the MSEDCL illustrating the attractiveness of the business for private players.

Since the implementation of parallel licencing in Mumbai, structural issues that contributed to the ""muddle"" have improved substantially. There are a number of options for retail distributers to source power as constraints in transmission have been resolved. This has eliminated the need for cost-plus regulation of tariff. Overall tariff and uncertainty over tariff have reduced for domestic retail consumers. Consumer experience with billing and exercise of choice has also improved substantially with introduction of new technology. Separation of carriage (wires) and content (electricity) is yet to materialise physically but it is functioning in practice with the use of distribution network common to all the DLs who pay wheeling charges. The two private parallel licensees TPCD and AEML have no regulatory assets as of 2022, and their financial sustainability is among the best in the country. However, this does not mean that the parallel licencing muddle is now a model for the rest of the country. Unique features of Mumbai city that include high density with no agricultural consumers, greater incomes that can accommodate higher tariff and a long history of private sector presence in generation and distribution that are critical to accommodating parallel licencing cannot be replicated across the country. In many states agricultural or subsidised consumption of electricity is dominant and incumbent distribution companies are saddled with high levels of debt. The Mumbai model demonstrates the tendency of DLs to ""vertically integrate"" with their own sister concerns that generate power. This has the potential to limit the benefits of competition in retail particularly in the context of reducing tariff. The fact that there is no fully evolved wholesale market for power procurement along with the fact that there is no market for fuels (coal, natural gas, hydro, nuclear, renewables) has limited reduction in tariff, one of the key benefits of competition.

Regulation is necessary, because in most cities or States in India, no more than two or three DLs are likely to compete. This would be oligopolistic competition with limited benefits. The complexities in sourcing power in the early stages of introducing parallel licencing in Mumbai clearly highlights that wholesale competition must be in place before retail competition is introduced across the nation. In the case of Mumbai, retail competitor Rinfra was dependent upon its retail rival TPCD for its electricity supply. This created a price squeeze situation. Judiciary and regulatory interventions were inadequate in addressing price squeeze. Competition continues to be limited to a struggle for customers between privately owned and publicly-owned DLs in Mumbai. The arena for competition should be expanded, as the wireless telecommunications industry illustrates, to offer benefits to consumers not obtainable from regulation alone. Studies have shown that the only successful regulation of electric utilities has been to introduce competition and competitive interaction that eliminates the need for regulation. In mature electricity markets, distribution utilities exposed to true competition have lowered prices and gained sales. More crucially, their finances have met the regulatory test of attracting capital for expansion. In a number of cases, rates of return have risen and exceeded those of comparable companies not under competition. The key lesson from the Mumbai muddle is for legislators, regulators, and courts to recognize that regulation is not a substitute for competition, but rather is an adjunct to competition.

According to Union Ministry of Power, peak power demand in India is likely to cross 400 GW (gigawatt) by 2030 and more generation capacity is being set up to meet the rising demand. Electricity is the most important infrastructure which is a sine qua non for development, it said. One major distinguishing feature between a developing and a developed country is that in a developed country, there is no load shedding. It said that the nation will add enough capacity to meet this burgeoning demand.

The national capital's peak power demand recorded an all-time high winter power demand, reaching 5,816 megawatt (MW) - the highest ever for the winter months, surpassing the previous record of 5,798 MW set on 19 January. Remarkably, this is the sixth instance in January when Delhi's power demand exceeded last year's peak winter demand of 5,526 MW, recorded on 6 January 2023. Barring 2 January, the city's peak demand has consistently surpassed 5,000 MW every day this month so far. The surge in power demand comes on the back of a cold wave across northern India. In the areas served by BSES Rajdhani Power Ltd (BRPL) and BSES Yamuna Power Ltd (BYPL), peak demand reached 2,526 MW and 1,209 MW, respectively. As per the Tata Power Delhi Distribution Ltd, it met its highest winter peak power demand of 1,826 MW.

The 4,000 MW power project -- Patratu Vidyut Utpadan Nigam Limited (PVUNL) -- a joint venture of the NTPC Ltd and the Jharkhand Bijli Vitaran Nigam Limited (JBVNL) formed after scrapping the old Patratu Thermal Power Station (PTPS) will bring a revolutionary change in the power sector of Jharkhand, making it self-sufficient in terms of power requirement. According to the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed between the NTPC and the JBVNL, 85 percent of the power produced from PVUNL will be supplied to Jharkhand. The mega power plant conceived in 2016 will comprise five units of 800 MW each and will be commissioned in two phases -- 2,400 MWs (3x800 MW) in the first phase and 1,600 MWs (2x800) in the second phase.

Discom Reform

A roadmap to eliminating power cuts, which has eluded the Noida city (Uttar Pradesh) for decades even as it has grown manifold - both in terms of economy and population - is finally taking shape. The Noida Authority has allocated INR2 billion (bn) (US$24.1 million (mn)) for a pilot project to move power transmission lines under the ground in three sectors -- 3, 15A and 47. Apart from these sectors, the Authority will shift 11 kV (kilovolt) and 33 kV lines underground in some other areas of the city where roads are undergoing a revamp. Occurring almost daily, power cuts have stood out as a sore point in Noida's concerted push to promote the NCR city as a business destination.

Polaris Smart Metering has secured two smart meter projects totalling INR52 bn (US$627.4 mn) in Uttar Pradesh. Madhyanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam Limited (MVVNL) has awarded the contracts for installing over 5.1 million smart meters in the important clusters of Lucknow and Ayodhya/Devipatan, which the company plans to install over the next 27 months. As per the agreement, Polaris Smart Metering will supply, commission, install and maintain smart meters for consumers and system metering across the consumer base in these clusters for the next 10 years.

Electric equipment maker HPL Electric and Power has bagged an order worth INR2.4 bn (29 mn) for smart meters from Advanced Metering Infrastructure Service Provider (AMISP). This accomplishment adds to HPL's already existing significant order pipeline, reinforcing its ongoing upward momentum in the dynamic smart meter sector, the company said.

Generation

Prime Minister (PM) of India dedicated two power projects by NTPC and laid the foundation stone of another with a total investment of INR289.78 bn (US$3.5 bn) in Odisha on 3 February. Located in Sundergarh district, the Darlipali STPP is a pit-head power station with supercritical (highly efficient) technology and will supply low-cost power to its beneficiary states such as Odisha, Bihar, West Bengal, Jharkhand, Gujarat and Sikkim. The 250 MW project of NTPC-SAIL Power Company Ltd was established in Rourkela Steel Plant (RSP) to provide reliable power for the steel plant, which is vital for economic growth. NTPC is developing the Talcher Thermal Power Project, Stage-III, within the old TTPS plant premises in Angul district, was taken over by NTPC from Odisha State Electricity Board in 1995.

Regulation and Governance

According to Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government at the Centre is moving towards making the electricity bill of the households in the country zero. PM's remarks came while addressing a gathering after inaugurating and laying the foundation stone of projects worth INR115.99 bn (US$1.4 bn) in Guwahati.

The Jaipur Vidyut Vitran Nigam Limited, a Rajasthan government-owned power discom (distribution company), vehemently opposed in the Supreme Court (SC) a plea of Adani Power seeking over INR13 bn (US$156.9 mn) as late payment surcharge (LPS) from the state discom. A bench comprising Justices Aniruddha Bose and PV Sanjay Kumar reserved its order on Adani Power Rajasthan Ltd (APRL)'s petition pertaining to its demand for late payment surcharge after hearing heated arguments by senior lawyers Abhishek Singhvi and Dushyant Dave.

According to Union Ministry of Power, the Union government is looking to set March 2025 as the deadline for 24x7 electricity supply across the country. After connecting all households with electricity supply through two flagship schemes in the past decade, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led central government now plans to ensure uninterrupted reliable power supply by the end of 2024-25 (FY25).

North & South America

According to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), United States (US) power consumption will rise to record highs in 2024 and 2025. EIA projected power demand will rise to 4,112 billion kilowatt hours (kWh) in 2024 and 4,123 billion kWh in 2025. That compares with 3,994 billion kWh in 2023 and a record 4,070 billion kWh in 2022. As homes and businesses use more electricity instead of fossil fuels for heat and transportation, EIA forecast 2024 power sales would rise to 1,530 billion kWh for residential consumers, 1,396 billion kWh for commercial customers and 1,035 billion kWh for industrial customers. That compares with all-time highs of 1,509 billion kWh for residential consumers in 2022, 1,391 billion kWh in 2022 for commercial customers and 1,064 billion kWh in 2000 for industrial customers.

According to the US EIA, wholesale electricity prices for 2024 in most areas of the US are seen to be close to or slightly lower than in 2023, because of relatively stable generation fuel costs. Periods of high demand or power market supply constraints, however, could lead to temporary spikes in wholesale prices, it said. EIA forecasts US wholesale prices to range between US$30 per megawatt hour (MWh) and US$40 per MWh outside of the Northeast, where the agency expects prices to increase and average US$48/MWh in New York and US$60/MWh in New England. The main source of electricity in the US is natural gas-fired generation, with EIA expecting natural gas prices for the production of electricity to average US$2.91 per million metric British thermal units (mmBtu) in 2024 compared with US$3.29 per mmBtu in 2023. In most areas, average wholesale electricity costs should remain lower than or comparable to those of the previous year due to lower natural gas prices, the report said. US wholesale power prices are typically calculated on an hourly or daily basis and are designed to reflect market conditions at a specific time.

A winter storm bringing snow, ice and high winds to parts of the US Midwest and Pacific Northwest knocked out power for hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses, with a brutal freeze expected to grip numerous states. The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said storms continue to cause flight cancellations and delays. Some 150,000 homes and businesses were without power in Michigan. Power was out for another 200,000-plus customers in Oregon and Wisconsin.

The Alberta Electric System Operator (AESO) lifted the grid alert issued earlier in the day asking customers to reduce their consumption to avoid a power shortfall after a demand spike caused by extreme cold. The AESO earlier declared the grid alert and asked citizens to immediately reduce their electricity use to essential needs in response to ongoing extreme cold temperatures across western Canada, restricted imports and very high demand. The AESO had projected a shortfall of up to 200 megawatt (MW) of electricity during the peak evening hours and warned of potential rotating outages until demand declined or generation returned to the grid. The AESO said after the alert was issued, it almost immediately saw a 100 MW drop in electricity demand which rose to 200 MW within minutes.

Europe & Russia

Norwegian natural gas exports were curtailed due to an unplanned outage at the Nyhamna processing plant following a power cut at the weekend amid high winds, operator Shell, opens new tab said. The power line which tripped and caused the outage at Nyhamna was repaired late, transmission grid operator Statnett said.

Ukraine reported a surplus of electricity production and intends to export it to neighbouring Moldova and Poland, Ukrainian energy ministry said. Ukraine had produced more energy than it consumed before the Russian invasion in 2022, but that output has dropped since the Russian attacks on power facilities and the occupation of Europe's largest Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Ukraine's Energy Minister German Galushchenko said that Ukraine could resume substantial energy exports as early as this spring due to lower consumption. Ukraine banned exports during the last heating season amid Russian attacks on Ukraine's energy system and large-scale shutdowns.

Major German power utility EnBW, opens new tab, a likely bidder in auctions for building initially gas-fired generation capacity under a new government scheme, could draw on its existing plant sites, its Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Andreas Schell said. The company, alongside sector peers Uniper and RWE, opens new tab, is tipped to be among those responding to the long-awaited roadmap laying out details of a possibly €40 billion (US$43.6 billion) plan to avoid power shortages caused by volatile renewable generation, once coal is abandoned. The plan entails state-support for perhaps 20-25 GW of electricity-producing capacity by 2035, which will either be new stations or old ones that are converted, and which are made ready for clean hydrogen operations in the long term. Germany's Economy Minister Robert Habeck said a much-anticipated roadmap for how a new generation of gas-fired power plants would be put out to tender was imminent, fuelling hopes of financial support for the construction of these stations. The plan, with an estimated cost of up to €40 bn (US$43.5 bn), aims to ensure enough electricity generation until renewable energy can overcome storage issues and inadequate grid technology to fully replace fossil fuels. German stakeholders were set to agree a deal on the power plant expansion strategy, which has drawn criticism from environmental campaigners keen to phase out coal and gas as soon as possible.

Sweden's power demand could rise some 150 percent by 2045, transmission grid operator Svenska kraftnat said, driven by plans for new industrial developments and the conversion of fossil fuel-based industries to non-polluting energy sources. Overall demand could rise from 138 terawatt hours (TWh) in 2022 to just over 340 TWh in 2045 under two of the four scenarios the TSO presented in its latest long-term market analysis. The scenarios were deemed the most likely as they closely align with government projections of 300 TWh demand in 2045. To meet the higher demand, Sweden would need to add on average 7.5 TWh of new power generation per year over the next 20 years.

12 February: India's demand for petroleum products is likely to increase by a mid-single-digit percentage in the financial year ending March 2024, following a 10 percent post-pandemic recovery in 2022-23, according to Fitch Ratings. Both petrol and diesel sales recorded robust 4-6 percent increases in the first nine months of 2023-24, fuelled by heightened economic activities in the agriculture and power sectors, coupled with a surge in holiday travel and auto sales. Fitch said it expects Indian refiners' gross refining margins (GRM) to moderate during 2024-25 from the strong levels expected in 2023-24, but remain above mid-cycle levels. By 2025-26, it foresees a shift closer to mid-cycle levels, but remaining resilient, bolstered by the escalating demand for end-products. In the upstream segment, domestic oil and gas production has modestly increased, driven by a 5 percent rise in gas production in the first nine months of 2023-24. Fitch forecasts the oil and gas sector's high capex intensity to continue in the medium term, particularly with upstream companies investing in production enhancement.

8 February: India wants to sign a multi-year oil purchase deal with Guyana and acquire stakes in the South American nation's exploration areas, the Guyanese minister for natural resources Vickram Bharrat said. He said any such deal with India would have to be approved by Guyana's cabinet. India, the world's third-biggest oil importer and consumer, wants to diversify its crude sources. India approved the signing of a five-year Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Guyana earlier this month for cooperation in energy. After a meeting with India's Oil Minister, Hardeep Singh Puri, Bharat said Indian companies are interested in picking up stakes in Guyana's exploration acreage through negotiation rather than a bidding process.

8 February: India's fuel consumption rose 8.2 percent year-on-year in January, government data showed, helped by strong industrial activity in the world's third largest oil consumer. Total consumption, a proxy for oil demand, totalled 20.04 million tonnes (MT) in January, up from 18.51 MT a year earlier, data from the Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell (PPAC) of the oil ministry showed. Consumption held relatively steady month-on-month from December's seven-month high of 20.05 MT.

8 February: At the India Energy Week 2024 in Goa, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) took a significant step towards enhancing the efficiency of LPG cylinder delivery in India. The company has launched a ground-breaking initiative titled ""Pure for Sure"" that emphasizes quality and quantity assurance for LPG cylinders. The announcement was made by the Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas, Hardeep Singh Puri, with the aim of improving customer satisfaction. The ""Pure for Sure"" initiative is a first-of-its-kind in the industry, designed to ensure the integrity of the product from the production plant to the customer's doorstep. To do so, BPCL has introduced a tamper-proof seal with QR codes on the cylinders. When these QR codes are scanned, customers receive a pop-up and a signature tune that indicates the cylinder's gross weight at the time of filling, enabling them to verify the cylinder before acceptance. In a progressive move, BPCL plans to include women in the LPG delivery process, acknowledging their understanding of the product. This shift not only promotes gender equality but also adds a unique perspective to the delivery process. With the launch of the ""Pure for Sure"" initiative, BPCL is poised to redefine the standard in LPG cylinder delivery, focusing on reliability, transparency, and excellence in customer service.

7 February: India is expected to be the largest driver of global oil demand growth between 2023 and 2030, narrowly taking the lead from top importer China, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said. The world's third-largest oil importer and consumer is on track to post an oil demand increase of almost 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) between 2023 and 2030, accounting for more than one-third of the projected 3.2 million bpd of global increases in the period, the IEA said in a report. The agency forecast India's demand would reach 6.6 million bpd in 2030, up from 5.5 million bpd in 2023. The single largest basis of India's oil consumption will be diesel fuel, accounting for almost half of the rise in the nation's demand and more than one-sixth of total global oil demand growth through to 2030, the IEA said. Jet fuel is poised to grow 5.9 percent annually on average but this will be from a low base compared with other countries, it said. To meet this demand, India is expected to add 1 million bpd of new refining capacity over the seven-year period and this will increase its crude imports further to 5.8 million bpd by 2030, the IEA said.

7 February: Indian Strategic Petroleum Reserve Ltd (ISPRL) has signed a deal with Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) to lease 300,000 metric tonnes of storage space for three years in a Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) in Vizag in southern India. ISPRL operates three SPRs in southern India with combined capacity of about 5 million tonnes (MT). ISPRL said the contract with HPCL is for two years with a provision to extend it by one year. The 1.03 MT SPR at Vizag is half filled with Iraqi oil. And after leasing of space to HPCL, there is scope to rent out the remainder 200,000 tonnes space. ISPRL will soon invite bids to lease out half of the 1.5 MT SPR in Mangalore, where one of the two equally sized compartments has been leased to UAE's ADNOC. ISPRL has been selling from the caverns to local refiners after a change in the government rules in 2021.

13 February: Clean fuel supply in Kolkata is set to receive a significant boost in the coming months with the completion of the main trunk GAIL gas transportation pipeline. Bengal Gas Company Ltd CEO (chief executive officer) Anupam Mukhopadhyay stated that the GAIL gas pipeline would be completed within the next three months, with the resolution of an 800-meter hurdle and the necessary statutory clearances.

8 February: India's Petronet LNG plans to begin supplying liquefied natural gas (LNG) to neighbouring Sri Lanka for five years starting in 2025, its chief executive officer (CEO) Akshay Kumar Singh said. Petronet will ship 850 metric tonnes of gas daily to the island nation in 50 containers of 17 tonnes each, he said. The project will supply two gas-fired power plants in Sri Lanka, which has suffered from crippling power blackouts and fuel shortages. Petronet plans to commission a floating storage regasification unit (FSRU) in Sri Lanka and hopes to gain government approval by 2025 to build the facility by 2028. He said that Petronet, India's top gas importer, is looking for more long-term gas deals. The company signed a deal for QatarEnergy to supply it with 7.5 million tonnes of LNG annually from 2028 to 2048, extending an existing agreement.

13 February: India's coal import registered a rise of 27.2 percent to 23.35 million tonnes (MT) in December, over the corresponding month of the previous fiscal. The coal ministry is aiming for zero thermal coal import by FY26. The country's coal import was 18.35 MT in the corresponding month of the previous fiscal, according to data compiled by mjunction services ltd. Of the total imports in December, non-coking coal imports stood at 15.47 MT, against 10.61 MT imported in December 2022. Coking coal import volume was 4.84 MT, against 4.71 MT imported in the same month of the previous financial year. The coal import in the April-December period of the current fiscal increased to 192.43 MT, over 191.82 MT in the year-ago period. During the April-December period of the current fiscal, non-coking coal import was at 124.37 MT, marginally lower than 126.89 MT imported during the same period in the previous financial year. Coking coal import was at 42.81 MT during April-December 2023-24, slightly up against 41.35 MT recorded for April-December 2022-23.

7 February: Chhattisgarh Chief Minister (CM) Vishnu Deo Sai announced in the Assembly scrapping of an order issued during the previous Congress government regarding the issuance of permits for coal transportation in the state through offline mode. The move will restore the old system of coal transportation by seeking transport permits online.

11 February: No subsidised power will be provided to any minister, officer or government employee in Assam, Chief Minister (CM) Himanta Biswa Sarma said. He has instructed the power department to install prepaid meters in government quarters, including residences in the ministerial colony. Sarma that he was informed by power department officials during a recent interaction that a very nominal amount on account of the monthly power bill is deducted from the salaries of ministers and senior officers.

7 February: The Jharkhand government decided to increase the limit of free electricity to 125 units from the existing 100 units per month for domestic consumers. In a review meeting with senior officials including the chief secretary, Chief Minister (CM) Champai Soren directed the energy department to prepare a proposal in this regard. The state government started the '100-unit free electricity' scheme in 2022 with an aim to reduce financial burden of the people. The scheme is applicable up to the consumption of 100 units of electricity per month for domestic connections.

11 February: Chhattisgarh has inaugurated the country's biggest solar energy plant with a battery energy storage system located near the Dhaba village in the Rajnandgaon district. This solar facility established by the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) and Chhattisgarh Power Distribution Company provides a capacity of 100 megawatt (MW). This solar plant ensures that there will be electricity even during the night generating over five lakh units per day. This will reduce 4.5 lakh metric tons of carbon emission and boost green energy. The on-grid solar power plant set-up by the Chhattisgarh Renewable Energy Development Agency (CREDA) is a significant step towards sustainable energy. The plant was established on 1 February 2024. The plant features a 100 MW solar plant equipped with 2,39,000 bifacial solar panels which is producing electricity from both the sides. The plant is expected to generate power for the next seven years using solar energy. The decision to establish the first solar park in the Bairam hill area of the Rajnandgaon district was taken by the Chhattisgarh government to maximize the use of these hilly terrains for solar power.

8 February: To propel the adoption of solar energy, the Uttar Pradesh (UP) government has unveiled plans to transform 17 major cities of the state into solar cities including revered cities of Ayodhya and Varanasi. Under the initiative, the development of solar cities will take place first and then the government will work towards building solar villages on the same pattern. Notably, the administration has already started its efforts to establish Ayodhya as the inaugural solar city. Recently, state's Energy Minister A K Sharma underscored UP's commitment to solar energy advancement and revealed that the state is poised to emerge as a leader in the solar energy domain, with initiatives already gaining momentum. Ayodhya's solar city project encompasses the installation of over 2,500 solar-powered streetlights, enhancing the sacred city's commitment to sustainability. CM (Chief Minister) Yogi Adityanath started a solar boat service in Ayodhya. The city already boasts solar-powered amenities such as ATMs and solar trees adorning its 40 intersections, epitomising the city's embrace of renewable energy solutions. With Ayodhya spearheading the solar energy adoption, another major city Varanasi is making a foothold to install rooftop solar plants across government buildings. Under the project, Varanasi is slated to witness the installation of 25,000 rooftop solar plants, positioning it as a beacon of solar innovation.

7 February: SJVN Ltd said it has received a letter of intent (LoI) from Gujarat Urja Vias Nigam Ltd to set up a 200 megawatt (MW) solar power project. The tentative cost of construction and development of this project is INR11 billion, SJVN chairman and managing director (CMD) Geeta Kapur said. The ground-mounted solar project shall be developed by SJVN subsidiary SJVN Green Energy Ltd (SGEL) anywhere in India through an EPC contract. The Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) shall be executed with GUVNL after the adoption of the tariff by GERC (Gujarat Electricity Regulatory Commission), it said. The project is expected to generate 508.4 million units in the first year after commissioning and the projected cumulative energy generation over a period of 25 years is 11,836.28 million units.

13 February: OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) stuck to its forecast for relatively strong growth in global oil demand in 2024 and 2025 and raised its economic growth forecasts for both years saying there was further upside potential. The OPEC said world oil demand will rise by 2.25 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2024 and by 1.85 million bpd in 2025. A further boost to economic growth could give additional tailwind to oil demand. OPEC's 2024 demand growth forecast is already higher than that of other forecasters such as the International Energy Agency (IEA), although the wider OPEC+ alliance is still cutting output to support the market. For this year, OPEC's expectation of oil demand growth is much more than the expansion of 1.24 million bpd so far forecast by the IEA. The IEA, which represents industrialised countries, is scheduled to update its forecasts. OPEC and the IEA have clashed in recent years over issues such as long-term demand and the need for investment in new supply. The IEA sees oil demand peaking by 2030 as the world shifts to cleaner energy, a view OPEC dismisses.

12 February: United States (US) oil output from top shale-producing regions will rise in March to its highest in four months, the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) said. Production from the top basins will rise by nearly 20,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 9.7 million bpd, its highest since December, the EIA said. Oil output in the Permian basin, the largest US shale field spread across West Texas and New Mexico, was due to rise by about 14,000 bpd to 6.1 million bpd, the second highest monthly output on record after November, the EIA said. Production in the Eagle Ford in southeast Texas was due to rise nearly 4,700 bpd to 1.1 million bpd, the highest since September, the EIA said. In the Bakken, output was set to rise by about 3,000 bpd to 1.2 million bpd, the highest since December.

12 February: The International Monetary Fund (IMF) said Middle East economies were lagging below growth projections due to oil production cuts and the Israel-Gaza conflict, even as the global economic outlook remained resilient. In a regional economic report last month, the IMF revised its GDP growth forecast for the Middle East and North Africa down to 2.9 percent this year, lagging below October projections, due in part to short term oil production cuts and the conflict in Gaza.

8 February: French energy giant TotalEnergies is seeking to sell its minority share in a major Nigerian onshore oil joint venture, following Shell's divestment, CEO (chief executive officer) Patrick Pouyanne said. The Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited (SPDC), in which TotalEnergies holds a 10 percent stake, has struggled with hundreds of onshore oil spills as a result of theft, sabotage and operational issues that led to costly repairs and high-profile lawsuits over the years. TotalEnergies is the latest international oil company seeking to withdraw from Nigeria's onshore sector after decades of operations. But the French group, which produced a total of 219,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2023 in Nigeria, remains a major operator of offshore fields in the West African country. It announced the start-up of the Akpo West oilfield located 135 kilometres off the coast.

12 February: Faced with stubbornly high Russian gas imports as the war in Ukraine rages on, Austria is seeking to take more radical steps, including ending energy company OMV's long-term contract to buy gas from Gazprom, Austria's Energy Minister Leonore Gewessler said. Having long sought to maintain close ties with nearby Russia, Austria sought to end its decades-long dependency on affordable Russian gas soon after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, scrambling to find alternative providers. Gewessler said the Russian share of Austria's gas imports actually increased in December to a new record of 98 percent from 76 percent the month before, even if the total volume of imports fell slightly.

9 February: The Russian government has extended a permit for its Yamal LNG plant to supply liquefied natural gas (LNG) to German nationalised gas importer and trader SEFE until 31 December 2040. Russia banned trade with a number of companies including Gazprom Germania in 2022, but a year later the government made a special dispensation for the company to allow the LNG sales until the end of 2024. The decision to extend the permission was published as Russia's largest liquefied natural gas producer Novatek is facing sanctions and delays at its new Arctic LNG 2 project.

8 February: Germany will receive its first supplies of pipeline natural gas from Algeria under a medium-term contract signed between a subsidiary of trader VNG AG and oil and gas firm Sonatrach, the companies said. This makes VNG the first German company to purchase pipeline gas from Algeria. Germany has been forced to seek new suppliers after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 ended Germany's decades of reliance on Russian gas. Algeria's gas production at 106 billion cubic meters per year, according to Sonatrach.

7 February: British energy supplier Centrica has agreed to purchase 1 million metric tonnes of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Spain's Repsol between 2025 and 2027, Centrica said. The cargoes will be delivered to the Isle of Grain terminal in Kent in the South of England.

13 February: Asia's imports of seaborne thermal coal eased from record highs in January as top buyers China and India saw arrivals ease. However, there was strength in Japan and South Korea, which helped drive some divergence in prices between the high-energy coal preferred by the third- and fourth-biggest importers in Asia, and the lower quality fuel sought by China and India. Asia seaborne imports of thermal coal, used mainly to generate electricity, dropped to 77.65 million metric tonnes in January, according to commodity analysts Kpler data. China's January imports of seaborne thermal coal slipped to 27.92 million tons from December's all-time peak of 31.59 million, but were still 34 percent above the 20.86 million from January 2023. China's appetite for imported coal has been fuelled by strong demand for thermal generation amid lower output from hydropower, as well as by a price advantage compared to domestic coal prices. The main grades imported by China are lower-energy coal from Indonesia and mid-rank fuel from Australia.

13 February: United States (US) energy regulators have launched a review of the performance of the bulk power system during recent winter storms in January that brought Arctic air across much of North America, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) said. Elliott was the name given to the system that brought frigid cold and blowing winds, knocking out power for more than 1.5 million homes and businesses across the US in December 2022. In November 2023, the US energy regulators urged lawmakers to fill a regulatory blind spot to maintain reliable supply of natural gas during extreme cold weather that was highlighted by an inquiry into power outages during Elliott.

8 February: German gas-fired electricity generation jumped to its highest levels in two years in January as power firms dialled up output to compensate for the closure of the country's nuclear reactors and meet higher heating demand during a cold snap last month. The 8.74 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity generated from gas-fired power stations was the highest since January 2022, according to think tank Ember, which was just before Russia's invasion of Ukraine led to the severing of gas pipeline flows to Europe's largest gas consumer and economy. Gas-powered generation was 13 percent above January 2023 levels, and helped lift Germany's total electricity generation to its highest level in a year. Higher gas generation also lifted natural gas' share of Germany's electricity generation mix to 18.6 percent, the highest since early 2021, which indicates that German power firms remain reliant on fossil fuels for electricity production despite ongoing energy transition efforts. While German power producers lifted generation from gas power plants in January, use of coal-fired generation remains below previous levels. Coal-fired electricity production in January was 10.83 TWh, which was down 29 percent from January 2023 and around 22 percent below the average coal generation levels of 2022.

8 February: China's National Development and Reform Council (NDRC) is moving to refine the pricing mechanisms for services essential to stabilising power supply in markets increasingly dependent on wind and solar power, in a fresh step toward creating a national electricity market by 2030. NDRC said it would focus on optimising pricing mechanisms for standby capacity, frequency modulation and so called peak shaving - which are ancillary services essential to maintaining reliable electricity supply. The peak shaving market allows power companies to buy power from quick-ramping sources such as energy storage and flexible coal plants, to help them meet spikes in demand. Frequency regulation helps maintain normal frequency on the grid, a function that can be performed by battery storage systems and generators such as coal- and gas-fired plants. The ancillary services rule is among a series of basic documents setting out the rules for a national electricity market by 2025, with the market's start targeted for 2030.

9 February: European Union (EU) countries voted to pass a law to reduce emissions from trucks, after late demands by Germany had threatened to sink the policy. The move is the latest in a string of last-minute upsets to European Union (EU) laws, caused by disputes within Germany's three-way coalition government. The law, which will enforce a 90 percent cut in CO (carbon dioxide) emissions from heavy-duty vehicles by 2040, still needs approval from the EU Parliament to enter into force. To win Germany's backing, EU countries agreed to add a preamble to the law which said the European Commission would consider developing rules to register trucks running on COneutral fuels, which could count towards the targets, diplomats said.

8 February: Britain's biggest bank HSBC has partnered with Google to finance fast-growing climate technology firms behind some of the world's most promising solutions to global climate change. Under terms of the partnership, HSBC will look to provide financing to companies cherry-picked by the US technology giant to join its Google Cloud Ready-Sustainability programme. Scaling technologies that can help the corporate world move more quickly to a low-carbon economy dominated the COP28 climate talks in Dubai in December, and is a crucial part of most banks' efforts to drive a global push to cut emissions.

8 February: Australia experienced its eighth-warmest year in 2023, with the influence of climate change pushing average temperatures almost 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) above the 1961-1990 average, the weather bureau said. Last year's extreme weather swings took Australia from widespread flooding and the coolest January since 2002 through the hottest southern hemisphere winter and early spring and driest three months on record to end with heavy rainfall as summer got underway. Forecasters warn that climate change will make Australia hotter and increase the severity of weather extremes. The bureau said that globally 2023 was the warmest year on record, with ocean temperatures at their highest ever since April and the extent of Antarctic sea ice at a record low for much of the year. For most of 2023, Australia was in the grip of an El Nino weather phenomenon - a warming of the Pacific Ocean waters along the equator off the coast of South America that typically causes hot, dry weather in Australia and Southeast Asia.

May 13 (Interfax) - The European gas market has replaced most of the Russian gas it used to receive with U.S. liquefied natural gas, but Europe has also been saved by extraordinarily mild winters, lower gas consumption by industry and increased use of renewable energy. However, European gas analysts believe the crisis is now over, and, faced by reduced supply flexibility and a recovery in consumption, infrastructure constraints and competition from Asia for LNG, as well as uncertainty over the continued transit of Russian gas through Ukraine, every cubic meter of gas could count in the event of a cold winter.

Cara MacDonald, head of LNG & Clean-Fuel Supply and Origination at RWE AG, said at the Flame gas conference at the end of April that Europe had been able to withstand the past two heating seasons thanks to mild weather and a demand side response. ""Europe had much milder weather, especially in the winter of 2022-2023, which cooled consumption and allowed storage to fill up. Additionally, due to high gas prices, we have seen demand destruction in Europe, while in Asia, this meant more fuel switching,"" she said.

""But is the crisis over? Things could change in the coming winters, especially if there is no flexibility in LNG supplies. The only answer may be continued demand side response,"" MacDonald said, although she believes this might not save the situation.

""Yes, we coped by reducing demand, but can we do it again? When I look at demand side signals, I see that the market will become tighter,"" she said, adding that there was limited supply flexibility and any incident at an LNG plant could tighten the balance.

Glenn Vinvand Kviljo, head of trading at Equinor, also said the European market faced uncertainty in the coming winter after two mild winters: ""Will there be another mild winter, or we will get back to the normal, cold winter? We cannot sit back and relax,"" he said.

Chief analyst at Uniper Energy, Gregor Pett, warned that despite the fact that the market has been more bearish in recent weeks and months, this was mainly associated with a weak economy, air temperatures, high storage and others. ""But for most market participants, this is a fragile balance, and at any time the situation can turn around [...] and there could be a repeat of the crisis. It's not over, it's far from over,"" he said.

""It is difficult to foresee what will happen in terms of supply and demand. It depends on many things, including the weather. We can have a very mild winter, so gas demand in Europe will be low. If it's an extremely cold winter the demand will be higher than in the past two years and a lower supply could be a problem,"" a representative of a European gas trader told Interfax in an interview.

""If there was an outage of the production from Norway or hurricanes in the U.S. - there are many events which can happen and which can bring to a very tight situation in Europe where each Bcm of supply is important,"" the trader said, adding that a very hot summer could also cause demand to spike.

He said that current gas prices in Europe include a risk premium since all these factors were difficult to predict. ""And each player has an own opinion if prices are fair or not. Currently the market is pricing in, I would say, a normal cold winter, but the winter can be different,"" the trader said.

Europe has reduced gas consumption by about 20% over the past two years to approximately 330 billion cubic meters due to high gas prices (27 EU countries), as well as the energy transition drive, while some industrial demand for gas has been lost forever, some participants believe. However, there are signs of demand recovering.

Cheniere Energy said in a presentation that gas consumption in Europe was now below the 2017-2021 average. It fell 19% in the region's six biggest economies, with consumption in industry down 22% (between 18% and 23%), in energy - 14% (between 8% and 25%), in other sectors - 21% (between 17% and 28%).

Uniper Energy's Pett said Europe has lost a very large amount of industrial production due to high prices, but ""we expect a lot of industrial demand to return to the market."" However, most gas analysts were unable to say to what extent demand might return.

Gautam Mukherjee, head of gas analytics at BP, said it was necessary to look at sectors. For example, in industry, gas is being replaced by heat pumps; in the energy sector, on the one hand, there is more renewable energy, but on the other hand, coal is being replaced. Overall, he said, Europe has had very weak economic results over the past two years, so not only has demand for gas fallen, but demand for electricity has also been very low. And Europe's economy is expected to recover in the coming years, so demand for gas in both the power industry and other industry will increase.

Uniper Energy's Pett said the difference in consumption in a mild and normal winter for northwestern Europe was 30 billion cubic meters, and last winter was ""extraordinarily mild.""

Given the demand and uncertainty over the weather, gas market participants are concerned about whether the contract for Russian gas transit through Ukraine will be extended, and if not, whether LNG can replace it. Europe has lost over 100 billion cubic meters of pipeline gas supplies from Russia over the past two years, but supplies through Ukraine and TurkStream continue to some extent.

Andrei Prokofiev, head of Division for Cooperation with Clients at Gas Transmission System Operator of Ukraine (GTSOU), said that both the transit deal and the agreement between Gazprom and GTSOU would expire at the end of the year. ""As the Ukrainian authorities and European Commission have said many times, Ukraine is not going to negotiate with Russia on this matter - no direct agreements. What does this mean from a practical point of view? Not having an agreement between operators means we'll not be putting any capacity up for at auction,"" he said.

""This is like the situation on our border with Romania, where we have interconnectors - Tekovo, Mediesu Aurit. ""There is infrastructure, a tariff, but we cannot come to an agreement with the Romanian TSO due to technical problems. And neither we nor Romania are offering capacity,"" Prokofiev said.

Last year, Europe bought about 135 bcm of LNG, almost half of it from the United States. However, industry participants say that there will be a limited supply of LNG on the market in 2024-2026. Marco Saalfrank, head of trading for continental Europe at Axpo, estimates that the market will be tight in Europe in 2026-2027 because Europe will need to pay high prices to attract LNG. In addition, there will be high volatility in the market because Europe has lost its flexibility (for supply), he said.

There is an opinion that higher gas prices for Europe will become a new reality. Andrew Walker of Cheniere Marketing said that Europe, as the largest market for US LNG exports, has not traditionally been tied to spot prices in Asia, where the market is tight, as it relies on pipeline supplies. However, now Europe is more tied to Asian prices. ""So now this is a bit of a new reality for Europe, so Europe will probably have to get used to higher prices,"" he said.

Patrick Dugas, head of LNG trading at TotalEnergies, said that before the conflict in Ukraine, Europe was a balancing market where any cargo could find a home. However, then the paradigm changed, and Europe became a premium market like Asia. ""I think in the coming months and years we will see competition for LNG between the two basins, European and Asian,"" he said.

Dugas also said that the European market has become characterized by volatility and uncertainty. ""Every time there is a supply problem, it creates volatility in the market [...] and to solve these two problems, we need flexibility,"" he said.

The TotalEnergies trader said not to forget about the recovery in China, which imported 20 million tonnes of LNG in the first quarter, which is 4 million tonnes more than the previous year. ""So recovery in demand in China and possibly Europe will be the two main themes in the market over the next few years,"" he said.

""There really is a maximum amount of LNG on the market now. And if there is no increase in supply with growing demand in Asia, Europe will not be able to fill the balance with liquefied natural gas,"" a spokesperson from RWE said.

However, LNG sellers need assurances that their products will be in demand in the long term. Landon Larson, marketing director for American LNG producer Sempra Infrastructure, said that European companies are now buying LNG, but Europe has announced decarbonization goals, and this puts pressure on investment decisions for the second wave of LNG projects, raising questions about whether or not the projects will be able to sell their LNG, and about their financial sustainability. At the same time, many believe that Europe has set unrealistic goals for its energy transition, at least where timing is concerned.

Meanwhile, the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden has already suspended the issuance of new licenses for LNG exports, intending to assess the extent to which Europe is focused on LNG purchases, or if it will still move away from using fossil fuels.

Axpo's Saalfrank said that there are risks in signing long-term contracts. Therefore, Europe is going to reduce gas consumption; in addition, one cannot exclude ""the risk that Russian gas will return to the European market in 10-20 years,"" he said.

Another risk relates to price: gas purchases tied to oil or linked to Henry Hub spot pricing is sold at a TTF price in Europe, so such price risks are not easily hedged in long-term contracts. In addition, the trader said, there is a regulatory risk (on carbon regulation). ""So, 3-4 years ago, Ireland and France refused to buy American LNG because it is produced in shale deposits,"" he said.

Nicola Duffin, head of LNG supply at Ineos Energy Trading, said that Ineos had the advantage of being a private company and is not under pressure from shareholders to divest from fossil fuels. ""We are realistic and understand that we will need gas for the next 20 years. Other companies may agree with this, but they are not allowed to,"" she noted. In order to enter into a long-term agreement for the purchase of LNG, you need to be ""relatively large and have a huge amount of money,"" Duffin said. It is difficult for small companies to operate in the LNG market.

Gulfstream LNG CEO Vivek Chandra said that traders help grow the LNG business by becoming intermediaries, for example, with countries like Sri Lanka that cannot enter into long-term contracts. Asia, especially China and India, are much more active in purchasing LNG, as they consider it a transition fuel, he said. In addition, we should not forget about the Middle East; for example, Kuwait has become an active buyer, as well as African countries.

But infrastructure is no less of a risk. Laurent Hamou of Gas Infrastructure Europe (GIE) said the gas infrastructure utilization in Europe has been at record levels over the past two years and this means that ""in the coming years we cannot afford any disruptions. Any problem will be very noticeable, and we have a limited number of suppliers and less flexibility.""

""Everyone says that everything is fine - there's spare capacity at LNG terminals in Europe. But I believe that, on the contrary, we need to increase capacity and give the market more flexibility. Let's see what happens in the next two years. Our contract for gas through Ukraine might come to an end, there might be some recovery in demand, and I'm sure we'll need more LNG terminals,"" he said.

Hamou said there was a regional discrepancy in Europe in this regard - for example, Spanish terminals were operating at normal levels, while infrastructure in south-eastern Europe, for example, the terminal in Greece, as well as infrastructure in Germany, were operating at a totally unusual level.

Halting gas transit through Ukraine will result in even bigger restrictions, but we need to think about all European consumers. ""If French consumers paid the German price for gas like in 2022, they would be paying 5 billion euros more. This is a lot of money. You need geographical flexibility, time flexibility and supply flexibility. Any accident will affect prices,"" Hamou said.

Hungary is heavily reliant on Ukrainian transit. ""Yes, some new infrastructure is being built, but it is not yet clear how it will work. There is a lot of infrastructure in the north and south, but gas needs to be delivered to the center,"" he said.

Thomas Thorkildsen, chief commercial officer at Hoegh LNG, in his presentation cited the degree of exposure of some European countries to Russian gas. Croatia gets 81% of its gas from Russia (1.4 bcm), Austria - 75% (5.6 bcm), Hungary - 62% (6.2 bcm), Slovakia - 57% (2.4 bcm), Serbia - 61% (2.1 bcm) Greece - 39% (2 bcm) and the Czech Republic - 35% (2.6 bcm).

Half of this gas enters the EU through Ukraine, the transit agreement ends at the end of 2024, and this must be borne in mind, he said.

A trader at Hungary's MVM CEEnergy told Interfax that the company was now buying 10-11 LNG cargoes, equivalent to 1 bcm of gas, at the Krk terminal in Croatia. The capacity booking contract is valid until 2027, and the company plans to bid at auctions for new capacity. But any increase in purchases will depend how LNG competes with pipeline supplies. Hungary is also counting on potentially higher production within the EU, in particular the Neptun project offshore Romania, which ExxonMobil could put on line in 2026-2027.

But the MVM CEEnergy trader said that although there is enough regasification capacity, pipeline tariffs across Europe might be too high to justify buying LNG.

GTSOU's Prokofiev echoed this. He said European markets were highly segmented and it was difficult to transport LNG from Greece to Slovakia, Austria or Germany. The issue of capacity can be resolved, for example, there is capacity in Ukraine. ""But due to the tariff policies of some countries, this sometimes does not make economic sense. For example, the cost of storage in Germany, likewise in Austria, the anticipated increase in tariffs in Slovakia, make the problem more difficult. And this needs to be resolved, at least at the government level,"" he said, adding that since everyone protected their own market, perhaps a decision at the level of the European Commission is needed.

Prokofiev also said that last year about 2.5 billion cubic meters of gas were pumped into Ukrainian underground gas storage facilities by non-residents and another 0.6-0.7 bcm remained there. At the same time, the capacity of Ukrainian underground gas storage facilities is more than 10 bcm, which could cover a potential interruption of gas supplies to Europe.

Market participants believe that even more LNG terminals need to be built. Ineos Energy Trading's Duffin said Europe needed a huge amount of imported capacity by 2028. She said Northwestern Europe, under normal weather conditions, would have to import an additional 46 bcm of gas as LNG - demand is growing due to the switch from coal to gas, and internal production is falling.

But demand might also fall, so it might make more sense to use floating storage regasification units. But Duffin said it should be remembered that FSRUs are more expensive, do not last forever and they do not have operational flexibility. ""So if governments put an end to subsidies and companies stop paying, they will go to other countries where they are needed more quickly. And I see that in Europe people soon forgot about this and are perhaps not taking it as seriously as they should,"" she said.

Hoegh LNG's Thorkildsen said the company currently owned 10 FSRUs, and a further three LNG tankers that can be converted into FSRUs, which usually takes up to 18 months, but there have been precedents where this happened within five months. He said a new FSRU costs about $500 million and that all shipyards were now booked until 2028.

Hoegh LNG estimates that in 2022 the order for new LNG vessels broke all records and amounted to 145 units, with 68 in 2023 and 44 tankers in 2024. At the same time, 10 gas carriers have already been built in 2024, another 60 are expected, with plans to build 86 tankers in 2025, 84 in 2026, 73 in 2027 and 26 in 2028.The LNG fleet is currently about 600 tankers, excluding FSRUs, which are mainly used as terminals.

The company's FSRUs operate under long-term contracts - half of them in Europe (three in Germany and one in each of France and Lithuania). But Thorkildsen said China was the only market that plans to increase regasification capacity to 200 bcm from the current 100 bcm. Other growing markets, such as Italy, Malaysia, Germany, India, Indonesia, Thailand and Bangladesh, where LNG demand is forecast to grow, are not making decisions to build regasification facilities.

He said Germany was the exception among European countries. But given the announced growth in imports and planned commissioning of regasification capacities, their utilization will reach 63% in 2025-2028 and 82% by 2029, which corresponds to the situation with capacity utilization in north-west Europe in 2022, when there was chaos and high prices. Utilization of LNG terminals in Germany will exceed 90% after 2030, reaching 95% in 2033.

In Italy it is even worse - utilization of its regasification capacity will reach 94% in 2024, and this will no longer be enough from 2027, given the planned import of LNG. ""This doesn't look like energy security,"" Thorkildsen said.

According to Hoegh LNG, 40% of gas consumed in Europe in 2024 will be LNG - about 175 bcm of approximately 420 bcm consumed, while 119 bcm will be supplied by gas pipelines from Norway, 22 bcm by the gas pipeline from Russia, and 67 bcm will be produced in the EU and the UK.

A drop in Russian gas supplies is expected after 2024 as the transit contract with Ukraine expire; supplies from North Africa and Azerbaijan will remain largely at the same level; imports from Norway will decrease from 108 bcm in 2029 to 81 bcm in 2034 and 58 bcm in 2039; and Europe's own production will decrease to 60 bcm.

LNG supplies are expected to increase initially to 203 bcm in 2029, accounting for half of consumption, but as consumption falls to approximately 330 bcm in 2039, LNG purchases will also fall, to 157 bcm, Hoegh LNG says in its presentation.

The European Union is currently discussing a ban on imports of Russian LNG. Last year, Europe purchased about 18 bcm of LNG from Russia, with about 1 bcm of this redirected to Asian markets.

However, market participants believe European politicians will most likely postpone the embargo until 2027, when new LNG projects go on line for world markets.",interfax.com,news,interfax.com,,-0.1058823529411764,453481330,5,,eng-9563546

RWE has had a solid start to the year: in the first quarter of 2024, the company posted adjusted EBITDA (adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) of €1.7 billion and adjusted net income of €0.8 billion. The reduction in earnings compared to the same quarter of the previous year are mainly due to lower earnings in the Flexible Generation segment, as expected.

Michael Müller, Chief Financial Officer of RWE AG: ""We can look back on a solid first quarter of 2024, with significant increases in earnings in both Offshore Wind and Onshore Wind/Solar. This shows that our investments are paying off. In the first three months of the year, 42% of our electricity generation came from renewable sources - and we are continuing to invest massively. Currently, we have projects with a total capacity of 8.3 gigawatts under construction. We confirm our outlook for 2024 and our target of paying a dividend of €1.10 per share for the current fiscal year.""

With net investments of €2.3 billion in the first quarter of 2024, RWE continues to expand its portfolio. Around €1 billion was attributable to the acquisition of three offshore wind development projects from Vattenfall off the coast of the UK. In addition, RWE invested more than twice as much in the construction of new wind and solar power plants in the first quarter as in the same period last year. Proceeds from the sale of a 49% stake in the Dogger Bank South offshore wind projects in the UK to Masdar had a counteracting effect.

RWE is currently building plants with a total capacity of 8.3 gigawatts (GW). These include the offshore wind projects Sofia off the UK coast with 1.4 GW and Thor in Denmark with 1.1 GW. RWE is also driving forward the expansion of onshore wind and solar energy and the construction of new batteries with more than 100 projects under construction in Europe and the US.

Business development in the first quarter of 2024 by segment

Offshore Wind: Adjusted EBITDA in the Offshore Wind segment amounted to €548 million, compared to €473 million in the first quarter of 2023. The increase in earnings is mainly due to improved wind conditions. In the same period of the previous year, these were below the assumed average.

Onshore Wind/Solar: The Onshore Wind/Solar segment recorded adjusted EBITDA of €341 million compared to €247 million in the first quarter of 2023. The positive earnings development is mainly due to the commissioning of new capacity and the recognition of the business activities of Con Edison Clean Energy Businesses in the US for the full three months. Moreover, wind conditions at the European onshore sites improved marginally overall, which also had a positive effect.

Flexible Generation: Adjusted EBITDA of the Flexible Generation segment decreased to €552 million in the first quarter of 2024 from €1,181 million in the prior-year period. The margins on electricity forward electricity sales and income from the short-term optimisation of power plant dispatch fell short of the exceptionally high level recorded last year.

Supply & Trading: Although the segment's adjusted EBITDA of €251 million was below the previous year's figure of €289 million, it once again reached a high level. A strong proprietary trading performance was the basis for this.

As of fiscal 2024, RWE has pooled the lignite-fired power generation business and the nuclear decommissioning activities under the name 'Phaseout Technologies' and has been managing them based on adjusted cash flows. This business is no longer included in adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBIT and adjusted net income.

Continued solid financial position despite high level of investment activity. As of 31 March 2024, RWE reported net debt of €11.2 billion. Due to the company's significant growth investments, the leverage factor, i.e. the ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA, is likely to increase in 2024. However, it is expected to remain well below the upper limit of 3.0 that RWE has set for itself.",marketscreener.com,news,Market Screener,,0.1450980392156862,453477654,38,,

The U.S. state of New Jersey has launched its fourth offshore wind auction to secure between 1.2 GW and 4 GW of clean power.

The solicitation, which opened on April 30 and will close on July 10, is part of efforts by Governor Philip Murphy to build 7.5 GW of offshore wind energy by 2035.

In its previous auction in January, New Jersey awarded contracts for the 1.3 GW Attentive Energy Two project (TotalEnergies and Corio Generation) and the 2.4 GW Leading Light Wind project (Invenergy and energyRe).

The awards came after a tumultuous year that saw the cancellation of several offshore wind projects in the U.S. Northeast due to higher costs. In October, Orsted canceled its Ocean Wind 1 and 2 projects off the coast of New Jersey citing soaring inflation, rising interest rates and delays in securing ships needed to build the projects.

Earlier this month, neighbouring state New York decided not to sign offtake agreements with three planned offshore wind projects with a total capacity of 4 GW after turbine supplier GE Vernova decided to switch to a smaller turbine.

The decision refers to the 1.4 GW Attentive Energy One (TotalEnergies and Corio Generation), 1.3 GW Community Offshore Wind (RWE and National Grid) and 1.3 GW Excelsior Wind (Vineyard Offshore) projects that were all awarded provisional contracts in a competitive auction in October 2023.

The developers declined to comment on their plan for the projects but they could potentially seek to sell power to New Jersey.

US to sell 18 GW of floating wind leases in Maine, Oregon

The Biden administration plans to lease 10 offshore wind areas this year in the Gulf of Maine and Oregon that could produce up to 18 GW of floating wind capacity.

The lease sale includes eight areas offshore Maine, Massachusetts and New Hampshire, totaling nearly one million acres. These areas have the potential to generate approximately 15 GW of clean energy, enough to power approximately five million homes.

The sale could potentially take place in October, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM), said.

The U.S. also plans to sell two lease areas spanning 195,000 acres off the coast of Oregon that could generate 3.1 GW of clean energy.

The deep waters in the Gulf of Maine and Oregon mean the lease areas are more suited to floating wind technology.

The bidding process will provide credits to bidders that support workforce training programs or supply chain development.

The U.S. plans to hold 12 offshore wind lease sales by 2028, the Interior Department announced on April 24.

The five-year schedule also includes wind lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico this year.

Ireland identifies four offshore wind build areas

The Irish government has identified four offshore wind development areas off the country's south coast.

According to the South Coast Designated Maritime Area Plan (DMAP), which was released on May 3, Ireland plans to build a 900 MW offshore wind farm in an area known as Tonn Nua that could start producing power by 2030. Three other areas were designated for development over the next decade.

Ireland plans to install at least 5 GW of fixed-bottom offshore wind capacity by 2030 and a further 2 GW of floating wind for the production of green hydrogen and other non-grid uses. In May 2023, Ireland awarded state-backed power contracts to four offshore wind projects with a combined capacity of 3.1 GW.

By 2040, Ireland plans to build 20 GW of offshore wind, rising to 37 GW by 2050, according to a new roadmap released by the government earlier this month.

The Future Framework for Offshore Renewable Energy says Ireland's long term goal is to build enough offshore wind energy to replace the ""volatile"" fossil fuels the country imports to produce electricity.

Ireland could build more transmission to export excess offshore wind energy to France, the U.K., and other European markets, as well as a large-scale green hydrogen industry, the document says.

""Our offshore wind energy is potentially the largest domestic source of electricity that can replace volatile, imported fossil fuels. It also gives us our most exciting industrial opportunity for decades as we plan to not only power our own country, but export our excess energy to power Europe,"" Eamon Ryan, the minister for environment and climate, said in a statement.

Chinese turbine suppliers failing to grow overseas

Despite efforts to expand overseas, Chinese wind turbine suppliers made 97% of their installations in their home market last year, according to data compiled by the Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC).

Global wind turbine installations rose by around 50% last year to a record 120.7 GW, or 23,833 wind turbines, GWEC said in a new report. China was a key driver of growth, installing 67% of all new capacity.

Last month, GWEC increased its wind installation forecast for 2024-2030 by 10%, to 1,210 GW, after major economies implemented policies to promote the wind industry.

""Growth is concentrated in mature markets like China, the U.S. and Germany, GWEC CEO Ben Backwell said.

""For wind energy to play its full role in the push to achieve Net Zero, growth needs to speed up across the globe, particularly in emerging and developing economies,"" he said.

Four of the five top turbine manufacturers last year were Chinese. Goldwind was the top turbine supplier with 16.7 GW of capacity installed, followed by Envision (15.9 GW), Vestas (12.7 GW), Windey (10.5 GW) and Mingyang (10.2 GW), with the latter the world's largest offshore wind turbine supplier.

Vestas, Siemens Gamesa, Nordex Group, GE Vernova and Enercon still have a stronghold on the European markets. According to GWEC, Chinese OEMs only installed 194.1 MW of wind turbines in Europe last year, of which only 8.4 MW was in the EU27.

Chinese suppliers have also failed to get a foothold in the U.S., where GE Vernova and Vestas are the largest suppliers, data from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) shows.

Meanwhile, Vestas and Siemens Gamesa reported 155 MW and 3 MW installations in China last year, respectively, together accounting for only 0.2% of new installations in the country.",reutersevents.com,news,reutersevents.com,,0.4666666666666666,453471867,1,,eng-9564665

Another stumble for offshore wind in New York has highlighted shifting sentiment in the offshore wind turbine market.

Last month, New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) chose not to sign offtake agreements with three planned offshore wind projects after designated turbine supplier GE Vernova decided to switch to a smaller turbine.

The 1.4 GW Attentive Energy One (TotalEnergies and Corio Generation), 1.3 GW Community Offshore Wind (RWE and National Grid) and 1.3 GW Excelsior Wind (Vineyard Offshore) projects were all awarded provisional contracts in a competitive auction in October 2023.

GE Vernova decided to switch from its latest 18 MW turbines to a 15.5/16.5 MW platform and this caused ""technical and commercial complexities"" which meant the project could not proceed under the awarded contract terms, a NYSERDA spokesperson said. Most U.S. offshore wind projects set to be built over the next few years plan to install turbines in the 11 to 15 MW range.

The developers declined to comment on their plans for the projects but they have indicated their continued interest in the New York market, NYSERDA said. Last month, New York announced plans for two more offshore wind solicitations this summer and in 2025.

After years of rapid increases in turbine capacities, GE Vernova's decision reflects a trend by Western original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) of introducing fewer new turbines and focusing on existing models for longer.

GE Vernova did not give a reason for its turbine switch, but it follows a difficult few years in which volatile costs and delivery challenges have delayed projects and severely dented the revenues of turbine suppliers.

The hunger for larger turbines led to some developers bidding projects based on turbines in early development stages, which can lead to offtake awards that are at higher risk of abandonment by awardees, a spokesperson for Danish turbine supplier Vestas told Reuters Events.

Vestas plans to focus on its 15 MW offshore wind turbine. This size is ""best positioned to enable greater certainty of on-time, successful project delivery,"" the spokesperson said.

Standardisation

Over the past decade, offshore wind developers in Europe and U.S. sought larger turbines to lower the cost of energy per kilowatt hour and win state-backed power contracts in competitive auctions.

The maximum size of new offshore wind turbines has risen from around 8 MW to around 15 MW amid an ""arms race"" among leading OEMs, said Signe Sorensen, Senior Research Analyst for the Americas at Aegir Insights.

Global average offshore wind turbine capacities

Intense competition squeezed the margins of turbine suppliers, while volatile global costs and logistics issues since the coronavirus pandemic have prompted offshore wind investors, developers and suppliers to reassess project risks.

On the U.S. East Coast, soaring costs and high interest rates prompted multiple cancellation of offshore wind contracts, delaying projects and curbing progress in building out new supply chain facilities.

Under financial pressure, Western wind turbine suppliers are producing less turbine variants than Chinese rivals.

Since 2020, Western suppliers have announced 29 new variants of onshore and offshore wind turbines, compared with over 426 from China, according to Endri Lico, principal analyst for Global Wind Technology and Supply Chain at Wood Mackenzie.

""The main reason is due to OEMs profitability pressure and their need to simplify their product portfolio,"" Lico told Reuters Events.

For exclusive wind insights, sign up to our newsletter.

Focusing on one model size could lead to reduced manufacturing costs thanks to standardization and industrialization, hence providing Western OEMs and their component suppliers with the ""clearest path to return to profitability,"" Lico said.

A focus on more mature existing technology would enable the supply chain to ""reap the quality and cost benefit of consistent volume and an industrialized wind turbine technology over many years,"" the Vestas spokesperson said.

""Designing technology with the current supply chain in mind will result in cost predictability, shorter execution times, and industry scalability,"" the spokesperson said.

Timing risk

Developers look to optimise power generation and in some cases smaller turbines can be more cost-competitive because they can produce more power at slower wind speeds, feature more mature technology, or are more readily available.

Developer Ocean Winds, a 50/50 joint venture owned by EDP Renewables and ENGIE, selects the best turbine size for a given project while also ""considering time to market,"" a company spokesperson said.

Global offshore wind turbine market share for operating projects (end of 2022)

The pioneering 800 MW Vineyard Wind project in Massachusetts (Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners and Avangrid) is currently installing an earlier turbine model by GE Vernova designed to operate at 14.7 MW. Meanwhile, the 2.6 GW Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project will install 14.7 MW Siemens Gamesa turbines (SGRE) in the next few years while Orsted has chosen the 11 MW Siemens Gamesa models for the 924 MW Sunrise Wind project in New York.

Vestas has received firm orders for 15 MW turbines from projects in Poland, Germany and the Netherlands and has signed conditional agreements to supply the turbine to Equinor's Empire 1 and 2 projects in New York, the company said. Empire Wind 1 is slated to start producing power in 2026 but Empire Wind 2 has yet to secure an offtake agreement.

The standardisation of turbines at existing capacities would reduce the need for new larger vessels or significant upgrades to existing vessels.

A lack of U.S. wind turbine installation vessels remains a significant risk for project developers, exposing companies to global vessel supply markets and workarounds using barges to transport into and out of East Coast ports.

""The cost savings from the larger turbines are partially lost to increased vessel costs,"" Sorensen noted.

Bidding year

A raft of U.S. offshore wind auctions this year will indicate whether developers will be happy to focus on 15 MW turbines in their mid-term growth plans.

Developers including Orsted, Avangrid, Vineyard Offshore, EDP and Engie bid to secure up to 6 GW of new offshore wind capacity in the latest power auctions by three New England states. Together, the East Coast states of New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Maryland plan to tender for around 16 GW of offshore wind power in 2024.

Lico expects GE Vernova, Vestas and Siemens Gamesa to focus on the 14 to 15 MW range until 2029-2030, when they could start launching bigger models.

""They will continue to co-exist with the next-generation turbine for some years (beginning of '30s) until we fully transition to 20 MW [plus],"" he said.

Developers will continue to be tempted by larger turbines and lower costs, and ongoing innovations by Chinese suppliers could spur Western suppliers to refocus towards larger units.

Indeed, Siemens Gamesa has announced plans to develop ""the world's largest offshore turbine generator"" and has received funding from the European Union for a prototype model.

""If the competitors keep going bigger, GE Vernova and Vestas may have to as well, no matter their preferences,"" Sorensen said.",reutersevents.com,news,reutersevents.com,,0.3254901960784313,453471566,1,https://d2921o69vu3u9x.cloudfront.net/rtr34s8z_reuters_fabian_bimmer_0.jpg?0vx.FbTC0xEeYjRBMLxoQXwbMvDy9qVm,eng-9569264

REW, a German-based energy group, has announced plans to build a new green hydrogen plant in Grangemouth on the site of the current petrol refinery station operated by Ineos.

The company has secured a grid connection as well as shortlisting electrolyser suppliers as the project is hoped to make a positive impact towards the Scottish Government's Net Zero ambitions.

The current plans propose to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at the site and the initial projected capacity is to be up to 200MWe, with the ambition to potentially produce up to 3.6 tonnes of hydrogen per hour in future expansions.

Initial plans aim to have the site operational by 2029 with the next steps being submitting a planning application and running consultations on the project with local communities.

Sopna Sury, COO Hydrogen RWE Generation, says the project aligns with the Scottish Government's vision of a Just Transition and will put Scotland at the forefront of the green revolution.

She said: ""This is a significant step towards RWE's ambitions for the production of green hydrogen in Scotland.

""As one of the world's leading energy companies, RWE has significant experience in onshore and offshore wind, developing green hydrogen production plants and operating large-scale gas plants.

""This project at Grangemouth aligns with the Scottish Government's vision for a 'Just Transition', putting Scotland at the forefront of the green revolution while protecting jobs and decarbonising Grangemouth.""

Colin Pritchard, sustainability director at the INEOS Grangemouth site, says the proposed plans for the green hydrogen plant will place Grangemouth firmly at the heart of Scotland's future.

Since 2018, pupils at Baysgarth School have designed and built Greenpower electric kit cars, gaining hands-on science, maths and engineering skills in the process. Students have competed at iconic tracks including Silverstone and secured apprenticeships at some of the region's biggest employers, including Ineos and Croda.

Baysgarth is now seeking sponsors to build its own racing track, believed to be the first of its kind at a school. The test track is to pave the way for the development of a regional STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) centre at the school.

""We've cultivated a real passion for STEM and sustainable energy at Baysgarth, providing students with phenomenal experiences in the process,"" said Jade Driscoll, head teacher at Baysgarth School. ""Greenpower is already well integrated into the curriculum with reverse engineering sessions and electronic, friction and speed training kits, but this STEM project will further enhance this.

""The purpose-built track will allow students the opportunity to experience real-life pit stop challenges and to go full throttle around the course, whilst also developing skills and knowledge suitable for the local labour market."" The track will also not just be available to the school's students. Ms Driscoll said it will also be open to the wider community for smaller group races, F1 grand prix style events, and more.

The secondary school aims to raise £130,000 to be able to build the track. The council's £40,000 investment together with the support of local organisations, student fundraising events, and the determination of the Baysgarth team has helped raised already the majority of the funding. ""We would like to extend a huge thank you to North Lincolnshire Council for their significant investment, along with VPI Immingham, Cemex, RWE, Barrow Rotary and ADJ Surfacing, without whom this would not be possible,"" added Ms Driscoll.

""This is a tremendous opportunity for our young people, enabling them to gain hands-on, cutting-edge experience in STEM subjects and bringing design and technology to life in the most engaging way,"" said North Lincolnshire Council leader Cllr Rob Waltham. He added it had worked closely with Barton Ward councillors and the school.

""North Lincolnshire is at the forefront of the UK's green energy revolution, and this is a great example of how we can align school curriculums to the needs of employers in these emerging industries, helping our young people secure high-skill, high-wage local jobs."" Besides racing, the track will also be an all-weather running track for local athletics groups, a safe environment to undertake cycling proficiency training, and host a range of wellbeing activities.

""The fact that this exciting project has already helped students secure apprenticeships with global science and chemical engineering companies is a brilliant testament, but we don't want its impact to end there,"" said Cllr Julie Reed, cabinet member for children, families and communities. The investment would help more young people across North Lincolnshire benefit from high-quality, real-world experience in STEM subjects, she added.

C-Ventus is being sold by DISA International

Føn Energy Services is to acquire Dutch offshore wind farm services company C-Ventus to create a leading European O&M player within offshore wind.

Føn Energy Services is backed by Norwegian industrial group IKM and Oslo-listed industrial investment company Akastor.

It has approximately 90 employees and three decades of O&M experience from the offshore market.

The company currently has operations in Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and Germany.

The deal will see Føn Energy Services acquiring 100% of the shares in C-Ventus from current owner DISA International, a global provider of marine engineering, civil construction and offshore oil and gas services.

The consideration consists primarily of shares in Føn Energy Services resulting in DISA controlling 22.67% of class A shares in the company.

Akastor and The IKM Group will both control 38.67% of the Class A shares. The parties have not disclosed the financial details of the transaction.

DISA International's managing director, Didier de Graaff, will join the Føn Energy Services board of directors.

Didier de Graaff, managing director of DISA International, said: ""Although the transaction is legally structured as an acquisition, from an operational perspective it is a merger of competence, manpower, businesses, and brands.

""We look forward to becoming shareholders of the combined business and to developing the group together with the two powerful and highly reputable co-owners IKM and Akastor.""

Torben Hald, chief executive of Føn Energy Services, (pictured: right) said: ""Combining a strong presence in the North Sea and the financial muscles of Føn Energy Services with C-Ventus' European track-record and scalable operating model with in-house project management and engineering, enable us to strengthen our integrated service model and deliver cost-efficient O&M service operators across Europe.""

C-Ventus's expertise covers balance of plant-services for both topside and subsea equipment, installation support and decommissioning services.

The company delivers project management and engineering from its Dutch headquarters and utilises a Europe-wide network of approximately 350 field technicians with 10+ years of experience to execute on O&M work.

Its scalable operating model is based on designing optimal O&M concepts tailored for the individual offshore wind farm which includes the use of technology, digital solutions, logistics set-up and team composition, according to the company.

Over the past 12 years, C-Ventus has supported more than 25 offshore wind farms in the UK, Germany, the Netherlands, and Belgium. The company's client list includes names such as Vestas, Vattenfall, RWE, Eneco, TenneT, Shell and many others.

Didier de Graaff, managing director of DISA International, (pictured: left) said: ""Our joint plan is to take C-Ventus' well proven and highly efficient O&M operating model, apply it to Føn Energy Services, and use it as a catalyst for geographical expansion to the rest of Europe.

""Our business model enables us to scale up our business substantially without incurring unnecessary costs for our clients. We look forward to building an even stronger O&M player together with Føn Energy Services.""

Following the completion of the merger, C-Ventus will start to operate under the Føn Energy Services brand immediately.

Føn Energy Services has an ambition of industrializing and digitizing the O&M segment of the wind industry to increase efficiency and reduce cost of operations.

Part of its strategy is to utilise M&A to consolidate, scale up and further professionalize the O&M segment of the offshore wind value chain.

Partnering with C-Ventus is the first stepping stone of this M&A strategy to build up a large, leading European O&M player within offshore wind.

Føn Energy Services will adopt C-Ventus' operating model and expand this to the North Sea region and elsewhere in Europe. Føn Energy Services' owners, IKM, Akastor and DISA, aim to contribute with their industrial backing as well as extensive customer networks in the region.

Hald added: ""With C-Ventus now becoming part of Føn Energy services, we will expand our market presence to also include UK, Belgium, and the Netherlands.",renews.biz,news,Renews,,0.2941176470588236,453461218,1,https://renews.biz/media/31662/thumbnail_didier-de-graaff-disa-international-left-_-torben-hald-foen-energy-services-right.jpeg?width=640,

The OnePlus Buds 3 arrive as another pair of fairly affordable buds in this spirit, but they're among the better such options.

So are they some of the best budget earbuds around? They're not far off. You're probably considering the OnePlus Buds 3 if you own one of the best OnePlus phones already, but you'll be able to enjoy them if you own any other brand of mobile smartphone too; unlike Apple, OnePlus doesn't lock its tech to pre-existing customers.

At a glance, the OnePlus Buds 3 bear more than a passing resemblance to their predecessors, the OnePlus Buds 2 Pro. And while it's true, these aren't exactly wild revisions on the 2023 models, they're more affordable and have some improvements across the board.

In some areas, OnePlus may have gone too far, and the sound quality is something of a sore spot. In our Buds 2 Pro review we said bass was ""not especially heavy"" and the Buds 3 have overcorrected, taking inspiration from the RWE Bagger 288 (which Google tells me is the heaviest vehicle in the world) because it's heavy.

The bass on the Buds 3 is just too much, no matter how much playing around you do in the equalizer, blowing the treble into the distant corners of the sound mix. You shouldn't buy these if you like a balanced or neutral sound.

Did I say equalizer? Yes I did, because that's one of the many cool features packed into the smartphone tie-in app. Other features include spatial audio, ear canal scanning to get a tailor-made sound, the ability to change to different active noise cancellation (ANC) modes and more. For not-really-that-expensive earbuds, the feature range on display is really something.

You'll have to enjoy these features in small bursts, though, because the OnePlus Buds 3 will only last for 6.5 hours of listening in one go when ANC is turned on. Turning it off boosts that to 10 hours, but that's still nothing to write home about - thankfully the case is generous with extra charges.

That ANC is pretty good, too, and it's got to be one of the best I've tested in the sub-$100 / £100 / AU$200 price range. There are a range of strength levels and a transparency mode, to let you fully customize how much sound comes through, but at any level the buds are a dab hand at getting rid of annoying unwanted noises.

While they're not quite fantastic enough to make it into our ranking of the best wireless earbuds, the OnePlus Buds 3 do have a lot going for them. If you receive them as a gift alongside a OnePlus phone, you should count yourself lucky, and they're well worth considering even if you have to buy them on their own.

The OnePlus Buds 3 were officially unveiled at the end of January 2024, in lieu of the new smartphone the company sometimes unveils at the beginning of the year.

You'll pay $99 / £89 AU$179 to pick up the buds - in theory, though these are the kind of earbuds that you're more likely to acquire through pre-order bonuses or as a free gift with a OnePlus phone, rather than as a chosen purchase.

That price shows these as being more affordable (read: lower-end) than 2023's OnePlus Buds 2 Pro, despite being similar in terms of design and the feature set. Unless you find those dramatically marked down, the OnePlus Buds 3 will be a much more tempting purchase.

The OnePlus Buds 3 earbuds have a middling battery life: 10 hours with ANC turned off, which drops to 6.5 hours when it's on. That's not amazing, though some rivals last an even shorter amount of time. The charging case rockets that figure up to 44 hours (with ANC off, 28 with it on) which is a much bigger jump-up than cases often provide, so people on long journeys can rely on this case.

When setting up the OnePlus Buds 3, I was perturbed to find no tie-in app available on the Google Play Store. Instead, I was prompted (both by the recommended suggestions, and OnePlus' own website), to install a third-party app called HeyMelody which has a pretty low rating on the Play Store. It seems this is how people without a OnePlus phone control the buds - handsets from the company seemingly have a first-party control app.

It's worth bearing in mind that the buds worked well without the app, and I only downloaded it to access extra features. You can enjoy music and noise cancellation without HeyMelody, you just can't control your sound, or access certain extras you're paying for.

The app lets you play with an equalizer (more on that later) and adjust noise cancellation, with an impressive range of options in terms of strength and efficacy (a Transparency mode cancels some sounds but maintains important ones). It's actually mildly handy once you've set it up, though it's definitely not required.

You can also use the app to set up the touch controls: the two buds can have individual commands mapped for one, two or three taps, as well as a long hold or a slide gesture. That's a lot of potential, though I found that the almost-imperceptible button area meant I frequently missed the correct area when trying to use the touch controls.

The OnePlus Buds 3 are among the better earbuds at this price that I've tested when it comes to noise cancellation, using a deft hand to remove annoying background noises. I tested in Max mode, although there are degrees of intensity if you'd rather only strip out a middling amount of sound.

HeyMelody brings two extra features I'd like to flag: first off is Golden Sound, which lets the buds scan your ear canal in order to calibrate your music. The instructions on the test are poorly worded and it took me a few tries to figure out what it was actually asking, but it's a cool additional feature, even if the results are barely audible.

Then there's OnePlus 3D Audio, which had a much more palpable effect. This is basically spatial audio, and it really creates a sense of dynamic (though artificial) soundstage, really improving music. It's only available on certain apps so I'm not going to take it into account for the music quality section later, but luckily the super-niche music app Spotify (you may have heard of it) is one of the compatible apps.

One thing I should note is that the OnePlus Buds 3 had a pretty slow average phone pairing time compared to most rivals I've tested. When I put the buds on, they'd take up to ten seconds to connect with my phone, and almost always over five, which is slower than basically every other alternative I've tried.

This was also the case when I first set up the earbuds, and my phone took a good while to detect them.

I've got to say, I'm a big fan of the look of the OnePlus Buds 3.

The carry case is a tiny lightweight pebble, measuring just 5.9 x 5 x 2.6 cm and weighing 40.8g - that's the kind of case you can easily lose in your bag or pocket, it's more svelte than the majority of its competitors. It has naught but the essentials - space for the earbuds, and a USB-C charging port.

I did find that the smooth material of the buds made them a tad hard to remove from the case though - every removal required roughly three slips before a successful attempt.

The case is made from plastic, hence its lightness, though it does feel like it'd snap if you clenched it in your fist too hard. Our smartest gadget-reviewing minds have a suggestion: don't do that.

Like their carry case, the buds themselves are incredibly lightweight, with their 4.8g barely registering on scales (or your ear). As wireless earbuds go, they're pretty barebones: no OnePlus branding, no obvious sensor or buttons, just a tip and a stem.

There is, in fact, a sensor on each earbud, but it's denoted just by a slightly matted area on the stem, so you'd be forgiven for missing it. It's so subtle that it avoids detection not just by your eyes, but by your fingertips too - but I've already discussed that above.

The buds have IP55 certification, which means they'll survive splashes or bursts of water, but shouldn't be submerged in liquid.

You can't exactly expect precision-tuned sound on earbuds that cost this little, and you won't get that on the OnePlus Buds 3. That said, they're nothing to turn your nose up at either for this money.

These earbuds will appeal to people who like their bass-heavy sound, because that's exactly what they provide. Whatever kind of music I tested, from pop and house to acoustic singer-songwriter tracks, the lower range of instruments and notes was always a lot more prevalent.

Some people might like that, but it was a little overbearing in plenty of songs - you don't listen to rock to only hear the guitar's lower E string, after all. Treble is all but blown out, meaning vocal lines lose their clean sparkle and harmonies and countermelodies were often harder to hear than I'd like.

The mids within my reference music tracks often stood up to the brutal barrages from the bass, but treble was almost always less prominent than I'd like. Saying that, sometimes when it was palpable, peaking made me wish it was buried even further...

The in-app equalizer lets you tweak your sound to a certain extent, with a few presets, a customization option and also a bass boost option, but honestly I found all of my tweaking was for naught. The equalizer is very light touch, and you might not notice changes unless you're really (really) listening for them.

As mentioned before, it's hard to envision someone buying the OnePlus Buds 3 full-price, given that they're likely designed to be bundled with a new OnePlus phone.

If that's how you're acquiring these buds, they're a great little gift; they're solid all-around wearables that'll save you from having to buy a separate pair to use with your brand new shiny smartphone.

If you're paying full-price, the value proposition is different. The OnePlus Buds 3 are fine for their price (and you're certainly getting some flagship fit and spatial audio features), but there are other sub-$100/£100/AU$100 rivals that'll give you more sonic bang for your buck.

The OnePlus Buds 3 were tested over the course of the week, with the review writing period rounding the testing period out by a few extra days. The main device I paired with was a Xiaomi Mi Note 10 smartphone, but I also tested it alongside a Windows laptop and an iPad. I did not test it with a OnePlus phone.

I listened to a range of music genres in different places including my office, my home and on various walks around my neighborhood. I mostly tied with the strongest noise cancellation mode and the EQ set to the default setting.

He'd hinted as much when the deal was first announced late last year, issuing a paean to steel's role in winning World War II and building the America he grew up in. The president from Scranton, Pennsylvania, was not going to abandon steelworkers -- or, more to the point, be seen as abandoning them -- in an election year.

""I told our steelworkers I have their backs, and I meant it,"" Biden said, assuaging the concerns of U.S. Steel employees who have been consistently against the acquisition. The Biden administration is scrutinizing the proposed takeover under the standard but utterly opaque procedures of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, and a final ruling could come after the election. Biden's rival fusses less with procedural niceties. ""I would block it instantaneously. Absolutely, "" former President Donald Trump said in January.

Oddly, a few days after Biden's March statement, his administration unveiled a $6 billion plan to help decarbonize energy-intensive industries, including steel. Further decarbonizing steel, a major contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions, is one of the first things that Nippon Steel highlighted in presenting its takeover bid last year, and U.S. Steel through recent acquisitions is already on the same path, investing billions of dollars in advanced minimills that use new technology (and fewer workers) to make cleaner steel.

But unions, which like the labor-intensive, old-fashioned, coal-fueled blast furnaces, see things differently. The older steel mills require more workers to make the same amount of steel, and those workers pay union dues; the newer minimills require fewer people and are generally nonunion shops. David McCall, the president of United Steelworkers, North America's largest industrial union, told Bloomberg News in April that, in the authors' words, ""securing specific investments that will ensure another generation of life at the blast furnaces"" is what matters to the union, not who owns U.S. Steel.

That battle between the past and the future is playing out in places such as Gary, Indiana. Gary Works, the largest steel plant in the United States and the rusting jewel in the U.S. Steel portfolio, has been churning out huge volumes of steel from its gigantic furnaces for more than a century. The factory makes more steel than the entirety of the United Kingdom and all but 20 countries. But it makes it dirtier than most.

The competing imperatives to keep old plants functioning -- to keep the unions at bay -- and to make cosmetic environmental fixes -- to pacify the administration and investors -- explains why U.S. Steel announced in April a limited trial program to capture carbon emissions at Gary Works. The problem is that the system would scrub at best 0.5 percent of the plant's annual emissions, and it wouldn't touch the rest of what comes out of the smokestacks. There are several pathways to green steel; this, for now, is not one of them.

""This is the largest single emitter in Indiana, and that is saying something,"" said Ben Inskeep, a program director at Citizens Action Coalition, Indiana's biggest environmental advocacy group. Coke, a coal byproduct used in traditional steelmaking, pollutes the local air in Gary to a degree that alarms even Britons. ""We have concerns that they are keeping the blast oven furnace open by locking in this carbon capture route,"" Inskeep said. He'd prefer a wholesale shift to newer technologies that use electricity, not coal, to make steel.

""Our vision of sustainable steel is going to first and foremost benefit the workers who are breathing this day in and day out,"" he said.

Steel doesn't invade headlines like fashionable metals such as lithium or cobalt do, and it doesn't monopolize attention or even policy the way semiconductors do. But there is nothing more central to the modern world -- not to the material world, not to the green transition, and certainly not to trade and economic nationalism.

Steel holds up skyscrapers and trade agreements between the United States and Europe. It makes wind turbines tall, new cars sleek, and old politicians nostalgic. It is at once a relic of the 19th century and the building block of the next. And it is where trade, industrial policy, national power, and the climate revolution come to do battle.

Today, the world makes more steel every year, nearly 2 billion metric tons, than it did during the entire 19th century; the growth curve for steel output this century is nearly vertical, with global production more than doubling just since 2000. And despite a brief slowdown in world production growth in recent years after the COVID-19 pandemic and thanks to stubborn overcapacity, steel output will only keep growing, as the appetite for new cars, new power plants, and new buildings continues apace.

Even as historic European steelmakers such as ThyssenKrupp scale back their production to fight off cheap Asian imports, India plans to double its production of steel to 300 million metric tons a year by the end of the decade. That is the equivalent of adding the entire steel output of Japan and the United States -- the world's third- and fourth-largest producers, respectively -- in just the next five years. China, which already makes about half the world's steel, is spending tens of billions of dollars to build new coal-fired steel mills, despite its own overcapacity issues.

Steel, which is basically iron mixed with a little bit of carbon to make it stronger and more malleable, has been around in artisanal quantities for centuries: The famous samurai swords and the blades using Damascus steel were made by hand with high-quality steel. But production at an industrial scale began in the middle of the 19th century with Henry Bessemer's breakthrough process to cheaply turn pig iron into molten steel. The flood of affordable steel allowed the rise of railroads and, after a little more technical tinkering, structural steel that spanned rivers and soared skyward.

Most of the world's steel plants today operate a blast furnace that uses pulverized coke to turn pig iron into steel -- essentially more advanced descendants of Bessemer's first plants in Victorian England. More innovative plants today use electricity to zap scrap metal into steel, a less carbon-intensive way to produce the metal but one that requires ready supplies of affordable electricity and scrap metal.

Either way, the uses are endless -- literally so, since steel is infinitely recyclable. A typical car uses nearly a metric ton of steel. A double-track kilometer of high-speed rail needs 240 metric tons of steel. A wind turbine uses about 900 metric tons.

""At its most basic, pretty much all your major infrastructure, buildings, bridges, energy systems, water supply, all of this is built with steel,"" said Kevin Dempsey, the president and chief executive of the American Iron and Steel Institute, a trade association. ""So what we need to live and move around in and do our digital jobs still requires a lot of steel and even more going forward.""

But steel is also central to the problem of climate change, accounting for about 8 percent of global carbon dioxide emissions. That's mostly because the vast majority of the world's steel mills are the old blast furnace and basic oxygen furnace kind, like the one getting a new lease on life in Gary or the dozens under construction in China and India. Those emit about 2.2 metric tons of carbon dioxide for every metric ton of steel produced. (The world makes about 1.9 billion metric tons of steel a year.)

Much like the nasty environmental impacts of cement, the other unsexy but utterly ubiquitous material of the modern world, steel's climate footprint was long considered virtually insoluble; the entire process involves huge amounts of coal and heat. But unlike cement, the bulk of steel's carbon emissions aren't actually baked in. Secondary types of steelmaking, especially melting scrap metal with heavy-duty electric arcs, can reduce carbon emissions per metric ton of steel by about 60 percent or more. Even more advanced techniques just being developed to clean up the iron reduction part of steelmaking by using hydrogen promise even greener steel in the future.

""There has been a lot of progress because there is a lot of demand for green steel from construction, from the automotive industry,"" said Julia Attwood, an industrial decarbonization specialist at BloombergNEF, a research and analysis firm. ""They all need to make things greener, and that is what kick-started steel.""

There is plenty of talk these days about government and corporate plans to decarbonize heavy industry, especially steel, given how central it is to the real economy and the one that politicians from Scranton to Shanghai imagine they must protect. The Biden administration is throwing billions of dollars at the problem. The European Union has a REPowerEU plan that aims to clean up steel, at least a bit. Nippon Steel, when not busy with its stalled takeover bid, aims to decarbonize operations on several continents. Even steelmakers in retreat, such as ThyssenKrupp, are spending money on next-generation technologies to ensure what steel they do still produce will be greener than what came before.

The push for green steel isn't just because the sector accounts for nearly one-tenth of global emissions. It is also because steel will underpin nearly everything that will enable the full transition to cleaner, greener technologies -- lightweight electric car bodies and power trains, massive new wind turbines, solar power arrays, and advanced nuclear power plants. Companies that are betting their future on making products for the carbon-free future can't build it with gear from a carbon-coated past.

""We're going to require a lot more steel if we succeed in moving toward a green energy revolution, in terms of wind, solar, nuclear, natural gas, whatever -- that's a lot of steel,"" Dempsey said.

""We had to reinvest in Oxelosund, a huge source of carbon emissions, so instead of doing that, we said, 'Let's look at the U.S. and minimills and look at doing something similar here,'"" said Martin Lindqvist, SSAB's outgoing president and CEO. SSAB's U.S. operations had experience with electric arc furnaces, which are much more common in the United States than in Europe.

Around the same time, SSAB had teamed up with ore miner LKAB and energy firm Vattenfall to use fossil-free electricity and hydrogen to make virgin iron with no carbon emissions to feed a steel mill. By 2020, the three companies had a pilot plant starting to churn out small amounts of fossil-free sponge iron.

With that in hand, SSAB decided to overhaul more than a single plant -- the idea was to remake the entire Nordic steel industry by turning old blast furnaces into more modern electric arc furnaces. One after another, the company is turning its old, smoky steel mills into sleeker, electric-fired, much greener plants. Just this April, SSAB announced that it was moving faster than anticipated to transform the big plant at Lulea, in northern Sweden, to all electric-arc operations. When the steel mill conversions are complete, it will lower Sweden's national emissions of carbon dioxide by 10 percent.

The goal is to produce entirely fossil-free steel at Oxelosund by 2026 and throughout the company by 2030. Just keeping the existing plants operational for another decade would have cost more than $2 billion. For about $4.8 billion, SSAB is creating a plant that will make more steel, with a better product mix, and almost no emissions.

""It's a no-brainer,"" Lindqvist said. ""It makes business sense. The customers are extremely interested.""

When it comes to green steel, the demand pull is indeed very strong. SSAB started working with automaker Volvo, and later Mercedes-Benz; both want to start introducing clean steel in their cars. Other industries that are under pressure to clean up their products are also increasingly clamoring for cleaner steel, such as the construction industry, Lindqvist said. SSAB gets some state assistance for its innovative fossil-free iron project from Sweden and perhaps soon the United States, but the company insists that the steel transformation is answering a market need.

""What we see now is very strong demand, even though Chinese steel is available at low prices,"" Lindqvist said. ""Politics and policy are very helpful, but in the end, this will be demand-driven.""

One of the industries demanding cleaner steel is one whose whole raison d'être is to make cleaner electricity: wind power. After all, it won't do very well to keep building new wind turbines with hundreds of metric tons of steel made from coke and smoke.

Last year, Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy, a leading wind power company, launched the GreenerTower, a wind turbine that uses steel with one-third the carbon footprint of traditional towers, and quickly landed its first customer, a Danish offshore wind farm of German utility RWE. Siemens Gamesa gets the steel from German steelmaker Salzgitter AG, using electric arc furnaces powered by offshore wind power.

""If you had asked me a year ago, 18 months ago, I would have said that before 2030, there will not be much green steel available,"" said Maximilian Schnippering, the head of sustainability at Siemens Gamesa. ""But in the course of the last year, things have really accelerated.""

Other turbine-makers, such as Denmark's Vestas, are offering their own towers made with green steel. Orsted, a Danish clean energy company that partners with Vestas on sustainability projects, just landed the first consignment of heavier low-carbon steel to be used for the foundations of offshore wind turbines. GE Vernova is just going straight to the source, providing new power management technologies for steelmakers to handle the fluctuating loads of electricity that come with the conversion to electric arc furnaces. Siemens Gamesa is now looking at how to recycle its own wind turbine towers for much-needed scrap metal to feed cleaner mills and how to source the rest of a turbine's steel needs with cleaner and greener steel.

""I think, over the course of the next two, three years, we will see quite green supply chains available,"" Schnippering said. ""I'm much more optimistic that things will go faster.""

It's not just Swedes, Danes, and other leafy Europeans. SSAB got the idea for greening its entire operations from the experiences of its U.S. division. That's because the United States is one of the greener steel-producing countries in the world, especially in its newest electric-fired minimills. Just over two-thirds of America's steelmaking capacity uses electric arc furnaces, with roughly the remaining one-third using the old-fashioned kind. Globally, the proportions are reversed, with China and India in particular betting on traditional forms of steelmaking to underpin their ambitious expansions.

A metric ton of U.S. steel made using electric arc furnaces produces about 600 kilograms of carbon dioxide; even China's most advanced plants produce more than double that. But the vast majority of China's (and India's) steel plants are old blast furnaces, which emit about four times as much carbon as the cleanest U.S. steel (and more than legacy U.S. steel plants, too).

""The United States has some of the lowest carbon intensities because of the electric arc furnaces,"" said Attwood of BloombergNEF. Even without waiting for new breakthroughs in hydrogen and other near-zero alternatives, she said, the most environmentally conscious option for most steel production is using recycled steel and electric arc furnaces -- especially as countries everywhere scramble to meet ambitious climate targets.

""To get to net zero, everybody has to decarbonize, so steel's time is coming,"" she said.

U.S. Steel, for all the flak it may take from environmental advocates for its continued operation of old-fashioned blast furnaces, is moving firmly in that direction. Between 2019 and 2021, before it became a takeover target in its own right, it spent about $1.5 billion to acquire Big River Steel, a minimill operator that runs one of the most advanced steel plants in the United States. U.S. Steel is investing $3 billion to build another state-of-the-art electric minimill nearby. Two cornerstones of U.S. Steel's new pitch are cleaner, advanced grades of steel that cater to environmentally conscious customers and specialty steel for the electricity and electric vehicle sectors. The shift to greenery, which Nippon Steel wants to take even further, is one of the companies' selling points for the stalled cross-border takeover.

If the United States, which is still the fourth-largest steelmaker in the world, can be so heavily tilted toward advanced, electric arc mills, why can't everybody? Why is the bulk of tomorrow's global steel capacity still turning to a playbook essentially written in the 19th century?

First, the electric-fired minimills, which are largely fed using scrap metal, still can't make all the grades of steel that industry requires. ""Scrap has residuals that can have a detrimental impact,"" said Dempsey of the American Iron and Steel Institute. ""For more advanced grades, for automobiles, the sheet metal, that is where you need higher virgin iron content"" from the traditional, integrated steel mills, he added.

Not all countries have access to abundant scrap metal like that found in the U.S. market; Schnippering of Siemens Gamesa predicts that there will be an industrywide scramble for enough scrap to feed the electric arc furnaces that produce cleaner steel. India's plans to build advanced steel furnaces may be limited by the EU's desire to keep more of its scrap at home to power its own decarbonization.

Not every country has access to reliable, affordable electricity to power the new-generation mills, either. Big River's plant in Arkansas uses the equivalent of 176 megawatts of electricity (1 percent of the entire state's installed generation capacity) to run its furnace, and a local utility is building a massive solar farm next door just to provide clean power to the mill.

But the United States has all those technical advantages -- and a friendly playing field when it comes to international trade. The Biden administration has maintained most of the tariffs that Trump levied on steel imports, ostensibly on national security grounds, invoking the Section 232 provision of U.S. trade law to levy tariffs on threatening imports. Trade experts then and now, as well as defense industry veterans, largely agree that the move was about everything but national security. The steel industry can reimagine those tariffs as an environmental measure now that decarbonizing steel is all the rage.

""You want to incentivize the production of clean steel in the United States, and the biggest threat is the threat of cheap but dirty steel that [other countries] are making in the same old steel mills they built 30 years ago,"" Dempsey said. He even suggested the idea of a border adjustment tax to penalize carbon-intensive imports, which would make cleaner (but pricier) U.S. steel more competitive.

It's not just a steel industry fantasy. Biden in May tripled the tariffs on imports of Chinese steel -- though China exports little steel to the United States anyway -- couching the measure as a way to protect U.S. workers from emissions-intensive Chinese imports. ""China's policies and subsidies for their domestic steel and aluminum industries mean high-quality, low-emissions U.S. products are undercut by artificially low-priced Chinese alternatives produced with higher emissions,"" the White House said in a statement.

And the administration is now talking about using tariffs even more in the future -- not on questionable national security grounds but as a climate change measure. That very notion has been at the heart of more than two years of stalled negotiations with Europe over a new, rich-country club of clean steel producers.

In April, the Biden administration's new climate envoy, John Podesta, suggested that the United States might be open to some sort of carbon border adjustment, a fancy way to say new tariffs on old, dirty products. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who has been vocal about a flood of cheap Chinese goods that threaten U.S. manufacturing, has floated similar ideas. All the while, Biden has been promoting a ""Buy America"" plan to make sure that his administration's massive investments in new infrastructure are built with U.S. steel and iron.

Between new tariffs and old economic nationalism, steel has become as central to the Biden reelection campaign in the Rust Belt as it is to the modern world and the green transition. But just how has a domestic industry that now employs a mere 80,000 or so people come to utterly dominate U.S. trade policy?

That argument, as old as U.S. political economy, was laughingly demolished in later congressional testimony. ""We, the steel men, don't need protection anymore. Protection now can only work a serious injustice to the consumer,"" the witness told lawmakers.

There is nothing unusual about that debate; it's the same one raging now among the White House, Congress, trade negotiators, and white-shoe law firms. The only odd thing about it was that both arguments came from the same man: Andrew Carnegie -- first in 1890 as the head of the empire that would become U.S. Steel and several years later as a retired, and less self-interested, philanthropist.

The question of special trade protection for steel is not, of course, something unique to Biden or Trump, though both have made it a central part of their economic nationalism message. Former U.S. President George W. Bush, too, raised tariffs on steel to woo votes, as did most of the presidents who came immediately before him. It goes back further: The decades after the Civil War were a protectionist's dream, and steel reaped the biggest rewards. U.S. protectionism for steel, in a very real way, goes back even further than the invention of modern steelmaking itself: Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton's 1791 Report on Manufactures immediately laid the groundwork for more than two centuries of tariffs to promote U.S. industry.

""The steel industry has not been shy about using its historical heft and its geography, being located in a lot of electorally important places, to push for protection,"" said Scott Lincicome, a trade expert at the Cato Institute. Trump's once and perhaps future trade negotiator, Robert Lighthizer, is the dean of steel industry protectionists, chasing those goals as a lawyer for the industry for decades, pushing tariffs as trade representative during Trump's tenure, and proposing even more for next time.

""In terms of using trade laws to its advantage, steel is probably the No. 1 example,"" said Lincicome, who spent two decades practicing international trade law.

The U.S. steelmaking industry employs about 0.05 percent of the country's nonfarm workforce, yet, Lincicome argued, ""steel has hijacked American trade policy. It is not just the Section 232 tariffs. It is not just the 'Buy America' regulations. It is the entire World Trade Organization as well.""

One of the industry's favorite methodological tricks for securing favorable trade remedies -- known as ""zeroing"" in technical parlance -- involves ignoring fairly priced imports and focusing only on cheaper imports to justify across-the-board tariffs. It is also anathema to the World Trade Organization (WTO). So, over successive administrations from both parties dating back years, the United States essentially shut down the WTO's ability to adjudicate trade disputes. ""It's insanity,"" Lincicome said.

A smokestack industry is so central to so many trade fights not because of what steel actually represents in employment or even economic terms but because of what it symbolizes. Even today, political scientists tend to measure national power by counting a country's steel and iron production, among other crude metrics. Steel's historical echo -- especially for politicians who came of age during America's postwar industrial boom -- is deafening, even more so when steel production is concentrated in politically fickle swing states.

""U.S. Steel has been an iconic American steel company for more than a century,"" Biden said when he came out in open opposition to the planned Japanese takeover in March, ""and it is vital for it to remain an American steel company that is domestically owned and operated.""

But even the purely national security arguments for the sanctity of U.S.-made steel -- the formal justification, then and now, for the Trump-era tariffs on steel imports that Biden has maintained -- ring hollow. Nearly the entirety of U.S.-made steel has other uses than tanks, guns, and ships; protecting an entire industry for the roughly 1 percent used for defense purposes is what makes trade experts howl. And even in cases where the military has relied exclusively on U.S.-made steel, the results haven't always been stainless.

Take nuclear submarines. For decades, below-standard U.S.-made steel was fraudulently sold to the U.S. Navy and used on Virginia-class subs; there were no reported accidents, but the Navy did have to spend more on maintenance. Now, as part of a nuclear submarine deal with Britain and Australia, the Navy will trial small batches of Australian-made specialty steel for the submarines it has to build in years to come. (Britain, the inventor of the modern steel industry, is no better off: The Royal Navy has to get all its specialized steel for submarines and surface ships from abroad.)

The magnified place of steel, whether in politicians' imaginations, campaign aides' calculations, or trade lawyers' hourly earnings, has real impacts that make it harder for the United States to achieve many of the things it keeps saying it wants to accomplish.

Take the transition to a cleaner, lower-carbon future and revitalized infrastructure. The United States and Europe have spent years at loggerheads over Trump's steel tariffs and years more squabbling over what was meant to be their reconciliation, a partnership to promote green steel and punish dirtier producers, which just happen to be their main trade bogeymen anyway.

But negotiations on this proposed partnership, known as the Global Arrangement on Sustainable Steel and Aluminum, have stalled because Washington wants to use blanket tariffs on steel to protect all its production, even from dirty old blast furnaces in competitive battleground states, while Europeans keep trying to simply apply their existing domestic carbon price to imports that don't pass muster.

""A blanket 25 percent tariff on imports from almost every other country in the world has nothing to do with steel's carbon intensity or domestic regulations,"" Lincicome said. ""It's just a tax.""

Or take the Biden administration's Buy America push, requiring U.S.-made iron and steel for infrastructure projects. U.S. steel is a lot more expensive than steel made in Europe, China, or other countries (one of the reasons import tariffs have been so attractive for decades).

""The United States and some other countries are hobbling the infrastructure transition by requiring that it be made at home,"" said Gary Clyde Hufbauer of the Peterson Institute for International Economics. ""So that dilutes the effectiveness of the transition.""

Or take the lingering uncertainty over the Nippon Steel takeover of U.S. Steel, which would create a global behemoth with deep pockets and big ambitions to ramp up the decarbonization of steel in its overseas operations. Nippon Steel's new president, in fact, comes from the electric arc furnace world, not the one dominated by old blast furnaces, and has vowed to make decarbonization one of the company's main objectives going forward.

Or forget everything green, and just look at the Biden administration's plans to revitalize U.S. manufacturing of all stripes. As important as steel production may be, steel use throughout the economy is much more so, directly supporting many more jobs and a lot more economic activity. That's one reason the Trump-Biden tariffs were and are, on balance, such a bad deal. They increased the cost of inputs for nearly everything for everybody just to benefit a few.

""Essentially, U.S. manufacturers are paying double the world market price,"" Lincicome said. ""For downstream manufacturers, it is simply the cost of doing business in the United States.""",foreignpolicy.com,news,Foreign Policy,Keith Johnson,0.03529411764705892,453459694,1,https://foreignpolicy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/steel-production-US-China-GettyImages-976692744.jpg?w=1000,eng-9569360

The decline in earnings was mainly attributed to the result at the Flexible Generation segment which, as expected, fell from ""exceptionally high"" levels a year ago.

RWE reported adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of EUR 1.7 billion (USD 1.8bn), which marks a year-over-year decline of 26%, and adjusted net income of EUR 801 million.

Earnings rose in the company's Offshore Wind segment, mainly due to improved wind conditions, and in its Onshore Wind/Solar segment, driven by capacity additions.

Chief financial officer Michael Mueller said the increased earnings in the offshore and onshore renewables segments show that the company's investments are paying off. ""In the first three months of the year, 42% of our electricity generation came from renewable sources - and we are continuing to invest massively. Currently, we have projects with a total capacity of 8.3 GW under construction,"" he added. RWE aims to expand its green portfolio to more than 65 GW by 2030.

During the first quarter, RWE generated 33,780 GWh of electricity, 42% of which from renewables, compared to a coal share of 28%. The company's power production declined by 9% from a year ago, due to less coal generation and the decommissioning last year of its last German nuclear power station.

Generation from renewables was up 19%, with a significant increase from solar as a result of the 2023 acquisition of US energy firm Con Edison Clean Energy Businesses. The wind business showed an 8% rise, driven by better weather conditions and capacity expansion.

RWE said its 2024 outlook has not changed since March, when it signaled it expects to achieve the lower end of its guidance provided in November 2023 due to a significant drop in electricity prices in the meantime.

While solar and wind power generation at sea and on land performed better than in the same period last year, flexible generation fared much worse. This includes business with hydropower, biomass and gas. The DAX-listed company also performed slightly weaker in energy trading. The Executive Board confirmed its forecast for the year. The share price fell slightly in early trading.

In the first quarter, RWE achieved an operating result before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of 1.71 billion euros, more than a quarter less than a year earlier. Adjusted net profit fell even more sharply by almost 40 percent to 801 million euros. However, according to the data provided by the company, analysts had expected even less.

RWE's electricity production fell by a total of 9 percent to just under 34,000 gigawatt hours, with almost one fifth more electricity coming from renewable energy sources. Renewables now account for 42 percent of RWE's electricity production, while coal accounts for 28 percent.

Chief Financial Officer Michael Müller spoke in the press release of a good first quarter. Investments are paying off, he said. The company is continuing to invest heavily, particularly in renewable energies. RWE invested a total of almost 2.9 billion euros in the first quarter. Almost two thirds of this went into the expansion of offshore wind power and just under a third was spent on onshore solar and wind power plants.

For the year as a whole, RWE continues to expect to achieve the lower end of the forecast ranges issued: For profit in the day-to-day business, this is between 5.2 and 5.8 billion euros. In the worst-case scenario, this would be around a third less than RWE earned in 2023. The range for adjusted net profit is between 1.9 and 2.4 billion euros, which would mean a decline of up to a good 50 percent. Lower electricity prices in particular are putting pressure on earnings.

For Alberto Gandolfi from Goldman Sachs, the merely confirmed forecast harbors a certain opportunity potential. He pointed out that the adjusted group profit already accounts for 42 percent of the target. He praised the figures for the first quarter as ""very strong"" and was positively surprised by the net debt.

Earnings increased for both RWE's offshore wind and onshore wind/solar segments in the first quarter of 2024.

Adjusted EBITDA in the offshore wind segment amounted to €548m, compared to €473m in the first quarter of 2023.

The increase in earnings is mainly due to improved wind conditions.

In the same period of the previous year, these were below the assumed average, RWE said.

The onshore wind/solar segment recorded adjusted EBITDA of €341m compared to €247m in the first quarter of 2023.

The positive earnings development is mainly due to the commissioning of new capacity and the recognition of the business activities of Con Edison Clean Energy Businesses in the US for the full three months.

Moreover, wind conditions at the European onshore sites improved marginally overall, which also had a positive effect, RWE reported.

Michael Müller, chief financial officer of RWE, said: ""We can look back on a solid first quarter of 2024, with significant increases in earnings in both offshore wind and onshore wind/solar.

""This shows that our investments are paying off. In the first three months of the year, 42% of our electricity generation came from renewable sources - and we are continuing to invest massively.

""Currently, we have projects with a total capacity of 8.3GW under construction. We confirm our outlook for 2024 and our target of paying a dividend of €1.10 per share for the current fiscal year.""

Around €1bn was attributable to the acquisition of three offshore wind development projects from Vattenfall off the coast of the UK.

In addition, RWE invested more than twice as much in the construction of new wind and solar power plants in the first quarter as in the same period last year.

Proceeds from the sale of a 49% stake in the Dogger Bank South offshore wind projects in the UK to Masdar had a counteracting effect, the company reported.

RWE is currently building plants with a total capacity of 8.3GW.

These include the offshore wind projects Sofia off the UK coast with 1.4GW and Thor in Denmark with 1.1GW.

RWE is also driving forward the expansion of onshore wind and solar energy and the construction of new batteries with more than 100 projects under construction in Europe and the US.

The outlook for earnings development in the current financial year is unchanged from March 2024.

At the Capital Markets Day on 28 November 2023, RWE forecasted adjusted EBITDA within a range of €5.2bn to €5.8bn.

The company is maintaining this guidance, although RWE expects to close at the lower end of the forecast range.

The reason for this is that electricity prices have dropped significantly since November 2023.

The same is true for adjusted net income, which is expected to be between €1.9bn and €2.4bn.",renews.biz,news,Renews,,0.3803921568627451,453455613,34,https://renews.biz/media/25116/rwe.jpg?width=640,eng-9564665

European markets are heading for a higher open Wednesday as global investors look ahead to the latest U.S. inflation print.

April's consumer price index report is due out during U.S. trading hours on Wednesday and economists expect that it rose 0.4% in April on a month-over-month basis, or 3.4% from 12 months earlier.

Traders are hoping that a return to Federal Reserve rate hikes is largely off the table despite a recent slew of hotter-than-expected inflation prints. On Tuesday, April's producer price index came in higher than economists' expectations, dampening expectations that the Fed would begin cutting rates later this year.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell reiterated Tuesday that inflation is falling more slowly than expected, likely keeping interest rates elevated for an extended period.

Asia-Pacific markets were mostly higher overnight, tracking Wall Street gains on Tuesday that saw the Nasdaq Composite index hit a fresh record closing high despite the strong inflation data. U.S. stock futures were little changed overnight.

Whether retail investors profit from their bets on GameStop and AMC Entertainment or not, one group of companies is set to cash in from a spike in trading.

These four companies have previously acknowledged a boost to earnings from heightened retail investor trading.

""We are delighted to have signed a long-term gas supply agreement with our partner Equinor. For us as a global energy trader gas plays an important role in the energy transition. The newly concluded gas supply agreement adds a further important building block to our Pan-European natural gas portfolio contributing to security of supply.""

Earlier this year RWE and Equinor announced their plan to develop large-scale value chains to ensure security of supply and reduce emissions in response to the German-Norwegian Partnership on Climate, Renewable Energy and Green Industry.

The first step is to invest in and develop gas fired power plants in Germany that are ready to use hydrogen as feedstock as soon as it becomes available on an industrial scale in the country. These plants are also subject to the power plant strategy announced by the German government, which aims to create a suitable regulatory framework for new gas-fired power plants.

This year's line-up includes more than 50 speakers, including Adam Ezzamel, head of offshore development for RWE, and Sarah Williamson, Sizewell C construction programme director.

The theme, ""Energy Ecosystem"", will focus on the energy industry around the Southern North Sea - nicknamed by some the ""Sea of Opportunity"" - and the crucial role it will play in powering the UK's future.

EEEGR Chair Kevin Keable said: ""The Energy EcoSystem is about all sectors of the energy industry working together to convert and transmit energy sources to power the UK to net zero targets, while growing the supply chain and developing a skilled mobile workforce in the East of England.

""SNS2024 is an unparalleled opportunity to network, tackle pressing issues, the latest technological advancements, and forge strategic alliances.

European markets are heading for a higher open Wednesday as global investors look ahead to the latest U.S. inflation print.

April's consumer price index report is due out during U.S. trading hours on Wednesday and economists expect that it rose 0.4% in April on a month-over-month basis, or 3.4% from 12 months earlier.

Traders are hoping that a return to Federal Reserve rate hikes is largely off the table despite a recent slew of hotter-than-expected inflation prints. On Tuesday, April's producer price index came in higher than economists' expectations, dampening expectations that the Fed would begin cutting rates later this year.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell reiterated Tuesday that inflation is falling more slowly than expected, likely keeping interest rates elevated for an extended period.

Asia-Pacific markets were mostly higher overnight, tracking Wall Street gains on Tuesday that saw the Nasdaq Composite index hit a fresh record closing high despite the strong inflation data. U.S. stock futures were little changed overnight.

Whether retail investors profit from their bets on GameStop and AMC Entertainment or not, one group of companies is set to cash in from a spike in trading.

These four companies have previously acknowledged a boost to earnings from heightened retail investor trading.

The S&P 500 is soaring to record highs this year and the Dow Jones Industrial Average just had its best week of the year -- and its eighth-straight winning session last Friday.

But Goldman Sachs has still given some of its favorite stocks more than 50% potential upside, and one more than 100%.

European markets are heading for a higher open Wednesday as global investors look ahead to the latest U.S. inflation print.

April's consumer price index report is due out during U.S. trading hours on Wednesday and economists expect that it rose 0.4% in April on a month-over-month basis, or 3.4% from 12 months earlier.

Traders are hoping that a return to Federal Reserve rate hikes is largely off the table despite a recent slew of hotter-than-expected inflation prints. On Tuesday, April's producer price index came in higher than economists' expectations, dampening expectations that the Fed would begin cutting rates later this year.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell reiterated Tuesday that inflation is falling more slowly than expected, likely keeping interest rates elevated for an extended period.

Asia-Pacific markets were mostly higher overnight, tracking Wall Street gains on Tuesday that saw the Nasdaq Composite index hit a fresh record closing high despite the strong inflation data. U.S. stock futures were little changed overnight.

Whether retail investors profit from their bets on GameStop and AMC Entertainment or not, one group of companies is set to cash in from a spike in trading.

These four companies have previously acknowledged a boost to earnings from heightened retail investor trading.

The S&P 500 is soaring to record highs this year and the Dow Jones Industrial Average just had its best week of the year -- and its eighth-straight winning session last Friday.

But Goldman Sachs has still given some of its favorite stocks more than 50% potential upside, and one more than 100%.

Opening Call:

Shares are set to rise in Europe on Wednesday as investors await U.S. consumer-price data due later in the day. In Asia, stock benchmarks were mixed; Treasury yields were flat; the dollar ticked lower; while oil and gold strengthened.

Equities:

European shares are poised for a higher open on Wednesday, as traders take in one U.S. inflation report and look ahead to another that will offer a much-anticipated look at how consumer prices have been faring.

A report on wholesale prices offered mixed signals for investors trying to assess the Federal Reserve's path forward in its fight against inflation.

The producer-price index rose more than economists expected in April, but was revised lower for March. Investors could be forced to reassess their optimism after Wednesday's release of the consumer-price index. A surprisingly high reading for April would extend a streak of three reports that have come in firmer than expected.

""A hot CPI print would create volatility as expectations for interest-rate cuts are lowered,"" said Bel Air Investment Advisors.

Forex:

The dollar edged down in Asia, as the balance of risks seems a bit skewed to the downside for the U.S. currency.

Given the hawkish repricing of Fed rate-cut expectations seen in April, market participants certainly like to position for a scenario that disinflation in the U.S. will continue, Maybank said.

U.S. CPI data are due later in the day.

A weaker-than-expected U.S. inflation reading on Wednesday could drive the dollar and U.S. Treasury yields lower while supporting the euro, DHF Capital said.

Bonds:

Treasury yields were flat ahead of an expected small decline in U.S. inflation and as markets stick to expectations of an interest rate cut in September despite pushback from Fed officials and some analysts.

Treasury yields could rise considerably if U.S. services inflation data accelerates, even if headline inflation is in line with market expectations, asset management company TwentyFour said.

""The Fed needs to see housing inflation and services inflation, in general, picking up the disinflationary baton from goods for headline numbers to continue declining towards the Fed's target in a sustainable manner,"" it said.

Energy:

Oil futures rose in a likely technical recovery after settling at a nine-week low overnight.

However, gains may be capped after OPEC kept its monthly forecasts largely unchanged in its monthly report released Tuesday, analysts said.

Helping oil prices decline overnight was also a media report that some OPEC+ producers want their production capacity upgraded, NAB said.

Metals:

Gold edged higher, following earlier losses in possible position adjustment ahead of U.S. CPI data due out later.

Upside risks appear to have returned to the gold market, with precious metals traders holding plenty of ""dry-powder"" and keeping a keen eye on the CPI data, said TD Securities.

Any signs of weakening in economic data could be the catalyst that macro traders are waiting for, which gives strength to the argument that there is still plenty of upside in the cards for the precious metal, it added.

Struggles in the mining industry are pushing prices higher due to tightening availability of copper concentrate, such as Chile reporting a decline in output for March, ANZ said.

The possibility of trade disruptions, driven by the U.S. announcing higher tariffs on Chinese imports, including EVs, is also helping drive prices higher, ANZ added.

Iron prices were lower amid tepid investor sentiment and sliding coal prices.

Beijing's CNY1 trillion ultralong bond issuance and Chinese policymakers' passing mention at the recent Politburo meeting of plans to digest housing inventory have lifted macroeconomic expectations, Huarong Rongda Futures said.

However, the specific use of the ultralong long bond is still unknown and developers' debt defaults are still occurring, weighing on investor confidence, it said.

Meanwhile, expectations of growing coal supply in China's Shanxi province are dragging down coking coal prices and putting further pressure on iron ore prices, it added.

China's Central Bank Holds Key Policy Rates Steady

China's central bank held key policy rates steady on Wednesday, a move that could preface a hold on benchmark lending rates later this month.

The People's Bank of China injected 125 billion yuan ($17.28 billion) worth of liquidity via the medium-term lending facility, which charges banks an interest rate of 2.5%. The rate was unchanged from last operation.

Stock market could suffer 'ugly' day if April CPI comes in above this level

A May rally has taken the stock market back to the cusp of record territory after last month's pullback - and April inflation data due out Wednesday is widely considered a potential catalyst for either new highs or a renewed slide.

Tom Essaye, founder of Sevens Report Research, took a look Tuesday at potential ""good, bad and ugly"" outcomes for the April consumer-price index reading.

Mester Says Fed in 'Really Good Place' to Study Economy Before Charting Rate Path

CLEVELAND-A top official at the Federal Reserve said it was too soon to say that progress bringing down inflation had stalled and said it was appropriate for the Fed to hold rates steady as it awaits evidence that price pressures are easing further.

""It's too early to really conclude that we stalled out or that inflation is going to reverse,"" said Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester in an interview Tuesday. ""I kind of always suspected that we wouldn't be able to make as quick progress as we got in the second half last year.""

The Lopsided Reality of the Russia-China Relationship

When Russian President Vladimir Putin visits Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Beijing this week, the two leaders will seek to project their customary united front against the U.S.-led global order.

Beneath the surface, however, the relationship isn't one of equals.

Hamas Shift to Guerrilla Tactics Raises Specter of Forever War for Israel

Seven months into the war, Hamas is far from defeated, stoking fears in Israel that it is walking into a forever war.

The U.S.-designated terrorist group is using its network of tunnels, small cells of fighters and broad social influence to not only survive but to harry Israeli forces. Hamas is attacking more aggressively, firing more antitank weapons at soldiers sheltering in houses and at Israeli military vehicles daily, said an Israeli reservist from the 98th commando division currently fighting in Jabalia.

With America Off-Limits, China EV Makers Aim to Conquer Rest of World

BEIJING-Chinese automakers will focus on global markets outside the U.S. now that the Biden administration has declared America off-limits to made-in-China electric cars.

The 100% tariffs on Chinese EVs announced Tuesday in Washington are more of a symbolic blow than a practical one for Chinese carmakers. They have almost no business in the U.S. and already recognized that the political hurdles to entering the market were insurmountable.

Google to Roll Out AI Search Summaries to Billions by Year-End

Google will show artificial-intelligence-powered answers to billions of people using its namesake search engine by the end of the year, broadening its rollout of the technology as it tries to fend off growing competition in its core business.

The move, starting this week in the U.S., strengthens Google's embrace of generative AI, computer programs that can produce fluent text and other kinds of media.

RWE, a German-headquartered energy firm, has drawn up proposals to build the plant on the site of the current Ineos petrol refinery, in a move that could accelerate the country's shift to decarbonisation.

The company has secured a grid connection and is now shortlisting electrolyser suppliers, with an aim of making the plant operational by 2029.

With plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at the site, the initial capacity is anticipated to be up to 200MWe - potentially producing up to 3.6 tonnes of hydrogen per hour - with ambitions for further expansion to 600Mwe in the future.

The next steps of the project will be a planning application, which will include local consultation on the project.

It is hoped the project will contribute to the Scottish Government's Just Transition Fund - which was when ministers promised a £500m ten-year fund to help the north east and Moray switch away from oil and gas to renewables.

Sopna Sury, COO Hydrogen RWE Generation, said the project puts Scotland ""at the forefront of the green revolution"".

She said: ""This is a significant step towards RWE's ambitions for the production of green hydrogen in Scotland.

""As one of the world's leading energy companies, RWE has significant experience in onshore and offshore wind, developing green hydrogen production plants and operating large scale gas plants.

""This project at Grangemouth aligns with the Scottish Government's vision for a 'Just Transition', putting Scotland at the forefront of the green revolution while protecting jobs and decarbonising Grangemouth.""

Colin Pritchard, sustainability director at the INEOS Grangemouth site, said: ""We are pleased to support RWE in their investment in green hydrogen at our site in Grangemouth.

""This perfectly augments our project to develop a low-carbon (blue) hydrogen production unit at Grangemouth, with the CO2 exported deep underground in the North Sea via the Acorn transport and storage system.

The firm is working with Ineos, owner of the refinery, to develop the scheme which could be up and running by 2029, RWE said.

RWE has secured a grid connection and is shortlisting electrolyser suppliers. The firm will apply for planning permission as the next stage.

The facility will be powered by renewable energy - hence ""green"" hydrogen. It will produce hydrogen alongside an Ineos plan to produce ""blue"" hydrogen using gas.

The plans will go ahead despite the facility facing closure next year.

In November, owner Petroineos announced Scotland's last remaining oil refinery would cease operations as soon as 2025 following an 18 month process to transition to a fuel import terminal.

Petroineos - a joint venture between PetroChina and Ineos - blamed market pressures and the energy transition for the decision.

RWE said its project will be the first supply hydrogen to Ineos, ""assisting them in significantly reducing their greenhouse gas emissions"".

The plant could produce up to 3.6 tonnes of hydrogen per hour.

RWE Generation chief operating officer hydrogen Sopna Sury said: ""This is a significant step towards RWE's ambitions for the production of green hydrogen in Scotland.

""As one of the world's leading energy companies, RWE has significant experience in onshore and offshore wind, developing green hydrogen production plants and operating large scale gas plants.

""This project at Grangemouth aligns with the Scottish Government's vision for a 'just transition', putting Scotland at the forefront of the green revolution while protecting jobs and decarbonising Grangemouth.""

Ineos Grangemouth sustainability director Colin Pritchard, said the firm was supporting RWE in its investment.

The project would work alongside its plans for its gas-fired hydrogen plant, which will store carbon emissions as part of the planned Acorn CCS scheme at Peterhead.

He said: ""This perfectly augments our project to develop a low-carbon (blue) hydrogen production unit at Grangemouth, with the CO2 exported deep underground in the North Sea via the Acorn transport and storage system.

""Together these projects support delivery of our net zero roadmap and place Grangemouth at the heart of Scotland's future hydrogen economy.""

RWE has approximately 480MW of installed renewable capacity across 26 sites in Scotland. It has further plans for expansions underway, including 100MW of onshore wind in construction.

RWE is actively developing green hydrogen projects across Europe and targets 2GW of its own green hydrogen electrolyser capacity in its core markets by 2030.",energyvoice.com,news,Energy Voice,Erikka Askeland,0.04313725490196085,453394151,38,https://www.energyvoice.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/05/Grangemouth-site-from-Inveravon-Hill.JPG_52335408-2j09je2c3-scaled.jpg,eng-9566818

The government is facing fresh legal action over a key plank of its net zero strategy, after campaigners confirmed they would seek a Judicial Review of the government's approval of a new gas-fired power station with carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology planned as part of the Net Zero Teesside project.

The high profile development from oil and gas giants BP and Equinor was granted development consent earlier this year by Energy Security and Net Zero Secretary Claire Coutinho.

The project, which is now awaiting the finalisation of the regulatory and contract regime that would allow it to reach a final investment decision, is aiming to become the world's first purpose built gas-fired power station with CCS capability. It is widely regarded as a key component of the government's plans to establish a net zero industrial cluster along the east coast.

However, The Guardian reported this morning that Ecotricity founder Dale Vince and energy analyst Andrew Boswell are seeking a Judicial Review of the government's decision on the grounds it could breach the UK's climate commitments.

The application for a Judicial Review is based on analysis from Boswell, which alleges that even if the CCS project works as expected it would still result in over 20 million tonnes of carbon emissions over its lifetime.

The project is expected to capture up to 95 per cent of emissions from the power plant, but the new analysis suggests that even if this capture rate is reached significant emissions will result. These direct emissions from the power plant would be further exacerbated by emissions produced upstream from the extraction and transport of the gas used at the facility. Boswell calculated that total lifetime lifecycle emissions could reach 20.3 million tonnes.

""When a project produces over 20 million tonnes of carbon pollution, it is simply wrong, and misleading, to call it 'net zero',"" he told The Guardian.

Vince said the proposed development was ""a fake net zero project from two of the world's biggest fossil fuel companies... The project should not have been allowed to go ahead and that's why we're supporting the legal challenge against this fossil-fuelled deception"".

The legal action echoes a successful Judicial Review of the government's wider net zero strategy, which last month culminated in the High Court ordering the government to strengthen its Carbon Budget Delivery Plan.

Significantly, the court said the government should provide more information on how it intended to meet legally binding emissions targets and better account for the risk of decarbonisation projects and policies under-delivering. Critics have long argued that one of the major risks associated with CCS projects is that they could struggle to deliver promised capture rates, resulting in higher than expected emissions.

However, the government is likely to contest any legal action, pointing to analysis from the Climate Change Committee and others that suggests CCS will have a critical role to play in meeting net zero targets and decarbonising the power system. ""Power stations with these facilities will provide a stable energy supply, not dependent on the weather, with low emissions,"" they said. ""This will be vital to support a secure, largely renewables-based energy system in 2050.""

Advocates of CCS argue capture rates are improving, plans are underway to curb emissions from the upstream gas industry, and any emissions from CCS plants could be tackled through emerging negative emissions projects.

A spokesperson for Net Zero Teesside said the project would ""help the UK government to meet its net zero targets by capturing significant CO2 emissions, while maintaining energy security through the supply of dispatchable low-carbon electricity to back-up renewables"".

""National policy is clear, a key component of transitioning to a low carbon economy is the phasing-out of unabated gas generation through the deployment of gas fired electricity generation with CCS,"" they added. ""There are more than 40 CCS facilities in operation around the world.""

In further low carbon industrial news, energy giant RWE today reportedly unveiled plans to build a new green hydrogen plant on the site of the current Ineos petrol refinery in Grangemouth, Scotland.

RWE said it hopes the plant could be operational by 2029, confirming it has already secured a grid connection and is now shortlisting electrolyser suppliers.

As members of RenewableUK go to the ballot box, multiple candidates are seeking to join the group's board, coming from companies including Venterra Group, Simply Blue Group, Nordex and RWE.

Deutsche Windtechnik UK Managing Director Louise Stott, who is standing to become a board member, stated on LinkedIn: ""Meeting the target of net zero territorial emissions is a massive undertaking for the UK - it will require industry bodies to look for forward-thinking innovation and have the right people working collaboratively to set the right strategy.""

OEG Energy Group chief commercial officer David Carr stated in his nomination: ""The ever-growing scale of renewable projects necessitates a robust and adaptable supply chain capable of supporting the sector's current and future demands.

""While the UK's renewables supply chain has witnessed remarkable growth, achieving ambitious net-zero targets requires continued, collaborative efforts between industry and government to reform and strengthen supporting frameworks.""

And BlueFloat Energy/Renantis Partnership UK Managing Director Susie Lind stated: ""We're on the cusp of something truly remarkable in the UK as we push forwards to deliver our net zero targets.""

RenewableUK has an 18-person board, including the body's current chairman, SSE Director of Capital Projects Paul Cooley.

At present, it isn't clear how many people have entered the race, or how many positions are up for grabs.

Board members hold their position for three-year terms.

The last election was held in May 2023, when 25 candidates sought positions on the board.

This saw four new members of the board elected - Mainstream Renewable Power's Una Brosnan, Equinor's Halfdan Brustad, Orsted's Duncan Clark and Ian Hunter of RES.

Mr Cooley was elected to his position in September, and Ms Brosnan taking on the role of Vice Chairwoman.

In addition, Hitachi Energy's Laura Fleming; ORE Catapult's Cristina Garcia Duffy; Ocean Winds' Adam Morrison; Vestas's David Rooney; Global Energy Group's Iain Sinclair; and EDF's Tristan Zipfel also joined the board.

The board's current composition also includes RWE's Alice Barrs, Siemens Gamesa's Clark MacFarlane, National Grid's Roisin Quinn, GE Renewables' Anne-Marie Coyle, Associated British Ports' Andy Reay, The Crown Estate's Mary Thorogood, and ScottishPower Renewables' Kate Turner",energyvoice.com,news,Energy Voice,Michael Behr,0.4352941176470588,453362975,5,https://www.energyvoice.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/05/element5-digital-T9CXBZLUvic-unsplash-36qqjbi4d.jpg,

Plans have been revealed for a green hydrogen plant in Scotland's industrial heartland that could accelerate the country's shift to decarbonisation.

RWE, the renewable energy company, has drawn up a proposal to build the plant in Grangemouth, near Falkirk, on the site of the current Ineos petrol refinery.

Green hydrogen is produced using renewable energy, while blue hydrogen is typically made using gas. It burns more cleanly than gas and oil, which is why it is favoured by the Scottish government in its drive to achieve net zero.

RWE hopes that the plant will be operational by 2029. The company has secured a grid connection and is now shortlisting electrolyser suppliers.

I view the Celtic Freeport as more than just a development project, it is both a catalyst and an accelerant. Its core mission is to drive growth, particularly in economically disadvantaged areas, by leveraging innovations in renewable energy.

The Port of Milford Haven, the UK's largest energy port, and ABP at Port Talbot encapsulate a unique synergy.

Both regions share challenges, notably economic deprivation, and the looming threats to traditional industries. Our shared vision with Celtic Freeport is to transform these challenges into opportunities by creating a vibrant corridor of innovation and growth in the renewable energy sector. This corridor is not just a path towards economic regeneration but also a pathway for upskilling and job creation.

The emphasis on floating offshore wind in the Celtic Sea highlights the immense opportunities available through 2035 and beyond. To maximise these opportunities, the strategic collaboration between the two deepwater ports of Milford Haven and Port Talbot is essential.

Moreover, the region is positioned uniquely with significant green industrial opportunities due to the presence of two of the UK's largest CO2 emitters: Tata Steel and the RWE power station at Milford Haven. Both are actively seeking to leverage the Freeport's potential to accelerate their decarbonisation efforts. This is pivotal, not only in reducing environmental impact but also in setting a precedent for how traditional industries can evolve to meet modern demands.

Our ambitions also extend to the industrial-scale production of green hydrogen, a critical element in the UK's strategy to achieve net-zero emissions. The potential here is not just about energy production but encompasses building one of the UK's largest industrial clusters focused on renewable energy.

The long-term opportunities presented by the Celtic Freeport are transformative. By pivoting towards green technologies, we aim to bolster the UK's energy portfolio, drive innovation, enhance skill sets, and create a multitude of job opportunities.

This strategic focus on renewable energy is not merely a response to current trends but a forward-looking commitment to sustainable economic and environmental stewardship.",businessnewswales.com,news,Business News Wales,Celtic Freeport,0.2862745098039217,453329926,1,,

Image by Eric Middelkoop via iStock

Global storage terminal owner and operator VTTI BV is acquiring 50 percent of Dragon LNG Group Limited from infrastructure manager Ancala.

Dragon LNG is the owner of a major onshore import terminal for the supply of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to the United Kingdom (UK) market.

Dragon LNG's regasification terminal is one of the three LNG terminals in the UK. It is located near Milford Haven in Wales, and consists of LNG receiving, storage, reliquefaction, regasification and send-out facilities, VTTI said in a news release.

The facility can achieve a maximum gas send-out to the UK national transmission system of up to 317.8 billion cubic feet (9 billion cubic meters), supplying approximately 10 percent of the UK's annual gas demand, according to the release.

The transaction is subject to customary conditions and is expected to close in the third quarter, VTTI said. The financial details were not disclosed.

Dragon Energy Limited, a fully owned subsidiary of Dragon LNG Group Limited, has also developed a solar farm at the facility and is developing additional renewable power projects at the site in support of decarbonizing scope 2 emissions at the LNG terminal, VTTI noted.

''As part of VTTI's Strategy 2028, we are committed to expanding and enhancing LNG regasification infrastructure globally,"" VTTI CEO Guy Moeyens said. ""Our aim is that half of our portfolio will be in transitional and sustainable energy sources by 2028. Following the recent agreement in Italy to acquire a 70 percent equity stake in Adriatic LNG in Italy and the ongoing development of a new LNG import facility in Vlissingen in the Netherlands, this acquisition reflects our commitment to diversify into LNG as a transitional energy source"".

""We are looking forward to partner with Shell to ensure that Dragon LNG continues to operate in a safe and reliable manner while accelerating its decarbonization and growth path,"" Moeyens added. Shell plc owns 50 percent of Dragon LNG.

VTTI said it has a long-term strategic view on the terminal, ""furthering the opportunities for decarbonization of the regasification process and continuing to provide safe and secure, long-term access to the UK gas market"".

Earlier in the month, Dragon LNG said it awarded a contract to professional services firm Worley to conduct a comprehensive feasibility study to explore the integration of LNG and carbon dioxide (CO2) liquefaction processes.

The study is focused on exploring the potential benefits of integrating LNG regasification and CO2 liquefaction processes at Dragon LNG terminal facilities, the company said in an earlier statement, adding that the benefits not only impact the Dragon site but also other industry companies in Haven, Pembrokeshire.

If feasible, the technology at Dragon would support wider collaboration with RWE Pembroke Net Zero Centre (PNZC), whose CO2 would be transported to the Dragon facility for processing before being shipped via non-pipeline transport (NPT) to carbon sequestration sites.

Rotterdam-based VTTI describes itself as a global leader in independent energy storage, developing the critical energy infrastructure needed to move towards a carbon neutral future. The company safely provides and expands access to essential energy, including fuels, chemicals, gases, and other energy-derived products and accelerates the transition to sustainable sources for customers and partners.",rigzone.com,news,Rigzone,,0.1372549019607843,453301756,1,https://images.rigzone.com/images/news/articles/VTTI-to-Acquire-50-Percent-Stake-in-Dragon-LNG-176720-582x327.webp,eng-9562354

IGOS is a global, prospective, observational, multicenter cohort study that has enrolled 2,000 patients who were followed for one to three years.

ANX007 in GA: First-in-class, non-pegylated antigen-binding fragment (Fab) designed to block C1q and activation of the classical complement cascade locally in the eye with an intravitreal formulation.

Presented new neuroprotective analyses supporting the effect of ANX007 in GA at the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) 2024 Annual Meeting Key Additional Phase 2 Analyses from ARCHER Study Show ANX007 Treatment: Provided broad-based protection against vision loss, including dose dependent and time-dependent protection in BCVA ≥15-letter loss including patients with foveal-center and non-foveal-center involved GA.First known demonstration for statistically significant protection of Low Light Visual Acuity (LLVA), a sensitive assessment of photoreceptor function in low light conditions.Statistically significant reduction of photoreceptor loss as measured by assessment of the Ellipsoid Zone (EZ) layer via Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), a key anatomical measure of the cells responsible for light detection and visual acuity.Meaningful slowing of lesion growth measured by retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) loss near the fovea, the region of the retina most important for visual acuity. New preclinical data demonstrating that C1q blockade protected photoreceptor synapses, cells and retinal function in a model of photoreceptor damage, supporting a neuroprotective mechanism for ANX007 in preserving photoreceptor structures and visual function in GA.

ANX1502 for Autoimmune Conditions: First-in-class oral small molecule inhibitor of the classical complement pathway designed to target chronic autoimmune diseases.

Ongoing bridging trial evaluating comparability of tablet and liquid suspension formulations.ANX1502 has the potential to offer the advantages of selective upstream classical complement inhibition with the convenience and dosing flexibility of oral administration.Upon completion of proof-of-concept (POC) trial in Cold Agglutinin Disease (CAD) in the second half of 2024, anticipate advancing ANX1502 into multiple mid-to-late-stage clinical trials in antibody-mediated autoimmune diseases.

Key 2024 Anticipated Milestones for Flagship Programs

ANX005 in GBS: Topline data from the pivotal, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial expected in the second quarter of 2024. Initial data from RWE comparability protocol with IGOS expected in first half 2025 to support a planned BLA submission.

ANX007 in GA: Global pivotal Phase 3 ARCHER II trial vs. sham control expected to initiate in mid-2024. Pivotal Phase 3 head-to-head ARROW trial vs. SYFOVRE® (pegcetacoplan injection) planned to initiate in the second half of 2024. Expect to host an R&D Day on GA and therapeutic potential of ANX007 in mid-2024.

Consolidated Edison Inc (NYSE:ED) recently announced a dividend of $0.83 per share, payable on 2024-06-14, with the ex-dividend date set for 2024-05-14. As investors look forward to this upcoming payment, the spotlight also shines on the company's dividend history, yield, and growth rates. Using the data from GuruFocus, let's look into Consolidated Edison Inc's dividend performance and assess its sustainability.

What Does Consolidated Edison Inc Do?

Consolidated Edison Inc is a holding company for Consolidated Edison of New York, or CECONY, and Orange & Rockland, or O&R. These utilities provide steam, natural gas, and electricity to customers in southeastern New Yorkincluding New York Cityand small parts of New Jersey. The two utilities generate nearly all of Consolidated Edison's earnings following the sale of its clean energy business to RWE in early 2023.

While the city council will be mulling over a property tax increase to fight off a budget hole, with a solid waste fee increase to accompany it, Shelby County has no tax increases in the works.

The city began budget hearings last week, which included lengthy discussions about the solid waste increase.

The week also involved major news into the investigation into Shelby County Clerk Wanda Halbert. Hamilton County District Attorney Coty Wamp filed an ouster petition on May 6, which brings the investigation to a close but starts the ouster process.

The initial judge for the case, Judge Cedrick Wooten, recused himself from the case. Division 1 Judge Felicia Corbin-Johnson has been assigned the case.

The commission had its final approval of the body's changes to the Unified Development Code to put restrictions on utility-scale solar farms in the county. While the commissioners approved their version of the UDC, the city council still has to adopt the same ordinance with the same amendments for it to be sustained.

Harsher restrictions were placed on the development code ordinance by commissioners. The changes were recommended by a group of concerned residents from Millington who have been fighting against the Graceland Solar Project, a proposed solar farm development near their homes, for months.

The Commercial Appeal recently reported that despite the commission voting down the solar farm development, the project will go ahead after the County settled with Graceland Solar and parent company RWE Clean Energy.

The ordinance was amended initially by commissioners to heavily restrict solar farms within the county. Those amendments included 600 minimum setbacks from residential dwellings, distance from other utility-scale solar systems must be 1 mile from a straight-line distance and utility-scale solar systems must be restricted to less than 1 square mile.

During a May 1 committee meeting, commissioners withdrew the amendment that required solar farms to be more than 1 mile from existing systems. Commissioner Amber Mills said during the meeting that this would allow the ordinance to move through the city council ""easier.""

After the commission passed the joint ordinance Monday, the city council passed the ordinance 11-0, but residents from Millington expressed upset over not being able to speak during the meeting. Per city rules, only city residents can speak during public comment.

Commissioner Britney Thornton presented a budget amendment that would allocate $2.7 million to various projects within her district. The administration asked that the resolution be withdrawn as it did not have a funding source.

The commission did not withdraw the resolution, but after robust discussion regarding the item not having a funding source it was postponed to the next committee meeting on May 15.

Two resolutions regarding budget amendments for the Shelby County Clerk to give employees raises and purchase ""essential equipment"" were withdrawn. Hours before the items were withdrawn, The Commercial Appeal reported that the Hamilton County District Attorney filed an ouster petition for Clerk Wanda Halbert.

Shelby County Commissioner Erika Sugarmon withdrew both resolutions during the meeting.

The Division of Solid Waste is requesting a solid waste fee hike to bring in more employees, bring employee pay up to market rate and fleet increases. The initial 23% increase from $29.96 to $36.85 would be the first of three over the next three fiscal years.

If passed by the Memphis City Council, it would go into effect on Jan. 1.

The wage increase for solid waste employees would not ""double dip"" with the Mayor's proposed 3% raise for all city employees in the budget, according to Phillip Davis.

The increase requires an ordinance to pass over the course of three readings. The first reading was during the meeting on May 7 and passed.

PosHYdon aims to produce green hydrogen on an operational gas platform in the Dutch North Sea. It will be the first time that three offshore energy systems will be integrated and hydrogen is transported to land together with gas via an existing pipeline.

The pilot is essential for the development of large-scale production of green hydrogen at sea and, thus, for the energy transition in the Netherlands and Northwest Europe. After this testing period onshore, the electrolyser will be transferred offshore to the Q13a-A platform, 13 kilometres off the coast of Scheveningen (The Hague). First offshore hydrogen production is planned for Q4 this year.

René Peters, business director Gas Technologies TNO and initiator of the North Sea Energy Programme says: 'PosHYdon is a perfect example of system integration in the North Sea. In many studies, hydrogen is considered the missing link in the energy transition, with many talking about all the opportunities. But here, right off the coast of Scheveningen, it will actually take place later this year. PosHYdon is teaching us a lot about the next steps that need to be taken towards safe, large-scale green hydrogen production from wind at sea.'

'Offshore green hydrogen production will enable large-scale wind farms to be developed far out at sea. Wind energy is directly converted to green hydrogen from demineralised seawater and can be transported through the existing or new gas infrastructure,' adds Peters. 'As a result, offshore wind projects can be realised faster at significantly lower costs for society. I am therefore very happy that we can now test the complete installation onshore, in preparation for transferring it offshore for the final test: offshore green hydrogen production.'

In addition, PosHYdon will also participate in a pilot for Guarantees of Origin for green hydrogen and the upcoming migration towards European hydrogen certification. This pilot, also open to others, is being planned via HyXchange. Neptune Energy (Eni) participated before in the HyXchange certification pilot in 2022.

In the PosHYdon project, a significant number of lessons are being learned about the offshore production of green hydrogen. This makes the project essential for a smooth roll-out towards large-scale production, as envisaged with the Esbjerg ambitions for 2050.

PosHYdon seeks to validate the integration of three energy systems in the Dutch North Sea: offshore wind, offshore gas and offshore hydrogen and will involve the installation of hydrogen-producing plant on the Neptune Energy (Eni)-operated Q13a-A platform. This platform was the first fully green electrified platform in the Dutch North Sea.

The green hydrogen will be blended with the gas and transported to the coast via the existing gas pipeline. To this end, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy has increased the blending specifications from 0.02 per cent to 0.5 per cent hydrogen. The 1 MW electrolyser will follow the wind profile of the Luchterduinen wind farm.

Terrestrial Energy, a developer of Generation IV advanced nuclear power plants that use its proprietary Integral Molten Salt Reactor (IMSR) technology for industrial heat and power supply, and Schneider Electric, a Fortune Global 500 supplier of digital control systems for energy management, have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to jointly develop commercial opportunities and advance the deployment of IMSR plants.

The joint press statement did not indicate a timeline for construction of multiple units of the advanced reactor which uses molten salt to produce a 700C outlet temperature for applications of electricity generation and process heat industrial applications.

The announcement, in terms of timing, comes on the heels of an announcement by OKLO of having signed a letter of intent with a major developer of data centers to provide up to 500 MW of electrical power to data centers. Oklo noted its 15 MW basic design is capable of being scaled to 50 MW. The deal includes a $25 million upfront payment to Oklo for future implementation of the power purchase agreement.

In terms of the Terrestrial Energy deal, the scope is more wide ranging with multiple levels of engagement with Schneider Electric. Gary Lawrence, President of Power & Grid Systems at Schneider Electric, said, ""Schneider Electric's value proposition is to leverage Digital Twin technology across the full IMSR project lifecycle and during operations - resulting in a reduction of project time to market and cost as well as more efficient operations.""

Terrestrial Energy's IMSR plant heat and power supply has many industrial uses that require reliable, baseload zero-carbon energy supply at near-site locations, such as dedicated power for large data centers and cogeneration for heavy industrial facilities. Schneider Electric systems automate and optimize energy management for improved performance, efficiency, and contribute to the commercial and sustainability goals of its customers.

The firm emphasizes the collaboration offers solutions to the major energy challenges faced by data center operators and many heavy industries operating a wide range of industrial processes such as hydrogen, ammonia, aluminum, and steel production.

In April 2023, the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC), following a systematic and multi-year review against nuclear regulatory requirements, concluded that there were no fundamental barriers to licensing the IMSR plant for commercial use. This was the first-ever regulatory review of a commercial nuclear plant using molten salt reactor technology and the first advanced, high-temperature fission technology to complete a review of this type.

Ontario Power Generation (OPG) expects nuclear construction work on its first small modular reactor (SMR) to begin in 2025, according to filings submitted to Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC).

The Ontario, Canada, utility is planning to build a total of four SMRs at the Darlington nuclear site and would use GE Hitachi's BWRX-300 reactor technology. The four units once deployed would produce a total 1,200 MW of electricity.

OPG has said it expects construction on the first reactor to be complete by 2028, with the additional SMRs coming online between 2034 and 2036. The utility aims to take learnings from the construction of the first unit to deliver cost savings on the subsequent units.

In April 2024, the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) announced that the existing environmental assessment (EA) for the Darlington New Nuclear Project (DNNP) is applicable to the BWRX-300 reactor.

""The CNSC's decision confirms OPG's stance related to the EA and is a critical next step in OPG's application for a [license] to construct the first of the four SMRs at the DNNP site,"" said Ken Hartwick, OPG President and CEO.

""Our fleet approach to both early work and the project as a whole means we can leverage common infrastructure, such as shared roads, utilities, and water intake, which will help to drive down regulatory, construction, and operating costs,"" added Hartwick.

Aaol Atomics, an Austin, TX, based micro reactor startup seeking to commercialize the INL Marvel SMR R&D reactor, announced is has signed a Siting Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) from the Department of Energy (DOE). This marks the first step towards deploying the first Aalo-1 reactor at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) site in Idaho.

The Aalo-1 reactor, a 10 MWe sodium-cooled, UZrH-fueled reactor, represents a significant leap forward in sodium-cooled advanced nuclear technology in the US. Leveraging low-enriched uranium (LEU) at just under 10% U235 enrichment.

Aalo intends to leverage this Siting MOU towards locating the first Aalo-1 reactor at the Central Facilities Area (CFA) site within INL, a location chosen to collocate with newly constructed megawatt-scale electrolyzers, and INL's upcoming hydrogen motorcoach fleet. Aalo-1 can provide electricity and heat behind the meter to these electrolyzers and demonstrate seamless hydrogen production. Aalo has recently signed an Umbrella Strategic Partnership Project (SPP) to leverage INL's expertise to support the exploration of this deployment.

The next step for Aalo is to enter into a real property agreement with DOE, selecting a specific parcel of land to site the Aalo-1 reactor. This step will involve extensive collaboration with INL and local stakeholders to ensure the chosen site meets all technical and environmental requirements.

The firm also announced plans to construct a full-scale, non-nuclear prototype of the Aalo-1 reactor. This endeavor follows the recent successful completion of the Aalo-1 conceptual design. The prototype will serve as an important step in testing and refining our technology, ensuring that Aalo-1 meets its technical, regulatory, and economic targets.

The team is now engaged in the preliminary design. This phase is critical for verifying the reactor design. In parallel, the firm kicked off preparation of regulatory submittals.

Idaho Strategic Resources, Inc. (NYSE:IDR) announced it has entered into a non-binding memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Radiant Industries, Inc. to participate in the Kaleidos Frontier Pilot Program designed to aid Radiant in the development and planned deployment of their meltdown-proof portable microreactor, Kaleidos.

The agreement establishes a pathway for Idaho Strategic and Radiant to operate one or more of the first five Frontier Kaleidos units at a viable Idaho Strategic mining site. The mining company is involved in extraction of gold, rare earths, and thorium at multiple sites along the Idaho /Montana border.

As part of the agreement, the two companies agree to jointly study the licensing process and timeline, and other business and operations factors relevant to the deployment of a Kaleidos unit.

Radiant's Kaleidos unit is designed to replace diesel generators with base-load power in remote and hard-to-reach locations. Cooled by Helium, which cannot become radioactive, Kaleidos can output 1 MWe electric and 1.9 MWt of heat, and operate with TRISO fuel for an average of five years before refueling . The firm notes it is ""mass-producible, transportable by air, sea, road or rail and roughly the size of a shipping container.""

As part of the competitive US Department of Energy (DOE) FEEED program, Radiant is building towards a test at Idaho National Laboratory (INL) in 2026, with their first commercial reactors available as soon as 2028.

Radiant will get the support of the National Reactor Innovation Center (NRIC) at INL to test a fueled prototype of the Kaleidos microreactor.

Licensing Radiant Industries engaged the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) on the Kaleidos SMR through a public meeting on 02/17/23. Radiant Industries has also engaged the NRC on their business and licensing plans. The firm submitted its Regulatory Engagement Plan to the agency in November 2023. The firm has set a target date of delivery of its first unit to a customer by 2028.

Financing Radiant has secured public and private sector financing in support of the Kaleidos microreactor. This includes more than $50 million in private financing and two awards through the US Small Business Innovation Research program totaling approximately $250,000 to support modelling and simulation capabilities.

Through the NRIC FEEED process, Radiant was awarded up to $1.5 million to progress towards deployment of the Kaleidos at the DOME facility located at the INL's Materials Fuels Complex (old Argonne West) site about 25 miles west of Idaho Falls, ID.

Fuel In 2022, Radiant Industries launched a Request for Proposals for fuel fabricators to produce TRISO fuel, and in 2023 the company entered an agreement with Centrus Energy to work towards identifying a path to provide a future supply of HALEU for up to 20 Kaleidos microreactors.

Licensing The firm has not announced timelines for licensing the reactors or nuclear fuels programs nor target dates for delivery of products / services to customers.

A search of the NRC ADAMS library did not turn up any citations indicating formal regulatory engagement with the NRC, by the firm, using the term ""NANO Nuclear Energy"" in the search box. Typically, at a minimum, a firm seeking a license will file a regulatory engagement plan with the NRC spelling out how it plans to proceed.

A Regulatory Engagement Plan (REP) establishes ""Rules of Engagement"" between the applicant and NRC. The primary goal of the REP is to reduce regulatory uncertainty by establishing such agreements as early in the regulatory process as possible.

(WNN) The UK government is awarding GBP196 million (USD245 million) to Urenco to build a uranium enrichment facility with the capacity to produce up to 10 tonnes of high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) per year by 2031. The funding decision is part of the UK government's efforts to cut out dependance on Russia for nuclear fuel for its reactors.

UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said that building the uranium enrichment plant was essential for guaranteeing the country's nuclear and energy security. The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero says the new facility ""will put an end to Russia's reign as the only commercial producer"" of HALEU fuel in Europe.

The GBP195 million funding is part of the GBP300 million HALEU program announced in January 2024, with the energy department saying that the remaining funding would be allocated later this year to other parts of the program including to support deconversion capability (converting the enriched uranium into a form to be made into fuel).

Urenco is one third owned by the UK government, one third by the Dutch government and one third by two German utilities, E.ON S.E. and RWE AG.

Other HALEU Production Efforts

In September, Orano revealed plans to extend enrichment capacity at its Georges Besse II (GB-II) uranium enrichment plant in France, and said it had begun the regulatory process to produce HALEU there.

The US is also developing a domestic supply of HALEU. In November 2023, Centrus Energy delivered the first HALEU produced at its American Centrifuge Plant in Piketon, Ohio, to the US Department of Energy (DOE).

Construction of the 16-centrifuge demonstration cascade plant began in 2019, under contract with the DOE. The delivery by Centrus of more than 20 kilograms of HALEU to the DOE means that phase one of the contract has now been completed and Centrus can move ahead with the second phase: a full year of HALEU production at the 900 kilograms per year plant.",energycentral.com,news,Energy Central,,0.4274509803921569,453218212,1,,

The turnover continued to grow to 2.9 billion euro, a record in the history of the Group.

This led to an increase in EBITDA with 39% to 610 million euro or 21% on turnover, globally resulting in a strong profit of 296 million euro. These growth figures were achieved in a balanced manner through various innovative projects and reflect the operational efficiency of our teams across all divisions. This despite the current economic and geopolitical turmoil in several parts of the world.

2023 was also the year in which our next-gen offshore installation vessels, Les Alizés and Voltaire, were deployed on their first projects and where Jan De Nul Group ordered an innovative, XL cable-laying vessel, the Fleeming Jenkin.

Looking forward, Jan De Nul Group started the year 2024 with an unprecedentedly high order book of 8.9 billion euro, an increase of 38% compared to last year. These projects are again well spread across all divisions of the Group.

With this impressive orderbook, our characteristic innovative boldness supported by excellent financial structure, and our 'impossible is not possible' mentality, we started 2024 with full confidence.

ACTIVITIES IN 2023

77% of Jan De Nul Group's turnover was achieved by its maritime divisions.

Coastal and shore protection, port infrastructure works, maintaining, deepening or widening waterways as well as land reclamation, are key solutions offered by the dredging division of Jan De Nul Group. In 2023, a multitude of projects was carried out around the world.

Coastal and shore protection works were carried out in Knokke, Belgium, in the form of beach replenishments. In Bangladesh, Jan De Nul Group continued the capital and maintenance dredging works for the access channels to the new Payra Port. Jan De Nul Group was also active in the Middle East, amongst others, for the deepening of the access channels to the port of Jebel Dhanna. In Latin America, Jan De Nul Group is operating and maintaining the access channel to the port terminals of Guayaquil in Ecuador, this under a 25-year concession contract. Port infrastructure works were carried out in the Port of Gdynia, in Poland.

The offshore division deployed its newly delivered next-gen offshore vessels on their first projects. Jack-up installation vessel Voltaire is transporting and installing 277 turbines for the Dogger Bank A, B and C offshore wind farms, while heavy lift vessel Les Alizés is performing the transport and installation of 107 foundations and 1 offshore substation in Germany for the Gode Wind 3 and Borkum Riffgrund 3 offshore wind farms.

An example of our cable installation expertise is shown in the UK. During the summer, a 33 kV-interconnector cable was installed in the Pentland Firth seaway, between the Orkney-island of Hoy and the Scottish mainland. Where necessary, the cable was buried by our trencher Swordfish or protected by rock bags installed by multipurpose vessel Adhémar de Saint-Venant.

Buildings, foundations, transport related infrastructures, water related infrastructures, these are but some of the wide variety of solutions offered by the construction division. Jan De Nul Group focuses on complex design and engineering projects, executed for private and public clients while participating in Public Private Partnerships (PPP). The construction projects remain a constant and solid part of Jan De Nul Group.

In 2023, the construction started on the infrastructure to house and maintain the new F-35 fighter jets. Two identical air force bases are being built, one in Florennes and one in Kleine-Brogel.

Jan De Nul Group was also active on infrastructure works along the highway E40 between Ghent and Brussels. Together with its partner, Jan De Nul Group is replacing two bridges: one of the E40 over the railroad and another over the E40. Furthermore, the Group is participating in the construction of the Oosterweel link, through the construction of the Scheldt tunnel (COTU), which is the connecting element in the link that closes the Antwerp Ring Road, and the Right Bank link (ROCO), which forms the link between the Scheldt tunnel and the R1 both in Northern and Eastern directions.

The environmental division, Envisan, is an important player on the Belgian market. This division has comprehensive experience in handling polluted sites both by remediation in situ or excavation and transportation of the polluted material to one of the Group's six valorisation centres in Belgium and France. Major projects in 2023 include the construction of PFAS water treatment plants and soil remediation for the Oosterweel link and environmental dredging and remediation works in the Walloon region.

PSR, the brownfield development specialist remains focused on the reconversion of polluted sites. In 2023, PSR continued its endeavours with the development of several projects in Belgium amongst others the Albertplein in Knokke, Rives Ardentes in Liege and Malt in Mechelen.

GEOGRAPHICAL PRESENCE

This year Jan De Nul Group undertook 371 projects around the globe. Europe, where all divisions of Jan De Nul Group are traditionally active, represents a strong 44% share of the Group's turnover. Asia and the Middle East was good for 33% of the Group's turnover. A 21% share in turnover was attained by the Americas, while Africa contributed 2%.

HIGH SOLVENCY AND NET CASH POSITION

Traditionally, Jan De Nul Group demonstrates a strong solvency ratio. Also this year the solvency ratio amounted to almost 60%. The Group's equity climbed now to almost 3.4 billion euro, showing a year-to-year increase of 9.6%.

Additionally, the Group's liquidity position remained strong, even after the continuous innovations and investment in new assets. This is demonstrated by a net cash position of 520 million euro. Jan De Nul Group has now been net debt-free for the last ten years. This rock-solid financial structure is a major competitive asset of Jan De Nul Group.

CONTINUOUS INVESTMENT PROGRAMME IN AN IMPRESSIVE AND UNIQUE FLEET

Jan De Nul Group shapes water and land. Therefore, based on the vision to create unique solutions worldwide, connect communities and improve infrastructure, the company continues to invest in the specialized and innovative fleet of tomorrow.

""We have a lot to work on,"" she said. ""Time is not on our side, so we have to move.""

Several Midwestern states already generate a majority of their electricity from renewable and zero-emissions sources, but local opposition is a significant obstacle to further progress that developers need to work with communities and state policymakers to overcome, panelists said.

Renewables accounted for 84% of the generation mix in South Dakota and wind alone accounted for 62% of Iowa generation in 2022, while Illinois provided 13% of the United States' total nuclear output, according to the Energy Information Administration.

Zero-carbon sources comprised 54% of Minnesota's generation mix in 2024, according to Clean Energy Economy Minnesota.

Illinois (2050), Minnesota (2040) and Michigan (2040) also have legislative mandates for carbon-free electricity production. Illinois passed its zero-emissions law in 2021. Minnesota and Michigan followed in 2023.

These commitments are the latest milestones in a transition that began decades ago, Soholt said. In Minnesota, Xcel Energy's predecessor first agreed to generate some power from wind and biomass in 1994, followed by a 2007 legislative mandate for 25% renewable electricity by 2025, she noted. But despite clear progress, Soholt characterized the state's efforts to date as ""groundwork.""

""Targets are great, but how do you get steel in the ground,"" said Will Eberle, vice president for government relations and regulatory affairs at RWE Clean Energy.

Midwestern policymakers and regulators are generally good about ""finding the problem and getting the job done"" when it comes to renewables development, but local opposition to utility-scale renewables is a growing challenge across the region and beyond, Eberle said. As the ""deep but narrow"" local impacts of large-scale fossil generation give way to broader, shallower impacts from renewables in rural areas, ""we need to be honest and take [communities'] concerns seriously,"" he said.

""Well-meaning"" state policies can exacerbate those concerns, Kunkle said, pointing to a Michigan policy requiring pollinator-friendly plantings around certain solar projects on agricultural land. That requirement becomes more costly and complex as projects scale, he added.

""There's a big difference between a 1-MW project and a 200-MW project,"" he said.

States' efforts to promote agrivoltaics, or colocating solar arrays with agricultural uses like sheep grazing, likewise need to balance conservation with the needs of potentially skeptical local farmers, Eberle said.

Beyond agrivoltaics, developers should also recognize that land lease agreements are voluntary and land set aside for renewables may one day be used for agriculture again, Soholt said. Citing farmers' frequent complaints about damage to subsurface drain tile, she said developers ""need to make sure that the land will be in the same or better condition after construction"" to avoid ""a black eye out of the gate.""

Honest, transparent negotiations often allay these concerns, said State Sen. Waylon Brown, R-Iowa, who owns farmland and a construction company in northern Iowa. Those negotiations may hinge on seemingly trivial items, like developers' willingness to remove loose rocks from disturbed earth, but they're key to building trust and helping projects advance.

""When [farmers] are able to sit down with developers...that's when you get good results,"" he said.

Agriculture is a uniting force in a politically heterogeneous region, as are other shared economic interests, Minnesota Commerce Department Commissioner Grace Arnold said. Democratic-controlled Minnesota and Republican-controlled North Dakota collaborate on cross-border economic development initiatives despite coal-rich North Dakota's threat to sue over Minnesota's 100% clean energy standard, she noted.

""We as a collective here in the Midwest have a lot of power"" to shape renewable energy deployment ""because we can talk about how it impacts agriculture and Fortune 500 companies, which we have a lot of,"" Arnold said",utilitydive.com,news,Utility Dive,,0.223529411764706,453052550,1,https://www.utilitydive.com/imgproxy/YX4pU5Jb3fCBO9_eEH3cJmMqcWth3najmQur7AIbL6c/g:ce/rs:fill:770:435:0/bG9jYWw6Ly8vZGl2ZWltYWdlL0dldHR5SW1hZ2VzLTE4NjkyMDYzNF9ZaXhPeHVILmpwZw.webp,

Due to the EU law challenges posed by the Achmea, Komstroy and Romatsa judgments by the European Court of Justice (ECJ), investors are increasingly resorting to extra-EU jurisdictions (especially the US) to enforce their intra-EU investment treaty awards.

In the context of Spain's efforts to resist enforcement of intra-EU Energy Charter Treaty (ECT) awards, the latest ruling by the LG Essen stands out as a critical juncture. This decision is part of a broader trend observed also in other EU jurisdictions of refusing to interfere with enforcement actions brought beyond EU borders, most recently in the Netherlands.

The background: clash between the German and US judiciaries

The procedural history leading to the LG Essen decision is notable for its intricate back and forth between German and US courts.

Spain's anti-enforcement application of December 2022 was prompted by RWE's enforcement action of its €28 million ECT award against Spain (ECT award) before the US District Court of Columbia in December 2021. Spain sought an order from the LG Essen (where RWE has its headquarters) to restrain RWE from pursuing enforcement outside the EU (ie an anti-suit or anti-enforcement injunction).

RWE then turned to US Courts in March 2023, where it applied for an (anti-)anti-suit injunction ordering Spain to stay the anti-enforcement proceedings before the LG Essen.

At that point, Spain responded by filing for an (anti-)anti-anti suit injunction before the LG Essen against the anti-suit application brought by RWE in the US. While the LG Essen rejected Spain's application, it was then upheld in May 2023 on appeal by the Higher Regional Court of Hamm (OLG Hamm), which issued - for the first time ever in Germany - an (anti-)anti-anti-suit injunction in the context of investment arbitration. The OLG Hamm's underlying reasoning was rooted in the preservation of Germany's judicial sovereignty and the applicant's right to justice (here Spain). In other words, the German court held that a foreign court cannot impede or obstruct legal proceedings in Germany.

The decision: German courts should obstruct enforcement actions in the US

On 12 April 2024, the LG Essen dismissed Spain's anti-enforcement application as being inadmissible. The German court confirmed the long-standing position under German law, that anti-suit injunctions violate the principles of territoriality and state sovereignty, regardless of whether the action was directed against the party (like in the case at hand) or against a foreign state court. The German court noted that it would be contradictory if German courts were to reject anti-suit injunctions from abroad, but then issued anti-suit injunctions themselves.

Most importantly, the LG Essen held that the ECJ case law on intra-EU investment arbitration (eg Achmea and Komstroy) does not establish an obligation for German courts to prevent the enforcement of ICSID awards outside of the EU. EU courts must only prevent enforcement within EU borders.

Spain's argument that enforcing the ECT award would constitute a violation of EU law on State aid also failed. The German court noted that Spain had not yet sought authorisation from the EU Commission (which has the authority to assess and approve State aid measures proposed by EU Member States) to pay the ECT award. In other words, it was apparent to the LG Essen that Spain lacked any genuine intention to pay the ECT award.

Spain engaged in a similar multijurisdictional fight before Dutch courts, trying to prevent the enforcement of the ECT award in AES v Spain in the US. In two similarly reasoned decisions from March 2023, the District Court of Amsterdam dismissed Spain's petition. It found that by seeking an anti-suit (or anti-enforcement) injunction before Dutch courts, Spain was attempting to create an additional forum to challenge the ECT award, which it found prima facie to be impermissible under the New York Convention.

Outlook

The LG Essen decision marks a setback for Spain's efforts to obstruct enforcement of intra-EU ECT awards. The Essen and Amsterdam decisions constitute strong precedent that EU courts will not assist EU Member States unwilling to comply with investment treaty awards. Both courts held in clear terms that the CJEU case law in Achmea and Komstroy does not provide a legal basis to grant anti-suit injunctions. Rather, they found that the public international law principle of territorial sovereignty as well as the New York Convention, militate against anti-enforcement orders.

It is likely that Spain will appeal the LG Essen decision before the OLG Hamm. While it is true that the OLG Hamm had issued an anti-anti-suit-injunction in favour of Spain in the same case, it had done so solely to preserve judicial sovereignty of German courts. Due to comity considerations, it seems unlikely that the LG Essen decision will be reversed on appeal.

In the second (or even third) instance, German courts may however opt to refer the matter to the ECJ for a preliminary ruling on whether EU law - in order to uphold the principle of primacy of EU law - requires EU domestic courts to grant anti-enforcement injunctions in these circumstances. A similar approach was in fact adopted by the German Federal Court of Justice (FCJ) in its landmark decisions in Mainstream v Germany, Uniper v Netherlands and RWE v Netherlands. There, the FCJ essentially stretched procedural tools available to ensure primacy of EU law and declare those intra-EU investment arbitrations inadmissible, even though the ""closed"" ICSID system does not allow for state court review.

It remains to be seen whether the OLG Hamm, the FCJ or the ECJ (if requested to opine on the matter) will adopt a similar stance in this case.

At the moment, such scenario seems unlikely. As pointed out by the LG Essen, the principle of primacy of EU law merely requires EU Member States to ensure the application and observance of EU law in their respective territory. Thus, it does not provide a basis for resisting enforcement of investment treaty awards beyond EU borders.",lexology.com,news,Lexology,,0.2549019607843137,453052081,26,https://www.lexology.com/images/share/lexology-social-media.png,

Orcadian's license, which covers blocks 49/25b, 50/21a, 49/30a and 50/26, contains the Earlham discovery drilled by Talisman Energy in 1995. The well encountered gas in the Rotliegendes.

The following year bp drilled a long horizontal appraisal well that tested more than 30 MMscf/d of gas. However, the test was halted when it became apparent that the gas contained 49% CO and 9% N.

Orcadian estimates that the Earlham reservoir contains 114 Bcf of sales gas (methane) on a P50 basis. It has proposed a development with an offshore power station, connected to the grid via a wind farm substation, with integrated CO capture and storage.

This, the company claims, could deliver a stable and reliable supply of electricity with near-zero emissions. Orcadian aims to present its plans to RWE, which recently acquired the rights to develop the nearby Norfolk Boreas offshore wind farm from Vattenfall.

Abu Dhabi renewable energy firm Masdar and Iberdrola have installed the first wind turbine at the 476-megawatt (MW) Baltic Eagle offshore wind farm in Germany.

The Baltic Eagle wind farm, which is on track to start operations by the end of the year, will consist of 50 wind turbines built on monopile foundations, each with a unit capacity of 9.53 MW.

The wind farm will have an anticipated annual production capacity of 1.9 terawatt-hours (TWh), enough to meet the clean energy demands of 475,000 homes.

""With the installation of its first wind turbine, Baltic Eagle is taking shape off the German Baltic coast. This marks the start of the final phase in the construction of the offshore wind farm, which is expected to become fully operational later this year,"" said Felipe Montero, the CEO of Iberdrola Deutschland.

Iberdrola will retain a majority 51 per cent stake in the asset, which will help to accelerate green energy security in Europe.

The global clean energy firm will control and manage the asset, providing operation and maintenance services and other corporate services.

Masdar accelerates global energy transition

Meanwhile, Masdar aims to build a renewable energy portfolio with a capacity of 100GW by the end of the decade.

The UAE clean energy firm closed the acquisition of a 49 per cent stake in RWE's $13.9bn (GBP11bn) UK Dogger Bank South offshore wind farm in March - one of the world's largest offshore wind farms.

The 3 gigawatts (GW) wind farm is expected to generate enough electricity to power three million homes and create 2,000 jobs during construction and an additional 1,000 during the operational phase.

Masdar previously partnered with RWE on the 630MW London Array wind farm.

Last December, Masdar and Iberdrola agreed to co-invest $16.2bn (EUR15bn) in offshore wind and green hydrogen projects in key markets including Germany, the UK and the USA.

The renewable energy company also invested in the 30MW Hywind project - the world's first floating offshore wind farm - and the 402MW Dudgeon offshore wind farm.

RWE and the Swedish Port of Karlshamn have signed a Memorandum of Understanding to explore whether the latter could be a suitable harbour for the logistics, installation, operations and maintenance activities relating to the developer's planned offshore wind projects in the Baltic Sea.

In a first step, the partners will map the requirements and necessary build outs and investments to facilitate the scaling-up of the port's capacity.

An early implementation of harbour capacity will ensure Sweden is well placed to maximise the potential of the offshore wind industry, said RWE.

The collaboration demonstrates a clear commitment to share knowledge and expertise, in support of broader industrial growth in Sweden, it added.

""Port capacity and a sustainable supply chain industry are key to the deployment of offshore wind projects,"" said vice president of offshore development Nordics at RWE Offshore Wind Matilda Machacek.

""A new offshore wind farm has the potential to transform a nearby harbour into a dynamic hub that catalyses significantly growth, infrastructure, jobs and economic benefits for the region.

""That is why we are looking forward to collaborating with Port of Karlshamn to evaluate their potential as future offshore wind hub.""

Project lead at RWE Renewables Sweden Anton Andersson said: ""Our Karehamn offshore wind farm is a great example also for harbour development. It has been reliably generating green electricity for thousands of Swedish homes for more than a decade.

""Thanks to the wind farm the old fishing harbour has been revitalised. Based on this success RWE plans to build more offshore wind farms in the Baltic Sea.""

Port of Karlshamn chief executive Caroline Säfström added: ""Port of Karlshamn is proud that RWE, one of the world's leading offshore wind companies, is supporting us in our plans to become a hub for offshore wind.

""With its natural deep harbour and large shipyard, Port of Karlshamn is well positioned to meet the future needs of the offshore wind industry in the Baltic Sea.

""We recognise the demand for port capacity related to offshore wind energy, including after-sales services such as maintenance and operations centres.

""Expanding the port's product portfolio in this direction is a natural step given our previous experience with wind energy projects and logistics.

These estimates are interesting, but it can be useful to paint some more broad strokes when seeing how forecasts compare, both to the RWE's past performance and to peers in the same industry. We would highlight that sales are expected to reverse, with a forecast 22% annualised revenue decline to the end of 2024. That is a notable change from historical growth of 28% over the last five years. Compare this with our data, which suggests that other companies in the same industry are, in aggregate, expected to see their revenue grow 7.4% per year.

In cooperation with Kyocera Communication Systems, Everblue Technologies and Tokyu Land Corporation, SolarDuck was selected in 2022 to carry out a demonstration of its solar power infrastructure in Tokyo's Central Breakwater district. The trial-size installation measures about 30 meters square, and will generate power for charging an energy storage battery bank in the Takeshiba area. Possible uses include powering Open Street Corporation's electric bikes, and providing charging for an electric boat. A temporary demonstration of the bike-charging power application is scheduled for May 12-21.

SolarDuck has ambitious plans for generating power at sea. The company's floating panel arrays can be integrated into offshore wind farm developments, but are also designed to work on their own in wind-poor, sun-rich waters - like those in Tokyo's inner harbor. This could allow densely-populated coastal areas to access solar power without giving up valuable shoreside real estate.

SolarDuck wants to deploy one gigawatt worth of floating solar capacity by 2030, and it says that it already has a project pipeline totaling 3.5 gigawatts at locations around the world. Work is under way on a small demonstrator project for RWE's Hollandse Kust West VII offshore wind farm in the Dutch sector of the North Sea, where surface conditions will be far rougher than in Tokyo's inner harbor. When completed, this will be the largest floating offshore solar plant ever built. It will soon be followed by a 120 MW farm in the Gulf of Taranto, supported by Green Arrow Capital and New Developments.

The strategy will allow Freeport East green energy cluster in East Anglia to position itself as a UK and international leader in decarbonising transport. Freeport East encompasses two ports at Felixstowe and Harwich, the Gateway 14 business and logistics park and a telecommunications R&D centre, with tax benefits designed to attract inward investment.

The report stresses the need for grid investment. Freeport East could use its geographical advantage to produce and supply green fuels for maritime, surface and potentially air transport.

Freeport East can leverage its position as a major UK transport hub to become a 'Green Transport Hub'. Decarbonisation will enhance its future competitive position and attract investment in green technologies and resources.

The process will require sufficient low-cost renewable energy supplies and associated networks, plus a green fuel production, supply and storage chain.

In assessing future energy needs, the report applied the Climate Change Committee's recommended decarbonisation scenario to the region. REA identified two key implications for Freeport East from the scenario.

Electricity consumption will need to significantly increase - an estimated six-fold from 2022 - to supply energy for transport and hydrogen electrolysers. It will require new investments in electricity networks and associated infrastructure. Major new hydrogen production and storage facilities will also be required to supply green transport fuels.

Freeport East stands to benefit from the UK government's energy transition plans which, for energy supplies, targets investment and growth in nearby offshore wind, low carbon hydrogen and nuclear power.

For transport, the plans target an acceleration to zero emission surface vehicles and green fuels for shipping and aircraft.

Steve Beel, chief executive of Freeport East, said: ""Decarbonising transport brings significant opportunities for inward investment; offering new jobs and skills as well as reducing the volatility and cost of our transport fuels. Freeport East, with significant transport flows across rail, road and sea, is a natural hub for the economies of scale required to support decarbonisation.

""However, achieving this element of the energy transition will require significant investment in our grid network and renewable power supplies. This independent report provides a valuable basis for ensuring we deliver the power infrastructure across Freeport East that will drive the transition to large-scale electrification and cleaner fuels across our transport system.""

The report identifies four key strategic themes.

First, enhance electricity resources. This can be done by identifying the investments needed in electricity networks, low carbon generation, customer electricity infrastructure and electric vehicles.

Enable hydrogen production by identifying the investment needed in electrolyser capacity and the supply chain for production, storage and supply of green fuels. The report also centres enabling finance solutions. Freeport East should identify priority investments and business cases to enable a mix of public and private finance solutions.

The final key strategy the REA highlighted was integrated resource planning and delivery. The transport hub should lead the development of coordinated local energy plans to optimise the delivery of net zero targets across the whole energy system. Further, by preparing delivery plans which identify priority investment needs, delivery models and financing solutions.

Dr Nina Skorupska CBE, CEO of the REA said: ""At a time when decarbonisation must move faster and across more sectors of our economy than ever before, it is fantastic to see an industry-leading coalition like Freeport East committing to the objective of becoming a Green Transport Hub.

The REA looks forward to working with stakeholders across industry and government to ensure the recommendations in the report are followed in full, and Freeport East's Green Transport Hub vision is realised.""

RWE, Maritime Transport and Sizewell C supported the report.

Managing director of Sizewell C, Julia Pyke, commented: ""Sizewell C welcomes Freeport East's plans to decarbonise transportation in the region and we look forward to continued collaboration throughout the development of the Green Transport Hub.""",current-news.co.uk,news,Current,Molly Green,0.2705882352941176,452962456,1,https://www.current-news.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Freeport-East-1920x823-1.jpg,eng-9553669

RWE, one of the world's leading players in offshore wind, signed Framework Agreements with Hitachi Energy and Aibel for the joint supply of three high-voltage direct current (HVDC) systems for RWE offshore wind farms. The agreements are long-term in nature as the secured HVDC systems are designated for offshore wind projects from RWE's global development pipeline, which are to be connected to the grid at the beginning of the next decade. A signing ceremony held in Hamburg, Germany celebrated the partnership between the three companies.

HVDC systems allow electricity transmission from offshore wind farms to onshore connection points. The agreements include the supply of HVDC systems and construction of the actual platforms. The onshore construction work will be contracted during the development phase of the projects.

Hitachi Energy will supply its voltage source converter (VSC) systems to convert alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC) for efficient long-distance transmission to shore, where it will be converted back to AC for the grid. Aibel will be responsible for the Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) on the design, construction, and commissioning of the offshore platforms.

Sven Utermöhlen, CEO RWE Offshore Wind: ""The deployment of offshore wind is crucial to reach climate protection targets. As RWE, we continue to drive forward the expansion of offshore wind energy in Europe and worldwide, because we believe in its long-term fundamentals. Through our partnership with Hitachi Energy and Aibel, we are able to secure early the necessary engineering and production capacity for three major HVDC systems to ensure future offshore wind farms can be integrated into the grid. Given the challenging market situation, this type of agreement is exactly what we need to succeed.""

The framework agreements allow Hitachi Energy and Aibel to manage the resources required to deliver the three HVDC systems, such as securing the supply chain, hiring workforce, allocating engineering and manufacturing capacity and ordering materials ahead of time.

The agreements provide RWE with the potential to procure additional HVDC systems for future offshore wind projects worldwide.

Niklas Persson, Managing Director Hitachi Energy's Grid Integration business: ""We're pleased to have been selected by RWE in this agreement to allow countries to achieve their carbon neutrality goals. The energy transition requires us to deploy innovative solutions at scale and speed. This new business model reflects our strategic shift to becoming more of a partner to support our customers in their effort to strengthen the power grids for the integration of increased clean renewables into the energy system.""

Mads Andersen, President and CEO Aibel: ""The agreement with RWE confirms that we have a competitive concept developed in collaboration with Hitachi Energy, and a reliable common delivery model with a balanced risk-reward profile. The capacity reservation provides predictability and further strengthens our position as a leading supplier to the offshore wind market.""",nsenergybusiness.com,news,NS Business,,0.4352941176470588,452952826,42,https://www.nsenergybusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/2024-05-08-rwe-signs-framework-agreement-with-hitachi-and-aibel-on-hdvc-systems.jpg,eng-9546167

Atlantica Sustainable Infrastructure (NASDAQ:AY) has done well since our last article, where we pointed out that they looked like a bargain trading with cash available for distribution (CAFD) yield of over 10%, most of which was being returned to shareholders via dividends. Since then, shares have significantly outperformed the S&P 500 index (SPY) on a total return basis.

While shares still look decently valued, the big news is that Bloomberg recently reported that there are advanced talks to acquire the company. Based on Seeking Alpha user comments, there is a lot of speculation about what the offer price might be. We have no particular knowledge about the acquisition negotiations other than what was reported by Bloomberg, but what we can do is take a look at historical M&A transactions in the space, and analyze Atlantica's assets in particular, to make an educated guess at what a reasonable offer price could be.

As a reminder, Atlantica delivered FY2023 CAFD of $235 million, or $2.03 per share, which means that at current prices of close to $22 it is trading at a still reasonable multiple of ~11x. Their CAFD guidance for 2024 was relatively wide due to higher than normal uncertainty regarding different parts of the business, but given the mid-point of $245 million there is hope for some growth compared to the previous year. Still, even at the lower end of the range, the dividend should be fully covered, but as we mentioned in the previous article, there is always a risk that management could decide to lower the dividend to help finance the development pipeline.

Atlantica is not starting fiscal 2024 with good numbers, having just reported a significant decline in CAFD and lower renewable energy production. CAFD was $50.9 million, a 17% decrease compared with $61.0 million in the first quarter of 2023 which included $4.1 million from the sale of part of an equity interest in their development company in Colombia. CAFD per share was $0.44, an 11% decrease excluding the equity sale in Colombia. Similarly, production in the renewable energy portfolio decreased by 11.0% for the first quarter of 2024 compared with the first quarter of 2023. This was largely the result of the unscheduled outage at the 100 MW Kaxu solar plant, where the company has a 51% interest. Kaxu restarted operations in mid-February 2024. Production also decreased in Spain as a result of significantly lower solar radiation.

Other notable highlights from the company's release included news that it signed a 15-year PPA for a 100 MW solar + storage project in California. It also closed the acquisition of two wind assets in operation in the UK at a 6.6x EV/EBITDA multiple. The Board of Directors approved the quarterly dividend of $0.445 per share, and the ""Strategic Review"" remains ongoing.

We won't go into as much detail as we did in the previous article, but we would like to remind readers that the annual report disclosed ""Strategic Review Bonuses"" for some members of management and the CEO. These bonuses would be triggered on the closing of a ""strategic transaction"". It is unclear what exactly would qualify, other than it depends on the Board of Directors' definition.

There is also a ""Change of Control"" clause, which says that a change of control would accelerate vesting of stock options for company employees, and that they would have 30 days before the options lapse. The takeaway is that management and employees of the company have an important incentive to get a high price in the case of a takeover.

We know that the strategic review initiated by the company was largely due to its biggest shareholder's desire to sell their stake. It is therefore relevant to see what their executives have been saying regarding Atlantica.

As fellow author Trapping Value pointed out in his March 11th article, Algonquin Power's (AQN) management hinted that a sale announcement in mid-2024 was likely. Below is the relevant part of the earnings call discussion between an analyst and Algonquin's Interim Chief Executive Officer.

Nelson Ng

[...] So Chris, you mentioned that you'll be making a sales announcement and/or you expect to make a sales announcement in mid-2024. So, just to clarify, are you essentially saying that the renewables sales -- like, do you expect to announce the sale of the renewables division in mid-2024? Or are you saying that an announcement will be made in mid-2024 regardless of whether there is a sale or not?

Chris Huskilson

What you just described is our target is to announce a sale at '24, that's our target.

Nelson Ng

Okay, okay and things are tracking well it sounds like.

Chris Huskilson

No news is good news.

There is an interesting compilation of energy generation asset valuations in M&A transactions compiled by FactSet, with a graph showing the different transactions by year and technology type. Valuations vary from a high of $9,632/kW for a UK offshore wind transaction in 2018, to an $80/kW sale of older fossil fuel assets in Northern Ireland in 2019.

Interestingly, it includes the acquisition of Atlantica's COSO Geothermal plant in California, which was done at a low valuation due to the steady decline in geothermal resource output. According to FactSet, Atlantica Sustainable Infrastructure paid $1,259/kW, a very low multiple for a geothermal plant. They point out that some of the highest valuations have been for renewables like offshore wind, hydropower, and geothermal assets. One relatively recent transaction that could give us some relevant insights was the acquisition of Con Edison Clean Energy by Germany's RWE (OTCPK:RWEOY). The portfolio size was roughly 3 GW and mostly made up of solar assets. The transaction took place at a valuation of roughly $2.3 million per MW. RWE also disclosed that the EBITDA for the Con Ed portfolio was $600 million, implying an 11.2x EBITDA multiple.

This is highly relevant for Atlantica, as its portfolio is mainly composed of solar assets too, given the 1,590 MW of solar assets in operation across 23 assets and only 442 MW in operating wind assets (not counting the small recent acquisitions). Most of the company's CAFD comes from renewables, which have approximately a 69% shares, with much of the rest split between efficient natural gas & heat and transmission line concession assets, and a low single digit attributed to a small water utility subsidiary. If Atlantica were to receive a similar offer at a ~11.2 EV/EBITDA multiple, that would imply an enterprise value of $8.9 billion based on its adjusted EBITDA of 794 million delivered in 2023. Atlantica's enterprise value currently stands at roughly $7.6 billion, which implies an additional $1.3 billion in equity value to the current market cap of ~$2.49 billion, or a premium of more than 50% to the current share price. Still, we would be surprised if the company manages to negotiate such a large premium, especially when it is well known that the largest shareholder is a motivated seller, even if shares have traded at a higher multiple before.

That said, a premium is very much expected, given that the company has developed several assets from its development pipeline in recent years, and shares are trading close to the average ten-year enterprise value. It would therefore be extremely difficult for the Board of Directors to justify a sale at a price only slightly higher compared to where shares are currently trading. After all, they have a fiduciary duty to all shareholders, not only their largest one, as desperate as they might be to sell.

We see the 11.2 EV/EBITDA multiple referenced above as a very optimistic buyout scenario, especially when the company itself has been able to recently purchase UK wind assets at 6.6x EV/EBITDA multiple. Still, the company has some assets that probably deserve higher valuations, such as its 280 MW Solana solar power plant in Arizona, and its 280 MW Mojave solar power plant in California. We also view the long-term transmission line concessions as highly-valuable, and the company has a healthy balance sheet, which means it is not in desperate need of a new sponsor.

It can also be argued that the company deserves a higher valuation multiple compared to individual assets, given that the development platform should be given some value as well. Especially considered the very significant pipeline that includes ~2.2 GW of renewable energy generation assets and ~6.0 GWh of storage projects.

A good example of the value of a development platform can be found in Orsted's (OTCPK:DNNGY)(OTCPK:DOGEF) 2021 acquisition of Brookfield Renewable's (BEP)(BEPC) Brookfield Renewable Ireland (BRI) subsidiary for €571 million, or roughly $614 million dollars. BRI owned a portfolio of 389 MW in operation and under construction assets, a 149 MW advanced development pipeline, and more than 1 GW development pipeline in Ireland and the UK. Brookfield highlighted the value creation thanks to the development pipeline.

The biggest risk we see right now with Atlantica Sustainable Infrastructure is that the price is reflecting to some degree expectations of a sale of the company. If negotiations fail or the results of the ""strategic review"" prove underwhelming, shares could decrease very significantly. There is also a risk of a dividend cut given the high payout ratio, even if the Board of Directors has approved the next quarterly payment.

We were not impressed by Atlantica's first quarter results, but right now, most investors are more concerned with the potential sale of the company, and what the offer price could be. Based on similar M&A past transactions, an optimistic scenario would be a 50% price premium to current prices, although we see such a high premium as having a very low probability. One of the main issues is the well-known fact that the main shareholder is a motivated seller, as well as the higher interest rate environment.

According to metrics provided by Seeking Alpha, Atlantica is trading with an EV/EBITDA (FWD) multiple of 9.48x, compared to the utilities sector median of 10.87x, or a 12.7% discount. We would therefore see a buyout premium of less than 15% compared to the current price of close to $22 as highly disappointing.",seekingalpha.com,news,Seeking Alpha,,0.3490196078431373,452951598,5,https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/1455762465/image_1455762465.jpg?io=getty-c-w1536,

Introduction

Until now, pro-Islamic State (IS) Artificial Intelligence (AI) propaganda materials were generated and shared online by supporters of the caliphate. Yet, none of them had ever been located within private chats and channels belonging to the IS communication infrastructure (IS online safe-havens).

Following the Crocus City Hall attack in Moscow on 26 March 2024, a user accessed the IS server on Rocketchat and posted a video generated with AI on the server's main discussion room. From that day to 1 May, he posted five different propaganda videos employing the same production techniques, albeit with some graphic and content differences. As of now, this is the most prominent example of an IS supporter using AI. The fact that the video was posted on Rocketchat - one of the main digital safe havens of IS since 2019 - represents a clear case of a security efficiency trade-off and a deliberate choice of the user to position itself as quickly as possible within the pro-IS digital ecosystem. The attack at the Crocus City Hall in Moscow could be considered the main source of inspiration that led to the production of these videos since it is the subject of the first one. The attack was even presented as a ""new beginning"" in the audio message released by the IS spokesman shared by its media arm, al-Furqan. This moment may have ignited a new era of pro-IS media operators.

The insight thus delves into how pro-IS supporters use AI to spread institutional propaganda materials of the Islamic State. By analysing the content, the videos are structured around official IS propaganda, which is presented as a newsflash by an AI-generated Arabic speaker. Specifically, the result was the creation of an online version of IS mass media news broadcasts. Moreover, the usage of official IS material, such as Amaq's bulletins, is highly relevant because the user presents himself with all the formal features of an official media house.

Furthermore, the use of material gleaned from the official IS communication stream and the choice to share the videos within an environment considered safe underlines the willingness to flaunt this content. In other words, it is a clear attempt to promote a new brand by respecting some of the socio-digital practices found within the pro-IS ecosystem. For instance, taking inspiration from the institutional material and creating a well-recognisable brand as a media house.

The only missing element is the digital bay'ah, a declaration of the alliance towards the Caliph, usually presented as a text banner. Nevertheless, the absence of this element does not exclude future publications. In the past, other media houses have declared an alliance after consolidating their position online.

From 26 March to 4 April, the user produced and posted the videos in Arabic (two of 90 seconds and one of 60 seconds). Interestingly, three different AIs methods were employed to produce the videos:

Character (speaker) generation; Voice file generation. In this case, a text-to-speech AI was used, which, starting from a written text, simply reads it with pre-selected intonation and language (Arabic); Lips movement and connection to the audio file.

The first video represents a jihadist press review of Amaq and IS bulletins related to the Moscow attack, while the second and the third present a press review of IS's Middle Eastern and African operations. As shown by the screenshots (Fig. 1), the first generated character wears a military uniform, while in the other two, the speaker is dressed in traditional Islamic civilian clothes (Fig. 2).

Figure 1: military-generated character.

Figure 2: civilian-generated character.

The content of the videos remained the only constant element: official claims and statements are used as overlay images (material from Amaq, IS and Al-Naba) and the synthetic voice reads the written text. In addition, it is noteworthy that, apart from the first video, the user signs the other four videos with a logo that recalls his name on Rockechat, implying that it is its own media house.

The videos and the usage of IS content

From the analysis of the communication flow, according to the pro-IS community reactions, it is a successful attempt to provide a 'digital press review' service of IS operations in the Middle East and sub-Saharan Africa. This thematically overlaps with the Nashir News, although they only share official IS material. The user has also collected part of these materials, in particular war news, and pasted them into the video. Moreover, the layout of the video refers to a specific communicative imperative, recalling the style of the major television news networks, such as CNN and the BBC. At the bottom of the screen, a short text overlay can be seen, accompanied on the right by the IS official logo.

Figure 3: the logo of the user in the top right-hand corner., IS logo on the bottom right.

Even though the five videos present themselves as a new form of cutting-edge media production, it is worth noting that, except for the first video dated 26 March, some of the material shows considerable discrepancies in terms of chronology and geography between the IS media centre and Amaq bulletins and the images that follow them. The institutional material presented in the videos refers to recent IS operations, while some of the images date back to 2022, 2023, and even 2017. Specifically, in the second video, images are from 2023 and 2017 (one of which cannot be identified because its characters are too generic), while in the third video, images are from 2022 and 2023. For instance, in the case of Fig.4, the user poses an image of the Islamic State Province in West Africa (ISWAP), specifically Mozambique, which follows an IS media centre bulletin referring to an operation in Nigeria. The more remarkable part is that the user was seemingly aware of this discrepancy. He cut off the lower part of some of these images to delete the overlay text, in which IS media centre and Amaq give a short caption, location, and the date of the operation.

The reaction of the pro-IS community

The five videos shared by the user on Rocketchat have garnered positive and favourable opinions, as shown in Fig. 5. Furthermore, an indication that the video caught the attention of the community is the presence of several pieces of advice given by other users in order to make the video theologically coherent.

Figure 5: a user asks in Arabic which agency produced the video posted on the 26 of March. The poster replies with his nickname, suggesting that whoever is behind the user identifies themselves as a spontaneous media house.

One of the community reactions was highly interesting, particularly given its possible future implications. While different users suggested some generic corrections, the most interesting interactions pertained to the videos' language and religious elements. After receiving a request from a user for an English version, the creator of the AI video expressed positively, suggesting that they might produce new videos in English in the future. Another user was more concerned about the theological implications of using AI. Its interactions with the AI creator pushed him to blur the face of the speaker (Fig. 6) in order to not be considered haram (sinful).

Figure 6: image of the correction made by the user to comply with the community rules

This is closely tied to the potential of this new form of AI-generated content, which promises a significant increase in the usability of content produced by both IS and official media outlets. By creating a press review of the main IS news and content (the last video is based around articles from al-Naba, an Islamic State official magazine), it is assumed that the user, through its media house, is seeking to propose a new broadcast-style propaganda tool, speeding up and facilitating the dissemination of information and propaganda material to wider Western audiences.

As to how this case might represent the use of AI is still shrouded in a halo of perplexity concerning its permissibility of using such tools in Islam. According to several Islamic law experts, the use of AI is not considered haram, yet the jihadist ecosystem is still very sceptical about its use. Nevertheless, by monitoring the users of the main IS server channel on Rocketchat, it was possible to observe how several users have reported their attempts to use AI tools to develop propaganda material without receiving any discouragement or disapproval from other users. Looking at the positive directions of the ecosystem to the above videos and the efforts of Hisad to be more accepted, it is worth asserting that, given the absence of a precise religious doctrine which prohibits its use, AI technologies could evolve into a tool for producing and diffusing propaganda material.

How to prevent a new era of pro-IS propaganda

The first step to ascertain a possible wave of AI-equipped media operators is content analysis. Once the material used has been identified, it is possible to target the supply chain of images and news. In particular, the targeting of Nashir channels, which are considered bottlenecks in the pro-IS digital ecosystem, could affect video production capacity and visibility. Secondly, AI providers, internal moderation, and access policies should impede the production of terroristic content within the platforms. The study of the propaganda released and shared by jihadist organisations, such as IS, has enabled us to identify specific recurring elements (content, visual motifs, and expressions) that can be exploited to train AIs aimed at terrorist pattern recognition. The use of AI capable of recognising and reporting terrorist patterns becomes increasingly necessary. Ali Fisher and Nico Prucha are currently engaged in the development of an advanced artificial intelligence system. This AI system is designed to be authentic and evidence-based, ensuring that its functionalities are rooted in verifiable data. Its core capability includes the recognition of the theocentric nature characteristic of the Islamic State. By launching a rapid categorisation of the material and leveraging vast datasets, the AI aims to accurately interpret and analyse the complex ideological underpinnings that define this movement. The goal of their work is to create a tool that not only enhances our understanding of such movements but also contributes to a more effective content identification within social media.

Infrastructure manager Ancala has agreed to sell its 50% stake in Milford Haven-based Dragon LNG Group (Dragon) to VTTI, a global leader in energy storage and developer of energy infrastructure. The value of the deal, which is expected to be finalised in Q3 of this year, has not been disclosed. It comes as LNG volumes through the terminal have seen a threefold increase.

Dragon is one of three LNG terminals in the UK with a gas send out rate of up to 9 nine billion cubic meters per annum - enough to supply 10% of the UK's gas needs.

Ancala acquired a 50% interest in Dragon in 2019. The other 50% stake is held by Shell who will remain a shareholder following the transaction.

Since Ancala's acquisition, the infrastructure manager has worked closely with the business to invest in the terminal, develop and execute its net zero strategy, and enhance its operations. It supported Dragon to install an at peak 10 megawatt solar park on site which was commissioned in 2023. This has reduced Dragon's scope 2 carbon emissions by around 2,500 tonnes per year, as well as provides renewable energy to local businesses.

Dragon has also submitted a planning application for an at peak 13 megawatt wind farm. Together the renewables projects will supply a significant part of the terminal's demand for power with self-generated green electricity. Dragon is also currently working in partnership with RWE, the largest power generator in Wales, on a Multi-Utility Services Transit (MUST). The MUST will connect industry across the Milford Haven Waterway which will support the decarbonisation ambitions of the South Wales Industrial Cluster.

The transaction marks Ancala's sixth exit from its first flagship infrastructure fund which continues to outperform.

Simon Ames, managing director, Dragon LNG, said:""The Ancala team has been a valued partner and played a critical role in our work to enhance our terminal operations and accelerate our energy transition strategy. They have brought fresh thinking to unlock new opportunities and make improvements across the business.

""The terminal is in an exciting position to expand its role in contributing to the UK's energy security and affordability whilst decarbonising our own scope 1 and scope 2 emissions. We are also well positioned to be part of the wider decarbonisation within the Milford Haven industrial cluster and as the UK's leading energy port. We work closely with the port, other industries and the local community to ensure we maximise the benefit we bring to the local economy and the broader UK pathway to net zero. We're looking forward to what we can achieve in the future with Shell and VTTI.""

Lee Mellor, partner, Ancala, said:""Dragon has been another successful investment for Ancala and evidences our proactive approach to create value whilst delivering downside protection for our investors. Our investment thesis was based upon the growing importance of LNG to the UK's energy mix and in delivering further improvements to the site's operations and to Dragon's sustainability journey.

""We're pleased to have helped the team deliver on this while providing a step-change in Dragon's capabilities and developing exciting new opportunities for the business.

""We would like to thank the Dragon team and Shell for the excellent collaboration and partnership over the past five years and wish them, together with VTTI, every success on the exciting journey ahead.""

Proposals for a 'Greener Grid Park' in Necton have been granted permission for development by Breckland Council.

The plans were unveiled last year with the project designed to support the increasing amounts of renewable energy being fed into the National Grid, in the wake of major schemes like RWE's offshore windfarms.

The site is located next to the Necton substation, to the south of the A47, and council planning officers conceded that the development would have a significant impact on the landscape of the area.

Fraser Bateman, a Necton parish councillor, said: ""While we accept that this project will serve a necessary function in making the National Grid more reliant and efficient, we are not satisfied with the site chosen or the visual impact of this industrial scale development in a rural location. This is far from ideal.""

The Greener Grid Park, proposed by Norwegian company Statkraft, is aimed at stabilising the grid and providing reliability of power supply in case of disruptions to the electricity system.

Currently, at times of low wind activity, fossil fuel plants are fired up. The park will instead use synchronous compensators - large electrical machines with flywheels - to deliver this stability.

Sacha Lloyd Rutherford, project manager, said: ""This development will help to keep the lights on and secure our greener energy supply.

""It will support the fight against climate change, solve a lasting issue with our grid network and reduce energy bills.

""Projects like this will allow more wind and solar to be built and connected.""

Construction of the park will begin later this year and is expected to take around 18 months.",lynnnews.co.uk,news,Lynn News,,0.2156862745098038,452944840,1,https://www.lynnnews.co.uk/_media/img/SX5NN0V4MH5SUC0B0ZRA.jpg,

Her work through a huge period of change for the regional group Humber Marine and Renewables - at a time when her own business was bought out - was a key consideration.

Camilla said: ""It is quite overwhelming. This room is overflowing with people who I admire, I look up to and I respect, and to receive this when surrounded by so many amazing companies, amazing people and the future also of this region, with all these wonderful apprentices, it really is a surprise and really is an honour.""

Born in Cleethorpes, she studied international business management and broadcast journalism, with an early media career taking her to Paris, London and New York before she returned to Lincolnshire in 2008. Her father Anthony's passing saw her take the helm of Carlbom Shipping, navigating the business into the burgeoning offshore wind market as a mainstay, coal, entered terminal decline.

Her award came during an evening at which winners of the 2024 Humber Renewables Awards used the stage to encourage the next generation to take the industry forward on a sparkling night of celebration.

A dozen years of recognition of the sector's sensational role in helping regenerate the region were rung up as the event once again became a fitting finale to Humber Marine and Renewables' Offshore Wind Connections conference.

Held at Hull's DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel - a venue that the event heard ""probably wouldn't have been built had it not been for the emergence of offshore wind,"" - 200 guests toasted standout stories uniting the Energy Estuary.

Camilla Carlbom Flinn was crowned Humber Renewables Champion, with her work to diversify the fourth generation family business and take the host organisation to a new level highlighted, as well as impressive ambassadorial duties with her proud Swedish heritage.

And RWE was named Medium to Large Business of the Year, recognising the huge commitments made to the region with skills programmes, vessel purchases and operations and maintenance expansion.

Its focus on the future workforce was embraced by many winners, with demand clear.

Long-term operator from Grimsby, Tidal Transit, won the Green Innovation Award, for its pioneering electric crew transfer vessel project, with a full retrofit of a diesel craft.

Leo Hambro, commercial director, said: ""I am delighted that after 12 years of working in the Humber, we are now creating a change that will not just last for another 12 years, but for generations. It will make a change, not just economically, but environmentally, reducing emissions.

""We are delighted to work out of Humber. The support we have found locally is second to none, the supply chain, the clients we work with directly are so supportive, and we feel like part of the family.

""We can't do it on our own. We need mariners, there is a lack of them, and for tomorrow there is an even bigger problem. We need to engage with kids at any age to show them there isn't just the opportunity to be a wind engineer, there are opportunities to work at sea, to create a full life career.""",blmforum.net,news,Business Link Magazine,Stuart Pearcey,0.3490196078431373,452933935,1,https://www.blmforum.net/mag/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/camilla-e1715237666827.jpeg,

The Association for Renewable Energy and Clean Technology (REA) has today published a new report on Freeport East's Green Transport Hub Strategy. The Freeport East region, based around the ports of Felixstowe and Harwich, is a major UK transport hub. Decarbonisation of transport can enhance the Freeport's future competitive position and attract new investment in green transport technologies and resources.

Pursuing a Green Transport Hub Strategy will allow the Freeport to maintain its position as a UK and international leader in transport decarbonisation. Freeport East is already well placed to pursue this strategy through the UK Government's energy transition plans which:

The Freeport East region can leverage its existing position as a major UK transport hub with the energy transition to become a major UK and international 'Green Transport Hub'. This is a valuable opportunity that should deliver major benefits to both local and national economies, and is already happening with a diversity of developments such as those announced by companies such as Rux Energy, RWE, Scottish Power and Green Firefly.

Steve Beel, Chief Executive, Freeport East, said:

""Decarbonising transport brings significant opportunities for inward investment; offering new jobs and skills as well as reducing the volatility and cost of our transport fuels. Freeport East, with significant transport flows across rail, road and sea, is a natural hub for the economies of scale required to support decarbonisation.

""However, achieving this element of the energy transition will require significant investment in our grid network and renewable power supplies. This independent report provides a valuable basis for ensuring we deliver the power infrastructure across Freeport East that will drive the transition to large-scale electrification and cleaner fuels across our transport system.""

But to achieve this goal, sufficient low-cost renewable energy supplies and associated networks must be available, plus a green fuel production, supply and storage chain. This will require significant investment and must be affordable in a highly competitive trade and transport marketplace. Also, the evolution to a 'Green Transport Hub' must be coordinated with other energy transition measures for power, heat, and transport across the region.

The report identifies four strategic themes key to achieve the 'Green Transport Hub' vision for Freeport East.

Dr Nina Skorupska CBE, CEO, REA (Association for Renewable Energy and Clean Technology) said:

""At a time when decarbonisation must move faster and across more sectors of our economy than ever before, it is fantastic to see an industry-leading coalition like Freeport East committing to the objective of becoming a Green Transport Hub.

The REA looks forward to working with stakeholders across industry and government to ensure the recommendations in the report are followed in full, and Freeport East's Green Transport Hub vision is realised.""

Jeremy Smith, Head of Hydrogen Business Development, RWE, said:

""As an organisation with big ambition to produce green hydrogen in the UK, we recognise the potential opportunities in the Freeport East region and we are keen to understand and work through the challenges.""

Julia Pyke, Manging Director, Sizewell C said:

""Sizewell C welcomes Freeport East's plans to decarbonise transportation in the region and we look forward to continued collaboration throughout the development of the Green Transport Hub.""

Tom Williams, Deputy CEO at Maritime Transport, said:

""It is essential that additional electrical power and alternative fuels are made available in in the Felixstowe area. Over the next 5 years Maritime will be operating at least 48 battery electric and hydrogen fuel cell trucks as part of the Innovate UK/Department for Transport ZEHID trials as we move towards net zero.""

Proposals for a 'Greener Grid Park' in Necton have been granted permission for development by Breckland Council.

The plans were unveiled last year with the project designed to support the increasing amounts of renewable energy being fed into the National Grid, in the wake of major schemes like RWE's offshore windfarms.

The site is located next to the Necton substation, to the south of the A47, and council planning officers conceded that the development would have a significant impact on the landscape of the area.

Fraser Bateman, a Necton parish councillor, said: ""While we accept that this project will serve a necessary function in making the National Grid more reliant and efficient, we are not satisfied with the site chosen or the visual impact of this industrial scale development in a rural location. This is far from ideal.""

The Greener Grid Park, proposed by Norwegian company Statkraft, is aimed at stabilising the grid and providing reliability of power supply in case of disruptions to the electricity system.

Currently, at times of low wind activity, fossil fuel plants are fired up. The park will instead use synchronous compensators - large electrical machines with flywheels - to deliver this stability.

Sacha Lloyd Rutherford, project manager, said: ""This development will help to keep the lights on and secure our greener energy supply.

""It will support the fight against climate change, solve a lasting issue with our grid network and reduce energy bills.

""Projects like this will allow more wind and solar to be built and connected.""

The agreements are long-term in nature as the secured HVDC systems are designated for offshore wind projects from RWE's global development pipeline, which are to be connected to the grid at the beginning of the next decade. A signing ceremony held in Hamburg, Germany celebrated the partnership between the three companies.

HVDC systems allow electricity transmission from offshore wind farms to onshore connection points. The agreements include the supply of HVDC systems and construction of the actual platforms. The onshore construction work will be contracted during the development phase of the projects.

Hitachi Energy will supply its voltage source converter (VSC) systems to convert alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC) for efficient long-distance transmission to shore, where it will be converted back to AC for the grid. Aibel will be responsible for the Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) on the design, construction, and commissioning of the offshore platforms.

Sven Utermöhlen, CEO RWE Offshore Wind: ""The deployment of offshore wind is crucial to reach climate protection targets. As RWE, we continue to drive forward the expansion of offshore wind energy in Europe and worldwide, because we believe in its long-term fundamentals. Through our partnership with Hitachi Energy and Aibel, we are able to secure early the necessary engineering and production capacity for three major HVDC systems to ensure future offshore wind farms can be integrated into the grid. Given the challenging market situation, this type of agreement is exactly what we need to succeed.""

The framework agreements allow Hitachi Energy and Aibel to manage the resources required to deliver the three HVDC systems, such as securing the supply chain, hiring workforce, allocating engineering and manufacturing capacity and ordering materials ahead of time.

The agreements provide RWE with the potential to procure additional HVDC systems for future offshore wind projects worldwide.

Niklas Persson, Managing Director Hitachi Energy's Grid Integration business: ""We're pleased to have been selected by RWE in this agreement to allow countries to achieve their carbon neutrality goals. The energy transition requires us to deploy innovative solutions at scale and speed. This new business model reflects our strategic shift to becoming more of a partner to support our customers in their effort to strengthen the power grids for the integration of increased clean renewables into the energy system.""

Mads Andersen, President and CEO Aibel: ""The agreement with RWE confirms that we have a competitive concept developed in collaboration with Hitachi Energy, and a reliable common delivery model with a balanced risk-reward profile. The capacity reservation provides predictability and further strengthens our position as a leading supplier to the offshore wind market.""",evwind.es,news,AEEolica,,0.3333333333333333,452869544,30,,eng-9546167

The original equipment manufacturer will supply 16 aeroderivative LM6000VELOX dual fuel DLE (dry low emissions) gas turbine and generator packages, which are expected to deliver 850 MW when they begin operating in 2028. The new plant will ""provide more flexible, reliable and dispatchable generation to support the growth in intermittent renewables,"" GE Vernova said.

The order marks an important first step for TVA, which announced in April that it would retire the nine-unit coal facility in Roane County. In a record of decision (ROD), TVA said the ""need for [Kingston] to operate at full capacity has decreased"" given the evolution of its generating fleet over the past 10 to 15 years -- primarily driven by additions of nuclear, gas, and renewable resources. TVA noted it had resorted to more frequent cycling of Kingston's units to meet fluctuating loads.

In its ROD, the TVA highlighted plans to replace the coal plant's decades-long workhouse capacity with a natural gas-fired CCGT combined with 16 dual-fueled aero-derivative combustion turbines, a 3 MW to 4 MW solar site, a 100-MW battery storage site, along with a new 161-kV switchyard on the Kingston Reservation.

While the ROD kicked off the technology selection and procurement process, it also underscored the urgency for a quick replacement, noting that the replacement generation ""must continue to maintain the planning reserve margins and to provide transmission system voltage support to the local area that is needed to maintain overall system stability and reliability."" So far, no decisions have been made beyond the aeroderivative units announced on Monday, the TVA confirmed.

""The Kingston Energy Complex highlights the way diverse generation works together to ensure TVA can provide more reliable, resilient, and affordable power,"" said TVA Chief Operating Officer Don Moul on Monday. ""These aeroderivative units will help us meet demand during peak energy usage and supplement solar generation on days when sunshine is limited.""

The order also indicates continued commercial uptake of GE Vernova's LM6000VELOX packages, which the company introduced in October 2023. The first 10-unit package is set to be introduced at TVA's Johnsonville Aeroderivative Plant in Middle Tennessee, marking a first for TVA's fleet of natural gas plants.

At the core of the package is the LM6000, a 44.7-MW to 56-MW aeroderivative gas turbine launched in 1988, derived from GE's CF6-80C2 high bypass turbofan aircraft engine. More than 1,200 LM6000 gas turbines have since been installed across 60 countries, GE Vernova said. ""These units are well-known in the power generation industry for their quick start time of down to 5 minutes to full power, high cyclic life helping to complement intermittent power from renewable sources, and operational flexibility which can help stabilize the grid and reduce the risk of electricity supply shortages,"" the company explained.

The LM6000 offers ""greater than 99% start and operational reliability and over 98% availability,"" it noted. ""In addition, the turbine in a Singular Annular Combustor (SAC) configuration has the capability to burn up to 100% hydrogen by volume, which can reduce or eliminate CO emissions from power delivered by a gas turbine.""

The concept of packaging the LM6000 stems from an initiative to reduce the installation and commissioning schedule of LM6000 turbines by up to 40%, saving up to 4,000 labor hours."" According to GE Vernova, the initiative speaks to inherent benefits presented by aeroderivatives to support the massive buildout of renewables. Compared to other available gas turbine models, aeroderivatives feature faster start-up time and higher simple cycle efficiency. Aeroderivatives are also relatively compact and lightweight, facilitating easier transportation and installation. Compact modular packaging enables quick installation and deployment, it noted.

GE Vernova has long offered a package for its LM2500 aeroderivative gas turbine technology (with a capacity range of 33 MW to 36.3 MW). GE Vernova's LM2500XPRESS power plant, launched in January 2020, is 95% factory-assembled ""into simplified modules for quick and easy site installation. Where power is needed quickly, the plant can be installed in as little as two weeks with a relatively small crew,"" it noted.

The 57-MW LM6000VELOX package follows up on the LM2500XPRESS's success, GE Vernova said. At TVA, the 16 LM6000VELOX packages also feature a dual-fuel capability, allowing them to operate flexibly on natural gas or liquid fuels if needed. ""In addition, the DLE combustor configuration is capable of meeting stringent environmental regulations, meeting emissions limits that comply with the regional air district requirements, and avoiding water consumption for NOx emissions abatement,"" it said.

The market for aeroderivatives is growing in the power generation and energy-intensive industries, GE Vernova noted. The company points to industry forecasts, which suggest North America and Europe will continue to lead the demand for aeroderivative gas turbines. ""This is due to well-established power generation infrastructures, stringent emissions regulations, and strong commitment to renewable energy,"" it notes.

The company suggested that Europe is already fielding a demand for reserve and peaking power solutions. RWE Generation recently installed 11 ""plug and play"" LM2500XPRESS units to provide a critical gas-power reserve in Germany's reliability-challenged southern region. Similarly, the Swiss Federal Office of Energy's 250-MW station at Birr utilizes eight TM2500 mobile gensets. In Ireland, the Electricity Supply Board has enhanced its reserve power capabilities with installations at Shannonbridge and Northwall, each equipped with six LM2500XPRESS units and a 150-MW plant at Tarbert powered by three LM6000 units.

However, other global regions are also looking intently at aero derivatives as a solution to support their sustainable energy transitions and reduce environmental impacts. Taiwan Power Co. has so far integrated six LM2500XPRESS units to provide an additional 175 MW of capacity, facilitating a coal-to-gas energy shift and supporting the integration of wind power. In Yemen, PetroMasila embarked on a transition from diesel to natural gas power using GE Vernova's TM2500 units.

Hydrogen readiness is also bolstering prospects for aeroderivatives. As POWER reported in detail in 2022, the LM6000 turbine showcased that capability at the New York Power Authority's Brentwood Power Station, achieving operation with up to 44% hydrogen -- some of the highest volumes of hydrogen blended into a commercially operating gas turbine.

Similarly, Australia's CS Energy is pioneering Queensland's first hydrogen-ready facility at its Brigalow Peaking Power Plant. In January 2024, GE Vernova said the 400-MW project would utilize 12 LM2500XPRESS aero-derivative gas turbines in the new power station. Once operational in 2026, Brigalow will be capable of operating initially on 35% (by volume) of renewable hydrogen, with a pathway to 100 percent hydrogen over this decade.",powermag.com,news,POWER Magazine,Sonal Patel,0.1686274509803922,452869413,1,https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/kingston-aerial-perspective-gevernova-scaled.jpg,

The aim of this collaboration is to explore whether Port of Karlshamn could be a suitable harbour for the logistics, installation, operations and maintenance activities relating to RWE's planned offshore wind projects in the Baltic Sea. In a first step, the partners will map the requirements and necessary build outs and investments to facilitate the scaling-up of the ports capacity. An early implementation of port capacity will ensure that Sweden is well placed to maximise the potential of the offshore wind industry. This collaboration demonstrates a clear commitment to share knowledge and expertise, in support of broader industrial growth in Sweden.

Matilda Machacek, Vice President of Offshore Development Nordics at RWE Offshore Wind: ""Port capacity and a sustainable supply chain industry are key to the deployment of offshore wind projects. And a new offshore wind farm has the potential to transform a nearby harbour into a dynamic hub that catalyses significantly growth, infrastructure, jobs and economic benefits for the region.

We recognise the demand for port capacity related to offshore wind energy, including after-sales services such as maintenance and operations centres. Expanding the port's product portfolio in this direction is a natural step given our previous experience with wind energy projects and logistics. By establishing itself as a hub for offshore wind energy, Port of Karlshamn is also creating employment opportunities for the region and promoting business opportunities for local companies and suppliers, thus contributing to the economic development of the area and strengthening the local economy.""

RWE - an experienced offshore player

RWE is one of the world's largest offshore wind companies with more than 20-year track record of developing, building, and operating offshore wind projects efficiently. The company currently operates 19 offshore wind farms. Two offshore wind farms, Thor (1.1 GW) in Denmark and Sofia (1.4 GW) in the UK, are under construction, and further projects are in development worldwide. RWE plans to grow its global offshore wind capacity from 3.3 GW today to 10 GW in 2030. RWE's experience in deploying seabed-fixed offshore wind turbines, combined with its in-house engineering expertise and global approach, means that the company is particularly well placed to also become a market leader in floating wind and unlock the large-scale potential of deep waters around the world. RWE is actively participating in high-profile floating demonstration projects, each based on different foundation concepts, to gain early floating wind experience and broad engineering knowledge.",evwind.es,news,AEEolica,,0.2862745098039217,452868143,42,,eng-9551555

Texas is expected to install 6.5 GW of utility-scale batteries in 2024, bringing the total installed capacity to around 10 GW, data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) shows.

Solar deployment is soaring and an increasing number of developers are coupling their projects with battery storage to maximise income. Meanwhile, new tax credits in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act have spurred deployment of stand-alone batteries.

""Developers expect to bring more than 300 utility-scale battery storage projects on line in the United States by 2025, and around 50% of the planned capacity installations will be in Texas,"" EIA said in January.

Source: U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), February 2024

Rising clean power and battery storage capacity in Texas is reducing the use of fossil fuel plants during peak evening demand periods.

Developers are installing larger batteries to gain economies of scale and maximise revenue opportunities. Texas will host some of the largest batteries in the U.S., including Solar Proponent's 621 Lunis Creek and 600 MW Clear Fork Creek projects and Hecate Energy's 600 MW Ramsey Storage project, all of which are set to be co-located with large solar farms in the south.

""Storage assets have been steadily getting bigger over time. Five years ago, a 50 MW operating battery was considered a large utility-scale asset,"" Xiaoyu Gu, managing director at investment group AB CarVal, told Reuters Events.

""I believe market changes will drive an imperative need for larger [battery storage] facilities,"" said Hanson Wood, Senior Vice President of Utility-Scale Development at RWE Clean Energy.

""I am optimistic that we will see a handful of 1 GW facilities by 2030,"" Wood said.

Thinking big

For the first time, the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act introduced a 30% tax credit for standalone energy storage, while extending tax credits for solar and wind for a further 10 years.

A number of solar developers are using the storage tax credits to retrofit batteries to existing solar facilities or add them to projects under development. Meanwhile, separate stand-alone facilities can be located closer to demand centers, avoiding lengthy grid connection processes faced by solar developers in more remote areas.

The batteries planned at Lunis Creek, Clear Fork Creek and Ramsey are of similar capacity to co-located solar farms, showing how developers are keen to maximise storage capacity at a given site to capture more power revenues.

Large batteries can provide significant economies of scale in soft costs and fixed costs, such as ""interconnection, development expenditures, and site construction and mobilization,"" Wood said.

The boom in energy storage deployment has provided installation companies with additional revenue streams.

""For projects under 75 MW we see waning interest from large [installation companies],"" Wood noted.

Battery capex costs are also falling on the back of rising production capacity and global competition. Market intelligence group Clean Energy Associates (CEA) predict the cost of US lithium-ion battery storage will drop by 18% in 2024 as Chinese suppliers seek customers. Suppliers continue to improve technology and manufacturing processes and costs will continue to fall over the next two decades, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) said in a 2023 report.

Peak profits

Batteries can provide owners with multiple revenue streams. Solar operators usually charge batteries during high solar periods and dispatch during evening peak demand periods when solar power wanes and prices are typically highest. Last summer, peak prices in Texas hit the market price cap of $5,000/MWh as heat waves drove up conditioning demand.

Owners of stand-alone batteries typically follow a similar ""energy arbitrage"" approach, charging when power market prices are lower and dispatching when prices are higher.

In addition, Texas grid operator ERCOT pays battery operators for ancillary grid services that improve grid reliability and stabilise power flows.

As a result, developers in Texas are favouring storage durations of around two hours, compared with around one hour just a few years ago.

Market regulation is a key driver of storage durations. Resource adequacy rules in California's CAISO market incentivise four-hour batteries, for example.

""However, in alternative markets such as ERCOT, RWE has tended to install 2-hour [battery storage] solutions which are more optimal for a purely energy arbitrage business model,"" Wood said.

Chasing demand

Grid congestion and curtailment risks are an increasing challenge for clean power developers in Texas and other high growth markets.

Wind power deployment has been concentrated in West Texas and many solar developers have headed east and south to avoid grid connection delays and minimise congestion risks.

The proposed Lunis Creek, Clear Fork Creek and Ramsey storage projects are all located in South Texas near major demand centers.

""Market data suggest that the South Texas and Houston hub are where there is the biggest need because of electricity congestion issues,"" Vibhu Kaushik, Senior Vice President and Global Head of Energy, Utilities, and Storage at Prologis, a commercial real estate and utilities investor.

ERCOT prices show higher volatility in southern Texas and the Houston hub, Kaushik said.

""Where there is congestion and revenue, supply will come in,"" Kaushik said. ""We are doing a lot of distributed assets today and rooftop solar.""

Developers have called for Texas grid operator ERCOT to plan ahead and expand transmission capacity to send power from high development areas to the larger load centers. New power lines from West to East would be one way to ease the congestion but these would take many years to be completed.

Going forward, rising solar and storage capacity is likely to soften wholesale price swings, reducing the revenue potential for operators.

Developers will also be wary of future falls in battery prices as electric vehicles and battery storage is deployed globally, making existing storage assets less competitive.

Factors that will influence battery costs include ""market demand, supply chain expansions or constraints, interplay with other sectors such electric vehicles, and material costs and availability,"" NREL said in its report.",reutersevents.com,news,reutersevents.com,,0.3098039215686275,452867064,5,https://d2921o69vu3u9x.cloudfront.net/rtsjv168_reuters_adrees_latif.jpg?dq5pr3zgeoUj1r6kNLzn68hrkjLspwA.,

The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero says the new facility will be built at Urenco's Capenhurst site in northwest England, will support around 400 jobs and ""will put an end to Russia's reign as the only commercial producer"" of HALEU fuel in Europe.

HALEU - uranium enriched to between 5% and 20% uranium-235 - will be used in the advanced nuclear fuel required for most of the next-generation reactor designs currently under development. At present, only Russia and China have the infrastructure to produce HALEU at scale. The first advanced reactors are scheduled to be operational in the early 2030s.

UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said that building the uranium enrichment plant was essential for guaranteeing the country's nuclear and energy security.

Urenco CEO Boris Schucht said: ""The responsibility the nuclear industry has to help governments and customers to achieve climate change and energy security goals is clear. We welcome this government investment, which will help accelerate the development of a civil HALEU commercial market and in turn the development of the next generation of nuclear power plants. These plants will have even higher safety standards and lend themselves to quicker licensing and construction processes.""

The GBP195 million funding is part of the GBP300 million HALEU programme announced in January, with the energy department saying that the remaining funding would be allocated later this year to other parts of the programme including to support deconversion capability (converting the enriched uranium into a form to be made into fuel).

Tom Greatrex, Chief Executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, said: ""This investment will enable the UK to fuel advanced reactors around the world, building on our existing capabilities to strengthen energy security for our allies.""

Zara Hodgson, Director of the Dalton Nuclear Institute, which is also based in the northwest of England, said: ""This is the biggest single investment in UK nuclear fuel production capability in decades, and it is especially welcome as it will accelerate the supply of the next generation of fuels that are vital for this new net zero nuclear era. Urenco Capenhurst's HALEU Enrichment capability will help hugely to unlock the deliverability of advanced nuclear projects, opening the door to sustainable electricity and heat for industries from nuclear, across the UK and overseas. We look now towards to how we can support this important project through training and innovation.""

The USA is also developing a domestic supply of HALEU. In November last year, Centrus Energy delivered the first HALEU produced at its American Centrifuge Plant in Piketon, Ohio, to the US Department of Energy (DOE). Construction of the 16-centrifuge demonstration cascade plant began in 2019, under contract with the DOE. The delivery by Centrus of more than 20 kilograms of HALEU to the DOE means that phase one of the contract has now been completed and Centrus can move ahead with the second phase: a full year of HALEU production at the 900 kilograms per year plant.

In September, Orano revealed plans to extend enrichment capacity at its Georges Besse II (GB-II) uranium enrichment plant in France, and said it had begun the regulatory process to produce HALEU there.

You will note that the EU institutions have been busy during March. On March 12, 2024, the European Parliament (EP) formally adopted the revised Product Liability Directive, which makes several important changes to the existing European Union (EU) product liability regime, including that software and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies will now fall within the scope of a product. On March 13, 2024, the EP formally adopted the Artificial Intelligence Act, meaning the legislative process for the world's first binding law on AI is nearing its conclusion. Finally, on March 15, 2024, the Council of the European Union and the EP reached a provisional agreement on the European Health Data Space (EHDS), which aims to improve access to health data electronically across the EU. Each of these important legislative provisions should shortly be finalized and will then become law in the EU.

Regulatory Updates

European Parliament Adopts the AI Act. On March 13, 2024, the Members of the European Parliament formally adopted the Artificial Intelligence Act (AI Act). Following a lengthy negotiation period since the initial proposal by the European Commission in April 2021, the legislative process for the world's first binding law on AI is nearing its conclusion. For further details on the negotiations surrounding the text of the AI Act, see our January 2023 Advisory.

There are several provisions of the AI Act that are worth mentioning; in particular:

The legislation extends its jurisdiction broadly, applying to AI systems operating within the EU and to AI systems outside the EU whose output is introduced into the EU market. Therefore, companies at every stage of the AI development process must carefully monitor the AI Act's provisions, irrespective of where they are located geographically. The AI Act now awaits formal adoption by the Council of the EU, expected to take place in April, before it can become law.

DHSC and MHRA Accept Recommendations to Tackle Biases in Medical Devices. On March 11, 2024, the UK government's Department of Health and Social Care ( DHSC) and Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency ( MHRA) set out their planned measures to address racial, ethnic, and other biases in the design and use of medical devices. The measures are in response to an independent report on ""equity in medical devices,"" which was commissioned by DHSC over concerns that pulse oximeters were not as accurate for patients with darker skin tones. The report made 18 recommendations in order to tackle potential bias, which the DHSC and MHRA have fully accepted. The MHRA will now request that applicants describe how bias will be addressed in applications for approvals of medical devices and will publish strengthened guidance for developers on how to improve diversity in the development and testing stages. The DHSC will also support work to remove racial bias in data used in clinical studies and improve the transparency of data used in the development of medical devices using AI.

Second Reading of Private Members' Bill in the UK's House of Lords on the Topic of AI Regulation. On March 22, 2024, a Private Members' bill, called the Artificial Intelligence (Regulation) Bill, had its second reading in the House of Lords. The bill was first introduced in the House of Lords on November 23, 2023. The main purpose of the bill is to establish a central AI authority to coordinate and monitor the regulatory approach to AI, while promoting transparency, reducing bias, and balancing regulatory burden against risk. Although the bill largely tracks the government's white paper setting out the government's pro-innovation approach to the regulation of AI, it seeks to introduce the provisions into law. In contrast, and as set out in previous digests, it is currently not the government's intention to introduce AI-specific legislation, but it instead intends to develop a set of core principles for regulating AI while leaving regulatory authorities, like the MHRA, discretion over how the principles apply in their respective sectors. A briefing report, published on March 18, 2024, describes the bill in more detail and a full debate was held on March 22, 2024. The bill will now move to the committee stage in the House of Lords where the bill will be scrutinized line by line. It will then proceed through a number of additional stages within the House of Lords, prior to repeating the process within the House of Commons. Only a minority of Private Members' bills become legislation, and it is unlikely that this will become law given the government's position. Even so, it is clear there is a growing debate in the UK about whether the government's proposed approach to AI is correct.

Privacy Updates

Council and European Parliament Reach Provisional Agreement on the EHDS. On March 15, 2024, the Council of the EU and the EP reached a provisional agreement on the regulation creating an EHDS. The regulation aims to improve access to health data electronically across the EU. It is important to note that the text of the agreement has not yet been published and that this summary is solely based on press releases from March 15, 2024 and March 22, 2024. More details on the provisional agreement are included in our March 2024 blog. The agreement now needs to be formally adopted by the Council of the EU and the EP before it can become law.

Key elements of the agreement that are worth mentioning include:

DARWIN EU Calls for New Data Partners To Add to Its Network. On March 6, 2024, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) announced that the Data Analysis and Real World Interrogation Network (DARWIN EU) will expand and is looking for 10 new data partners to add in 2024. DARWIN EU is a coordination center created by the EMA and the European Medicines Regulatory Network to provide timely and reliable real-world evidence (RWE) on the use, safety, and effectiveness of medicines for human use from real world health care databases across the EU. The results of the studies carried out are made public in the new Heads of Medicines Agency-European Medicines Agency Catalogue of RWD studies. DARWIN EU obtains anonymized patient data from data partners, who generate RWE from sources such as hospitals, primary care, health insurance, registries, and biobanks to support regulatory activities of EMA's scientific committees and national regulators in the EU. At the moment, DARWIN EU's data partners include 20 public or private institutions from 13 European countries. The call to become a data partner is open to any data custodian in Europe and is a continuously open call until the end of 2024. However, applications will be reviewed and selected twice a year; applications received on or before April 30 and October 31, 2024 will be considered.

Reimbursement Updates

Flash Glucose Monitoring Systems Can Now Be Prescribed and Reimbursed in an Italian Region. The Italian Lombardy Region has adopted Resolution No. XII/1827 introducing a new regional eligibility criteria allowing Flash Glucose Monitoring Systems to be prescribed and reimbursed. The Flash Glucose Monitoring Systems are recommended in the resolution for patients with decompensated and non-decompensated type 1 diabetes mellitus and subjects with non-decompensated type 1 diabetes mellitus; patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus on basal insulin therapy and, for a limited period of three months, patients with type 2 diabetes receiving oral hypoglycemic therapy. It is the first time that glucose monitoring devices are reimbursed in Europe for type 2 diabetic patients on oral hypoglycemic therapy. Flash Glucose Monitoring Systems allow diabetic patients to self-monitor their health status.

Product Liability Updates

Revised EU Product Liability Directive One Step Closer To Becoming Law. On March 12, 2024, the EP formally adopted the revised Product Liability Directive (PLD). The Council of the EU is now expected to do the same without further amendments, after which the PLD will be published and will enter into force. This follows the provisional trialogue agreement reached on December 14, 2023 between the European Commission, EP, and Council (discussed in our January 2024 digest). The revised PLD makes several important changes to the existing EU product liability regime. For example, software and AI technologies will now fall within the scope of a product, there will be disclosure obligations on manufacturers, and the burden of proof for claimants has been alleviated through the introduction of several rebuttable presumptions. The EU Member States will have 24 months to transpose the measures into national law from the date the revised PLD enters into force.

Getty Images v. Stability AI: Getty Files Its Reply to Stability AI's Defense. As we reported in our January 2023 digest, there is a significant ongoing case between Getty Images and Stability AI in the UK High Court testing the boundaries of copyright infringement. In particular, whether the use of a dataset obtained by the scraping of millions of images from websites owned by Getty Images (which also included images from a number of other well-known sources, including Pinterest, Flickr, Wikimedia, and Tumblr) to train Stability AI's text-to-image generator, Stable Diffusion, amounts to copyright infringement in the UK. Getty Images also claims that the output produced by Stable Diffusion reproduces a substantial part of Getty Images' copyrighted works, amounting to a separate act of copyright infringement. There are also claims of database right infringement and trademark infringement, which we do not discuss further in this update.

In the latest pleading filed by Getty Images on March 28, 2024, Getty Images disputes Stability AI's allegation that there is a separate database and, instead, it asserts that the calculations described in Stability AI's defense are part of the AI model itself. Getty Images maintains that, to generate synthetic images, an AI model must learn from images contained within the datasets on which it is trained. In relation to the output generated by Stability AI, Getty Images argues that Stability AI has a high degree of control over the features of Stable Diffusion and that it has failed to design the model so as to prevent it from generating synthetic image outputs which comprise a reproduction of a substantial part of the input image and which therefore infringe Getty Images' copyright. Getty Images also intends to rely on indirect and/or ""subconscious"" copying arising from the fact that Stable Diffusion was trained on the copyrighted images.

The projects will allow electricity transmission from offshore wind farms to onshore connection points.

Under the global framework agreements, RWE has contracted Hitachi Energy and Aibel in a split contract model. The onshore construction work will be contracted during the development phase of the projects by RWE. The agreement includes the supply of HVDC systems and construction of the actual platforms. Hitachi Energy will supply its voltage source converter (VSC) systems, to convert alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC) for efficient long-distance transmission to shore, where it will be converted back to AC for the grid.

The Freeport East region, based around the ports of Felixstowe and Harwich, is a major UK transport hub. Decarbonisation of transport can enhance the Freeport's future competitive position and attract new investment in green transport technologies and resources.

A Green Transport Hub Strategy will allow the Freeport to position itself as a UK and international leader in transport decarbonisation. Freeport East is already well placed to pursue this strategy through the UK Government's energy transition plans which:

The Freeport East region can leverage its existing position as a major UK transport hub with the energy transition to become a major UK and international 'Green Transport Hub'. This is a valuable opportunity that should deliver major benefits to both local and national economies.

But to achieve this goal, sufficient low-cost renewable energy supplies and associated networks must be available, plus a green fuel production, supply and storage chain. This will require significant investment and must be cost-competitive in a highly competitive trade and transport marketplace. Also, the evolution to a 'Green Transport Hub' must be coordinated with other energy transition measures for power, heat, and transport across the region.

The report identifies four strategic themes key to achieve the 'Green Transport Hub' vision for Freeport East.

Dr Nina Skorupska CBE, CEO, REA (Association for Renewable Energy and Clean Technology) said:

""At a time when decarbonisation must move faster and across more sectors of our economy than ever before, it is fantastic to see an industry-leading coalition like Freeport East committing to the objective of becoming a Green Transport Hub.

The REA looks forward to working with stakeholders across industry and government to ensure the recommendations in the report are followed in full, and Freeport East's Green Transport Hub vision is realised.""

Steve Beel, Chief Executive, Freeport East, said:

""Decarbonising transport brings significant opportunities for inward investment; offering new jobs and skills as well as reducing the volatility and cost of our transport fuels. Freeport East, with significant transport flows across rail, road and sea, is a natural hub for the economies of scale required to support decarbonisation.

However, achieving this element of the energy transition will require significant investment in our grid network and renewable power supplies. This independent report provides a valuable basis for ensuring we deliver the power infrastructure across Freeport East that will drive the transition to large-scale electrification and cleaner fuels across our transport system.""

Jeremy Smith, Head of Hydrogen Business Development, RWE, said:

""As an organisation with big ambition to produce green hydrogen in the UK, we recognise the potential opportunities in the Freeport East region and we are keen to understand and work through the challenges.""

Tom Williams, Deputy CEO at Maritime Transport, said:

""It is essential that additional electrical power and alternative fuels are made available in in the Felixstowe area. Over the next 5 years Maritime will be operating at least 48 battery electric and hydrogen fuel cell trucks as part of the Innovate UK/Department for Transport ZEHID trials as we move towards net zero.""

RWE has signed Framework Agreements with Hitachi Energy and Aibel for the joint supply of three high-voltage direct current (HVDC) systems for RWE offshore wind farms.

The long-term agreements relate to secured HVDC systems are designated for offshore wind projects from RWE's global development pipeline, which are to be connected to the grid at the beginning of the next decade.

A signing ceremony held in Hamburg, Germany celebrated the partnership between the three companies.

HVDC systems allow electricity transmission from offshore wind farms to onshore connection points.

The agreements include the supply of HVDC systems and construction of the actual platforms.

The onshore construction work will be contracted during the development phase of the projects.

Hitachi Energy will supply its voltage source converter (VSC) systems to convert alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC) for efficient long-distance transmission to shore, where it will be converted back to AC for the grid.

Aibel will be responsible for the Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) on the design, construction, and commissioning of the offshore platforms.

Sven Utermöhlen, chief executive for RWE Offshore Wind, said: ""The deployment of offshore wind is crucial to reach climate protection targets.

""As RWE, we continue to drive forward the expansion of offshore wind energy in Europe and worldwide, because we believe in its long-term fundamentals.

""Through our partnership with Hitachi Energy and Aibel, we are able to secure early the necessary engineering and production capacity for three major HVDC systems to ensure future offshore wind farms can be integrated into the grid.

""Given the challenging market situation, this type of agreement is exactly what we need to succeed.""

The framework agreements allow Hitachi Energy and Aibel to manage the resources required to deliver the three HVDC systems, such as securing the supply chain, hiring workforce, allocating engineering and manufacturing capacity and ordering materials ahead of time.

The agreements provide RWE with the potential to procure additional HVDC systems for future offshore wind projects worldwide.

Niklas Persson, managing director at Hitachi Energy's Grid Integration business, said: ""We're pleased to have been selected by RWE in this agreement to allow countries to achieve their carbon neutrality goals.

""The energy transition requires us to deploy innovative solutions at scale and speed.

""This new business model reflects our strategic shift to becoming more of a partner to support our customers in their effort to strengthen the power grids for the integration of increased clean renewables into the energy system.""

Mads Andersen, president and chief executive at Aibel, added: ""The agreement with RWE confirms that we have a competitive concept developed in collaboration with Hitachi Energy, and a reliable common delivery model with a balanced risk-reward profile.",renews.biz,news,Renews,,0.3411764705882352,452853060,30,https://renews.biz/media/31552/nordsee-windpark-kaskasi_foto-rwe.jpg?width=640,eng-9546167

Paul Tuohy recalled with a laugh.

The popularity of the board sport, and awareness of it, has boomed in the intervening years.

There are now over 60 surf schools in Ireland, but when the Tuohys started surf schools weren't the business they are today.

There has been Irish surfing in various guises dating back to the 1960s, when Kevin Cavey founded Bray Ireland Surf Club and started building his own wooden surf boards after seeing a photo of Hawaiian surfers in a copy of Reader's Digest.

Tramore, with its long beach break, was a natural draw for Ireland's niche community of surfers from the early days of the sport, holding the very first Irish National Surfing Championships in 1967, the same year that South Coast Surf Club, now T-Bay Surf Club, was founded in the Co Waterford resort town.

But the idea of dedicated surfing schools, as opposed to surf clubs, had not really been developed in Ireland by the 1990s.

Although there were places renting boards or offering surfing as part of other watersports activities, Linda and Paul's school, Oceanics, was the first such dedicated surf school in the country.

Oceanics was founded by Linda, who had worked in the ill-fated Celtworld tourist attraction and had gone back to education to do a business course when it went under in 1995.

Both keen surfers themselves, and both having grown up in Tramore, Paul and Linda were impressed by the more advanced surfing culture, and the proliferation of surf schools they had encountered on a road trip that they had gone on in a souped-up van some years earlier.

""Both of us had surfed for years and we went off on this trip when we were between jobs, literally in a panelled van decked out inside, parking up on the side of the road, for nearly six months,"" Paul said.

""It was great, and we saw the growth of surfing abroad. The idea was born over a bottle of wine, as you do. Linda's original idea was to open a fantasy and sci-fi bookshop in Waterford city, but eventually she went for the surf school. We had seen thriving surf schools in France and Spain and England, and there weren't any in Ireland at the time.""

Paul was managing tourist accommodation. The couple had bought a cottage some 200 metres from the surf in Riverstown, but were renting it and living in the accommodation that came as part of Paul's job. They decided to convert their cottage into a surf school.

""We had 10 boards, 20 wetsuits, and a shed out the back,"" Paul said. ""From there, it grew. We attached other offerings like beach discovery hikes and rockpool experiences, and then we started into school tours.""

Almost 30 years on, Oceanics has expanded its title to Oceanics Surf School and Marine Education Centre. In conjunction with the Marine Institute (MaREI), they do schools outreach programmes in marine education in the winter months. Each year, Paul estimates that between 3,500 and 4,000 children and young people attend their surf camps, school tours and lessons.

It's arguable that up until the past decade, when Tramore started becoming a satellite town for families working in Waterford city, almost everyone in the coastal town made their living either directly or indirectly from the sea; even the fact that Paul grew up in the town was due to tourism in the coastal resort.

His father had been a manager at Butlin's in Mosney, and moved to Tramore to work for Tramore Fáilte. Paul took up surfing when he did a lifeguarding course at 17.

""I was never a team sports player. I always had two left feet and would be last being chosen for a team,"" he said.

""With surfing, there was nobody shouting at you, it was a totally independent sport. As I always say to people here, the best surfer out there is always the one with the biggest smile on their face. You don't have to be a shredder and a ripper; it's a fun and all-inclusive kind of thing.""

Challenges

Surfing has a reputation as the most chilled out of sports, but running a surf school isn't all hanging out in flip flops and board shorts working on your tan, by any means.

There is equipment to maintain, insurance to cover, and an increasing number of competitors in the market -- with Ireland so small, Paul says the presence of popular surf schools all along the west coast of Ireland impacts on where tourists choose to spend their adventure holidays.

""Don't get me started on the Wild Atlantic Way,"" he said. ""I never understood why it started in Kinsale and went to Donegal. I was like, hello, we're on the Atlantic here too!""

But wave conditions vary hugely at different surfing spots and Tramore's beach break is, Paul says, ""a perfect beginner's wave"".

Another challenge for surf schools in the South East this year is a shortage of qualified instructors. And with water safety a huge consideration for surf schools, qualifications are a vital pre-requisite, Paul explains.

""To be an Irish Surfing Association (ISA) approved school, all your instructors must be qualified. You have to do your own surf coaching, and then a beach lifeguard qualification. Then there's child protection and garda vetting. All that has to be done before you even step through the door of a surf school,"" he said.

With a maximum of eight students to one instructor, Oceanics would usually have five instructors working in the summer months. There are three other surf schools in Tramore, one in nearby Bunmahon on the Copper Coast and one in Ardmore.

""The local education and training board generally run an instructors' course each year, but this year they didn't have the uptake for it. We would generally have a new batch of instructors available by now, so at this stage, everyone is scratching for instructors.""

The Irish weather is a huge factor for Oceanics. Temperature has the biggest impact, Paul explains -- while the summer months mean more people willing to take the plunge, the most surfable waves don't necessarily come with balmy summer days. So Oceanics try to run as long a season as possible, only stopping when cold becomes a factor.

""We started camps in early March this year,"" he said. ""Even though it was very wet, it wasn't that cold. We will run until mid-November with the surfing end of it. It gets to a situation where it just becomes too cold: when no-one's enjoying it, there´s not much point. Last year we ran until the December 10 so we nearly had a full year.""

Marine conservation

Their partnership with the Marine Institute, running marine education outreach programmes in schools, gives the business welcome off-season work.

""We go into schools and put in saltwater aquariums for projects on marine life like squid, turtles and sharks, and we mostly do that in winter. That works really well because it keeps us tipping away for the winter, when most other schools shut down,"" he said.

Internationally, surfers have a reputation as passionate custodians of marine environments.

Over the past 30 years, the UK-based Surfers Against Sewage has become a marine conservation charity to be reckoned with, advocating for better water quality, campaigning against plastic waste, and raising awareness about marine environments.

To Paul, who is also a longstanding volunteer with the RNLI in Tramore, this makes perfect sense -- surfers are in the water, love their time in the sea, and are on the front line when it comes to noticing environmental threats.

Bucking the trend somewhat when it comes to fears for water quality in Ireland, Paul says sewage conditions on Tramore's 5km beach have actually improved since Oceanics was founded in the 90s.

""The pipeline on the beach opposite the old toilet block was an overflow pipe, and there was another pipe that was pumping stuff out: there was no treatment, it was literally just churned up into a mush and pumped out,"" he said.

""Everything would be fine until a day like today with a south-easterly wind, and everything would come back in. You could literally just be standing in untreated sewage. There were occasions where we actually just pulled our groups out.""

Working in schools, Oceanics now find a much higher level of marine awareness amongst children, a cause for optimism for the future. The boom in sea swimming that came with covid lockdowns has also meant that more people are tuned in to issues like ocean plastics, Paul feels.

""There's a background increase in ocean knowledge all the time,"" he said.

""Now, you'll see 20 or 30 people down there swimming in February. A lot more people are getting in the water and there's a lot more respect and awareness of the dangers of the water, and what can go wrong.

""There´s a lot more awareness of the environment as well. We notice in schools that kids are way more tuned in. 10 years ago, kids wouldn't have even known where the Pacific Ocean was, let alone that there is a giant garbage patch floating in it.""

Surfing's future in Tramore

When it comes to the future of surfing in Tramore, Paul is not without concerns.

Since 2018, energy companies have proposed 14 separate offshore wind farm projects off the Waterford coast. Three overlapping offshore exploration licences for 10kms off the coast of Tramore have been applied for by the ESB, Energia and RWE Renewables Ireland.

Local campaign group Blue Horizon are calling for the Irish government to ensure all offshore wind farms are on floating platforms over 22kms from the shoreline, which would add to construction costs for energy companies, but Blue Horizon argue it will protect wildlife migratory routes, coastal livelihoods, and the visual amenity of the shoreline.

Surfing is a livelihood that depends on the quality of waves. Paul says this is a rarely considered factor in the discussion around the need to transition to renewable energy.

""We have submitted a question about the wind farms. Firstly, what will they do to marine life and secondly, what will they do to the swell? If those things are going to be anchored to the sea bed, will they create silting? In 20 years' time, are we going to have a flat bay with no waves coming through at all?

""Planners in Dublin will look at the bottom line, and at our green credentials in Europe, but not necessarily at local interests. I would be very wary as a result. I'd want to be very, very convinced that there were not going to be impacts before making a decision to support those plans.""

A family affair

These days, Linda has stepped back from the surf school to focus on her work in alternative therapies, but the business has blossomed into a family affair, with both the couple's children, Jai and Raya, working seasonally at Oceanics.

""I came into the business after Linda,"" Paul said. ""For Jai, this is what he seems to want to do. Raya is only 22 and is just finishing college, so she might want to do some travelling. But it is a totally family business.

""And it's a pretty good quality of life. You come in in the morning, have a coffee, then the kids arrive and you go out on the water, have fun with the kids, come back; if you like the outdoors, it's great because you're in and out of the water all day.""

With the days getting longer and a whole summer season of learners struggling to master the art of catching waves and avoiding wipeouts, Paul says there's one thing to be looked forward to the most: fun.

""Our ethos is about fun, rather than training kids to be surfers of a certain level. It's all about having the craic, big smiles, and learning to love and respect the sea by spending time in it.""",irishexaminer.com,news,Irish Examiner,Ellie O'Byrne,0.388235294117647,452819809,1,https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/8206/4103302_5_articlelarge_dan_surf_1.jpg,

The alliance of 30 companies includes blue-chip groups like BMW, Volkswagen, Siemens, BASF and Deutsche Bank, as well as family-owned businesses and startups.

""Exclusion, extremism and populism pose threats to Germany as a business location and to our prosperity,"" said the alliance in a statement.

""In their first joint campaign, the companies are calling on their combined 1.7 million employees to take part in the upcoming European elections and engaging in numerous activities to highlight the importance of European unity for prosperity, growth and jobs,"" it added.

The unusual action by the industrial giants came as the latest opinion polls show the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party obtaining about 15% of the EU vote next month in Germany. The party is tied in second place with the Greens after the conservative CDU-CSU alliance.

A series of recent scandals, including the arrest of a researcher working for an AfD member of parliament, have slid the party's popularity since the turn of the year, even though it remains just ahead of Chancellor Olaf Scholz's Social Democrats.

The list of participants also includes multinational companies such as Bosch, Mercedes, Bayer, Deutsche Bahn and RWE. The German Trade Union Confederation and the Federation of German Industries are also involved.

Already struggling with severe shortages in skilled workers, many German enterprises fear gains by the far right could further erode the attractiveness of Europe's biggest economy to migrant labor.

The alliance estimates that fast-aging Germany currently already has 1.73 million unfilled positions, while an additional 200,000 to 400,000 workers would be necessary annually in coming years.

Wolf-Dieter Adlhoch, chief executive of the Dussmann Group, noted that 68,000 people from over 100 nations work in the family business.

""For many of them, their work with us, for example, in cleaning buildings or geriatric care, is their entry into the primary labor market and, therefore, the key to successful integration. Hate and exclusion have no place here,"" he said.

""Our alliance stands for respect, tolerance, openness and diversity. Extremists and racists question these values and at the same time offer seemingly simple solutions to the complex problems of our time,"" said Siemens chief executive Roland Busch.

""In doing so, they are dividing our society and threatening our future.""

The initiative did not initially specify to whom or to which parties the statements on populism, right-wing extremism and hatred referred.

The elections to the European Parliament will take place across the 27 EU member states on June 6-9.

Siemens Energy CEO Christian Bruch warned that ""isolationism, extremism and xenophobia are poison for German exports and jobs here in Germany - we must, therefore, not give space to the fearmongers and fall for their supposedly simple solutions.""

The alliance said it plans a social media campaign to emphasize the need to fight extremism and urged other companies to join its initiative.

It added that the campaign will continue after the EU elections, with three eastern German states to vote for regional parliaments in September.

In all three - Brandenburg, Thuringia and Saxony - the far-right AfD party is leading surveys.

The head of Deutsche Bank, Christian Sewing, said: ""Even investors, who value Germany precisely because of our strong democratic values, are looking at the developments with concern and are hesitant to invest.""

BMW's chief executive, Oliver Zipse, emphasized the importance of Europe for his company. ""Our success also depends very much on trade relations within the European Union,"" he said.",dailysabah.com,news,Daily Sabah,,0.2313725490196079,452781406,1,https://idsb.tmgrup.com.tr/ly/uploads/images/2024/05/07/thumbs/800x531/326755.jpg,eng-9545857

A fresh breeze is blowing in Jüchen: The new wind farm on the A 44n motorway is now feeding climate-neutral electricity into the grid. The six wind turbines with a total output of 27 megawatts produce green electricity for around 26,000 households - more than the total number in Jüchen itself. RWE, the municipality of Jüchen and energy supplier NEW will jointly operate the wind farm in future.

Harald Zillikens, Mayor of Jüchen: ""The goal of all the project partners has been achieved: the rotors are turning and the wind farm is generating green electricity. I would like to express my sincere thanks to everyone who ensured the dismantling and new construction work proceeded safely. I am delighted that our town is contributing to the energy transition and supplying its citizens with electricity, as well as benefiting from the participation model.""

Michael Theisejans, Managing Director of NEW Re GmbH: ""Green electricity from the region for the region - this guiding principle makes a significant contribution to the success of the energy transition. We need the acceptance of the local people and companies that work together successfully with the neighbouring municipalities. This wind farm is an excellent example of this.""

Agata Schallenberg, Head of the Construction Department for Wind and Solar Farms at RWE in Germany: ""From liaising with the authorities to laying the last cable - all colleagues and partner companies involved have done a great job. The wind farm on recultivated opencast mining land contributes to RWE's goal of consistently expanding the share of renewable energy generation in the Rhenish mining area.""

Rebuilding the wind farm was necessary because structural defects had been discovered in the concrete parts of the hybrid towers of the original wind turbines. The wind farm was therefore rebuilt not only from scratch, but also sustainably: Large parts of the old turbines such as nacelles, hubs and rotor blades could be reused to save resources.

RWE holds 51 per cent of the shares in the cooperative wind farm, with 49 per cent shared between the municipality of Jüchen and NEW.",nsenergybusiness.com,news,NS Business,,0.4431372549019608,452778896,18,https://www.nsenergybusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/2024-05-06-energiewende-im-revier.jpg,

Orcadian Energy (AIM:ORCA) has floated a plan to use its new North Sea gas licence to feed a floating power station connected to offshore wind infrastructure.

""We saw a really good opportunity to put together a completely different development plan for the Earlham discovery than anyone else had previously suggested,"" Orcadian Energy chief executive officer Steve Brown told Energy Voice.

Orcadian received four blocks in the Southern North Sea from the North Sea Transition Agency (NSTA) as part of the latest tranche of licence awards in the 33rd Round.

The licence contains Earlham, an existing discovery, along with an undrilled prospect, Clover.

Talisman and BP both drilled appraisal wells in Earlham in the 90s, with BP's well testing over 30mcf per day of gas production. However, BP found the gas to be unsuitable for production at the time, containing 49% CO2 and 9% N2, leading to the field's abandonment.

""You've only got 42% that's methane, but there's still a lot of methane in this accumulation,"" Brown noted - 114 bcf of methane or 19mn boe by Orcadian's estimates.

""The thing about producing low calorie gas, you need to find a network that will accept low quality gas,"" Brown said. ""You need to come up with a different solution and from our perspective that's what we love.""

To utilise the low-calorie gas, Orcadian's development concept entails using an offshore power station with a capacity of 70-100MW to utilise the gas.

The facility will come with integrated CO2 capture and storage, pumping the gas produced from both production and electricity generation back into the reservoir.

""With Earlham, the idea is actually capture all the CO2 that's coming out of the reservoir and the CO2 that you make by turning it into electricity and reinject that all back into the same reservoir,"" Brown explained.

""That means you need to consume the gas locally and the best way to do that is to have an offshore power station.""

As part of the 33rd licensing round, the NSTA introduced a new clause requiring oil and gas licence winners to work with wind lease holders to develop their projects. The move aimed to increase cooperation between the different ocean users.

Orcadian Energy envisions taking advantage of the infrastructure from the North Sea offshore wind boom by connecting the floating power station to the grid via a wind farm substation,

In particular, RWE's 1.4GW Norfolk Boreas wind farm would be located close to Earlham, providing a high-capacity export cable the project could utilise.

""RWE is putting in place the infrastructure that can carry electricity from the wind farm to the market and we're no distance from where that substation is going to be,"" Brown said.

Crucially, Orcadian's gas-powered facility covers the intermittency problems associated with offshore wind and other renewables.

""With a 1.4GW cable, there will be room for 100MW probably more than 90% of the time,"" Brown said.

""And the only time you wouldn't be able to sell the electricity from this power station is when the wind farm's using all of their capacity in that cable. And when the wind farm's using all of the capacity, the electricity price is going to be negative, so you wouldn't want to use it anyway.""

In addition, the licence also contains Clover, analogous to the nearby Orwell Field. This was decommissioned after producing over 300bcf of gas.

Orcadian estimates that P50 recoverable resources in Clover amount to 153bcf and the geological chance of success at 38%.

""Clover can be a really quite standard gas project,"" Brown said. ""We didn't originally look at this acreage for Clover, but when we'd identified the Earlham discovery as something we wanted to target, we looked at the seismic around it and realised there was a nice prospect in the north of the area.""

Orcadian Energy's licensing of the project is the first time in around 50 years that a developer has had the whole prospect under one licence. A lack of adequate seismic data meant that the Clover reservoir went undetected.

Brown noted that the field could be connected to the Earlham project, or developed as a conventional gas field.

""The existing infrastructure is being decommissioned, so you'd probably have to tie it back a little bit further than you would otherwise have had to, but it could be a simple, straightforward scheme,"" he said.

""It's something that will be attractive to a good number of companies that want to be active in the gas basin.""

Since oil companies have already done appraisal work on Earlham, it is further along in its development than fresh, untested prospects.

""It's very rare that you make a discovery and can go straight to a development decision,"" Brown said about the field. ""But there's no reason that we couldn't put together a field development plan for this within the next 12 to 24 months.

He added that Orcadian Energy will first focus on acquiring seismic data to better understand subsea conditions.

""Then we'll be looking for partners to come in to actually fund the development,"" he said. ""We'd be keen to find a partner who'd come in fund the development and carry us to first gas.

""We think it's going to be a really attractive project for some of the majors that are looking at getting into big CO2 capture schemes and big power station schemes because there's a lot to learn by doing a smaller project first.

""We're really excited about this project because we think it's a little bit like a microcosm of the whole transition - from an entirely fossil fuel-based energy system to one where you're working to deliver the total energy in as clean a way and as low cost away as possible.""",energyvoice.com,news,Energy Voice,Michael Behr,0.2392156862745098,452757856,5,https://www.energyvoice.com/energyvoice/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/04/shutterstock_1153608010.jpg,eng-9536087

The site is where power generated by the Hornsea Three wind farm, due to be constructed off the Norfolk coast, will be converted to be fed into the National Grid having been brought to shore along cables laid in a 35-mile-long trench across Norfolk.

The Planning Inspectorate granted permission for the converter station in 2020,

Luke Bridgman, managing director of Ørsted's Hornsea 3 Wind Farm said: ""Progress remains on track both for laying our cables onshore, and on our onshore converter station, which will eventually supply green energy to the UK.

""The steelworks started to go up in March - marking the first infrastructure works above ground.

""The steelworks house the heart of the system to convert the power from AC to DC and then on to the National Grid.

""The ponds that can be seen in the image are used to manage water during heavy rains - surface water is pumped into the ponds.

""Onshore works are due to be completed mid-2026.

""In parallel, we've started environmental surveys for our work offshore and will soon start initial works at the area where the offshore cables will come onshore.""

Wind farms are being built off the Norfolk coast

The Hornsea 3 scheme is one of a number of offshore wind farms planned off the county's coast.

Permission to double the capacity of Equinor's Sheringham Shoal and Dudgeon wind farms was granted last month.

In December, Swedish energy giant Vattenfall sold its rights to develop three wind farms - Norfolk Boreas, Norfolk Vanguard West and Norfolk Vanguard East - to German-based RWE.

Luke Bridgman, managing director of Ørsted's Hornsea 3 Wind Farm said: ""Progress remains on track both for laying our cables onshore, and on our onshore converter station, which will eventually supply green energy to the UK.

""The steelworks started to go up in March - marking the first infrastructure works above ground.

""The steelworks house the heart of the system to convert the power from AC to DC and then on to the National Grid.

""The ponds that can be seen in the image are used to manage water during heavy rains - surface water is pumped into the ponds.

""Onshore works are due to be completed mid-2026.

""In parallel, we've started environmental surveys for our work offshore and will soon start initial works at the area where the offshore cables will come onshore.""

Wind farms are being built off the Norfolk coast

The Hornsea 3 scheme is one of a number of offshore wind farms planned off the county's coast.

Permission to double the capacity of Equinor's Sheringham Shoal and Dudgeon wind farms was granted last month.

In December, Swedish energy giant Vattenfall sold its rights to develop three wind farms - Norfolk Boreas, Norfolk Vanguard West and Norfolk Vanguard East - to German-based RWE.

But plans for miles of pylons across the Norfolk and Suffolk countryside to take offshore power to the south-east of the country have sparked controversy.

National Grid is carrying out consultation over updated plans for the 114-mile Norwich to Tilbury power line.

Pharmacies can use the commercial services offered by a contract commercial organisation (CCO) to increase efficiency, reduce risk, and speed up patient access to medical innovations. One of the main services offered by CCOs is strategic consulting.

Other important services include market access (including RWE and HEOR), regulatory and compliance, medical affairs, pricing and reimbursement, and other services (data and analytics, and marketing services - HCP engagement, promotional strategies, patient engagement). The pharmaceutical industry's expanding complexity, the necessity to expand globally, and the desire to gain specialized expertise in fields like market access and regulatory compliance are just a few of the drivers driving the CCO market's expansion.

In addition, when pharmaceutical companies broaden their reach internationally, they frequently lack the local knowledge required to negotiate various needs, especially those with different regulatory frameworks and healthcare systems. The solution provided by CCO providers allows for easier market entry and growth by offering global capabilities and insights into regional nuances.

List of Prominent Players in the Pharma Contract Commercialization (CCO) Market:

EVERSANA IQVIA Certara Indegene Syneos Health Lucid Group Genesis Research Fishawack Health Cheors Peregrine Real Chemistry Other

Market Dynamics:

Drivers-

A significant factor in the uptake of CCO services is cost-effectiveness as well. Pharmaceutical businesses can save money by offloading the commercialization tasks to specialist service providers, eliminating the need to keep big internal sales and marketing teams.

Without the fixed costs of permanent personnel, they can scale their commercial efforts up or down according to the market's needs.

Additionally, the demand for CCO services is rising as data analytics and digital marketing gain prominence in the pharmaceutical sector.

These providers frequently possess cutting-edge equipment and know-how in utilizing data-driven insights and digital channels to better connect with healthcare professionals and patients.

Challenges:

Even though the pharma contract commercialization (CCO) sector is expanding significantly, there are still a number of significant obstacles to overcome. The complex regulatory framework that the pharmaceutical industry is subject to is a major constraint.

Operations for CCOs are made more complicated and expensive by compliance with strict national and international rules. The CCO market's competitive environment is also a constraint.

Competition grows as more service providers enter the market, thereby creating pressure on prices and necessitating the need for uniqueness through creative service offerings.

Regional Trends:

The North American pharma contract commercialization (CCO) market is expected to register a significant market share in terms of revenue and is projected to develop at a high CAGR in the near future. Including R&D efforts, North America is a centre for pharmaceutical innovation.

CCO service providers in the area frequently work closely with pharmaceutical firms to help bring novel treatments and products to market. A large number of pharmaceutical companies, both large and small, are also centred in the United States, as is a thriving biotechnology sector.

These companies usually look for CCO partners to contract out various commercialization tasks, from sales and marketing to distribution.

Furthermore, the factors above are projected to fuel a large increase in the Asia-Pacific Pharma CCO market over the next few years. As more businesses enter the market and established companies broaden their service offerings, the industry is also anticipated to become more competitive.

In addition, the country's vast and expanding population, rising frequency of chronic diseases, and increasing disposable incomes are all likely to contribute to the Chinese market's continued strong growth in the years to come.

The study is focused on exploring the potential benefits of integrating LNG regasification and CO2 liquefaction processes at Dragon LNG terminal facilities, the company said in a news release, adding that the benefits not only impact the Dragon site but also other industry companies in Haven, Pembrokeshire.

If feasible, the technology at Dragon would support wider collaboration with RWE Pembroke Net Zero Centre (PNZC), whose CO2 would be transported to the Dragon facility for processing before being shipped via non-pipeline transport (NPT) to carbon sequestration sites, according to the release.

Worley will evaluate various technical approaches to seamlessly integrate LNG and CO2 liquefaction processes for optimal energy efficiency and effectiveness. The study will assess how the integration of processes can contribute to lowering the carbon intensity of operations, aligning with broader environmental goals.

The six wind turbines produce green electricity for around 26,000 households - more than the city of Jüchen has itself.

RWE, the city of Jüchen and the energy supplier NEW will jointly operate the wind farm in the future.

Michael Theisejans, managing director of NEW Re, said: ""Green electricity from the region for the region - this guiding principle makes a significant contribution to the success of the energy transition.

""We need the acceptance of local people and companies that work successfully with the surrounding communities.

Agata Schallenberg, head of RWE's construction department for wind and solar parks in Germany, added: ""From the exchange with the authorities to the laying of the last cable - all colleagues and partner companies involved have done a great job.

""The wind farm on recultivated opencast mining areas contributes to RWE's goal of consistently expanding the share of renewable energy generation in the Rhenish mining area.""

The construction of the new wind farm was necessary because the concrete parts of the hybrid towers of the original wind turbines had been found to have structural defects, RWE said.

The wind farm was not only built from scratch, but also sustainably: large parts of the old turbines, such as nacelles, hubs and rotor blades, could be reused in a resource-saving manner, it added.",renews.biz,news,Renews,,0.3333333333333333,452697297,18,https://renews.biz/media/31594/wp-juechen-4871-2.jpeg?width=640,

As investors look forward to this upcoming payment, the spotlight also shines on the company's dividend history, yield, and growth rates. Using the data from GuruFocus, let's look into RWE AG's dividend performance and assess its sustainability.

Since the deal with E.On, RWE is refocused on power generation, mostly in Europe. It owns 38 gigawatts of power generation capacity: 28% from lignite and hard coal plants, 37% from gas plants, 40% from renewables including pumped storage and batteries. Besides Germany, RWE's power plants are chiefly located in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Turkey, and the United States for many onshore wind farms.

RWE AG has maintained a consistent dividend payment record since 2018. Dividends are currently distributed on a yearly basis. Below is a chart showing annual Dividends Per Share for tracking historical trends.

As of today, RWE AG currently has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 2.73% and a 12-month forward dividend yield of 3.00%. This suggests an expectation of increased dividend payments over the next 12 months.

Over the past three years, RWE AG's annual dividend growth rate was 4.00%. Extended to a five-year horizon, this rate increased to 11.30% per year. Based on RWE AG's dividend yield and five-year growth rate, the 5-year yield on cost of RWE AG stock as of today is approximately 4.66%.

To assess the sustainability of the dividend, one needs to evaluate the company's payout ratio. The dividend payout ratio provides insights into the portion of earnings the company distributes as dividends. A lower ratio suggests that the company retains a significant part of its earnings, thereby ensuring the availability of funds for future growth and unexpected downturns. As of 2023-12-31, RWE AG's dividend payout ratio is 0.47.

RWE AG's profitability rank, offers an understanding of the company's earnings prowess relative to its peers. GuruFocus ranks RWE AG's profitability 6 out of 10 as of 2023-12-31, suggesting fair profitability. The company has reported net profit in 8 years out of past 10 years.

To ensure the sustainability of dividends, a company must have robust growth metrics. RWE AG's growth rank of 6 out of 10 suggests that the company has a fair growth outlook.

Revenue is the lifeblood of any company, and RWE AG's revenue per share, combined with the 3-year revenue growth rate, indicates a strong revenue model. RWE AG's revenue has increased by approximately 21.40% per year on average, a rate that outperforms approximately 83.7% of global competitors.

The company's 3-year EPS growth rate showcases its capability to grow its earnings, a critical component for sustaining dividends in the long run. During the past three years, RWE AG's earnings increased by approximately -9.90% per year on average, a rate that outperforms approximately 23.2% of global competitors.

Considering RWE AG's consistent dividend payments, robust dividend growth rate, manageable payout ratio, and solid profitability and growth metrics, the company appears well-positioned to sustain its dividend payouts. This makes RWE AG an attractive option for value investors seeking steady income from dividends.

And RWE was named Medium to Large Business of the Year, recognising the huge commitments made to the region with skills programmes, vessel purchases and operations and maintenance expansion. Its focus on the future workforce was embraced by many winners, with demand clear.

Long-term operator from Grimsby, Tidal Transit, won the Green Innovation Award, for its pioneering electric crew transfer vessel project, with a full retrofit of a diesel craft. Leo Hambro, commercial director, said: ""I am delighted that after 12 years of working in the Humber, we are now creating a change that will not just last for another 12 years, but for generations. It will make a change, not just economically, but environmentally, reducing emissions.

""We are delighted to work out of Humber. The support we have found locally is second to none, the supply chain, the clients we work with directly are so supportive, and we feel like part of the family.""

Turning to requirements, he said: ""We can't do it on our own. We need mariners, there is a lack of them, and for tomorrow there is an even bigger problem. We need to engage with kids at any age to show them there isn't just the opportunity to be a wind engineer, there are opportunities to work at sea, to create a full life career.""

One potential avenue to pursue is the work being done by the industry's ""town centre billboard"" - an inspiring and educational box park. Projekt Renewable Grimsby landed last year. As well as developing an immersive experience within repurposed shipping containers, it is to offer boat trips to near-shore wind farms this summer.

Taking the Engaging the Community Award, director Richard Askam, said: ""The thing that made me the most pleased was that everyone in the room now knows a little bit more about Projekt Renewable. Projekt Renewable is for everybody in that room so it is a nice symbiosis of what is needed. Alongside the innovation and investment, we need communication; to get kids to understand what it is they all do. Then they will take it on.""

A recent £100,000 Crown Estate investment into the project was also flagged. ""It is astonishing when you look at the seniority they have in the industry, and in the UK. It is UK Plc backing this project that happens to be in Grimsby but it is a UK problem of lack of awareness. We hope this will be number one, and The Crown Estate has intimated they want to have several of these around the country and that would be great for everyone.""

Excellence in Renewable Education, Skills and Training went to Hull College, with work on the vital home heating transition highlighted. Robin Makey, assistant principal at Hull College, said: ""It is fantastic recognition for the staff and the learners of the college, and it is a great platform for us from which to continue developing the skills and enabling learners to thrive and go into this wonderful industry which will support our community and our world.

""We have a range of heat pumps installed, the first contained cylinder heat pump in the country, and it is wonderful for us to be able to show retrofitting of domestic appliances for everybody.""

Hull's River Energy and Renewables Ltd was named Small Business of the Year having made major strides with the consultancy. Frank Saunders, head of energy and renewables, said: ""It is excellent to be recognised for the hard work we have done as a small business, and a new entrant into the marketplace. It is testament to the amazing team that we have got, and all our great clients as well.""

Guy Hunter, co-founder and commercial director, added: ""We were traditionally a telecoms company but we moved into the energy space and brought people like Frank in with a wealth of knowledge in the industry and has helped us grow into it. Hopefully we can become a big player in it.""

Offshore Renewable Energy Catapult's 5G Portal - a testbed for the latest technology to be deployed on wind farms, focused around Grimsby and the Lincolnshire Coast - won Best Renewable Energy Project. The living lab brings digital advances to the fore.

Nicola Robinson, business development manager at ORE Catapult, said: ""It is evidence that collaboration really does work. The partners have worked together to create something that benefits so much more than Grimsby alone.""

Katharine York, manager of ORE Catapult's Grimsby-based Operations and Maintenance Centre of Excellence, added: ""It is about having facilities in Grimsby that mean people need and want to come here, the new technology, the things that make offshore wind farms run better and more efficiently, and more safely in future. Having Grimsby on the map with this sort of facility, can really start to do these things.""

Surprise for Humber director named renewables champion

Camilla Carlbom Flinn was overwhelmed to have been named Humber Renewables Champion, having been blindsided by the judging panel she had been part of.

Her sterling work through a huge period of change for the regional group Humber Marine and Renewables - at a time when her own business was bought out - was a key consideration. The intense element of surprise was clear, with comedic magician Ben Hanlin describing it as an 'Ant & Dec' style wind-up.

Camilla said: It is quite overwhelming. This room is overflowing with people who I admire, I look up to and I respect, and to receive this when surrounded by so many amazing companies, amazing people and the future also of this region, with all these wonderful apprentices, it really is a surprise and really is an honour.""

Born in Cleethorpes, she studied international business management and broadcast journalism, with an early media career taking her to Paris, London and New York before she returned to Lincolnshire in 2008. Her father Anthony's passing saw her take the helm of Carlbom Shipping, navigating the business into the burgeoning offshore wind market as a mainstay, coal, entered terminal decline. It was later held up as a key supply chain partner by Orsted - the world leader in the sector.

Camilla went on to take on the roles of honorary consul for Sweden and Finland, chair of the Humber chapter of the Swedish Chamber of Commerce and become a member of the Swedish Council in London, actively promoting business and cultural connections across the North Sea.

Presenting the award, HMR chair Iain Butterworth said: ""Work in renewables preceded her becoming a director, her role has included the successful merger between Team Humber Marine Alliance and Grimsby Renewable Partnership and she consistently supports its mission, members and directors.""

He added that she was ""incredibly supportive"" making ""so many introductions locally, nationally and internationally,"" in his first year in the top role. She has also played a ""significant role"" in a Department for Transport funding bid that ""could mean a lot for the region,"" Mr Butterworth added.

The family ships' agency business, based in Stallingborough, was bought by Pentagon Freight Services in 2022, and she remains as a director.

Orsted's senior stakeholder adviser, Lauren Little, was named Humber Renewables Women of the Year. She was also full of admiration for the talent gathered to celebrate.

Asked how to encourage others into the sector, she said: ""It is ace. Look at all these amazing people I work with in this industry. There is so much opportunity no matter what you want to do, the world is your oyster and I am so privileged to work in it among all these amazing people.""

Grimsby-born, she concluded her university studies with a thesis on the opportunity offshore wind would afford North East Lincolnshire. Now she's written herself into the sector's history.

""I am so delighted,"" she said. ""To write about it, to work in it, and to be nominated, I was so humbled. The town gets a hard time, but it really punches above its weight, it is a centre of expertise and excellence for operations and maintenance, and people need to recognise that. It is the opportunity it brings to children, young people, everybody, and that's what's the best bit about this industry.""

Corrine Barry, RWE's East Coast director for net zero, collected the big company prize. She said: ""It really is fantastic for us to be acknowledged for all the hard work we are putting into the region, and for the community as well. We are absolutely thrilled to win this award.

""We are helping lead the way and blaze a trail with careers, education and skills, and helping people get a great opportunity in a great sector in the region.""

Referring back to Offshore Wind Connections, of which RWE was headline sponsor, Corrine added: ""We want more of what we have seen today. Cross-energy sector engagement and cross-supply chain engagement. Not just offshore wind, but the other energy sectors and opportunities like hydrogen and carbon capture, and other industries too. There is so much opportunity here.""

RWE's Ryah Russell was named Apprentice of the Year too.

The Triton Knoll technician is already a STEM ambassador, mentor to newer apprentices and has returned to her sixth form and spoken to MPs in Westminster. She also recorded a video with the Greater Lincolnshire Local Enterprise Partnership, while having also supported recent recruitment.

She said: ""This means everything. I just wanted to do something to make a difference and develop. It makes me feel good to think what we are doing for the environment.""",business-live.co.uk,news,birminghampost,,0.6235294117647059,452675579,13,https://i2-prod.chroniclelive.co.uk/incoming/article29119117.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GWR_NJL_060524renew01.jpg,

Those were among the themes and conclusions offered by Cynthia Pyc, Director of Permitting & Environment with RWE Offshore Wind Americas, at the recent IPF24 held in New Orleans.

Pyc offered her thoughts and comments at a panel entitled ""Lessons from the Gulf of Mexico: new applications for proven approaches to energy development."" RWE had the lone winning bid in last year's first-ever offshore wind energy lease sale in the Gulf of Mexico, and Pyc noted that her company is also advancing development plans for offshore wind energy in areas off the US east and west coasts.

Pyc noted that even in these early phases of development, there have already been some lessons learned for RWE; and, she added, hopefully for the relevant regulatory officials as well. She noted that RWE is currently in the process of site characterization in its US offshore wind energy projects off New York and California, a process that includes gathering data on geophysical and geotechnical characteristics in these areas. But there have been ""regulatory hiccups"" along the way, Pyc said. She noted that the US Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) had recently put together a biological assessment for site characterization for the Pacific region. ""And they naturally leaned on their East Coast colleagues who are also working in the offshore wind space.""

But Pyc noted that there's a ""a very big difference"" between the East Coast and the West offshore areas, ""and the most obvious one is that the water depths are quite different."" In the Atlantic, she noted the industry is planning to operate in 30 to 50 meters; while off the West Coast, the industry is planning to operate in 800 to 900 meters, ""a depth that is much more analogous to the Gulf of Mexico than it is to the East Coast.""

As a result, Pyc commented, the agency's biological assessment for the Pacific did not allow for or stipulate the use of autonomous underwater vehicles as a platform for collecting geophysical data. ""They also didn't include things like moon pools, which are regularly used by the oil and gas industry in the Gulf of Mexico to deploy ROVs,"" she said.

""And because those things were left out of the biological assessment in the Pacific, we now have to reopen the biological assessment, which is a six to nine-month reset,"" Pyc commented. ""That kind of regulatory hiccup would have been avoided,"" she added, ""if the folks within BOEM had worked with their oil and gas colleagues in the Gulf to understand what the standard and typical platforms were.""

She noted that oil and gas companies operating in the Gulf have been using autonomous underwater vehicles to collect data on shallow-water areas and seabed hazards for more than 20 years. ""So I think there are some real opportunities if we look beyond the wind sector conversation, and tap into the experience that exists in the Gulf of Mexico oil and gas sector."" The lesson for offshore wind developers and regulators, she said, is that ""we really need to look outside of the sphere that we're working in, which in this case is offshore wind, and really try to bring in the experience that other folks bring from other sectors.""

There are strong similarities and dynamics between offshore wind and offshore oil and gas, Pyc noted. ""Both involve operating steel on water, gathering geophysical data, using autonomous vehicles, and complying with the Marine Mammal Protection Act. So we're dealing with very similar activities,"" Pyc said. ""We're often dealing with the same regulations and the same legislation, and sometimes even the same individuals in the offices. Going forward, we really have a great opportunity to avoid the kinds of hiccups"" that RWE experienced in its site characterization efforts offshore California, in future offshore wind energy development projects.

""With every challenge, there's a flipside, an opportunity,"" Pyc observed. ""And so I think that we have to acknowledge from the outset that the Gulf has a lot of experience and knowledge that we should tap into. There are almost 2,000 operating production platforms right now. There are exploration activities that are going on. There are construction activities with pile driving that will be very similar to what will be expected for the offshore wind market.""

Pyc noted that in the last couple of years, there have been many discussions within the US offshore wind industry about regulatory burdens, and trying to find efficiencies in that process. ""With all of the oil and gas activity that the Gulf of Mexico has seen, they have found ways to implement process efficiencies that have enabled the issuance of hundreds of permits that are based on site characterizations and data-driven decisions. And so I think that the challenge that we have in the offshore wind industry is to try to and think outside of the box that we have created for ourselves. We have to tap into the lessons learned that already exist in the Gulf of Mexico, to implement those lessons learned, and incorporate those efficiencies into our processes.""

Pyc also observed that ""currently, there is less regulatory burden associated with the permitting and construction of an oil and gas platform in the Gulf of Mexico than there is to build an offshore wind farm. And so we really need to ask ourselves, 'how and why is that'? And how can we change that, so that we can meet the objectives that we collectively have, both from the regulatory agencies and the developers.""",offshore-mag.com,news,Offshore,,0.3176470588235294,452641653,18,"https://img.offshore-mag.com/files/base/ebm/os/image/2024/05/6637fb3ce8dd8200081c2236-rwe_windpark_gwynt_y_mr_02a.png?auto=format,compress&fit=fill&fill=blur&w=1200&h=630",eng-9536087

A German energy giant has reached a settlement and paid around €500,000 in legal costs to a County Wicklow fisherman to withdraw legal action blocking the development of an offshore wind farm.

The Sunday Times reports that RWE, which was granted a license to survey part of the sea off the east coast, was taken to the High Court last May by Greystones fisherman Ivan Toole.

Mr Toole sought a judicial review, on environmental grounds, of the Minister of State for Local Government's decision to grant the licence. His case was then taken to the Court of Justice of the European Union, which could delay the judgment for up to 12 months.

The newspaper reports that in an unprecedented deal in the industry here, RWE has reached a settlement with Mr Toole and agreed to pay his legal costs in return for withdrawing his proceedings.

Data centers have a crucial role to play in helping to boost investment in renewable energy, the head of Amazon Web Services, the European boss, told the Business Post, warning that the Republic could lose billions of euros in investments if it continues to block new developments.

Neil Morris called out the simplistic and binary nature of the debate around data centers and the approach to sustainability.

Some say it's either the environment or the economy. And I don't accept that. It's not just about the environment or the economy. It's the environment and the economy. We must do both. And if we can't do both together, we risk doing nothing, he said.

Meanwhile, Morris said Ireland needed to show it was open for business, unless it wanted tech giants such as Amazon to cut back on future investment.
