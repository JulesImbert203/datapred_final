Most Read from Bloomberg

But in recent months stalled deals prompted speculation that Adnoc had lost momentum. Not so, says Klaus Froehlich, the former Morgan Stanley banker spearheading most of Adnoc's international expansion plans.

While the company will always be disciplined, it's ""full throttle ahead"" with its expansion and is pursing a ""healthy deal pipeline,"" Froehlich, Adnoc's chief investment officer, said in a rare interview earlier this month.

""Adnoc is executing on its plan and creating a portfolio of businesses across key verticals in gas, LNG, chemicals as well as renewables and little by little, the puzzle is now coming together,"" he said.

Adnoc Chief Executive Officer Sultan Al Jaber has transformed the country's top oil producer in the last few years. He has brought billions of dollars into the firm by selling shares in some of its key units and got international investors such as Brookfield Asset Management and KKR & Co to put money in the company's infrastructure. Al Jaber is also the main architect behind Adnoc's international expansion plan.

The energy giant has announced a series of acquisitions as part of a plan to invest $150 billion by 2027 to expand its footprint at home and spread its international reach.

This month has seen a flurry of activity. Adnoc purchased a stake in NextDecade Corp.'s LNG export project in Texas, its first US acquisition that also gives it a 20-year supply deal. The company also agreed to buy a 10% stake in a natural gas project in Mozambique. Separately, Adnoc sold $935 million worth of shares in a secondary offering of its drilling unit, increasing the company's free float to more than 16%.

""We are a big believer in gas and its future as a transition fuel. In order to optimize our LNG business today and to be a reliable supplier to our customers, we need to have positions globally,"" Froehlich said.

But in recent months Adnoc walked away from a potential acquisition in Brazil and suspended a deal in Israel. Talks over transactions with Germany's Covestro AG or Austria's OMV AG appear to have stalled.

""We go into every deal hoping that we can get it done but it won't be by compromising our standards on value and discipline,"" Froehlich said.

Adnoc's international ambitions are closely aligned with its domestic expansion strategy, where it's boosting LNG capacity in the Ruwais project, according to Froehlich, a former investment banker with Morgan Stanley.

Chemical Deals

In the chemicals sector, Adnoc is currently in talks to buy Germany's Covestro and -- in a separate transaction -- merge its domestic petrochemical firm Borouge with rival Borealis, which is controlled by Austrian oil and gas firm OMV. Froehlich declined to comment on the current status of talks with Covestro, but said the company was ""a great platform with a fantastic management team.""

Adnoc is a ""firm believer in the future of the chemicals industry -- either derived from hydrocarbons but then also increasingly from circular feedstocks and biomass,"" he said. Based in Leverkusen, western German, Covestro is working on sustainable forms of materials and uses recycled raw materials and renewable energy in its production.

Speaking about OMV, in which Adnoc acquired a 25% stake from fellow Abu Dhabi investor Mubadala, Froehlich said the Austrian oil and gas champion is a ""great investment into an under-appreciated company."" Adnoc sees long-term value in the partnership that Froehlich said is ""very crucial to us.""

Asked about a merger between Adnoc's petrochemical firm Borouge with OMV's polyolefin unit Borealis, Froehlich stressed both parties need to be aligned and find it beneficial. ""OMV and Adnoc can do a lot of things together,"" he said.

Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. will purchase the stake in the Area 4 concession from Galp Energia SGPS SA, it said in a statement Wednesday. Galp will receive $650 million, and further contingent payments of as much as $500 million when two planned development phases go ahead, the Portuguese company said in a separate statement.

The agreement gives Adnoc a share of LNG supply, a fuel that it's betting on for future growth. The company is also scouring the world for deals, including the takeover of German chemical company Covestro AG and the merger of one of its units with a subsidiary of Austria's OMV AG to create a $30 billion petrochemical giant. That push coincides with Saudi Aramco's efforts to boost its global presence, after agreeing to buy an LNG company in Australia.

In Mozambique, Adnoc will get a share in the 3.5 million-ton-a-year Coral South development LNG export project that is currently in operation. A proposed expansion called Coral North could produce the same amount of fuel from a floating export vessel. Another project planned to be based onshore called Rovuma is projected to have capacity to produce 18 million tons of LNG a year.

It follows Adnoc's first acquisition in the US earlier this week when it picked up a share in NextDecade Corp.'s LNG project in Texas, along with supply from a planned expansion of the plant.

The deal into Mozambique -- where attacks by militant groups linked with Islamic State have ramped up near the project site -- is also the latest example of the UAE's move to boost its influence in Africa. Earlier this year, the country agreed to invest $35 billion in Egypt, potentially saving the economy.

In 2022, the UAE pledged $52.8 billion in foreign direct investments in Africa, when it first topped FDI rankings, according to data from fDi Markets. That figure fell to $44.5 billion in 2023 -- still nearly twice that of Beijing, which came in second.

Oil wealth

The UAE, of which Abu Dhabi is the capital, is using its oil wealth to turn Adnoc into a global energy business. The country, and its Middle East neighbors including Saudi Arabia and Qatar, are also investing billions of dollars on gas -- seen as an important bridge fuel in the energy transition. The UAE aims to be self-sufficient in the fuel by 2030 as it explores at home and adds stakes in fields from Azerbaijan to Egypt.

""We've made it very clear that we're interested in key sectors when it comes to low carbon solutions, renewables, natural gas and chemicals,"" Musabbeh Al Kaabi, Adnoc's executive director for international growth, said in an interview Monday after the company announced the US deal. ""We're executing on our strategy and our strategy is clear. It's a milestone with hopefully more to come.""

Adnoc will take Galp's place in the Rovuma and Coral projects. The company will join Eni SpA, Exxon Mobil Corp., China National Petroleum Corp., Korea Gas Corp. and Mozambique's state producer Empresa Nacional de Hidrocarbonetos E.P.

Mozambique's Area 4 includes Eni's $7 billion floating Coral South Project that began shipping LNG in 2022 and a similar planned offshore production facility.

Imports from Norway are around 40%, and as the threat of outages continues, it has sustained prices.

During 2024, the average price has been 68.50, below the average price at the same time last year. The forward curve grows sharply upwards until the end of 2025 with December contract quoting above 109. Austria's OMV AG might stop payments to Gazprom soon, and that would cut 80% of supplies to the country.

Furthermore, Slovakia and Hungary are also dependent on Russian gas, despite the move to replace it as a result of the war in Ukraine, which was the main transit zone. Most gas into Europe from Russia is now provided via Turkey, and has not been affected by sanctions so far.

So, the geopolitical situation seems to be the main factor driving prices, as storage is still at good levels.

The contract has finally broken the key level of 74.90, and this week, it has surprised the market with a bullish breakout, placing prices well above the 10- and 20-unit exponential moving averages (EMAs). From here, the next strong dynamic resistance will be the 50 EMA (currently marking 95.80), and we would need to go as far back as December 2022 for the most recent breakout from that level.

The weekly RSI at 53.47 is still in the ""neutral"" area; however, it is trending up and following the direction of prices. For now, all signs are pointing upwards.

Robusta Coffee 10-T (RMN24), +11.67%: In the last four sessions, we see a confident bullish rebound, breaking all the 10, 20 and 50 averages. Mind the 4,000 level, which so far has acted as good resistance. Breaking it upwards will set the next target to 4,300.

This week's announcement that Vietnam 2024/2025 robusta coffee crop will be the lowest in 13 years (24 million bags) is fueling the last rebound. There are projections of yet another robusta global deficit for 2024/2025 of 4.6 million.

Brazil production in contrast has been revised up from Conab (Brazil's National Supply Company) to up to 58.8 bags. Given the dryness reports in Mina Gerais that might bit too optimistic, and the supply might be tight for this season.

Rapeseed (XRQ24), +4.54%: European Rapeseed is in a solid uptrend that started on Feb. 26 and has used the 10 and 20 EMA as effective support. The daily RSI at 62.77 is still validating the trend.

EU Commission grain trade data shows that rapeseed imports are below last year's volume. 2023-24 imports are at 4.9 Mt, which is 1.9Mt less than previous season.

Australia has exported 60% less to the EU as a result of dryness in a context of strong demand from EU crushers that are hitting record volumes. Fundamentals are clearly supporting this trend for now.

Worst European Commodity Performers This Week

Crude Oil Brent (CBQ24), -3.12%: Brent contracts are trading below the 10, 20, and 50 EMAs with a clear bearish bias in the last 5 sessions. The 79.5-80 area should provide a first support it the trend continues.

Demand is low currently at the start of the driving season, and with no close prospect of interest rate cuts to stimulate it. All attention is now focused on the next OPEC meeting on June 1.

VSTOXX Futures (DVM24), -25%: With lows hitting the 13 level, we are approaching extremely low volatility in the equity sector, down to levels not seen since January 2024. Previous to that, volatility had remained higher since January 2020.

The 50 EMA indicates 19, so this could be a good time for those looking to pick up cheap options on equities.

Cobalt (U8M24), -2,44%: Cobalt has its production concentrated in two countries. It had its last boom in May 2022 (high at 81,940), and a subsequent crash at the current 26,945.

The metal is near its cheapest in the last 5 years, and China has taken notice. Cobalt is a byproduct of copper and nickel production, and it's in demand among the defense, electric vehicle (EV), and communication industries.

There is a massive surplus in the market in 2024, which has produced the current crash, with overproduction reported in the Republic of Congo and Indonesia. Congo supplies 77% of theglobal market with around 170,000 tons just last year, and the current surplus in the market for 2024 is estimated at 35,000 tons.

The crash in prices has not stopped Chinese miners in Congo, as they benefit from state support. China's state stockpiler is ramping up demand, as it plans to acquire 15,000 tons at around USD$12.50-$13.80 per pound for stockpiling, and presumably for military use.

At the current levels, and with expected EV demand picking up, we could be close to a turnaround in this bear market.

How to Trade Cobalt

Futures contracts on this metal have very low liquidity, and the only realistic options for retail traders are on the ETF sector - though there is nothing specifically on cobalt 100%, either miners or on futures.

That said, two ETF options are the Amplify Lithium & Battery Technology ETF (BATT) and the ProShares S&P Global Core Battery Metals ETF (ION).

Markets on cobalt are ripe with opportunity at these levels; however, be sure to mind the liquidity if you are going to jump in.

In case the company OMF Gas Marketing and Trading GmbH fails to comply with the ruling of the Arbitration Court of the city of St. Petersburg and the Leningrad region <...> an award in favor of Gazprom Export LLC [in the amount of] 575,266,000 euros in rubles at the rate of the Bank of Russia will be paid,"" the judge said.

Earlier, Gazprom Export demanded that OMV Gas Marketing & Trading GmbH be prohibited from continuing arbitration proceedings at the Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce and that it be fined if it failed to comply with the judicial act.

Gazprom Export's lawyer insisted in court that because of sanctions, the company can not get proper legal representation and justice abroad. In particular, a number of EU law firms refused to work with Russian companies, and an agreement on streamlining the issuance of visas was also canceled. Nevertheless, the OMV representative claimed that no personal sanctions had been imposed against Gazprom Export, and the Austrian company proposed - within the same arbitration court - to transfer the hearings to other jurisdictions (including Dubai or Istanbul), but did not receive any response.

OMV Gas Marketing & Trading GmbH is a subsidiary of Austria's OMV AG. In June 2018, an agreement was signed to extend the existing contract between Gazprom Export LLC and OMV Gas Marketing & Trading GmbH to supply Russian natural gas to Austria until 2040. Previously, the contract was signed through 2028.

Earlier Gazprom filed claims in the Russian court against German traders Uniper Global Commodities SE and Meta-Methanhandel GmbH, Austria's OMV Exploration & Production GmbH, Czech company NET4GAS, Naftogaz of Ukraine, the Dutch gas transport Gasunie Transport Service, the operator of the BBL gas pipeline between the UK and the Netherlands, Slovakia's ZSE Energia and the Polish-Russian company Europol GAZ, which owns the Polish section of the Yamal-Europe gas pipeline, demanding a ban on continuing arbitration proceedings in foreign courts. The Russian company won all its claims to ban the continuation of legal proceedings abroad.

Gazprom Export also filed a similar lawsuit against Czech company CEZ, with a hearing scheduled for May 24.",tass.com,news,TASS,,-0.09019607843137256,454081257,1,https://tass.com/img/blocks/common/tass_logo_share_ru.png,eng-9589934

MOSCOW, May 22. /TASS/. OMV considers it likely that Gazprom Export will halt supplying gas under the contract if a foreign court decision obtained ""by a major European energy company"" would require OMV's subsidiary to make payments to this company instead of Gazprom Export, the Austrian company said in a statement.

""OMV Gas Marketing & Trading GmbH (OGMT) has learned about a foreign court decision obtained by a major European energy company which, if enforced in Austria against OGMT, would require OGMT to make payments under its gas supply contract with Gazprom Export to such European energy company (instead of Gazprom Export). In this respect, it is currently not known to OGMT whether and when such an enforcement might occur,"" the statement reads.

In case of such an enforcement, the Austrian company considers it likely that ""Gazprom Export will halt supplying gas under the gas supply contract with OGMT, thereby affecting the Austrian gas market,"" according to the report. This assessment is based on Gazprom Export's conduct in similar situations, OMV noted.

Meanwhile, in the case of such a scenario, OGMT would still be able to supply its contractual customers with gas from alternative, non-Russian sources, the company added.

Earlier on Wednesday the Court of Arbitration of St. Petersburg and the Leningrad Region upheld Gazprom Export's legal claim against OMV Gas Marketing & Trading GmbH banning the continuation of the proceeding in the foreign arbitration court.

Most Read from Bloomberg

A failure to pay the Kremlin-controlled gas giant on time would likely interrupt supplies, OMV said late Tuesday in a so-called urgent market message. Gazprom has covered more than 80% of Austrian imports over the last seven months under a long-term contract running until 2040.

The warning stems from a ""foreign court decision obtained by a major European energy company,"" OMV wrote in a statement. Should Austrian courts enforce the decision, potentially disrupting OMV payments, it's ""likely that Gazprom Export will halt supplying gas,"" it said.

OMV said its doesn't know whether or when such an enforcement might happen.

An interruption to Russian supplies could lead to a ""short-term"" increase in prices, Austrian regulator E-Control said Wednesday in a statement. However, adequate alternatives and high storage levels mean the country should have adequate supply into 2026.

E-Control and an OMV spokesman declined to identify the company or court case that triggered the warning. The Ministry of Energy didn't return requests for comment.

Former Gazprom customers have filed claims against the Russian company, including in Finland, Germany, Italy and the Czech Republic. On Tuesday, Bulgaria announced it's pursuing €400 million ($434 million) compensation.

The new OMV warning was issued as Austria reviews its contract with Gazprom. Energy Minister Leonore Gewessler has sought to accelerate the country's pivot away from Russian supplies ahead of national elections later this year.

Most Read from Bloomberg

Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. will purchase the stake in the Area 4 concession from Galp Energia SGPS SA, it said in a statement Wednesday. Galp will receive $650 million, and further contingent payments of as much as $500 million when two planned development phases go ahead, the Portugese company said in a separate statement.

The agreement gives Adnoc a share of LNG supply, a fuel that it's betting on for future growth. The company is also scouring the world for deals, including the takeover of German chemical company Covestro AG and the merger of one of its units with a subsidiary of Austria's OMV AG to create a $30 billion petrochemical giant. That push coincides with Saudi Aramco's efforts to boost its global presence, after agreeing to buy an LNG company in Australia.

In Mozambique, Adnoc will get a share in the 3.5 million-ton-a-year Coral South development LNG export project that is currently in operation. A proposed expansion called Coral North could produce the same amount of fuel from a floating export vessel. Another project planned to be based onshore called Rovuma is projected to have capacity to produce 18 million tons of LNG a year.

It follows Adnoc's first acquisition in the US earlier this week when it picked up a share in NextDecade Corp.'s LNG project in Texas, along with supply from a planned expansion of the plant.

The deal into Mozambique -- where attacks by militant groups linked with Islamic State have ramped up near the project site -- is also the latest example of the UAE's move to boost its influence in Africa. Earlier this year, the country agreed to invest $35 billion in Egypt, potentially saving the economy.

In 2022, the UAE pledged $52.8 billion in foreign direct investments in Africa, when it first topped FDI rankings, according to data from fDi Markets. That figure fell to $44.5 billion in 2023 -- still nearly twice that of Beijing, which came in second.

The UAE, of which Abu Dhabi is the capital, is using its oil wealth to turn Adnoc into a global energy business. The country, and its Middle East neighbors including Saudi Arabia and Qatar, are also investing billions of dollars on gas -- seen as an important bridge fuel in the energy transition. The UAE aims to be self-sufficient in the fuel by 2030 as it explores at home and adds stakes in fields from Azerbaijan to Egypt.

""We've made it very clear that we're interested in key sectors when it comes to low carbon solutions, renewables, natural gas and chemicals,"" Musabbeh Al Kaabi, Adnoc's executive director for international growth, said in an interview Monday after the company announced the US deal. ""We're executing on our strategy and our strategy is clear. It's a milestone with hopefully more to come.""

Adnoc will take Galp's place in the Rovuma and Coral projects. The company will join Eni SpA, Exxon Mobil Corp., China National Petroleum Corp., Korea Gas Corp. and Mozambique's state producer Empresa Nacional de Hidrocarbonetos E.P.

Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. will take an 11.7% stake in phase 1 of the Rio Grande LNG project, according to a statement Monday. The deal will also give Adnoc 1.9 million tons a year of liquefied natural gas supply from the planned Train 4. NextDecade shares gained as much as 16% in New York trading.

Houston-based NextDecade still needs to secure sales contracts to carry out its planned expansion beyond phase 1 and to help it raise financing. The Adnoc deal is ""a major step forward"" in the probable decision to go ahead with Train 4 and in potential for rising profit from the expansion, according to analysts at Stifel.

The transaction is a significant move into the US for Adnoc and part of an international expansion plan announced in November 2022. The company has been scouring the world for assets to reach new markets. It's in talks to buy a chemical company in Europe and is also looking to combine one of its units with subsidiary of Austria's OMV AG to create a $30 billion petrochemical giant. That push coincides with Saudi Aramco's efforts to boost its global presence, after agreeing to buy an LNG company in Australia.

""We've made it very clear that we're interested in key sectors when it comes to low carbon solutions, renewables, natural gas and chemicals,"" Musabbeh Al Kaabi, Adnoc's executive director for international growth, said in an interview. ""We're executing on our strategy and our strategy is clear. It's a milestone with hopefully more to come.""

Adnoc's stake in phase 1 of the Rio Grande project will give it access to the first three trains, as production units at LNG facilities are known. Trains 1 to 3 will have a capacity of 17.61 million tons a year, with construction already under way on the first line. Adnoc purchased its stake in the project from Global Infrastructure Partners.

The UAE, of which Abu Dhabi is the capital, is using its oil wealth to turn Adnoc into a global energy business. The country, and its Middle East neighbors including Saudi Arabia and Qatar, are also investing billions of dollars on gas -- seen as an important bridge fuel in the energy transition. The UAE aims to be self-sufficient in the fuel by 2030 as it explores at home and adds stakes in fields from Azerbaijan to Egypt.

France's TotalEnergies SE and Mubadala Development Co., an Abu Dhabi government-owned investment fund, are both shareholders in NextDecade. Total holds about 17.4% in the Houston-based developer and Mubadala owns about 5.5%, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The French energy giant also holds a stake in phase 1 of the Rio Grande project, along with NextDecade, GIP and, now, Adnoc.

NextDecade plans to make the final investment decision on building Train 4 in the second half of 2024. It already has a license to proceed and so shouldn't be delayed by the Biden administration's decision to put new LNG export project approvals on hold.

Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. will take an 11.7% stake in phase 1 of the Rio Grande LNG project, according to a statement Monday. The deal will also give Adnoc 1.9 million tons a year of liquefied natural gas supply from the planned Train 4. NextDecade was up 7.5% in pre-market trading.

Adnoc has been scouring the world for assets to expand its reach and access new markets. It's in talks to buy a chemical company in Europe and is also looking to combine one of its units with subsidiary of Austria's OMV AG to create a $30 billion petrochemical giant. That push coincides with Saudi Aramco's efforts to boost its global presence, after agreeing to buy an LNG company in Australia.

""As global energy demand continues to increase, Adnoc is growing our diversified energy portfolio to ensure a secure, reliable and responsible supply of energy,"" said Musabbeh Al Kaabi, Adnoc's executive director for international growth.

Adnoc's stake in phase one of the Rio Grande project will give it access to the first 3 trains, as production units at LNG facilities are known. Trains 1 to 3 will have a capacity of 17.61 million tons a year, with construction already under way on the first line. Adnoc purchased its stake in the project from Global Infrastructure Partners.

Global Ambition

The UAE, of which Abu Dhabi is the capital, is using its oil wealth to turn Adnoc into a global energy business. The country, and its Middle East neighbors including Saudi Arabia and Qatar, are also investing billions of dollars on gas -- seen as an important bridge fuel in the energy transition. The UAE aims to be self-sufficient in the fuel by 2030 as it explores at home and adds stakes in fields from Azerbaijan to Egypt.

France's TotalEnergies SE and Mubadala Development Co., an Abu Dhabi government-owned investment fund, are both shareholders in NextDecade. Total holds about 17.4% in the Houston-based developer and Mubadala owns about 5.5%, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The French energy giant also holds a stake in phase 1 of the Rio Grande project, along with NextDecade, GIP and, now, Adnoc.

NextDecade plans to make the final investment decision on building Train 4 in the second half of 2024. It already has a license to proceed and so shouldn't be delayed by the Biden administration's decision to put new LNG export project approvals on hold. Adnoc also has an option to take an equity stake in the planned Trains 4 and 5 at the Rio Grande project.

Adnoc, which plans to build its own LNG export facility in the UAE, didn't disclose financial terms of the US transaction. It didn't disclose when the project would be begin operations, nor when the company would begin to receive fuel supplies.

Earlier this year, I explained why I think that a deal between OMV AG (OTCPK:OMVJF, OTCPK:OMVKY) and the UAE's Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. (""Adnoc"") has the potential to unlock significant value for shareholders of the former. Since then, negotiations have, unfortunately, been dragging on, so far without result. Nonetheless, even without the catalyst of a deal, the stock recorded substantial gains in the meantime. Below, I will give an update on recent developments and how they affect the investment case.

Kindly note that all per share figures refer to common stock. There are also ADRs which represent ¼ share each.

Adnoc Deal Takes Its Time

OMV and Adnoc are currently engaged in advanced discussions of a deal for OMV's 75 percent stake in petrochemicals company Borealis. I have previously written about the strategic viability of such a combination, as well as the reported conditions being negotiated. There have been no material changes on that front, so, in the interest of brevity, I will not go into detail presently. Suffice it here to say that both companies would presumably end up with equal stakes in a combined Borouge-Borealis, with a minority stake being traded as free float. If so, I would assume that the free float would be somewhere in the range of 10 percent of outstanding shares. Additionally, based on the respective valuations and carious cross holdings, OMV would probably need to make an additional investment of somewhere between €1.5 and €2 billion in order to end up with a 45 percent stake in the new entity.

Lately, negotiations between Adnoc and OMV have somewhat slowed down. Austrian media reports of significant differences, especially on the Austrian side. The resignation of Borealis CEO Thomas Gangl (effective June 30th) may also play a role here. It appears increasingly likely that a deal will not be agreed before the Austrian parliamentary elections in late September. This presents an obvious downside, as it adds an element of uncertainty as to the composition of the next Austrian government and its stance on a possible deal with Adnoc. Keep in mind, that OMV is of national importance for Austria and the state holding ÖBAG owns 31.5 percent. In the worst case, A deal might be called off entirely. For the time being, I remain cautiously optimistic, but the risk profile has gradually shifted in an unfavorable direction.

Valuation

My long term valuation method remains largely unchanged. The initial valuation of Borouge-Borealis would likely be somewhere around $30 billion, give or take. The stock market may, of course, end up valuing the company higher or lower than that. Using this figure for the time being, a 45 percent equity stake would represent a value of $13.5 billion (or around €12.4 billion at the time of writing). My assessment of the oil and gas business, meanwhile, remains unchanged.

Applying a rather conservative multiple of 3 times 2022 earnings of €2.4 billion, the remaining divisions (including the downstream oil and gas units) should have a standalone value of around €7.2 billion. I am using 2022 specifically, as it represents a very strong year for the oil and gas sectors, thereby serving as a close approximation of an earnings peak. As a long term investor, I deliberately use peak cycle valuations in order to derive a price target for a cyclical business. In the short term, however, one needs to consider more recent results, too. Q1 revenue declined by a quarter to €8.17 billion YoY due to a decrease in natural gas prices. EPS increased to €1.43 (Q1 2023: €1.19, Q4: 0.72). Yet operating results decreased to €1.48 billion (Q1 2023: €2.07 billion). Overall, the oil market is in robust shape, but the natural gas market has somewhat normalized after windfall profits stemming from the Russian invasion in Ukraine.

Cash and equivalents increased slightly to €7.8 billion, with net debt decreasing to €1.2 billion as of March 31st. One should, however, add to that figure the cost of increasing the stake in a potential Borouge-Borealis. To be on the safe side, I will calculate with €2 billion, thus arriving at a pro forma net debt around €3.2 billion. Based on these considerations, I still believe a price of around €53.5 per share on an undiluted basis to be reasonable.

Absent an eventual Borouge-Borealis combination, the stock would arguably be at least fairly valued as is, one might even view it as moderately overvalued. In that case, all else equal, a 75 percent stake in Borealis would be valued at €8.8 billion, implying a total value of €11.6 billion, which equals a multiple close to of 54 times 2023 net profits of €216 million or about 1.6 times sales. This is not outlandishly cheap. But keep in mind that I assigned a relatively conservative multiple to the oil and gas business.

Dividend

As I keep repeating, one of the factors that drew me to invest in OMV is its dividend policy. In addition to its regular dividend, which the company intends to constantly maintain or increases, OMV introduced special dividends. The aim is to distribute between 20 and 30 percent of operating cash flows as dividends, as long as the leverage ratio is below 30 percent. As of Q1, the leverage ratio remains well below that threshold at a mere 4 percent (Q4: 8 percent). So, for the foreseeable future, I believe that annual distributions of €2.95 + X are to be expected. For 2023, the total dividend amounted to €5.1 per share (€2.95 regular dividend+ €2.1 special dividend). Operating cash flows remain robust (Q1: 1.85 billion), so I am confident that the dividend is quite safe. The company's track record is quite reassuring in that regard, too, with the last cut dating back almost a decade to 2015 and paying a dividend every year since 1994. The significantly higher share price, naturally, reduces the dividend yield. Based on the current share price, I would expect a forward dividend yield between 6.3 and 10.6 percent, subject to the amount of special dividends and under the assumption that the total amount will not exceed €5.1 per share. That is still a decent yield, in my opinion, even with the relatively high Austrian tax rate of 27.5 percent in mind.

Thesis Risk

In terms of risk factors, not that much has changed as compared to when I last covered the stock. Geopolitics remains a concern, with locations such as Lybia or Yemen in which OMV is doing business not becoming materially more politically stable. Another negative aspect is the relatively high percentage of government ownership. The interest of the republic of Austria - or, more precisely, its elected representatives - may not always align with the interests of other shareholders. In particular, political considerations may contribute to overly ambitious ESG commitments at the expense of profitability in the here and now. And, of course, both the energy and the petrochemicals divisions are inherently cyclical businesses.

What has changed is that now, there is a combination of a higher likelihood of the Adnoc negotiations breaking down without result and the fact that a higher share price leaves more short term downside if that were to happen. This, obviously, somewhat elevates the risk profile.

Conclusion

I still believe that OMV is a great business at a reasonable price. It is, however, no longer the screaming buy it was a few months ago. At the current share price, there is still some 15 percent upside to my price target. While that is not nothing, and the dividend remains attractive, one has to take into account the risk of short term downside if, for example, the Adnoc negotiations were to break down. All in all, the risk profile has not changed so much that I am looking to sell, and OMV still makes much sense as an income play. For the time being, I assign a hold rating to the stock, as that is exactly what I intend to do: keep holding the stock, but not necessarily adding to my position at the current price.

Investment action

I recommended a buy rating for OMV AG (OTCPK:OMVJF) when I wrote about it during last year March, as I liked the valuation set up, where OMV was trading at 2.5x EBITDA and had an indicated yield of 12%. My expectations played out well, in that OMV valuation did start to track back towards its historical multiple of 4x (now trading at 3.4x forward EBITDA), driving a total return of 31% (~15% from dividends). Based on my current outlook and analysis, I recommend a hold rating. My key update to my thesis is that valuation is no longer attractive, both on a dividend yield basis and a forward EBITDA basis. The poor earnings outlook should put a lid on how much valuation multiples can move up from here. For readers that followed my previous recommendation, OMV has delivered a nice return of 31%, but I no longer think an attractive return is possible from here.

Review

OMV reported earnings on April 30th with total revenue of EUR8.36 billion, clean operating profit of EUR1.48 billion, and adj net income of EUR696 million. Breaking it down by details, Clean CCS operating result was EUR1.48 billion, driven by Chemicals and Materials EBIT of EUR129 million, Energy EBIT of EUR1 billion, and Fuels & Feedstock EBIT of EUR303 million. Based on my review, the results were alright, but the outlook has gotten relative poorer than the last time I wrote about the company. Dividend yield is also a lot lesser at ~6%, and the potential valuation upside is a lot lesser today. Hence, I am downgrading my rating from buy to hold.

Firstly, on OMV's Energy earnings outlook, I am negative on it. According to Wood Mackenzie's analysis, gas prices could fall as low as $6.7/mmbtu as storage levels remain 55%. This comes at a where management guided for FY24 production to be between 330-350 kboepd in 2024, somewhat inline vs FY23. Note that Energy is a large part of clean CCS EBIT, and because of the mix (~70%), weak gas price outlook is going to really hurt OMV.

With storage levels nearing full capacity towards the end of the summer, there will be up to 10 bcm of excess supply that will need to either be piped into underground storage facilities in Ukraine or floated in LNG vessels"". says Mauro Chavez, Director of Europe Gas & LNG Markets at Wood Mackenzie. This means that a higher summer-winter differential is required to balance the market, compared to what the current forward curve suggests, putting downward pressure on Q3 prices.

Secondly, on Chemicals, there may be some improvement in the Chemicals segment in 1Q24, but I'm still wary because it could be due to short-lived problems with Asian imports via the Red Sea. OMV's operations and its push towards a lower carbon future have been bolstered by its downstream diversification and chemicals expansion, which, in my opinion, has been a significant step in improving OMV position in the value chain towards focus on higher-value and lower-carbon chemical products. As can be seen from 1Q24, this strategy has been successful, with solid chemicals results driving earnings supported by strong polyolefin margins (which grew 26% sequentially). I have a less optimistic view of the future because the petrochemical industry is currently experiencing overcapacity due to excessive investment over a number of years, combined with weak demand.

Lastly, OMV's Refining & Marketing earnings should also see headwinds as refining margins continue to normalize. In 1Q24, OMV's refining indicator margin for Europe rebounded to $10.8/bbl vs. 9.9 in 4Q23, an 8% sequential growth. Historically, OMV has seen a margin of around mid-single-digit dollars, and it was only recently, due to COVID, supply chain disruption, and the Russia-Ukraine conflict, that margins reached a height of ~$30. This is not sustainable, and OMV results have shown a continuous normalization (downward) trend. I expect the trend to continue given capacity additions.

Valuation

Valuation is certainly less attractive today after the run-up in valuation. Firstly, on a dividend yield basis, OMV's indicated yield now is around 6%, or ~17x DPS, and this is where OMV has historically traded. Secondly, on a forward EBITDA basis, multiples have run up as I expected (from ~2x to the current ~3.4x); however, because of the poor earnings outlook, I don't see a compelling reason that valuation multiples will continue to move up from here. Viewed together, I believe OMV is trading where it should be trading, and hence, I am downgrading to a hold rating.

Final thoughts

My recommendation is a downgrade to hold. While the company delivered decent results in 1Q24, particularly in the Chemicals segment, the overall earnings outlook is not very positive. Weak gas prices, potential overcapacity in the petrochemical industry, and normalizing refining margins are all headwinds for OMV. Additionally, the valuation is no longer attractive, with the dividend yield down to 6% and limited potential for further multiple expansion. While OMV has delivered a good return for investors who followed my previous recommendation, I believe the easy gains have already been captured and further upside is limited.

Image by Leonid Eremeychuk via iStock

Malaysia's Sapura Energy Berhad joint venture companies have secured contracts from Petróleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras) to provide the services and charter of six pipe-laying support vessels (PLSVs).

The contracts are for a term of three years, beginning on different mobilization dates for each of the PLSVs, with the longest dated contract lasting up to 2028, Sapura Energy said in a bourse announcement. The total value of the contracts is $1.8 billion.

The scope of work includes the provision of subsea engineering, installation and other services, by utilizing the PLSVs in Brazilian waters. Sapura Energy said the PLSVs will perform all operations required for the installation of flexible pipes, electric-hydraulic umbilical and power cables, new or used, such as loading, unloading, laying, connection between spans, vertical connection (first and second end) on submarine equipment, installation of submarine equipment and hydrostatic test, in a maximum water depth of 9842.5 feet (3000 meters).

Sapura Energy, through its wholly owned subsidiary Sapura Offshore Sdn Bhd, holds 50 percent equity interests in the joint venture companies.

Restructuring Progress

In March, Sapura Energy and its 22 wholly owned subsidiaries were granted new convening and restraining orders by the High Court of Malaya for a period of three months, beginning March 11.

The orders, sanctioned under the Companies Act 2016, will enable each of the scheme companies to summon meetings with creditors, to consider and approve a proposed scheme of arrangement and compromise as part of the company's group-wide debt restructuring plan. The restraining orders will assist the scheme companies to engage with creditors without being disrupted by the threat of litigation.

In its application to the Court, Sapura Energy stated in an earlier statement that ""significant progress in the restructuring exercise has been made"". Its multi-currency lenders have provided the requisite Approval-in-Principle for the proposed restructuring scheme while claims from its trade creditors under the Proof of Debt process have been fully reviewed.

Sapura Energy's debt restructuring exercise aims to address its multi-currency financing of approximately $2.28 billion (MYR 10.8 billion) and outstanding payments to trade creditors amounting to about $0.32 billion (MYR 1.5 billion).

Sapura Energy Chairman Dato' Mohammad Azlan Abdullah said, ""As previously announced, we appreciate the Approval-in-Principle from our financiers for the PRS. This was a major point that will enable us to move ahead with the restructuring"".

In April, TotalEnergies SE announced the acquisition of the remaining 50 percent stake in Malaysian independent gas producer and operator SapuraOMV Upstream Sdn from Sapura Upstream Assets Sdn Bhd (SUA) for $530 million.

The energy major in January signed an agreement with OMV AG to acquire its 50 percent interest in SapuraOMV for $903 million.

After the completion of both transactions, TotalEnergies would own 100 percent of SapuraOMV, TotalEnergies said in a separate statement.

SapuraOMV's main assets are its 40 percent operated interest in block SK408 and 30 percent operated interest in block SK310, both located offshore Sarawak in Malaysia.",rigzone.com,news,Rigzone,,0.3803921568627451,453207955,1,https://images.rigzone.com/images/news/articles/Sapura-Energy-Bags-Pipelaying-Contracts-from-Petrobras-176706-582x327.webp,

The Austrian Centre for the Enforcement of Human Rights International (CEHRI), in collaboration with the Dutch peace organization PAX, has lodged a criminal complaint against former senior executives of OMV AG, an Austrian company that had a business partnership with the Swedish company Lundin Energy AB.

The two organizations have urged Austrian prosecutors to open a criminal investigation into OMV AG, alleging that the company also abetted serious crimes committed by government forces in South Sudan between 1999 and 2003 with the aim of gaining control of an area where the Swedish-Austrian consortium wanted to search for oil.

Nearly one third of OMV AG is owned by the Austrian government. According to CEHRI and PAX, OMV AG joined the consortium in 1997 during the civil conflict in South Sudan to explore oil in Block 5A, an area beyond government control.

The region witnessed clashes marked by widespread crimes and violent displacements. Despite calls for respecting human rights, OMV AG failed to acknowledge its impact on the population. In 2003, the company sold its Sudanese assets, profiting US$50 million.

""Two former executives of Lundin are presently standing trial in Stockholm. They have been charged with complicity in war crimes while managing the Consortium in which OMV AG participated,"" CEHRI and PAX said Tuesday in a statement.

OMV AG also benefited from the alleged crimes and the victims have been denied justice since 1999, they explained. The committed atrocities allegedly include the systematic and deliberate targeting of civilians and the destruction of vital resources for survival.

""By the time OMV AG left Sudan, an estimated 12,000 people had died, 160,000 had been forcibly displaced, and their area of operation was thrown into abject poverty,"" the two organizations claimed, adding that OMV AG is believed to have been aware of the atrocities.

""OMV AG is accused of consciously accepting this in pursuit of its economic interests and of encouraging the criminal conduct of the Government of Sudan,"" according to CEHRI and PAX.

The Lundin trial in Sweden revealed that OMV AG owned 26% of the consortium. CEHRI and PAX contend that with just over one fourth of the voting power in the Joint Operating Committee, OMV AG wielded significant influence in crucial decisions.

Despite being regularly briefed on security matters and the consortium's actions, OMV's senior management never distanced themselves from the consortium's practices, according to CEHRI and PAX.

In the statement, Braskem published the contents of a letter it received from Novonor related Adnoc's decision. Novonor said it remained fully engaged in the sale process, according to the correspondence.

""We can confirm that we have withdrawn from the process to acquire a shareholding in Braskem,"" an Adnoc spokesman said by email.

Oil producers have long supplied chemical companies with fuels like naphtha or gases that are the building blocks for plastics and other materials. Now petrostates like Saudi Arabia and the UAE are increasingly turning to chemicals to bolster demand for their natural resources amid the energy transition.

Adnoc wants to develop a global chemicals business to diversify beyond the production and sale of crude oil and refined products, which make up the bulk of the company's profit. It's also pursuing other deals, including a proposed multibillion-dollar acquisition of German chemicals group Covestro AG and a separate merger of two plastics units that would create a business worth more than $30 billion.

So far those talks have also run into hurdles. The company's plan to merge Abu Dhabi-listed Borouge Plc with Borealis AG has been held up over valuation talks with partner OMV AG of Austria. Now coming elections in the European country threaten further delays. Covestro is in open-ended talks with Adnoc and may be waiting for a higher offer.",financialpost.com,news,Financial Post,,0.1529411764705881,452702171,1,https://smartcdn.gprod.postmedia.digital/financialpost/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/776026143.jpg,
