In the space of a week, almost all the more than 110,000 Armenians who lived there fled a lightning assault by Azerbaijani forces and what had been a nine-month blockade of the enclave by Azerbaijan. The blockade had resulted in food shortages and, from June 2023, the prevention of humanitarian aid (including medical supplies) entering Nagorno-Karabakh, including from the International Committee of the Red Cross. The first death from starvation had been reported. International lawyers, current UN officials, former UN officials and academics argued that genocide was taking place (inflicting conditions designed to bring about physical destruction) or at least there was a serious risk of genocide.

The blockade ended in late September 2023, when Azerbaijan bombed Nagorno-Karabakh, killing more than 200 people, injuring more than 400, and ultimately forcing the Armenian population to flee in fear from the blockade and the bombing, into Armenia. Those refugees remain in Armenia today, their right of return denied by Azerbaijan.

The fear of invasion and/or war by Azerbaijan also now has forced the Armenian government to give up other territory to Azerbaijan. Recent protests in Armenia demonstrate that this territorial exchange is very unpopular with the Armenian people and that the issue remains live and concerning. Meanwhile, Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev has made clear his intentions to resettle Nagorno-Karabakh with Azeris.

All of this takes place in the context of a history of anti-Armenian hate speech and expressions of genocidal intent from Azerbaijani leadership and media, as well as the destruction of Armenian cultural property in Nagorno-Karabakh. These are clearly serious violations of international law, but they capture little attention in the media or academic writings. However, understanding this conflict and the connected legal proceedings in international courts is essential for international lawyers, because there are myriad issues relating to accountability for violations of human rights law, international humanitarian law and international criminal law, alongside issues of public international law (e.g. self-determination and territory).

Who Cares About Nagorno-Karabakh?

As I have previously written, much about the conflict and atrocities that are part of the dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the territory of Nagorno-Karabakh goes underreported and therefore relatively unknown outside of the region. Exceptions exist, such as Swedish journalist Rasmus Canb√§ck, who continues to report on the issue in long-form, investigative pieces (see, e.g., his multi-part series in Blankspot magazine); and Armenian-American photographer Scout Tufankjian, who has crafted beautiful and moving photo essays on the Armenian culture of Nagorno-Karabakh and more recently, the refugees who fled the enclave. The list of human rights violations and international crimes that have arisen in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflicts are long, as documented regularly by Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, as well as in the work of the Tatoyan Foundation and the Centre for Truth and Justice, which collate evidence of crimes related to Nagorno-Karabakh.

Accountability for any crimes committed is sorely lacking. Armenia is a small country. Azerbaijan has gas that other countries want (including the U.K., through British Petroleum), but Armenia lacks such a resource. Thus, despite some remaining support for Armenia proper, especially due to the influence of its extensive diaspora in the United States and France, the Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh have struggled for recognition of their plight.

Armenia, however, is actively engaging with international law and its enforcement, turning to international institutions to seek some form of accountability -- in the European Court of Human Rights, the International Court of Justice (ICJ), and the International Criminal Court. The ICJ cases are worthy of an exploration here, as they deal with some substantial questions of human rights law, but also as the cases are running parallel at the ICJ, making them challenging to follow and distinguish.

The ICJ CERD Cases

Two cases brought under the Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD), Armenia v Azerbaijan and Azerbaijan v Armenia, are relevant, both of which center on Nagorno-Karabakh.

On Sept. 16, 2021, Armenia instituted proceedings against Azerbaijan in the ICJ for violations of CERD, requesting provisional measures. Armenia alleges Azerbaijan has engaged in anti-Armenian racial discrimination and hate, prejudice, systemic discrimination, mass killings, torture and other abuse, and cultural property destruction.

On Sept. 23, 2021, Azerbaijan instituted counter-proceedings under CERD, also requesting provisional measures. This case makes allegations of a ""campaign of ethnic cleansing"" by Armenia in the 1990s and 2020, including ""war crimes motivated by ethnic hatred"" and cultural property destruction, along with anti-Azerbaijani hate speech and disinformation.

There is a stark contrast between the provisional measures the Court issued in the two cases.

In Armenia v Azerbaijan, five provisional measures orders were issued from Dec. 7, 2021 to Nov. 17, 2023, a period when there was significant conflict-related activity in Nagorno-Karabakh. The orders reflect the changing conditions, such as the armed conflict and the blockade. Substantive provisional measures are found in the orders of Dec. 7, 2021, Feb. 22, 2023, and Nov. 17, 2023. In the orders of Oct. 12, 2022, and July 6, 2023, the Court declined to issue new provisional measures, reaffirming previous orders. Highlights of the provisional measures include:

In Azerbaijan v Armenia, there have been two provisional measures orders, on Dec. 7, 2021, and Feb. 22, 2023. Not all Azerbaijan's requests for provisional measures were granted, with the Court deciding some were not warranted. The only order to Armenia was to ""take all necessary measures to prevent the incitement and promotion of racial hatred, including by organizations and private persons in its territory, targeted at persons of Azerbaijani national or ethnic origin"" (para. 76). In February 2023, the Court declined to issue additional provisional measures in that case.

In both cases, the Court ordered both parties to ""refrain from any action which might aggravate or extend the dispute before the Court or make it more difficult to resolve."" Azerbaijan has not complied with any of the provisional measures ordered by the Court (although it may have submitted a report of steps taken to give effect to the measures, as required under the November 2023 order; if so, this has not been made public).

In April 2024, the Court held hearings on preliminary objections for both cases. (Written submissions are linked below; but see also the verbatim records of the oral hearings at those case pages.)

Armenia v Azerbaijan Preliminary Objections Arguments

Azerbaijan v Armenia Preliminary Objections Arguments

These ICJ cases are important for the enforcement of state accountability for international law violations, particularly the extensive number committed by Azerbaijan. However, they also offer the potential to contribute to international law jurisprudence on some interesting and pertinent legal issues, including the relationship between human rights law -- specifically, racial discrimination -- and IHL, through the question of whether acts of war can also amount to racial discrimination.

Neither Armenia nor Azerbaijan have made a declaration under Article 36(2) of the ICJ Statute, agreeing to general ICJ jurisdiction over any international law disputes, which would allow a case to be brought under IHL. That has left Armenia with limited avenues for State responsibility, hence the targeted case connecting specific conduct with racial discrimination under CERD. Another possible avenue is that Armenia could potentially bring a case under the Genocide Convention against Azerbaijan based on the blockade (both states have agreed to ICJ jurisdiction under this Convention).

Cases relating to Nagorno-Karabakh may fall under the radar because it is a small region that elicits less interest in the global legal world than some larger conflicts. But the conflict over this enclave has already produced -- and will continue to yield -- cases in various international fora that offer significant contributions to the development of international jurisprudence. These cases, then, should be of interest for international law practitioners and scholars to watch.",justsecurity.org,news,Just Security,,-0.4666666666666667,454856874,1,https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Armenia-Azerbaijan-border-demarcation-villages-small.jpg,eng-9607145

However, the measures would do nothing to bring transparency to politically active 501(c)(4) ""dark money"" groups into which foreigners, corporations -- even criminal organizations -- can contribute unlimited cash without the general public being any the wiser.

Two such organizations -- one of which was founded by a future aide to Gov. Mike DeWine -- funded the biggest bribery scandal in Ohio history. And many of the same politicians who now are warning of foreign money are ducking questions about massive support they received from those groups and company that funded them as they took actions that helped further the company's interests.

The Democratic National Convention this year falls on Aug. 19, which is after Ohio's Aug. 7 ballot certification deadline. Legislation was needed to move back that deadline if millions of Ohio voters were to be able to cast a ballot for the candidate of their choice.

It's a problem previous legislatures fixed for both parties as a matter of routine. But this year's Republican supermajorities demanded a quid pro quo if President Biden was to appear on the Ohio ballot.

Republicans are coming off of heavy defeats last year in attempts to make it much harder for voters to initiate constitutional amendments and to block an amendment protecting abortions rights. Now Ohio Republicans wanted to use the ballot fix to again attempt to change rules surrounding ballot initiatives.

Legislative Democrats declined to go along, and after a lengthy stalemate, Gov. DeWine on Thursday stepped in and said he was calling the General Assembly into special session.

The legislature can only consider matters the governor puts on the ""call"" for a special session, but DeWine didn't limit himself to a ""clean"" call that would have only allowed members to put the sitting president on the state ballot. He also allowed it to consider laws changing the way ballot initiatives are financed.

On Tuesday, the Democratic National Committee appeared to eliminate the need for any special session by announcing that it would meet virtually before the Ohio deadline and officially nominate Biden. But the session went ahead on Wednesday anyway.

DeWine Press Secretary Dan Tierney denied that his boss used the Biden-ballot controversy as a trojan horse to sneak in unrelated legislation.

""The General Assembly had gone weeks without passing a fix to get the President on the ballot; it would have been foolish to limit the options for the General Assembly to get this done,"" he said in an email.

The purpose of the unrelated measures, their Republican supporters say, is to ensure that foreign dollars aren't driving voter-initiated ballot initiatives.

""Unfortunately, it has become increasingly evident that decisions intended to be made by Ohioans are being unduly influenced by foreign governments, pouring millions of dollars into our state,"" Lt. Gov. Jon Husted said in a statement posted to social media Tuesday. ""To prevent foreign interests from manipulating our government for their own sinister agendas, foreign money must be barred from Ohio elections.""

It may prove difficult for lawmakers to agree on anything in the remaining hours of the session. Republican leaders in the Senate and the House couldn't even agree Tuesday on the order in which the bills must proceed through the two houses, or the numbers they should have.

As to their merits, several observers expressed skepticism that the real motivation was keeping outside money from infiltrating Ohio politics.

Last year, Secretary of State Frank LaRose said it was important to harshly limit citizens' ability to amend the state Constitution to protect against out-of-state interests. Meanwhile, his side of the fight was heavily funded by an out-of-state billionaire who also happened to be a prominent election denier.

Another reason for skepticism, said Common Cause of Ohio Executive Director Catherine Turcer, is the timing. If the bills being pushed in a special session ostensibly about putting Biden on the ballot are so all-fired important, why weren't they passed by the supermajorities in a regular session?

""Why is this legislation such a priority now?"" she asked.

Tierney, DeWine's press secretary, said the mere fact that Democrats and others are opposing the legislation is proof that it's needed -- and now.

""... the behavior of opponents of the ban since the Governor's announcement seems to indicate there indeed is foreign influence in these ballot initiatives and that some issue groups are counting on that support as part of their plans to campaign for or against these issues; the outcry would not make sense otherwise,"" he said. ""The statements and conduct of those opposing a ban have made it more clear to the Governor that such a ban is needed right away.""

Among the measures being debated are requirements that groups supporting state and local initiatives form political action committees -- a move that University of Cincinnati political scientist David Niven said would be ""a massive imposition for what can be very humble ballot questions.""

If enacted, at least some of the proposals would take effect prior to the November election, when a constitutional amendment meant to address Ohio's extreme gerrymandering is expected to be on the ballot. Just as LaRose's measure last year was meant in part to stop abortion-rights and anti-gerrymandering amendments, there's suspicion that some of the measures currently under debate are meant to stop this year's gerrymandering measure.

Niven said it's a bigger deal than that.

""It's certainly an anti-citizens'-voice effort,"" he said. ""And I think its consequences would be far grander than making it marginally harder (to put on the ballot and pass the anti-gerrymandering) amendment. It's creating campaign-finance requirements that would burden every ballot question from top to bottom no matter how obscure -- even things Republicans wouldn't object to.""

LaRose, the secretary of state, routinely ignores questions about his official actions and public statements -- as he did for this story. But in a May 9 press release calling to ""ban foreign influence over Ohio's elections,"" he gave a hint of what he is trying to stop.

It cited a press report saying that nearly $7 million to support the abortion-rights amendment came from the Washington, D.C.-based Sixteen Thirty Fund, which promotes causes such as voting access and the League of Conservation Voters. The fund counts among its more than 500 contributors Hansj√∂rg Wyss, a Swiss billionaire, who has contributed more than $200 million since 2016, the press release said.

If, as Husted said, such groups are ""manipulating our government for their own sinister agendas,"" Ohio voters of both parties apparently agreed with that of the Sixteen Thirty Fund. The abortion-rights amendment passed by a 14-point margin.

Turcer, of Common Cause, said lots of organizations might find themselves similarly situated as the fund -- including ones aligned with LaRose.

""There is a public good in keeping foreign money out of Ohio elections,"" she said. ""But that's already prohibited through the rules of the Ohio Elections Commission.""

She added, ""The problem is in the enforcement mechanism. This becomes complicated. Corporations can spend money in a ballot campaign. Let's take British Petroleum. A good chunk of their money is from out of the United States. Or if the Catholic Church is involved to fight a pro-choice issue, is it possible that some of that money is from Canada or Mexico? There can be a prohibition, but it gets complicated really fast.""

Turcer was also frustrated that even after the biggest bribery and money laundering scandal in state history, the state's Republican leaders have done nothing to bring transparency to the kind of entity that funded it -- 501(c)(4) ""dark money"" organizations.

Such groups -- which include the Sixteen Thirty Fund -- don't have to name their donors. They're used by Republicans and Democrats to support political causes and their use has expanded wildly after the 2010 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Citizens United v FEC.

It said that corporations could make unlimited political donations. The only limitation was that the cash had to go to outside groups that weren't allowed to coordinate their activities with campaigns.

Then-President Barack Obama predicted it would lead to abuses, and starting in 2017 in Ohio, dark money fueled a massive abuse. For all the public knew, Vladimir Putin could have been pumping money into an epic effort to pass and protect a $1.3 billion nuclear bailout that mostly benefited Akron-based FirstEnergy.

But in July 202o, the FBI arrested then-House Speaker Larry Householder, former Ohio GOP Chairman Matt Borges and three others -- and the public got a clearer picture of the money's origins. The feds had used subpoenas, wiretaps, undercover agents and other means the rest of us don't have to determine that FirstEnergy itself paid more than $60 million to finance the effort.

Ironically, that money was used to erect a foreign boogeyman of its own. Supporters of the bailout spent $36 million fighting its repeal, and some of that money financed TV ads falsely claiming that the repeal was China's attempt to take over the Ohio power grid.

At the time of Householder's arrest, DeWine, Husted, Yost and LaRose each had long-standing ties to FirstEnergy, each received financial support from the company, each played roles in passing the the bailout or stopping the citizen-initiated repeal, and each was mentioned multiple times in Householder's trial -- which netted him a 20-year prison sentence.

However, they've refused to answer important questions about their involvement. For example, DeWine said he didn't know about millions in dark money FirstEnergy spent supporting his 2018 campaign, while Husted has refused to talk about the $1 million the company spent supporting his.

Turcer said that if the state's leaders really were concerned about Ohio politics being polluted with money of unknown, criminal or foreign origins, they'd work to bring transparency to the dark money flooding the state.

""The thing that's really irritating is that it's been nearly four years since Larry Householder was arrested,"" she said. ""It is very clear to the state legislature what happens when you don't have greater transparency and you let all sorts of things flourish in a dark money system. They have not taken action for years. Why haven't they?""

Asked about this, Tierney, DeWine's press secretary, said there could be constitutional problems.

He said the governor ""would certainly entertain transparency reforms in this area if the General Assembly were to pass such a bill. The Governor has noted, however, that many proposals floated by advocates could conflict with United State Supreme Court caselaw and that the difficulty is indeed crafting a proposal that complies with the standing precedents.""

However, states such as Arizona have passed laws requiring that 501(c)(4)s that spend a certain amount on political campaigns disclose their donors. In February, a state judge dismissed a second attempt to strike down the law.

There's also the fact that in writing the Supreme Court opinion allowing unlimited corporate money in American politics, then-Justice Anthony Kennedy stressed the importance of transparency.

""The First Amendment protects political speech; and disclosure permits citizens and shareholders to react to the speech of corporate entities in a proper way,"" he wrote. ""This transparency enables the electorate to make informed decisions and give proper weight to different speakers and messages.""

Niven, the political scientist, said that for Ohio Republicans, bringing transparency to dark money is just a bridge too far.

""There's a very good reason why (the measures proposed in the special session) do nothing to dark money groups,"" he said. ""Dark money groups are the lifeline to the Republican bacchanalia here. They can't cut that off.""",clevescene.com,news,Cleveland Scene,Marty Schladen,-0.03529411764705881,454791217,1,https://media1.clevescene.com/clevescene/imager/u/slideshow/44423503/voting.581a346de9c3c.5d6d495c28481.jpg,eng-9604442

SALT LAKE CITY, UT (May 29, 2024) -- Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, the premier provider of legal services to technology, life sciences, and growth enterprises worldwide, is pleased to announce that Jess Krannich and Paul Sampson have joined the firm as partner and Of Counsel, respectively. Both will be based in the firm's Salt Lake City office.

Prior to joining Wilson Sonsini, Krannich and Sampson were both partners in the litigation department at Kirkland & Ellis. Krannich helped manage that firm's Utah office and headed its Salt Lake City litigation team.

""Even before we opened our Salt Lake City office in 2021, it was a priority for us to expand in line with client needs by bringing in highly talented attorneys with strong ties to the local and regional legal and business communities,"" said Doug Clark, managing partner at Wilson Sonsini. ""Like those who joined us before them, Jess and Paul have established important relationships and earned solid reputations for representing clients in a range of commercial litigation matters and trials. We're very pleased to welcome them both to our growing Salt Lake City team.""

Wilson Sonsini launched its Salt Lake City office in November 2021 with a base of three partners: Marc Porter, Matt Squires, and Justice Deno Himonas, following his early 2022 retirement as Utah Supreme Court Justice. Five months later, the firm announced the addition of another former Utah Supreme Court Justice, Christine Durham, who was the first woman to serve on both Utah's highest court and the state's district court. With the addition of Krannich and Sampson, Wilson Sonsini now has more than 20 attorneys based in its Salt Lake City office.

Krannich's practice spans multiple types of complex commercial litigation, including competition disputes ranging from trade secret and restrictive covenant litigation to intellectual property disputes, unfair competition, and antitrust litigation. He also has extensive experience in tort and product liability litigation and has represented clients in a variety of regulatory actions. Many of his cases involve class actions or consolidated multi-district litigation.

Krannich has won nearly 20 jury and bench trials, arbitrations, and injunctive hearings. He also has obtained early wins in large, complex cases through motion practice and strategic case development. Krannich has won multiple zero-liability or zero-damages awards on behalf of defendants, resulting in billions of dollars in savings, and has recovered more than $500 million on behalf of plaintiffs.

Krannich's clients have primarily been in competitive technology sectors, including the life sciences, medical devices, and computer sciences industries. He has also represented consumer products and financial services clients, including Apple, Inc.; British Petroleum; BDO USA, LLP; Route App, Inc.; Ivanti, Inc.; Owlet; Nexio; Savage Companies; and Sotheby's International Realty.

After graduating from law school, Krannich completed judicial clerkships for Chief Justice Christine M. Durham of the Utah Supreme Court and the Honorable Joan B. Gottschall of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. Following his clerkships, he joined Kirkland's Chicago office and was elevated to partner in 2011. In 2012, Krannich moved to Salt Lake City and joined elite boutique litigation firm Manning Curtis Bradshaw & Bednar. In 2021, he returned to Kirkland to help found and manage its Salt Lake City office.

In addition to his practice, Krannich is active in the Salt Lake City business and legal community. Since 2012, he has served as an Adjunct Professor of Law at the S.J. Quinney College of Law at the University of Utah, where he's taught trial advocacy and advanced negotiation. He currently serves as a member of the Salt Lake City Chamber of Commerce Board of Governors.

Krannich received a B.S., with honors, from the University of Utah in 2002. He received his J.D. from the S.J. Quinney College of Law at the University of Utah, graduating as a member of the Order of the Coif in 2005.

""One reason I'm excited about joining Wilson Sonsini is the firm's unique platform and representation of innovative clients -- from growing companies to established industry leaders -- because those clients face novel challenges, affording us the opportunity to represent them in interesting and engaging matters,"" said Krannich. ""Another reason is the chance to be part of the firm's growing and talented team, and to work with colleagues like Christine Durham and Deno Himonas.""

Sampson is a seasoned litigator with a wealth of experience in high-stakes litigation, including significant trial work. He has advised clients across industries such as biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, healthcare, consumer products, interstate shipping, energy, and financial services. Sampson has handled antitrust and consumer class actions, shareholder derivative actions, defamation lawsuits, and government investigation and enforcement actions involving the U.S. Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, state attorneys general, and the City of New York. Additionally, he represented a special litigation committee of a large pharmaceutical distributor's board of directors in shareholder derivative litigation related to opioid distribution and executive compensation issues.

Sampson has a proven track record of success in appellate matters. His experience includes briefing numerous appeals to the U.S. Supreme Court, various federal circuit courts, and several state supreme courts. Notably, Sampson recently secured a victory in the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, where he prevailed after delivering a compelling briefing and oral argument in a case involving federal employee benefits.

At the beginning of his legal career, Sampson served two judicial clerkships -- for the Honorable Justice Thomas R. Lee of the Utah Supreme Court and the Honorable Kent A. Jordan of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.

From 2016 to 2021, Sampson worked as an associate and later as counsel for trial boutique firm Wilkinson Walsh + Eskovitz LLP (now Wilkinson Stekloff LLP).

An investigative journalist has presented export data and contractual details on a BP-operated pipeline that he says show how Azerbaijani oil continues to flow to Israel via Turkey despite Ankara's trade boycott on the Israelis in response to actions in the Gaza war.

Turkish reporter-in-exile Metin Cihan (@metcihan) took a look at how oil from Azerbaijan's Caspian fields arrives at Turkey's port of Ceyhan via the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline, from where it is shipped across the Mediterranean to Israel's port of Haifa.

As bne IntelliNews reported in early May, the oil export operation appears to be continuing despite Turkey's trade ministry asserting on May 2 that ""all products"" were covered by the trade boycott announced due to the ""worsening humanitarian tragedy in Palestine [amid the conflict in Gaza]"".

The data looked at by Cihan is from Turkey's state-owned crude oil and gas company Botas. The BTC pipeline's Turkey section is managed by Botas, under the oversight of the Turkey Wealth Fund, led by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has accused the Israelis of committing ""genocide"" in their invasion and besieging of Gaza. Pipeline operator British Petroleum (BP) is the largest shareholder in the BTC.

Azerbaijan is a close ally of fellow Muslim-majority nation Turkey, but it is also seen as having strong relations with Israel. However, the BTC contractual information examined by Cihan indicate that is more than just geopolitical considerations that keeps the oil flowing to Israel.

Cihan said BTC agreements appear to obligate Turkey to maintain the flow of oil through the pipeline even in cases of conflict or terrorism. At the same time, Turkey receives only $0.80 per barrel of oil loaded onto tankers at Ceyhan, he said.

The BTC route is thought to supply around 40% of Israel's annual crude oil consumption.

Cihan stated that Turkey has no control or influence over the destination of the oil because Azerbaijan retains the right to sell the oil and determine its final buyers.

Export data on January show that in that month Israel was the top customer for Azerbaijani oil, importing 523,500 tonnes worth $297mn. Other significant suppliers of oil to Israel are Kazakhstan and Nigeria.

Israel -- which in the conflict with Palestinian militant group Hamas has refused to allow Turkey to join in international efforts to deliver aid to Gaza civilians -- has become a very important supplier of arms to Azerbaijan, with exports including combat drones from Israel Aerospace Industries, long-range artillery and surface-to-air missile systems. Israel also sells satellites to Azerbaijan.

In December, Erdogan and family members stated their intention to file a criminal complaint of insult and slander against Cihan who they said had falsely claimed a company associated with the Turkish president's son, Burak Erdogan, continued trading with Israel despite the Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip.

At the time, months before Turkey announced it would stop all trade with Israel, Erdogan was under growing pressure from critics who saw him as pursuing a ""words not action"" approach to the Israelis in relation to Gaza.",intellinews.com,news,Intellinews                        ,,-0.1058823529411764,454671612,1,https://d39raawggeifpx.cloudfront.net/styles/16_9_desktop/s3/articleimages/Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan_pipeline_(BTC_Pipeline).svg_Cropped.png,eng-9602339

Millions of barrels of Azerbaijani crude continue to fuel Israel's war machine thanks to the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline, which runs through Turkey to the country's southern Ceyhan port, where the oil is loaded onto tankers, and which is operated by British Petroleum (BP), the largest shareholder of the BTC, according to an investigative journalist citing export data from Turkey's state-owned crude oil company.

Investigative journalist Metin Cihan, who has been exposing trade relations between Turkey and Israel, detailed the controversial terms of the BTC agreements, which obligate Turkey to maintain the flow of oil through the pipeline even in cases of conflict or terrorism.

This stipulation, Cihan noted, prioritizes the oil trade over human rights and national sovereignty. Despite the critical nature of these terms, Turkey receives only $0.80 per barrel of oil loaded onto tankers at Ceyhan.

The BTC pipeline's Turkey section is managed by Turkey's state-owned company BOTA≈û under the oversight of the Turkey Wealth Fund, led by President Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan, and has been a critical infrastructure project since its inception.

According to BOTA≈û, millions of barrels of oil are shipped monthly from Ceyhan. The pipeline supplies around 40 percent of Israel's annual crude oil consumption.

Cihan stated that Turkey has no control or influence over the destination of the oil, as Azerbaijan retains the right to sell the oil and determine its final buyers.

In light of the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza, Turkey recently halted all bilateral trade with Israel until the conflict ends and aid can flow unhindered into Gaza.

The Gaza Strip is suffering a humanitarian crisis caused by Israel's military campaign against Hamas that started October 7.

Hamas staged an unprecedented attack on Israel on October 7 that resulted in the death of roughly 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and some 250 people taken hostage.

Israel's retaliatory offensive against Hamas has killed at least 36,050 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the Gaza health ministry, and has devastated the Gaza Strip.

Turkey is one of the most outspoken critics of Israel's war on Gaza, accusing the Israeli government of committing ""war crimes"" and ""genocide"" in the enclave. In early May Turkey's Trade Ministry announced that it was suspending all trade with Israel until it allows aid to enter Gaza unhindered during its offensive against Hamas militants.

Despite this, the BTC pipeline continues to function due to the binding agreements between BP and the governments involved that mandate the pipeline's operation regardless of regional developments.

The agreements, signed during Bill Clinton's presidency in 1999, are seen as one of the significant foreign policy successes of the United States, particularly for securing energy routes independent of Russian influence.

The agreements also require the states to align their domestic laws in favor of the pipeline's operations, further limiting Turkey's ability to impose sanctions or restrictions on the flow of oil to Israel.

The agreements have been criticized by experts and rights groups as ""colonialist,"" as they grant BP privileges and impose obligations on the signatory states that require them to relinquish part of their sovereignty to ensure the continued operation of the pipeline.

Cihan's previous investigations, based on official statistics and maritime traffic data, exposed the ongoing trade between Turkey and Israel since November.

Despite President Erdoƒüan's public condemnation of Israel's actions in Gaza, trade between Turkey and Israel has continued, contradicting the official rhetoric.

These revelations have sparked criticism and raised questions about the true extent of Turkey's support for Israel, particularly through the supply of critical materials like steel and cement, essential for military infrastructure.

Cihan argued that Turkey's trade practices with Israel indirectly support its military capabilities, which contradicts Erdoƒüan's public stance against Israel's military actions.

Following a defeat in the local elections in March, which is partly attributed to the ongoing trade with Israel amid the anti-Israeli sentiment among Turks, as well as a cost of living crisis exacerbated by rampant inflation, Erdoƒüan finally acknowledged Ankara's ongoing trade with Tel Aviv and restricted export of some materials in April, while announcing a complete halt to trade in May, after months of criticism.

Israel faced global condemnation after it struck a refugee camp in the southern Gaza city of Rafah on Sunday, killing dozens.

The International Court of Justice (ICJ) recently ordered Israel to halt its military offensive in Rafah and open the Rafah crossing for humanitarian aid. However, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dismissed the genocide charges brought against Israel by South Africa as ""false, outrageous, and morally repugnant,"" indicating Israel's likely non-compliance with the ICJ ruling.

This development follows an arrest warrant request by another international court's chief prosecutor for Netanyahu and Israeli defense minister Yoav Gallant as well as leaders of the Palestinian militant group Hamas.

Israeli-Turkish trade, which has survived numerous diplomatic disputes in the past, is facing a major challenge as Turkey suspends all bilateral trade with Israel in light of the ongoing Gaza conflict, according to a report by Reuters. Turkey's decision has been criticized by Israel as a violation of World Trade Organization rules.

Israeli importers are now looking for alternative sources of vital goods such as cement, food and cars, which could lead to short-term shortages but is not expected to have a significant impact on the 500 billion dollar Israeli economy.

The suspension of trade by Turkey, which accounted for a significant portion of Israel's cement imports, has forced Israeli industry to turn to more expensive European suppliers. Despite these disruptions, Israeli officials and economists, including Shmuel Abramzon, chief economist at Israel's Ministry of Finance, believe the overall economic impact will be minimal. In retaliation, Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich has suggested suspending the free trade agreement with Turkey until President Erdoƒüan steps down.",turkishminute.com,news,turkishminute.com,Turkish Minute,-0.3333333333333334,454624090,1,https://www.turkishminute.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/kirkuk-ceyhan.jpg,eng-9602339

More than half of the foreign businesses that announced plans to leave Russia after the start of the Ukraine conflict have remained in the country, the Financial Times reported on Monday. A rebound in consumer activity and ""bureaucratic obstacles"" are making the companies stay, the outlet suggested.

British businesses such as cosmetics brand Avon and consumer goods company Reckitt, as well as French industrial gas producer Air Liquide, are among 2,173 overseas firms that continue to operate in Russia as of May 5, according to data compiled by the Kiev School of Economics. Around 1,600 firms either exited or curtailed their operations in the country, it added.

Scores of Western companies pledged to leave the Russian market shortly after Moscow launched its military operation against Ukraine in February 2022. Carmakers Volkswagen and Renault, oil and gas multinationals Shell and British Petroleum, fast-food chain McDonald's, and Swedish furniture giant IKEA are among those that completed their exits.

Firms that left in the first weeks of the conflict saw ""a moral imperative"" to do so, an executive working with Western companies in Russia told FT. However, there has since been ""a noticeable change in sentiment,"" he added.

""The current wave is more about, 'Do you really have to leave? Do you want to leave?' Some of these companies have built four, five factories over 30 years. They're not going to sell that for a 90% discount,"" the outlet quoted the executive as saying.

The sale of assets to Russian buyers by Western companies requires approval by a government commission headed by Finance Minister Anton Siluanov. The Finance Ministry imposed a mandatory 50% discount on the sale of assets belonging to firms from ""unfriendly"" countries, and a minimum 15% ""exit tax,"" Russian media previously reported.

Russia's strong economic performance is reportedly also a factor in the decision by foreign firms to remain, with the country's gross domestic product (GDP) growing by 5.4% year-on-year in the first quarter of 2024, according to preliminary data released by the national statistics service, Rosstat. In April, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said it expected the Russian economy to grow faster than all advanced economies this year. GDP is forecast to expand by 3.2%, exceeding the expected growth rates for the US (2.7%), the UK (0.5%), Germany (0.2%), and France (0.7%).

Real wages in Russia also grew by nearly 8% last year - the biggest jump in five years, according to Rosstat.

Mondelez, Unilever, and Nestle are also among those that opted to stay. The chief executive of confectionery giant Mondelez recently told the FT that the firm's shareholders did not ""morally care"" whether the group exited the country.

Russian President Vladimir Putin set a goal earlier this month for the country to have the fourth-highest GDP - measured by purchasing power parity - in the world, by 2030.

In April, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said it expected the Russian economy to grow faster than all advanced economies this year. GDP is forecast to expand by 3.2%, exceeding the expected growth rates for the US (2.7%), the UK (0.5%), Germany (0.2%), and France (0.7%).

Real wages in Russia also grew by nearly 8% last year - the biggest jump in five years, according to Rosstat.

Mondelez, Unilever, and Nestle are also among those that opted to stay. The chief executive of confectionery giant Mondelez recently told the FT that the firm's shareholders did not ""morally care"" whether the group exited the country.

Millions of barrels of Azerbaijani crude continue to fuel Israel's war machine thanks to the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline, which runs through Turkey to the country's southern Ceyhan port, where the oil is loaded onto tankers, and which is operated by British Petroleum (BP), the largest shareholder of the BTC, according to an investigative journalist citing export data from Turkey's state-owned crude oil company.

Investigative journalist Metin Cihan, who has been exposing trade relations between Turkey and Israel, detailed the controversial terms of the BTC agreements, which obligate Turkey to maintain the flow of oil through the pipeline even in cases of conflict or terrorism.

This stipulation, Cihan noted, prioritizes the oil trade over human rights and national sovereignty. Despite the critical nature of these terms, Turkey receives only $0.80 per barrel of oil loaded onto tankers at Ceyhan.

The BTC pipeline's Turkey section is managed by Turkey's state-owned company BOTA≈û under the oversight of the Turkey Wealth Fund, led by President Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan, and has been a critical infrastructure project since its inception.

According to BOTA≈û, millions of barrels of oil are shipped monthly from Ceyhan. The pipeline supplies around 40 percent of Israel's annual crude oil consumption.

Cihan stated that Turkey has no control or influence over the destination of the oil, as Azerbaijan retains the right to sell the oil and determine its final buyers.

In light of the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza, Turkey recently halted all bilateral trade with Israel until the conflict ends and aid can flow unhindered into Gaza.

The Gaza Strip is suffering a humanitarian crisis caused by Israel's military campaign against Hamas that started October 7.

Hamas staged an unprecedented attack on Israel on October 7 that resulted in the death of roughly 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and some 250 people taken hostage.

Israel's retaliatory offensive against Hamas has killed at least 36,050 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the Gaza health ministry, and has devastated the Gaza Strip.

Turkey is one of the most outspoken critics of Israel's war on Gaza, accusing the Israeli government of committing ""war crimes"" and ""genocide"" in the enclave. In early May Turkey's Trade Ministry announced that it was suspending all trade with Israel until it allows aid to enter Gaza unhindered during its offensive against Hamas militants.

Despite this, the BTC pipeline continues to function due to the binding agreements between BP and the governments involved that mandate the pipeline's operation regardless of regional developments.

The agreements, signed during Bill Clinton's presidency in 1999, are seen as one of the significant foreign policy successes of the United States, particularly for securing energy routes independent of Russian influence.

The agreements also require the states to align their domestic laws in favor of the pipeline's operations, further limiting Turkey's ability to impose sanctions or restrictions on the flow of oil to Israel.

The agreements have been criticized by experts and rights groups as ""colonialist,"" as they grant BP privileges and impose obligations on the signatory states that require them to relinquish part of their sovereignty to ensure the continued operation of the pipeline.

Cihan's previous investigations, based on official statistics and maritime traffic data, exposed the ongoing trade between Turkey and Israel since November.

Despite President Erdoƒüan's public condemnation of Israel's actions in Gaza, trade between Turkey and Israel has continued, contradicting the official rhetoric.

These revelations have sparked criticism and raised questions about the true extent of Turkey's support for Israel, particularly through the supply of critical materials like steel and cement, essential for military infrastructure.

Cihan argued that Turkey's trade practices with Israel indirectly support its military capabilities, which contradicts Erdoƒüan's public stance against Israel's military actions.

Following a defeat in the local elections in March, which is partly attributed to the ongoing trade with Israel amid the anti-Israeli sentiment among Turks, as well as a cost of living crisis exacerbated by rampant inflation, Erdoƒüan finally acknowledged Ankara's ongoing trade with Tel Aviv and restricted export of some materials in April, while announcing a complete halt to trade in May, after months of criticism.

Israel faced global condemnation after it struck a refugee camp in the southern Gaza city of Rafah on Sunday, killing dozens.

The International Court of Justice (ICJ) recently ordered Israel to halt its military offensive in Rafah and open the Rafah crossing for humanitarian aid. However, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dismissed the genocide charges brought against Israel by South Africa as ""false, outrageous, and morally repugnant,"" indicating Israel's likely non-compliance with the ICJ ruling.

This development follows an arrest warrant request by another international court's chief prosecutor for Netanyahu and Israeli defense minister Yoav Gallant as well as leaders of the Palestinian militant group Hamas.

Israeli-Turkish trade, which has survived numerous diplomatic disputes in the past, is facing a major challenge as Turkey suspends all bilateral trade with Israel in light of the ongoing Gaza conflict, according to a report by Reuters. Turkey's decision has been criticized by Israel as a violation of World Trade Organization rules.

Israeli importers are now looking for alternative sources of vital goods such as cement, food and cars, which could lead to short-term shortages but is not expected to have a significant impact on the 500 billion dollar Israeli economy.

The suspension of trade by Turkey, which accounted for a significant portion of Israel's cement imports, has forced Israeli industry to turn to more expensive European suppliers. Despite these disruptions, Israeli officials and economists, including Shmuel Abramzon, chief economist at Israel's Ministry of Finance, believe the overall economic impact will be minimal. In retaliation, Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich has suggested suspending the free trade agreement with Turkey until President Erdoƒüan steps down.",turkishminute.com,news,turkishminute.com,Turkish Minute,-0.3333333333333334,454608194,1,https://www.turkishminute.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/kirkuk-ceyhan.jpg,eng-9602339

More than half of the foreign businesses that announced plans to leave Russia after the start of the Ukraine conflict have remained in the country, the Financial Times reported on Monday. A rebound in consumer activity and ""bureaucratic obstacles"" are making the companies stay, the outlet suggested.

British businesses such as cosmetics brand Avon and consumer goods company Reckitt, as well as French industrial gas producer Air Liquide, are among 2,173 overseas firms that continue to operate in Russia as of May 5, according to data compiled by the Kiev School of Economics. Around 1,600 firms either exited or curtailed their operations in the country, it added.

Scores of Western companies pledged to leave the Russian market shortly after Moscow launched its military operation against Ukraine in February 2022. Carmakers Volkswagen and Renault, oil and gas multinationals Shell and British Petroleum, fast-food chain McDonald's, and Swedish furniture giant IKEA are among those that completed their exits.

Firms that left in the first weeks of the conflict saw ""a moral imperative"" to do so, an executive working with Western companies in Russia told FT. However, there has since been ""a noticeable change in sentiment,"" he added.

""The current wave is more about, 'Do you really have to leave? Do you want to leave?' Some of these companies have built four, five factories over 30 years. They're not going to sell that for a 90% discount,"" the outlet quoted the executive as saying.

The sale of assets to Russian buyers by Western companies requires approval by a government commission headed by Finance Minister Anton Siluanov.

GDP is forecast to expand by 3.2%, exceeding the expected growth rates for the US (2.7%), the UK (0.5%), Germany (0.2%), and France (0.7%).

Real wages in Russia also grew by nearly 8% last year - the biggest jump in five years, according to Rosstat.

Mondelez, Unilever, and Nestle are also among those that opted to stay. The chief executive of confectionery giant Mondelez recently told the FT that the firm's shareholders did not ""morally care"" whether the group exited the country.

A rebound in consumer activity and ""bureaucratic obstacles"" are making the companies stay, the outlet suggested.

British businesses such as cosmetics brand Avon and consumer goods company Reckitt, as well as French industrial gas producer Air Liquide, are among 2,173 overseas firms that continue to operate in the sanctioned country as of May 5, according to data compiled by the Kiev School of Economics. Around 1,600 firms either exited Russia or curtailed their operations, it added.

Scores of Western companies pledged to leave the Russian market shortly after Moscow launched its military operation against Ukraine in February 2022. Carmakers Volkswagen and Renault, oil and gas multinationals Shell and British Petroleum, fast-food chain McDonald's, and Swedish furniture giant IKEA are among those that completed their exits.

Firms that left in the first weeks of the conflict saw ""a moral imperative"" to do so, an executive working with Western companies in Russia told FT. However, there has since been ""a noticeable change in sentiment,"" he added.

""The current wave is more about, 'Do you really have to leave? Do you want to leave?' Some of these companies have built four, five factories over 30 years. They're not going to sell that for a 90% discount,"" the outlet quoted the executive as saying.

The sale of assets to Russian buyers by Western companies requires approval by a government commission headed by Finance Minister Anton Siluanov. The Finance Ministry imposed a mandatory 50% discount on the sale of assets belonging to firms from ""unfriendly"" countries, and a minimum 15% ""exit tax,"" Russian media previously reported.

The contamination, which in some isolated lots is more than 10 times the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) standard for residential areas, is a legacy of the Anaconda Copper Mining Company's (ACM) refining and smelting works that once dominated the north shore of the Missouri River.

Crews under the direction of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have already begun peeling back the sod at homes along the southwestern edge of town. The work is close in, navigating shrubs and flower beds in neighborhoods where many of the houses are nearly 100 years old. Hand shoveling keeps the damage to trees and fragile foundations down to a minimum.

According to the EPA the work is expected to take the next two summers to complete. The work is being paid for the Atlantic Richfield Company, a subsidiary of British Petroleum, which purchased the former Anaconda smelter in 1977 operating it for only three years before it finally closed for good in 1980. Last year Atlantic Richfield signed a Consent Decree with the U.S. Justice Department agreeing to complete cleanups in Black Eagle at an estimated cost of $3.9 million.

However, the cleanup itself is only a final chapter to the story of the Anaconda Copper Mining Company. It's legacy has been both good and bad to the people of Black Eagle.

In its day the Anaconda Copper Mining Company was a titan of industry. From the 1920s through the 1960s ACM dominated copper production, not only in the U.S. but with mines in Chile, Mexico, and Poland. The cornerstone of the company's history and culture lay in Montana, founded upon the copper mines in Butte, smelted in the mills of Anaconda, processed and wrought pure within the plants at Great Falls - more specifically, the community of Black Eagle.

During peak production before the Great Depression the plants in Black Eagle employed more than 2,000 men. The ACM copper works were producing as much as 27 million pounds of copper a month - wire and rod used to electrify America and the bombshell casings that helped to win two world wars. The Black Eagle plant also became the largest producer of zinc in the United States, an element critical to the production of paints, rubber, plastics, inks, batteries, textiles, and electrical equipment.

The town of Black Eagle never grew much beyond the nearly 1,000 people who live there now. Most ACM employees simply commuted across the river from their tree-lined neighborhoods in Great Falls. Black Eagle was and remains a working class, unincorporated and fiercely independent blue-collar town. Many of its original citizens emigrated from Italy or Croatia, with a healthy sprinkling of Swedes, Norwegians, Finns, Germans, and Poles.

The ACM, which most people simply referred to as ""The Company,"" had a dark legacy too. Throughout most of its history the men who made the decisions at ACM's paid only cursory attention to the environmental damage their operations were wreaking. According to the EPA, waste material containing lead, arsenic, cadmium, antimony, and zinc were for a long time simply pushed into the Missouri River, a practice that only stopped following the completion of Rainbow Dam in 1915 which blocked the flow of waste further downstream.

""It is likely that dumping of waste into the Missouri River continued at a reduced rate after 1915 until the facility closed in the 1970s,"" the EPA concludes.

In total its believed that more than 30 million cubic yards of toxic mine waste was shoved into the river. Elevated levels of lead and arsenic have been detected in sediments as far away as Fort Benton, 40 miles downstream from where the old ACM reduction works once stood.

In town the primary means to protect adjacent neighborhoods from contamination was to build an enormous smokestack. In Black Eagle ""The Stack"" stood 501 feet high, intended to propel toxic gases, smelter wastes and flue dusts high above the ground to drift harmlessly away across an unpopulated area.

It was good in theory, but in practice there were multiple smaller smokestacks scattered across ACM's industrial grounds, each spewing out its own blend of toxins at a much lower level. And there were frequent days when there was either no wind at all, or it came in from an opposing direction making the big stack's height irrelevant. Black Eagle could be a very smokey place.

""It wasn't very fresh air,"" recalled Sarah Peck, a lifelong resident of Black Eagle and the current Director of the Black Eagle Technical Advisory Group (BETAG). ""When I was little, you'd have the stack smoking and the refinery smelling. It could be pretty awful.""

""You could even taste it,"" Monte Marzetta said.

Marzetta, 84, is current President of the Black Eagle Civic Club and a longtime activist with the BETAG. He worked for 23 years as an electrician at the Anaconda Copper Mine Company, visiting every building within the hillside complex within his three decades at ACM.

""I was raised on the lower north side, and when we were kids, we'd go down and play by the river,"" he recalled of his childhood. ""All the raw sewage used to dump directly into the Missouri River. Great Falls did it and so did Black Eagle.""

Liquid wastes like process solutions, acids and rinsate from historical facility operations were frequently spilled or intentionally dumped in lots or on undeveloped drainages. The ACM's industrial grounds could be a hazardous place to work.

""I spent the last few years at the wire mill, which wasn't too bad,"" Marzetta said of working conditions within the ACM complex. ""But if you got down to the lower part of the zinc plant there were some pretty bad areas down there.""

And so it went for more than 60 years. By the 1970s most of the richest copper and zinc deposits in Butte had already played out. In 1977 the oil and gas giant Atlantic Richfield bought ACM hoping to diversify its corporate portfolio. Political turmoil, a crash in global copper prices, and a nationwide strike sealed the fate of the reduction works in Black Eagle, which closed permanently in 1980. Atlantic Richfield was bought by British Petroleum (BP) in 2000, making the European energy company the second largest in the world.

""The 'Stack' blew the contaminants out and they landed on the roofs,"" Peck explained. ""Then the rain and snow washed them down off the houses, so now most of it is concentrated on the drip lines.""

However, the environmental impacts of eight decades of heavy metals production could not be wiped away with a single multi-billion-dollar contract. From the very beginning both the EPA and Atlantic Richfield knew there were likely going to be problems in Black Eagle.

The EPA's Record of Decision released in August 2021 records that within a year of the ACM refinery's closure in 1980, 27 ""areas of concern"" on the former refinery site had been identified, and that areas of ground and surface-water contamination were documented by 1983.

Still nothing was done. It took ACM 17 years to file a voluntary clean-up plan for the site. Once submitted Montana's Department of Environmental Quality found ACM's plan to be ""incomplete"" and subsequently asked the EPA to review any of ACM's cleanup activities.

In 2003 the EPA conducted site inspections focusing upon residential areas in Black Eagle and the northern tier of Great Falls facing the Missouri River. The results of the 2003 investigation found 375 residences in Black Eagle with elevated levels of lead and arsenic contamination. It's believed that most of this contamination came from the regular mix of smoke, gasses and dust that regularly rained down across the town.

Other factors played into the contamination. ACM was well known for supplying perks to its employees like cigarettes and lottery tickets, and free firewood gleaned from the railroad ties and demolished buildings ACM disposed of. There was also a ubiquitous supply of lead-based green paint that nearly every house in Black Eagle was slathered in.

Lead, which can cause irreversible brain damage in children and damage to the kidneys and nervous system in adults, is now a common contaminant in most of Black Eagle's yards. But the risk to residents was never only a matter of smoke and paint.

Take a look at a map of where the highest concentrations of lead and arsenic lie and you'll discover a patchwork of contamination. Yards lying directly adjacent to each other in Black Eagle often range between levels that are undetectable to those more than 10-times greater than EPA guidelines. This, in large part, is due to the once common practice of property owners bringing in refinery slag to fill in low spots in their yards and surrounding grounds.

""They'd bring in the slag to fill it in because it was cheap,"" Peck explained. ""There were different slag deposits they'd bring in to landscape their yards.""

""My land is clean, but the guy right next door to me - they hauled in a bunch to stuff to use as backfill,"" Marzetta said. ""I'm sure it all came from the slag piles. They just wanted something to fill in there, so they hauled it up and dumped it. Now that's contaminated, so they're going to have to tear all that out.""

Serious concerns about lead and arsenic contamination in Black Eagle was not a clear community concern until after an EPA investigation in the early 2000s. The first alarm was sounded by Herb Sobeczek, a Black Eagle resident who became a regular presence at Cascade County Commission meetings in the mid-2000s.

""Herb was the guy who went to all the commission meetings,"" Peck recalled. ""In the early 2000s he started to challenge the county commission. He's the one who really got it going.""

Herb's appeals to take some action in Black Eagle initially fell on deaf ears, but he found an ally in Cascade County Commissioner Joe Briggs, who first took office in January of 2005.

""My mother was born in Black Eagle, and I had four uncles on my mother's side who all worked at ACM,"" Briggs explained. ""The old house at 1511 Smelter Avenue was my grandmother's house when I was little, and it became my aunt's house later on, so I knew Black Eagle. I think Herb found a sympathetic ear, perhaps, to start working the issue at the commission level.""

In the same year as the copper refinery closed in Black Eagle the federal government created an environmental remediation program as the Superfund. Sites that make it on to the Superfund's National Priorities List are considered the most highly contaminated sites in the nation and are eligible for court-ordered cleanup funds from violators and/or federal funding if no violators can be found.

In 2007 the EPA conducted a Superfund Site assessment focusing upon residential areas within Black Eagle and a northern slice of Great Falls adjacent to the Missouri River. In total more than 7,200 individual soil samples were analyzed for arsenic, cadmium, copper, lead, and zinc. Almost no significant contamination was found in Great Falls, but in Black Eagle a large area was found with elevated levels of arsenic and lead.

However, whether the community of Black Eagle would or would not be designated as a Superfund site was a political decision and would only come if a majority of the residents believed such a designation was in their best interests. According to Briggs, it wasn't an easy decision to make.

""There was a lot of the public that lived up there who weren't too concerned about the contamination and really didn't want to be designated as a Superfund site,"" he explained. ""They asked some very legitimate questions like, if I want to sell my property what happens if it's a Superfund site?

""We had some people who were genuinely afraid of what was going to happen to them financially, but we also had a group of people who were concerned about the long-term health impacts.""

Briggs noted that the residents of Black Eagle have a long-time historical connection to gardening. For many people the prospect of having work crews tearing out flower beds was an unpleasant one, but the alternative was nearly equally unappealing.

""When the issue first came up a lot of the questions we were getting revolved around 'Am I safe to eat the vegetables out of my garden?'"" he said. ""You also have little kids up there and then you add to it the age of some of the houses and the lead paint that was on them. It made it a complex issue, but at the end of the day we decided becoming a Superfund site was the only way things were going to get moved forward.""

With an appeal from then Gov. Brian Schweitzer and the support of Montana's Congressional delegation, Black Eagle was added to the Superfund National Priorities List in 2011. Both Atlantic Richfield and the Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad (BNSF) were identified as potentially responsible parties and thus liable for the cleanup costs.

The expectation was that the work at Black Eagle would be completed in a timely fashion. That was nearly 12 years ago.

The EPA has divided the area around the old Anaconda Copper industrial works into three categories, identified as OU1 for residential areas, OU2 for the smelter and refinery site, and OU3 for the Missouri River itself. The current cleanup project only addresses soil contamination in Black Eagle's residential neighborhoods.

Atlantic Richfield launched a new round of testing in 2011. The testing was free and optional to Black Eagle's residents. Over two years more than 8,750 soil samples were taken across approximately 500 properties. While Atlantic Richfield tested for a wide range of contaminants, lead and arsenic were of the greatest concern. Contamination levels ranged from undetectable to 7,200 parts-per-million (ppm) for lead and 1,850 ppm for arsenic. The EPA guidelines for residential soils call for no more than 400 ppm of lead and 175 ppm for arsenic.

""To address immediate threats to human health and the environment, EPA removed approximately 1,200 cubic yards of contaminated soil from the Moose Lodge property in Black Eagle in November 2011,"" an EPA news release states. The soil was disposed of at the High Plains landfill.

""From September through November of 2020, EPA conducted second time-critical removal of approximately 3,200 cubic yards of soils contaminated with lead and arsenic in advance of a Black Eagle Water and Sewer District's construction project to replace aging water and sewer lines. The soil was placed in the former smelter site area.""

Many of the most contaminated sites are along what was once the BNSF's rail bed leading to the smelter. Marzetta recalled how that rail line was the main route for the transport of partially refined zinc, a crushed and smelted ore with a consistency somewhat akin to a heavy clay.

""They brought all their concentrate in by rail for the zinc plant,"" he said. ""It was brought in in 'gondola cars', and then they'd run it through a process out here to make regular zinc. That's where most of the contamination came in - on the railroad bed.""

""The area with the highest concentrations of arsenic and lead in soil and dust was from the oldest parts of Black Eagle,"" a 2019 EPA publication states. ""The area is also downwind from the railroad corridor. It is believed that the residences in this area were exposed to the aerial emissions from the historical smelter stack as well as to ongoing fugitive dust from the railroad corridor.""

While BNSF did complete a contaminated soils cleanup at Art Higgins Memorial Park in Black Eagle in 2014, the corporation has yet to agree to its share of remedial actions for the rest of the railroad corridor. Peck said that in her opinion the railroad has dug in its heels due to concerns over a possible larger legal liability.

""You have the whole rail line from Anaconda to Great Falls,"" she noted of the 170-mile route that weaves through the Beaverhead-Deerlodge and Helena National Forests. ""If they take responsibility in Black Eagle, are they going to have to take responsibility clear to Anaconda?""

In August 2021 a Record of Decision was issued jointly by the EPA and Montana Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) detailing the environmental findings and plan of action for cleanup of Black Eagle's residential areas. In most cases the excavations will take away the top six inches of topsoil, storing it at a site within the closed industrial grounds before a permanent sealed repository is constructed.

There is no cost to residents to participate. Those who agree to the mediation efforts will receive $1,000 for their inconvenience. Residents have been assured that new topsoil and sod will be transplanted to their homes. The care extends down to preserving any perennial flower bulbs a homeowner might want to save.

""If they dig up your garden or lawn, they'll replace it with sod and put it back the way it was or better,"" Marzetta avowed.

""Black Eagle and the county aren't pushing for the old smelter site to be cleaned to a residential standard because it would be too much work,"" Peck said. ""They (BP) could ultimately do nothing and fence it off forever with it off limits to everybody, but they're working with us to make it a recreation area, so it will be cleaned up to recreation levels.""

Monte Marzetta noted that several schemes have been posited to turn the old refinery into a money-making venture.

""George Willet from Showdown was up here and talking about putting a ski run on it,"" Marzetta said. ""Then there was going to be an amphitheater and a replica of the old stack. I don't think any of it will ever happen. You might see some trails or something like that, but that's about it.""

Whether any substantial cleanup effort ever takes place on the ACMs industrial grounds or for the Missouri River is still an open question. The old industrial site alone covers more than 5,000 acres and the cost to restore it to residential soil contamination standards would be enormous.

As for the Missouri River, it seems highly unlikely that any effort to dredge 40 miles of river bottom will ever take place, and if it did wouldn't it actually hurt the riverine environment more that it would help it?

""There is still testing planned for the other sections of the Superfund site,"" Commissioner Briggs said, ""which includes the actual industrial plant area and the river. The testing in OU2 which is the industrial plant has been underway for a year or so, but there's been no Record of Decision from the EPA as to how to handle it. The testing in the river has barely begun.""

What can be said with certainty is that the citizens of Black Eagle will soon be able to buy, sell, and accurately describe their individual properties as complying with federal contamination levels. Getting to this point has been the work of generations.

""I'm really glad to see it get cleaned up, but it wasn't a slam-dunk,"" Briggs commented. ""This has been a long haul. We're on our third representative from the EPA on this, and the project has gone through two managers who have both since retired.""

""From the standpoint of the citizens of Black Eagle, they can see the end of the tunnel,"" Briggs added, ""but from the whole project standpoint I wouldn't want to guess how far away we are on the whole thing.""",yahoo.com,news,Yahoo,,0.09019607843137245,454204454,34,https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/3c80hw7JTAABr.RjEC3faw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD0xNTYwO2NmPXdlYnA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/great-falls-tribune/a658cb38629ba9ff0ff3a697a5ad43d9,

The more pronounced energy consumption caused by the rapid growth of the world economy is creating many energy challenges. According to the British Petroleum's global energy outlook, even in the context of electrification, oil will continue to hold the largest share of the energy structure (31.2%) throughout the 2020s. Oil is projected to account for the significant contribution of transportation energy consumption by 2050, and its demand for highway traffic will remain important. In this scenario, new engine technologies to enhance engine efficiency and that are capable of meeting the increasingly stringent future emission policy for transportation, that is moving towards the zero-carbon target, are urgent.

The aim of this Special Issue is to collect and disseminate the efforts of select researchers regarding analysis, modeling, and control strategies and the application of sustainable fuels in internal combustion engines.

Speaking at the inaugural Dele Momodu Annual Lecture in Lagos recently, Prof. Nnaji observed that in the last few years, the West, particularly Western Europe, had been mounting relentless pressure on other countries of the world to embrace cleaner energy through solar, wind, and other forms of renewable energy like hydropower.

The West, according to him, has been asking mostly developing nations to abandon coal in particular, referring to it as the greatest environmental pollutant through carbon emission.

They have even added natural gas to the list of fuels that should be banned to make the world limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Centigrade by 2030, as required by the Paris Accord on Climate Change of 2015.

However, these pressure which had been mounting, took a twist n 2022 following Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent series of sanctions on Russia by the west, Moscow had in return, took punitive actions against Western countries like Germany, which depended largely on gas imports from Russia.

Prof. Nnaji noted that due to this action by Russia, Germany, the largest European economy, decided to revive coal-fired plants that it had resolved, under Angela Merkel, to close down. ""Though there were no imminent threats of power shortages in Germany, Berlin chose to reverse its policy on coal plants rather than risk in any way the chance of its people suffering any form of electricity crisis.

Germany was not alone. ""The United Kingdom, which had prided itself on shutting down its coal-fired power plants and on building large wind farms, decided to resuscitate its coal plants. Why? It didn't want its citizens to suffer the 2022 heatwave unduly,"" Prof. Nnaji said.

He added also that France when faced with winter which could hurt its people, chose to extend the lifespans of its coal-fired plants even though electricity from coal was responsible for only 0.6% of national electricity production,. ""The French government had to extend the lifespans of coal-fired plants just to protect its people. This is the country where 196 states, including Vatican City, signed the famous Paris Accord on Climate Change under the United Nations auspices!

""The United States is proud that several of its coal-fired plants have been decommissioned. Coal used to account for 50% of America's electricity, but the figure has now reduced to about 17.8% and it is expected that it may decline to 4% by 2030. Environmentalists are delighted at the rapid decline. But it would appear that the decline has not been driven by as much commitment to environmental protection as by economics, even though the Joe Biden administration has a special envoy on climate change. It is easier and cheaper to run a natural gas-fired plant than a coal-fired one, thanks to enhanced shale gas production and other issues. In fact, fossil fuels make up 60% of the total fuel to power since gas contributes more than 42% of fuel to power in America.

""The Donald Trump administration used to celebrate the ubiquity of coal all over the United States; its affordability; the convenience of its storage and use; the ease of its transportation; its generous use by steel, aluminium, and cement manufacturers; its extensive use by railway firms; the millions of American workers who depended on it; its host communities; several American businesses that relied on it directly and indirectly; and its key role in America's industrial history.

""There is something that we should know from the Americans as they deactivate their coal plants: a great concern for the common good. The United States Department of Energy has been looking for ways to fill the gap created by the declining coal plants. It thinks that converting the coal plants to nuclear plants will result in additional $275m annually in economic activities in the host community. It wants the affected coal plants replaced by nuclear power plants. This is to ensure that the electricity workers retain their jobs, and the host communities remain economically active. There is the argument that repurposing the plants from coal-fired to nuclear will reduce the cost of building brand new stations by 35%. A nuclear plant requires a fraction of the fuel needed by, say, a coal plant to produce the same amount of power. But its waste water is dangerous and the primary raw material used for nuclear energy is uranium, which is mined and, therefore, constitutes environmental degradation,"" he added.

Prof. Nnaji also revealed that it is not only nations that have displayed self-interests in the dialogue over fossil fuels, big oil and gas companies like Shell, Exxon Mobil, TotalEnergies, Chevron, and British Petroleum have also showed self-interests.

He noted that Exxon-Mobil and Chevron did not claim to be as committed to cleaner energy as their European counterparts.

According to him, Shell, under Ben van Beurden's leadership, tried to sell itself as a leader in the vanguard of the campaign for clean energy and paid a price for it. While it was posting huge profits, its stock performance on the exchanges was flat, unlike those of Chevron and ExxonMobil. Investors were not sure whether Shell was an oil and gas firm or one dealing in renewables.

""All this changed with the assumption of office of Wael Sawan, the Lebanese-Canadian, as its chief executive in January 2023. Sawan has left no one in doubt that his loyalty is not to environmentalists but to shareholders. Shell has resumed heavy investments in oil and gas. It has reduced its climate ambitions by scaling down its goal of reducing the net carbon intensity of its energy products from 20% to 15 % by 2030. Its investments in renewables came down from $3.5 billion in 2022 to $2.7 billion in 2023.

""Shell is not alone. The other British superpower petroleum company, BP, has taken similar steps. Its investments in low-carbon energy are seven times less than its investments in fossil fuels, while those of Shell are five times lower. TotalEnergies of France in April of 2023 announced a reduction of its climate ambitions from 35%-40% in emissions in 2030 to 20%30% the same period.

""The Shell CEO has an interesting explanation for the new ongoing huge investments in oil and gas by the petroleum majors: the world needs energy security. I believe he really meant the Western nations,"" he added.",realnewsmagazine.net,news,Realnews Magazine,,-0.03529411764705881,454003376,1,https://realnewsmagazine.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-986.png,eng-9587050

Quantifiable progress remains elusive.

City council members received power consumption data at a May 16 committee meeting for the first time since making that pledge and joining Duke Energy's nascent Clean Energy Connection program in 2021. The subscription-based initiative allows customers to support its statewide solar plants and receive monthly bill credits.

St. Petersburg has received about 40% of the clean energy kilowatt hours it requested from Duke. The city's power consumption has increased 9% since 2012.

""We have set an ambitious goal for ourselves and are falling far short is what it boils down to,"" said Councilmember Richie Floyd. ""It just doesn't seem like much progress is being made.""

Councilmember Brandi Gabbard requested the presentation at a Health, Energy, Resilience and Sustainability Committee meeting in February. At the time, she said the city could explore forming a municipal electric utility as its 30-year contract with St. Petersburg-based Duke Florida expires in 2026.

The committee did not revisit that topic May 16. They did, however, receive some long-awaited data.

Alison Mihalich, sustainability and resilience director, explained that while energy consumption has increased by 9%, the number of electric customers has spiked 22% since 2012. She attributed that to ""substantial population growth.""

Residential usage outpaces the commercial and government sectors. Mihalic said the transition to working from home during the pandemic exacerbated that trend.

Over 14% of the state's energy comes from the sun. Mihalic said that is a ""decent amount"" and expects a significant increase over the next decade.

City officials established five pathways to utilizing 100% clean energy by 2035 and an 80% emissions reduction by 2050. Mihalic said the Clean Energy Connection (CEC) program is a ""powerful tool"" that can help achieve those goals. Floyd called it ""convoluted.""

""I don't understand how the shares are done; I don't know what the outcome is going to be,"" he added. ""I'm not personally comfortable investing in that ... so it makes me skeptical on the city side, as well.""

Derick Farfan, lead strategy and planning manager with Duke, attempted to explain the program twice. CEC customers pay an $8.35 monthly subscription fee and request an allotment of kilowatt hours they expect to use.

In addition to the typical mix of fossil fuel-derived energy sources, like natural gas, participants receive an additional allotment of solar power. Farfan said Duke now operates 10 statewide solar plants.

CEC participants receive solar power according to how much they invest in the fully subscribed program. While costs fluctuate, Farfan said the average customer spends about $1 more per kilowatt.

""The first years of the program - it is not going to lower the bill,"" he said. ""You're going to be paying a little more on your bill every year until roughly around year eight or nine.""

Farfan said Duke could increase the city's CEC allotment to about 59% of its requested amount. He added that the company needs a decision as soon as possible.

Gabbard stressed that the council and mayoral administration should make that determination collaboratively. ""I want us to have comprehensive conversations about our renewable energy goals,"" she said. ""I just don't want this to be something that happens in the back rooms and doesn't get discussed out here in the light.""

Mihalic suggested installing city-owned solar facilities while the program matures. She also wants to see annual reports from Duke before increasing St. Petersburg's CEC investment.

City officials also lack residential solar and citywide emissions data. ""I would respectfully request that we keep this as a referral item,"" Mihalic said. ""Once we've completed that inventory, we can report back. And also report back on the renewable energy credits ...""

Floyd said the committee would continue discussing the ""complicated topic"" at future meetings. The update followed a decidedly more straightforward and celebratory presentation.

Mihalic began the meeting by highlighting how the city will spend its final $1.06 million in BP oil spill (formerly British Petroleum) settlement funding. Administrators removed an $850,000 tree inventory study from the initial proposal and will now provide Tampa Bay Watch with $403,000 to support seagrass restoration efforts.

The revised proposal also includes $400,000 for energy-efficient municipal building upgrades and electric vehicle infrastructure, $150,000 to create two new community food forests, $75,000 for nonprofit operators and $35,000 for a tree canopy analysis.

The committee unanimously praised the proposal, which the full city council must now approve. ""To say I'm excited would be a dramatic understatement,"" Gabbard said. ""Those things directly correlate to why we have that money.

""Thank you for understanding what the community has been asking for - for a very long time.""",stpetecatalyst.com,news,St Pete Catalyst,Mark Parker,0.388235294117647,453929257,1,https://stpetecatalyst.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Pier-solar-array.png,

Imperialism, the worldwide expansion of capitalism, motivated by the lust for raw materials such as petroleum, markets and cheap labour, involved fierce competition among great powers such as the British Empire, czarist Russia, and the German Reich, and thus led to the Great War of 1914-1918, later to be known as the First World War or World War I.

The First World War was the product of the nineteenth century, a ""long century"" in the view of some historians, lasting from 1789 to 1914. It was characterized by revolutions of a political, social, and also economic nature, especially the French Revolution and the Industrial Revolution, and ended with the emergence of imperialism, that is a new, worldwide manifestation of capitalism, originally a European phenomenon. This essay focuses on how imperialism played a decisive role in the outbreak, course, and outcome of the ""Great War"" of 1914-1918; it is based on the author's book,

The Great Class War 1914-1918, James Lorimer, Toronto, 2016.

When the French Revolution broke out in 1789, the nobility (or aristocracy) constituted the ruling class in just about every country in Europe. But because of the French Revolution and other revolutions that followed - not only in France - in 1830 and 1848, the haute bourgeoisie or upper-middle class was able, by the middle of the century, not to unseat the nobility, but to join it at the apex of the social and political pyramid. Thus was formed an ""active symbiosis"" of two classes that were in fact very different. The nobility was characterized by great wealth based on large landownership, had a strong preference for conservative political ideas and parties, and tended to cultivate clerical connections. The upper-middle class, on the other hand, favored the ideology and parties of liberalism as well as free-thinking and even anti-clericalism, and its wealth was generated by activities in commerce, industry, and finance. The two had been on opposite sides of the barricades during the revolutions of 1789, 1830, and 1848, when the bourgeoisie had been a revolutionary class and the aristocracy the counter-revolutionary class par excellence. What united these two propertied classes, namely in 1848, was their common fear of a class enemy that threatened their wealth, power, and privileges: the poor, restless, and potentially revolutionary ""underclass,"" propertyless and therefore known as the proletariat, the ""people who own nothing but their offspring.""

The upper-middle class ceased to be revolutionary and joined the nobility on the counter-revolutionary side after the revolutions that shook Europe in 1848. Those events revealed that the lower classes aspired to bring about not only a political but also a social and economic revolution that would mean the end of the power and wealth of not only the nobility but also the bourgeoisie. In the second half of the nineteenth century, then, and until the outbreak of the First World War, the nobility and the haute bourgeoisie formed one single upper class, one single ""elite"" or ""establishment."" But while the bourgeois bankers and industrialists enjoyed more and more economic power, political power tended to remain a monopoly of the aristocrats in most countries, and certainly in big, quasi-feudal empires such as Russia. In any event, all members of the elite were obsessed by the fear of revolution, increasingly embodied by proletarian political parties that subscribed to revolutionary Marxist socialism.

The nineteenth century was also the century of the Industrial Revolution. In all countries where that revolution took place, the economy became much more productive. But this eventually caused the economic supply to exceed the demand, as was revealed in 1873 by the outbreak of a totally new kind of economic crisis, a crisis of overproduction. (Earlier economic crises had always been crises of underproduction, in which supply was insufficient in comparison to demand, for example, the infamous potato famine in Ireland in the 1840s.) In the most developed countries, that is, in Western and Central Europe and in the USA, countless small industrial producers disappeared from the economic scene as a result of this economic depression.

The industrial landscape was henceforth dominated by a relatively restricted group of gigantic enterprises, mostly incorporated, joint-stock companies or ""corporations,"" as well as associations of firms known as cartels, and also big banks. These ""big boys"" competed with each other, but increasingly, they also concluded agreements and collaborated in order to share scarce raw materials and markets, set prices, and find other ways to limit as much as possible the disadvantages of competition in a theoretically ""free"" market - and in order to defend and aggressively promote their common interests against foreign competitors and, of course, against workers and other employees. In this system, the big banks played an important role. They provided the credit required by large-scale industrial production and, at the same time, they looked all over the world for opportunities to invest the surplus capital made available by the megaprofits achieved by the corporations. Big banks thus became partners and even owners, or at least major shareholders, of corporations. Concentration, gigantism, oligopolies, and even monopolies characterized this new stage in the development of capitalism. Some Marxist writers have referred to this phenomenon as ""monopoly capitalism.""

The industrial and financial bourgeoisie had hitherto been very much attached to the liberal, laissez-faire thinking of Adam Smith, which had assigned to the state only a minimal role in economic life, namely that of ""night watch."" But now the role of the state was becoming increasingly important, for example, as buyer of industrial commodities, such as guns and other modern weapons, supplied by gigantic firms and financed by major banks. The industrial-financial elite also counted on the state's intervention to protect the country's corporations against foreign competition by means of tariffs on the importation of finished products, even though this violated the classical liberal dogma of free markets and free competition. (It is one of the ironies of history that the USA, today the world's most fervent apostle of free trade, was extremely protectionist at that time.) ""National economic systems"" or ""national economies"" thus emerged, and they proceeded to compete fiercely against each other. State intervention - to be labelled ""dirigism"" or ""statism"" by economists - was now also favored because only a strong state was able to acquire foreign territories useful or even indispensable to industrialists and bankers as markets for their finished products or investment capital and as sources of raw materials and cheap labor. These desiderata were not normally available domestically, or at least not in sufficient quantities or at sufficiently low prices, they privileged a country's industrialists and bankers vis-√†-vis foreign competitors, and they helped to maximize profitability.

The kind of territorial acquisitions that could only be achieved under the auspices of a strong and interventionist state, also suited the nobility, the partner of the industrial-financial bourgeoisie within the ruling elite, and in many if not most countries still the class with a near-monopoly of political power. The aristocrats were traditionally large landowners, so it is only natural that they favored territorial acquisitions; the more acreage one controlled, the better. In noble families, moreover, the eldest son traditionally inherited not only the title but the family's entire patrimony. Newly acquired territory overseas or - in the case of Germany and the Danube Monarchy - in Eastern Europe could function as ""lands of unlimited possibilities"" where the younger sons could acquire domains of their own and lord it over natives who were to serve as underpaid peasants or domestic servants, just as the Iberian Peninsula's Reconquista had provided ""castles in Spain"" to junior aristocrats during the Middle Ages, the nobility's golden age. Adventurous scions of noble families could also embark on prestigious careers as officers in conquering colonial armies or as high-ranking officials in the administration of colonial territories. (The highest functions in the colonies, for example, that of Viceroy of British India or Governor General of Canada, were indeed reserved almost exclusively for members of aristocratic families.) Finally, the nobility had started to invest heavily in capitalist activities such as mining, a branch of industry interested in overseas regions rich in minerals. The British and Dutch royal families thus acquired enormous portfolios of shares in firms that were prospecting for oil all over the world, such as Shell, so they too were likely to profit from territorial expansion.

Like its upper-middle class partner in the elite, the nobility could also expect to gain from territorial expansion in yet another way; such expansion proved useful as a means to exorcize the spectre of revolution, namely by co-opting potentially troublesome members of the lower orders and integrating them into the established order. How was this achieved?

First but not foremost, considerable numbers of proletarians could be put to work in colonized lands as soldiers, employees, and foremen on plantations and in mines (where the natives served as slaves), low-ranking bureaucrats in the colonial administration, and even missionaries. There they could not only enjoy a higher standard of living than at home but also a certain amount of social prestige, since they could lord it over, and feel superior to, the colored natives. Thus, they became more likely to identify with the state that made this form of social climbing possible and to be integrated into its established order. Second, within the mother countries themselves, a similar socialization of an even larger segment of the lower orders resulted from the acquisition of colonies. The ruthless ""super-exploitation"" that was possible in the colonies, whose denizens were robbed of their gold, their land, and other riches, and be made to slave away for virtually nothing, yielded ""super-profits.""

In the mother country, the employers could thus offer somewhat higher wages and better working conditions to their workers, and the state could start to provide modest social services. At least some of the proletarians in the mother lands thus became better off at the expense of the oppressed and exploited denizens of the colonies. In other words, the misery was exported from Europe to the colonies, to the unhappy lands that would later collectively be known as the ""Third World."" (In the USA, the prosperity and freedom of the white population was similarly made possible by the exploitation and oppression of Afro-Americans and ""Indians."") In any event, under those conditions, most European socialists (or social-democrats) increasingly developed warm feelings towards a ""fatherland"" that treated them better, so they gradually abandoned their traditional Marxist internationalism to become rather nationalistic; discreetly, they - and their socialist (or social-democratic) parties - also ceased to believe in the inevitability and necessity of revolution and migrated from Marx's revolutionary socialism to socialist ""reformism."" This explains why, in 1914, most socialist parties would not oppose the war but would rally behind the flag to defend the fatherland that had presumably been so good to them. Third, territorial expansion also offered an advantage much appreciated by the many members of the elite who subscribed to Malthusianism, a trendy ideology at the time, which blamed overpopulation for the great social problems that ravaged all the industrialized countries. It made it possible to dump the restless and potentially revolutionary demographic surplus in distant lands such as Australia, where they could acquire land and start a farm, for example, by expelling or even exterminating the natives.

Projects for territorial acquisitions, undertaken under the auspices of a strong and even aggressive state, then, were favored by the aristocratic as well as the bourgeois factions of the elite. And they received considerable popular support, because they appealed to the romantic imagination and, more importantly, because even some of the proletarians could help themselves to the crumbs that fell off the table. The second half, and particularly the final quarter, of the nineteenth century thus witnessed a worldwide territorial expansion of European as well as two non-European industrial powers, the USA and Japan. However, the conquest of territories, where desiderata such as precious raw materials were to be found and where there existed plenty of investment opportunities, was rarely possible ""next door."" The great exception to this general rule was provided by the USA, who grabbed the vast hunting grounds of the Native Americans, stretching all the way to the coast of the Pacific Ocean, and robbed neighboring Mexico of a huge part of its territory. It was generally more realistic, however, to dream of territorial acquisitions in faraway lands, above all in the ""dark continent"" that was to become the object of the famous ""scramble for Africa."" Great Britain and France acquired vast territories, mostly in Africa but also in Asia. The USA expanded not only on its own continent but robbed Spain via a ""splendid little war"" of colonial possessions such as the Philippines, and Japan managed to turn Korea into a dependence. Germany, on the other hand, did not do very well, mostly because it remained focused for too long on the establishment of a unified state; as a latecomer in the scramble for colonies, it had to settle for relatively few and certainly less desirable possessions, such as ""German Southwest Africa,"" now Namibia. In any event, the industrial giants of Europe, plus the USA and Japan, without exception states organized according to capitalist principles, morphed at that time into ""mother countries"" or ""metropoles"" of vast empires. To this new manifestation of capitalism, originally a purely European phenomenon, that was henceforth spreading itself over the entire globe, a name was given in 1902 by a British economist, John A. Hobson: ""imperialism."" In 1916, Lenin was to offer a Marxist view of imperialism in a famous pamphlet, Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism.

Imperialism generated more and more tension and conflicts among the great powers that were competing to acquire control over as many economically important territories as possible. At that time, social Darwinism was a very influential scientific ideology, and it preached that competition was the basic principle of all forms of life. Not only individuals but also states had to compete mercilessly with each other in a struggle for survival. The strongest triumphed, and thus they became even stronger; the weak, on the other hand, were the losers, and they were left behind in the race for survival and were doomed to perish. To be able to compete with other states, a state had to be economically strong, and for that reason its ""national economy"" - that is, its corporations and banks - had to have control over as much territory as possible with raw materials, potential for the export of goods and investment capital, etc. Thus was generated a merciless worldwide scramble for colonies, even for lands one did not really need but did not want to fall into the hands of a competitor. Considering all this, the British historian Eric Hobsbawm drew the conclusion that capitalism's trend towards imperialist expansion inevitably pushed the world in the direction of conflict and war.

However, in spite of tensions and crises, including a conflict about East African real estate that brought Britain and France to the brink of war in 1898, the Fashoda Crisis, Europe's imperialist powers managed to acquire vast territories without fighting a major war against each other. By the turn of the century, the entire globe seemed to be partitioned.

According to historian Margaret MacMillan, this means that the imperialist powers no longer had any reason to quarrel, and she concludes that an accusing finger cannot be pointed at imperialism when the causes of the First World War are discussed. To this it can be replied - as the French historian Annie Lacroix-Riz has done - that there remained at least one ""hungry"" imperialist power which felt disadvantaged compared to ""satisfied"" powers such as Great Britain, was not prepared to put up with the status quo, aggressively pursued a redistribution of existing colonial possessions, and was in fact willing to wage war to achieve its objectives. That ""hungry"" power was Germany, which had belatedly developed an imperialist appetite, namely after Wilhelm II became emperor in 1888 and promptly demanded for the Reich a ""place in the sun"" of international imperialism, in other words, a redistribution of the colonial possessions that would provide Germany with a larger share. Colonial possessions, Lacroix-Riz points out, may have been distributed, but they could be redistributed. That redistributing the colonial possessions was possible, but also unlikely to be achieved peacefully, was demonstrated by the case of former Spanish colonies like the Philippines, Cuba, and Puerto Rico, which were transformed into satrapies of America's ""informal empire"" as a result of the Spanish-American War of 1898.

Moreover, a considerable part of the world did in fact remain available for direct or indirect annexation as colonies or protectorates, or at least for economic penetration. MacMillan herself acknowledges that a ""serious scramble for China,"" similar to the earlier, risky race for territories in Africa, remained possible, the more so since not only the great European powers but also the USA and Japan displayed much interest in the land of unlimited possibilities that the Middle Empire seemed to be. The imperialist wolves were also keenly - and jealously - eying a couple of other major countries that had hitherto managed to remain independent, namely, Persia and the Ottoman Empire.

The competition between the imperialist powers was and remained very likely to lead to conflicts and wars, not only limited conflicts such as the Spanish-American War of 1899 and the Russian-Japanese War of 1905 but also a general conflagration involving most if not all powers. It almost came to such a conflagration in 1911 when, to the great chagrin of Germany, France turned Morocco into a protectorate. The case of Morocco shows how even supposedly satisfied imperialist powers such as France were never truly satisfied - just as immensely rich people never feel that they have enough riches - but continued to look for more ways to fatten their portfolio of colonial possessions, even if that threatened to cause a war.

Let us consider the case of the ""hungry"" imperialist power, Germany. The Reich, founded in 1871, had entered the scramble for colonies a little too late. It could actually consider itself lucky that it was still able to acquire a handful of colonies such as Namibia. But those hardly amounted to major prizes, certainly not in comparison to the Congo, a huge region bursting with rubber and copper that was pocketed by minuscule Belgium. With respect to access to sources of vital raw materials as well as opportunities for exporting finished products and investment capital, the tandem of Germany's industry and finance thus found itself very much disadvantaged in comparison to its British and French rivals. Crucially important raw materials had to be purchased at comparatively high rates, which meant that the finished products of German industry were more expensive and therefore less competitive on international markets. This imbalance between extremely high industrial productivity and relatively restricted markets demanded a solution. In the eyes of numerous German industrialists, bankers, and other members of the country's elite, the only genuine solution was a war that would give the German Empire what it felt entitled to and - to formulate it in Social-Darwinist terms - what it believed to be necessary for its survival: colonies overseas and, perhaps even more importantly, territories within Europe as well.

In the years leading up to 1914, the German Reich thus pursued an expansionist and aggressive foreign policy aimed at acquiring more possessions and turning Germany into a world power. This policy, of which Emperor Wilhelm II was the figurehead, has gone down in history under the label of Weltpolitik, ""policy on a worldwide scale,"" a term that was merely a euphemism for what was in fact an imperialist policy. In any event, Imanuel Geiss, an authority in the field of the history of Germany before and during the First World War, has emphasized that this policy was one of the factors ""that made war inevitable.""

With respect to overseas possessions, Berlin dreamed of pinching the colonies of small states such as Belgium and Portugal. (And in Great Britain a faction within the elite, consisting mostly of industrialists and bankers with connections to Germany, was in fact willing to appease the Reich, not with a single square mile of their own Empire, of course, but with the gift of Belgian or Portuguese overseas possessions.) Nevertheless, it was above all within Europe itself that opportunities seemed to exist for Germany. Ukraine, for example, with its fertile farmland, loomed as the perfect ""territorial complement"" (Erg√§nzungsgebiet) for the highly industrialized German heartland; its bread and meat could provide cheap food for German workers, which would permit keeping their wages down. Likewise eyed by German imperialists was the Balkan, a region that might serve as source of cheap agricultural products and as market for German commodities. Germans in general were impressed with America's conquest of the ""Wild West"" and Britain's acquisition of the Indian subcontinent and dreamed that their country might similarly obtain a gigantic colony, namely by expanding into Eastern Europe in a modern-day edition of Germany's medieval ""push to the East,"" the Drang nach Osten. The East would supply the Reich with abundant raw materials, agricultural products, and cheap labor in the shape of its numerous, supposedly inferior but muscular natives; and also a kind of social safety valve, because Germany's own potentially troublesome demographic surplus could be shipped as ""pioneers"" to those distant lands. Hitler's infamous fantasies with respect to ""living space,"" which he was to reveal in the 1920s in Mein Kampf and to put into practice during the Second World War, saw the light under those circumstances. In this respect, Hitler was not an anomaly at all, but a typical product of his time and space, and of the imperialism of that time and space.

Western Europe, more developed industrially and more densely populated than Europe's east, was attractive to German imperialism as a market for the finished products of German industry, but also as a source of interesting raw materials. The influential leaders of the German steel industry did not hide their great interest in the French region around the towns of Briey and Longwy; that area - situated close to the border with Belgium and Luxembourg - featured rich deposits of high-quality iron ore. Without this ore, claimed some spokesmen of German industry, the German steel industry was condemned to death, at least in the long run. It was also believed that Germany's Volkswirtschaft, its national economy, would profit greatly from the annexation of Belgium with its great seaport, Antwerp, its coal regions, etc. And together with Belgium its colony, the Congo, would of course also fall into German hands. Whether the acquisition of Belgium and perhaps even the Netherlands would involve direct annexation or a combination of formal political independence and economic dependence on Germany was a matter of debate among the experts within the German elite. In any event, in one way or another, virtually all of Europe was to be integrated into a ""great economic space"" under German control, The Reich would finally be able to take its rightful place next to Britain, the USA, etc. in the restricted circle of the great imperialist powers. (The historian Fritz Fischer has dealt with all this in his classical study of Germany's objectives in World War I.)

It was obvious that Germany's ambitions in the East could not be realized without serious conflict with Russia and the German aspirations with respect to the Balkans risked causing problems with Serbia. That country was already at loggerheads with the Reich's biggest and best friend, Austria-Hungary, but it was supported by Russia. And the Russians were also very annoyed by Germany's planned penetration of the Balkan Peninsula in the direction of Istanbul, since the straits between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean were at the very top of their own list of desiderata. St. Petersburg was almost certainly willing to go to war to deny Germany direct or indirect control of the Bosporus and the Dardanelles.

The German ambitions in Western Europe, and Belgium in particular, obviously ran counter to the interests of the British. At least as far back as the time of Napoleon, London had not wanted to see a major power ensconced in Antwerp and along the Belgian coast - and certainly not Germany, long a great power on land but now, with an increasingly impressive navy, also a menace at sea. With Antwerp, Germany would not only have at its disposal a ""pistol aimed at England,"" as Napoleon had described the city, but also one of the world's greatest seaports. That would have made Germany's international trade far less dependent on the services of British ports, sea lanes, and shipping, a major source of revenue of British commerce.

The real and imaginary interests and needs of Germany as a great industrial and imperialist power thus pushed the country increasingly rapidly, via an aggressive foreign policy, toward a war. But the possibility of war raised no great concerns within the elite of the military giant that Germany had already been for quite some time. To the contrary, among the industrialists, bankers, generals, politicians, and other members of the Reich's establishment, only some rare birds did not wish for a war; most of them preferred a war as soon as possible, and many were even in favor of unleashing a preventive war. Of course, the German elite also featured less bellicose members, but among them, there prevailed the fatalist feeling that war was simply inevitable.

That the merciless competition between the great imperialist powers - a struggle of life and death, as seen from a social-Darwinist viewpoint - was virtually certain to lead to war, was also demonstrated by the case of Great Britain. That country marched into the twentieth century as the world's superpower, in control of an unprecedented collection of colonial possessions. But the power and wealth of the Empire obviously depended on the fact that, thanks to the mighty Royal Navy, Britannia ruled the waves. And in that respect a very serious problem arose around the turn of the century. As fuel for ships, coal was quickly being replaced by petroleum on account of its far greater efficiency. Albion had plenty of coal but did not have petroleum, not even in its colonies, at least not in sufficient quantities. And so the search was on for plentiful and reliable sources of oil, the ""black gold."" For the time being, that precious commodity had to be imported from what was then the world's foremost producer and exporter, the USA. But that was not acceptable in the long run, since Britain often quarrelled with its former transatlantic colony about issues such as influence in South America, and the USA was also becoming a serious rival in the imperialist rat race.

Looking out for alternative sources, the British found a way to quench their thirst for petroleum, at least partly, in Persia. It was in this context that the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company was founded, later to be known as British Petroleum (BP). However, a definitive solution to the problem only appeared in sight when, still during the first decade of the twentieth century, significant deposits of oil were discovered in Mesopotamia, more specifically in the region around the city of Mosul. The patriciate ruling Albion - exemplified by gentlemen like Churchill - decided at that time that Mesopotamia, a hitherto unimportant corner of the Middle East destined to become Iraq after the First World War, but then still belonging to the Ottoman Empire, had to be brought under British control. That was not an unrealistic objective, since the Ottoman Empire was a large but weak country, from whose vast territory the British had already previously managed to carve attractive morsels, for example, Egypt and Cyprus. In fact, in 1899, the British had already snatched oil-rich Kuwait and proclaimed it a protectorate; they were to transform it in 1914 into a supposedly independent emirate. Possession of Mesopotamia, then, was seen to be the only way to make it possible for unlimited quantities of petroleum to flow unperturbed toward Albion's shores.

However, in 1908, the Ottoman Empire became an ally of Germany, which meant that the planned acquisition of Mesopotamia was virtually certain to trigger war between Britain and the Reich. But the need for petroleum was such that plans were nonetheless made for military action. And these plans needed to be implemented as soon as possible. The Germans and Ottomans had started to construct the Bagdad Bahn, a railway that was to link Berlin via Istanbul with Baghdad, the Mesopotamian metropolis, situated close to Mosul, and that raised the prospect that barrels full of Mesopotamian oil might one day start to roll toward Germany for the benefit of the Reich's growing collection of battleships, which happened to be the most dangerous rival of the Royal Navy! Since the Baghdad Bahn was expected to be completed in 1914, quite a few British political and military decision-makers were of the opinion that it was better not to wait very long before starting a war that appeared unavoidable in any event.

It was in this context that London's traditional friendship with Germany came to an end, that Britain joined two former archenemies, France and Russia, in an alliance known as the Triple Entente, and that the British army commanders started to work out detailed plans for war against Germany in collaboration with their French counterparts. The idea was that the massive armies of the French and the Russians would smash Germany's host, while the bulk of the Empire's armed forces would invade Mesopotamia from India, beat the Ottomans, and grab the oil fields. The Royal Navy also promised to prevent the German Navy from attacking France via the English Channel, and on land, the French army was to benefit from (mostly symbolic) assistance by the relatively tiny British Expeditionary Corps (BEF). However, this Machiavellian arrangement was concocted in the greatest secrecy, and neither the Parliament nor the public were informed about it.

On the eve of the Great War, a compromise with the Germans remained possible and even enjoyed the favor of some factions within Britain's political, industrial, and financial elite. A compromise would have provided Germany with at least a share of the Mesopotamian oil, but London sought to achieve nothing less than exclusive control over the ""black gold"" of Mesopotamia. The British plans to invade Mesopotamia were prepared as early as 1911 and called for the occupation of the strategically important city of Basra, to be followed by a march along the banks of the Tigris to Baghdad. Complemented by a simultaneous attack by British forces operating from Egypt, this invasion was to provide Britain with control over Mesopotamia and much of the rest of the Middle East. This scenario would indeed unfold during the Great War, but in slow motion, as it turned out to be a much tougher job than expected, and the objectives would only be achieved at the end of the conflict. Incidentally, the famous Lawrence of Arabia would not suddenly appear out of nowhere; he was merely one of the numerous Brits who, during the years leading up to 1914, had been carefully selected and trained to ""defend"" their country's interests - mostly with respect to oil - in the Middle East.

The conquest of the oil fields of Mesopotamia constituted the prime objective of Britain's entry into the war in 1914. When the war broke out, and the German and Austrian-Hungarian partners went to war against the Franco-Russian duo plus Serbia, there seemed to be no reason for Britain to become involved in the conflict. The government in London was confronted with a dilemma; it was honor-bound to keep the promises made to France but that would have revealed that these plans had been concocted in secret. However, Germany's violation of Belgium's neutrality provided London with the perfect pretext to go to war. In reality, the fate of the small country was of little or no concern to the British leaders, at least as long as the Germans did not proceed to grab Antwerp. Neither was the violation of a country's neutrality deemed to be a big deal; during the war, the British themselves would not hesitate to violate the neutrality of a number of countries, namely, China, Greece, and Persia.

Like all plans made in preparation for what was to become the ""Great War,"" the scenario concocted in London failed to unfold as anticipated. The French and Russians did not manage to crush the Teutonic host, so the British had to send many more troops to the continent - and suffer much greater losses - than foreseen. And in the distant Middle East, the Ottoman army - expertly assisted by German officers - unexpectedly proved to be a tough nut to crack. In spite of these inconveniences, which caused the death of about three quarters of a million soldiers in the UK alone, all was well in the end; in 1918, the Union Jack fluttered over the oil fields of Mesopotamia.

This short survey demonstrates that, as far as the rulers of Britain were concerned, World War I was not fought to save ""gallant little Belgium"" or to champion the cause of international law and justice. At stake were economic interests, the interests of British imperialism, which happen to be the interests of the rich and powerful British aristocratic gentlemen and bourgeois burghers whose corporations and banks lusted for raw materials such as petroleum - and for much else.

It is also obvious that for the patricians in power in London, the war was not a war for democracy at all. In the conquered Middle East, the British did nothing to promote the cause of democracy, to the contrary. Britain's imperialist interests were better served by subtle and not-so-subtle un- and even anti-democratic arrangements. Occupied Palestine was ruled by them in approximately the same way that occupied Belgium had been ruled by the Germans. And in Arabia, London's actions only took into account its own interests - as well as the interests of a handful of indigenous families that were considered to be useful partners. The vast homeland of the Arabs was parcelled out and distributed to those partners, who proceeded to establish states they could rule as if they were personal property. And when many denizens of Mesopotamia had the nerve to resist their new British bosses, Churchill ordered bombs to rain down on their villages, including bombs with poison gas.

On the eve of the outbreak of the Great War, in all the imperialist countries there were countless industrialists and bankers who favored a ""bellicose economic expansionism."" Nevertheless, many capitalists - and possibly even a majority - appreciated the advantages of peace and the inconveniences of war and were therefore not warmongers at all, as Eric Hobsbawm has emphasized. But this observation has wrongly caused the conservative British historian Niall Ferguson to jump to the conclusion that the interests of capitalists did not play a role in the eruption of the Great War in 1914. For one thing, countless industrialists and bankers and member of the upper-middle class displayed an ambivalent attitude with respect to war. On the one hand, even the most bellicose among them realized that a war would have most unpleasant aspects, and for that reason, they preferred to avoid war. However, as members of the elite, they also had reason to believe that the unpleasantness would be experienced mostly by others - and of course mostly by the simple soldiers, workers, peasants, and other plebeians to whom the nasty jobs of killing and dying were traditionally entrusted.

Moreover, the assumption that peace-loving capitalists did not want war reflects a binary, black-and-white kind of thinking, namely that peace was the alternative to war and vice-versa. However, reality has a way of being more complex. There was in fact another alternative to peace, namely revolution. And that other alternative to peace was far more repulsive than war to most if not all capitalists and other bourgeois and aristocratic members of the elite. The aristocracy and the bourgeoisie had been obsessed with fear of revolution ever since the events of 1848 and 1871 had revealed the revolutionary intentions and potential of the proletariat. Afterwards, working-class parties subscribing to Marx's revolutionary socialism had been founded, had become increasingly popular, and remained officially committed to overthrow the established political and social-economic order via revolution even though, as we have seen, they had in fact discreetly become reformist. The decade before the outbreak of war, finally, ironically called Belle √âpoque, witnessed not only new revolutions (in Russia, in 1905 and in China, in 1911) but also, throughout Europe, a never-ending series of strikes, demonstrations, and riots that seemed to be harbingers of revolution in the very heartland of imperialism. In this context, war was promoted not only by philosophers such as Nietzsche and other intellectuals, by military and political leaders, but also by leading industrialists and bankers as an effective antidote to revolution.

During the years leading up to 1914, countless members of the bourgeoisie (and the aristocracy) thus imagined themselves to be witnessing a race between war and revolution, a sprint whose outcome could be decided at any time. Which one of the two was going to win? The burghers, fearing revolution, prayed that war would be the winner. With revolution, rather than peace, as the most likely alternative to war, even the most peace-loving capitalists definitely preferred war. And since they were afraid that revolution might win the race, that is, might break out before war, the capitalists, and the bourgeois and aristocratic members of the elite in general, actually hoped for war to come as soon as possible, which is why they experienced the outbreak of war in the summer of 1914 as a deliverance from unbearable uncertainty and tension. This relief was reflected by the fact that the famous pictures of folks enthusiastically celebrating the declaration of war, taken mostly in the ""better"" districts of the capitals, almost exclusively featured well-dressed ladies and gentlemen, and not workers or peasants, who are known to have been mostly depressed by the news.

In its imperialist manifestation, capitalism was definitely responsible for the many colonial wars that had been waged and was also responsible for the Great War that broke out in 1914. Countless contemporaries realized this only too well. As the great French socialist leader Jean Jaur√®s already declared in 1895, ""capitalism carries war within itself just like the thundercloud carries the storm."" Jaur√®s was a convinced anticapitalist, of course, but many members of the bourgeois and aristocratic elite were also keenly aware of the link between war and their economic interests, and occasionally acknowledged this. General Haig, for example, who would command the British Army from 1915 until the end of the war, declared on one occasion that he was not ""ashamed of the wars fought to open up the markets of the world to our traders."" It was the fateful emergence of the imperialist version of capitalism, then, that, to use Eric Hobsbawm's words, ""pushed the world to conflict and war."" In comparison, the fact that numerous individuals among the industrialists and bankers may privately have cherished peace is of little or no importance and certainly does not permit the conclusion that capitalism did not lead to the Great War. It would be equally fallacious to conclude that Nazism was not really anti-Semitic and did not play a role in the origins of the Holocaust, because quite a few individual Nazis were personally not anti-Semitic.

It is also because imperialist aspirations were responsible for it, that the war that broke out in 1914, essentially a European conflict, developed into a world war. We should not forget that there was fighting not only in Europa but also in Asia and Africa. While the great powers would fight each other primarily, and most ""visibly,"" in Europe, their armies would also do battle in each other's colonial possessions in Africa, in the Middle East, and even in China. Finally, in Versailles, the victors would divide and claim not only the relatively modest booty represented by Germany's former colonies but especially the petroleum-rich regions of the Middle East that had belonged to the Ottoman Empire.

Let us take a quick look at the role played by Japan in the Great War. With its victory over Russia in 1905, the ""land of the rising sun"" revealed itself to be the only ""non-Western"" member of the restricted club of imperialism's great powers. Like all other imperialist powers, Japan was henceforth keen to acquire additional lands as colonies or protectorates in order to make raw materials and such available to its industry, thus making it stronger vis-a-vis the competition - for example, from the USA. The war that broke out in Europe in 1914 provided Japan with a golden opportunity in this respect. On September 23 of that year, Tokyo declared war on Germany for the simple reason that this made it possible to conquer the Reich's mini-colony (or ""concession"") in China, the Bay of Kiao-Chau (or Kiao-Chao), as well as its island colonies in the Northern Pacific. In the case of Japan, it is obvious that the country went to war in order to achieve imperialist objectives. In the case of the Western imperialist powers, however, we continue to be told that in 1914, arms were taken up solely to defend liberty and democracy.

The Great War was a product of imperialism. Its focus was therefore on profits for the big corporations and banks under whose auspices imperialism had developed and whose interests imperialism purported to serve. In this respect, the war did not disappoint. It was admittedly a catastrophe for millions of human beings, for the plebeian masses, for whom it offered nothing but death and misery. But for the industrialists and bankers of each belligerent country - and quite a few neutral countries, such as the USA before 1917 - it revealed itself as a cornucopia of orders and profits.

The conflict of 1914-1918 was an industrial contest in which modern weapons such as cannon, machine guns, poison gas, flamethrowers, tanks, airplanes, barbed wire, and submarines were decisive. This materiel was mass produced in the factories of the industrialists, yielding gargantuan profits, profits that were taxed only minimally in most countries. Profitability was also maximized by the fact that in all belligerent countries the wages (but not the prices) were lowered, while the working hours were lengthened and strikes were forbidden. (That was possible because, as we have seen earlier, imperialism had integrated the leaders and the rank-and-file of the supposedly internationalist and revolutionary socialist parties - and labor unions - into the established order and turned them into patriots, who in 1914 revealed themselves ready to rush to the defense of the fatherland and make the sacrifices presumably required to ensure its victory.) The most famous of the arms manufacturers to be blessed with war profits was Krupp, the world-famous German producer of cannon. But in France too, ""merchants of death"" did a wonderful business, for example, Monsieur Schneider, known as the French Krupp, who in 1914-1918 enjoyed ""a veritable explosion of profits,"" and Hotchkiss, the great specialist in the production of machine guns. State orders for war materiel signified huge profits not only for corporations but also for the banks that were asked to loan the huge sums of money needed by governments to finance these purchases and the costs of the war in general. In the USA, J.P. Morgan & Co, also known as the ""House of Morgan,"" was the undisputed champion glutton in this field. Morgan not only charged high interest rates on loans to the British and their allies but also earned fat commissions on sales to Britain by American firms that belonged to its ""circle of friends,"" such as Du Pont and Remington.

In the spring of 1917, after a revolution had broken out in Russia and the French ally was rocked by mutinies in its army, it was feared that the British might lose the war and therefore not be able to pay back their war debts. It was in this context that the Wall Street lobby, headed by Morgan, successfully pressured President Wilson to declare war on Germany, thus enabling Albion to ultimately win the war and avoid a catastrophe for the US banks, especially Morgan. This development likewise illustrates the fact that the First World War was primarily determined by economic factors, that it was the fruit of imperialism, a system that purported to serve the profit-maximizing interests of corporations and banks - and did.

With respect to the entry of the USA into the great clash of imperialisms of 1914-1918, another remark is in order. It was clear that the imperialist powers that would exit the war triumphantly would pocket great imperialist prizes, and that the losers would have to cough up some of their imperialist assets. And what about the neutrals? In January 1917, the French Prime Minister, Aristide Briand, publicly gave the answer, obviously anticipating a victory for the Triple Entente; neutral countries would not be invited to the peace conference and would not receive a share of the loot, that is, of goodies such as German colonies, the oil-rich regions of the doomed Ottoman Empire, and concessions and lucrative business opportunities in China. In this respect, Japan, America's great competitor in the Far East, had already made a move in 1914 by declaring war on Germany and pocketing the Reich's concession in China. In the USA, this conjured up the risk that Japan might end up monopolizing China economically, excluding American business. It is extremely likely that Washington took Briand's hint and that this consideration also influenced the decision, taken in April of 1917, to declare war on Germany. In the 1930s, an inquiry by the Nye Committee of the American Congress was to come to the conclusion that the country's entry into the war had indeed been motivated by the wish to be present when, after the war, the moment would come ""to redivide the spoils of empire.""

The war provided a mighty stimulus for the maximization of profits made by corporations and banks. But was that not one of the reasons why they had looked forward to war? (Another reason was of course the elimination of the revolutionary threat.) But the conflict also yielded them other considerable benefits. In all belligerent countries, the war reinforced the trend toward gigantism, that is, the ongoing emergence of a relatively small elite of very big corporations and banks. This was so because only big firms could benefit from the state orders for weapons and other war materiel. Conversely, small producers did not profit from the war. Many of them lost their personnel, their suppliers, or their customers; their profits declined, and many of them disappeared from the scene, never to return. In this sense, it is true what Niall Ferguson has pointed out, that during the Great War, the average profits of businesses were not very high; however, the profits of the big firms and banks, the capitalist big boys who dominated the economy since the emergence of imperialism were in fact considerable, as Ferguson himself acknowledges.

Class conflict is a complex, multifaceted phenomenon, as Domenico Losurdo has emphasized in a book on that topic. It is not merely a bilateral conflict between capital and labor but also reflects contradictions between bourgeoisie and nobility, between industrialists of different countries, between the colonies and their mother countries, and also between factions within the bourgeoisie. An example of the latter is the conflict between big and small producers, big business and little business, the upper-middle class or haute bourgeoisie, and the lower-middle class or petite bourgeoisie. Imperialism was - and continues to be - the capitalism of the big boys, the corporations and big banks, and it was imperialism that gave birth to the Great War. It is no coincidence that this big war also favored the big capitalists in their struggle against the little capitalists.

The Great War also privileged the upper-middle class, the gentlemen of industry and finance, vis-a-vis their partner within the elite, the landowning nobility. The nobility had also wanted war, because it expected many advantages from it. But the conflict revealed itself as something very different from the old-fashioned kind of warfare they had expected, in which their beloved cavalry and traditional weapons such as swords and lances would be decisive but, as Peter Englund has written, ""an economic competition, a war between factories."" The Great War was an industrial war, fought with modern weapons mass-produced in the factories of the bourgeois industrialists, and in the course of the war, representatives of corporations and banks - such as Walter Rathenau in Germany - played an increasingly important role as ""experts"" within governments and state bureaucracies. The bourgeoisie thus managed to increase not only its wealth but also its power and prestige - very much to the disadvantage of the aristocrats, whose weapons and expertise proved useless for the purpose of twentieth-century warfare. Until 1914, the haute bourgeoisie had been the junior partner of the nobility within the elite in most countries but that changed during the war and because of the war. After 1918, within the elite, the industrial and financial haute bourgeoisie was on top, with the nobility as its sidekick.

The Great War was very much determined by economic factors, and it was the product of the merciless competition among the imperialist powers, a competition about territories with considerable natural and human resources. It is therefore only logical that this conflict was eventually decided by economic factors; the imperialist powers that emerged as victors in 1918 were those who already controlled the greatest colonial and other territorial riches when the war started in 1914 and were therefore abundantly blessed with strategic raw materials, especially rubber and petroleum, needed to win a modern, industrial war. Let us examine this issue in greater detail.

In 1918, Germany managed to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory, so to speak, because in the spring and summer of that year, the Reich had actually come tantalizingly close to achieving victory. The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, signed with revolutionary Russia on March 3, 1918, had enabled the Reich's army commanders, led by General Ludendorff, to transfer troops from the eastern to the western front and launch a major offensive there on March 21. Considerable progress was achieved at first, but the Allies succeeded time and again to bring in the reserves of men and materiel needed to plug the gaps in their defensive lines, slow down the German juggernaut's advance, and finally to arrest it. August 8 was the date when the tide turned. On that day, the Germans were forced onto the defensive and had to withdraw systematically until they finally capitulated on November 11. The allied triumph was made possible by the fact that they - and especially the French - disposed of thousands of trucks to quickly transport large numbers of soldiers to wherever they were needed. The Germans, on the other hand, still moved their troops mostly by train, as in 1914, but crucial sectors of the front were hard to reach that way. The superior mobility of the Allies was decisive. Ludendorff was to declare later that the triumph of his adversaries in 1918 amounted to a victory of French trucks over German trains.

However, this triumph can also be similarly described as a victory of the rubber tires of the Allies' vehicles, produced by firms such as Michelin and Dunlop, over the steel wheels of German trains, produced by Krupp. Thus it can also be said that the victory of the Entente against the Central Powers was a victory of the economic system, and particularly the industry, of the Allies, against the economic system of Germany and Austria-Hungary, an economic system that found itself starved of crucially important raw materials because of the British blockade. ""The military and political defeat of Germany,"" writes the French historian Fr√©d√©ric Rousseau, ""was inseparable from its economic failure."" But the economic superiority of the Allies clearly has a lot to do with the fact that the British and French - and even the Belgians and Italians - had colonies where they could fetch whatever was needed to win a modern, industrial war, especially rubber, oil, and other ""strategic"" raw materials - plus plenty of colonial laborers to repair and even construct the roads along which trucks transported allied soldiers.

Rubber was not the only strategic type of raw material that the Allies had in abundance while the Germans lacked it. Another one was petroleum, for which the increasingly motorized land armies - and rapidly expanding air forces - were developing a gargantuan appetite. During a victory dinner on November 21, 1918, the British minister of foreign affairs, Lord Curzon, was to declare, not without reason, that ""the allied cause floated to victory upon a wave of oil,"" and a French senator proclaimed that ""oil had been the blood of victory."" A considerable quantity of this oil had come from the USA. It was supplied by Standard Oil, a firm belonging to the Rockefellers, who made a lot of money in this type of business, just as Renault did by producing the gas-guzzling trucks. It was only logical that the Allies, swimming in petroleum, had acquired all sort of modern, motorized, gas-guzzling equipment. In 1918, the French not only had huge quantities of trucks but also a major fleet of airplanes. And in the war's final year, the French as well as the British also disposed of cars equipped with machine guns or cannon and above all of large numbers of tanks. If the Germans had no significant quantities of trucks or tanks, it was also because they lacked petroleum; only insufficient amounts of Rumanian oil were available to them.

The Great War happened to be a war between imperialist rivals, in which the great prizes to be won were territories bursting with raw materials and cheap labor, the kind of things that benefited a country's ""national economy,"" more specifically its industry, and thus made that country more powerful and more competitive. It is therefore hardly a coincidence that the war was ultimately won by the countries that had been most richly endowed in this respect, namely the great industrial powers with the most colonies. In other words: that the biggest imperialisms - those of the British, the French, and the Americans - defeated a competing imperialism, that of Germany, admittedly an industrial superpower, but underprivileged with respect to colonial possessions. In view of this, it is even amazing that it took four long years before Germany's defeat was a fait accompli. On the other hand, it is also obvious that the advantages of having colonies and therefore access to unlimited supplies of food for soldiers and civilians as well as rubber, petroleum, and similar raw materials, as well as a virtually inexhaustible reserve labor force, were only able to reveal themselves in the long run. The main reason for this is that in 1914, the war started as a continental kind of Napoleonic campaign that was to morph - imperceptibly, but inexorably - into a worldwide contest of industrial titans. In 1914, Germany, a military superpower, still stood a chance to win the war, especially since it had excellent railways to ferry its armies to the western and eastern fronts - and more than enough of the coal needed as fuel for the steam trains. This is how a big victory was achieved against the Russians at Tannenberg. However, after four long years of modern, industrial, and in many ways ""total"" war, economic factors revealed themselves as decisive. By the time Ludendorff launched his spring-offensive in 1918, the prospects for a final victory had long gone up in smoke for a German Reich that was prevented by a Royal Navy blockade from reaching territories where it might have been able to fetch adequate amounts of the collective sine qua non of victory in a modern war - strategic raw materials such as petroleum, food for civilians as well as soldiers, cheap labor for industry and agriculture, and so forth.

The Great War of 1914-1918 was a conflict in which two blocks of imperialist powers fought each other for the possession of lands in Europe itself, Africa, Asia, and the entire world. The result of this titanic struggle was a victory for the Anglo-French duo, a major defeat for Germany, and the inglorious demise of the Austrian-Hungarian Empire. In reality, the outcome of the war was unclear, confusing, and unlikely to please anybody. Great Britain and France were the victors but were exhausted by the enormous demographic, material, financial, and other sacrifices they had had to bring; they were no longer the superpowers they had been in 1914. Germany had likewise paid a heavy price, found itself punished and humiliated at Versailles, and lost not only its colonies but even a large part of its own territory; the country was allowed to have only a tiny army, but it remained an industrial superpower that was likely to try once again to achieve great imperialist objectives, as in 1914. Moreover, the war had been an opportunity for two non-European imperialisms to reveal their ambitions, namely, Japan and the USA. The struggle for supremacy among imperialist powers, which is what 1914-1918 had been, thus remained undecided. To make the situation even more complex, along with Austria-Hungary yet another major imperialist actor had departed from the scene, though in a very different way. Russia had morphed, via a great revolution, into the Soviet-Union. That resolutely anti-capitalist state revealed itself to be a thorn in the imperialist side, because it functioned not only as source of inspiration for revolutionaries within each imperialist country but also encouraged anti-imperialist movements in the colonies. Under these circumstances, Europe and the entire world continued to experience great tensions and conflicts that were to yield a second world war or, as many historians now see it, the second act of the great ""Thirty Years' War of the 20th Century.""

Imperialism, the worldwide expansion of capitalism, motivated by the lust for raw materials such as petroleum, markets and cheap labour, involved fierce competition among great powers such as the British Empire, czarist Russia, and the German Reich, and thus led to the Great War of 1914-1918, later to be known as the First World War or World War I.

The First World War was the product of the nineteenth century, a ""long century"" in the view of some historians, lasting from 1789 to 1914. It was characterized by revolutions of a political, social, and also economic nature, especially the French Revolution and the Industrial Revolution, and ended with the emergence of imperialism, that is a new, worldwide manifestation of capitalism, originally a European phenomenon. This essay focuses on how imperialism played a decisive role in the outbreak, course, and outcome of the ""Great War"" of 1914-1918; it is based on the author's book,

The Great Class War 1914-1918, James Lorimer, Toronto, 2016.

When the French Revolution broke out in 1789, the nobility (or aristocracy) constituted the ruling class in just about every country in Europe. But because of the French Revolution and other revolutions that followed - not only in France - in 1830 and 1848, the haute bourgeoisie or upper-middle class was able, by the middle of the century, not to unseat the nobility, but to join it at the apex of the social and political pyramid. Thus was formed an ""active symbiosis"" of two classes that were in fact very different. The nobility was characterized by great wealth based on large landownership, had a strong preference for conservative political ideas and parties, and tended to cultivate clerical connections. The upper-middle class, on the other hand, favored the ideology and parties of liberalism as well as free-thinking and even anti-clericalism, and its wealth was generated by activities in commerce, industry, and finance. The two had been on opposite sides of the barricades during the revolutions of 1789, 1830, and 1848, when the bourgeoisie had been a revolutionary class and the aristocracy the counter-revolutionary class par excellence. What united these two propertied classes, namely in 1848, was their common fear of a class enemy that threatened their wealth, power, and privileges: the poor, restless, and potentially revolutionary ""underclass,"" propertyless and therefore known as the proletariat, the ""people who own nothing but their offspring.""

The upper-middle class ceased to be revolutionary and joined the nobility on the counter-revolutionary side after the revolutions that shook Europe in 1848. Those events revealed that the lower classes aspired to bring about not only a political but also a social and economic revolution that would mean the end of the power and wealth of not only the nobility but also the bourgeoisie. In the second half of the nineteenth century, then, and until the outbreak of the First World War, the nobility and the haute bourgeoisie formed one single upper class, one single ""elite"" or ""establishment."" But while the bourgeois bankers and industrialists enjoyed more and more economic power, political power tended to remain a monopoly of the aristocrats in most countries, and certainly in big, quasi-feudal empires such as Russia. In any event, all members of the elite were obsessed by the fear of revolution, increasingly embodied by proletarian political parties that subscribed to revolutionary Marxist socialism.

The nineteenth century was also the century of the Industrial Revolution. In all countries where that revolution took place, the economy became much more productive. But this eventually caused the economic supply to exceed the demand, as was revealed in 1873 by the outbreak of a totally new kind of economic crisis, a crisis of overproduction. (Earlier economic crises had always been crises of underproduction, in which supply was insufficient in comparison to demand, for example, the infamous potato famine in Ireland in the 1840s.) In the most developed countries, that is, in Western and Central Europe and in the USA, countless small industrial producers disappeared from the economic scene as a result of this economic depression.

The industrial landscape was henceforth dominated by a relatively restricted group of gigantic enterprises, mostly incorporated, joint-stock companies or ""corporations,"" as well as associations of firms known as cartels, and also big banks. These ""big boys"" competed with each other, but increasingly, they also concluded agreements and collaborated in order to share scarce raw materials and markets, set prices, and find other ways to limit as much as possible the disadvantages of competition in a theoretically ""free"" market - and in order to defend and aggressively promote their common interests against foreign competitors and, of course, against workers and other employees. In this system, the big banks played an important role. They provided the credit required by large-scale industrial production and, at the same time, they looked all over the world for opportunities to invest the surplus capital made available by the megaprofits achieved by the corporations. Big banks thus became partners and even owners, or at least major shareholders, of corporations. Concentration, gigantism, oligopolies, and even monopolies characterized this new stage in the development of capitalism. Some Marxist writers have referred to this phenomenon as ""monopoly capitalism.""

The industrial and financial bourgeoisie had hitherto been very much attached to the liberal, laissez-faire thinking of Adam Smith, which had assigned to the state only a minimal role in economic life, namely that of ""night watch."" But now the role of the state was becoming increasingly important, for example, as buyer of industrial commodities, such as guns and other modern weapons, supplied by gigantic firms and financed by major banks. The industrial-financial elite also counted on the state's intervention to protect the country's corporations against foreign competition by means of tariffs on the importation of finished products, even though this violated the classical liberal dogma of free markets and free competition. (It is one of the ironies of history that the USA, today the world's most fervent apostle of free trade, was extremely protectionist at that time.) ""National economic systems"" or ""national economies"" thus emerged, and they proceeded to compete fiercely against each other. State intervention - to be labelled ""dirigism"" or ""statism"" by economists - was now also favored because only a strong state was able to acquire foreign territories useful or even indispensable to industrialists and bankers as markets for their finished products or investment capital and as sources of raw materials and cheap labor. These desiderata were not normally available domestically, or at least not in sufficient quantities or at sufficiently low prices, they privileged a country's industrialists and bankers vis-√†-vis foreign competitors, and they helped to maximize profitability.

The kind of territorial acquisitions that could only be achieved under the auspices of a strong and interventionist state, also suited the nobility, the partner of the industrial-financial bourgeoisie within the ruling elite, and in many if not most countries still the class with a near-monopoly of political power. The aristocrats were traditionally large landowners, so it is only natural that they favored territorial acquisitions; the more acreage one controlled, the better. In noble families, moreover, the eldest son traditionally inherited not only the title but the family's entire patrimony. Newly acquired territory overseas or - in the case of Germany and the Danube Monarchy - in Eastern Europe could function as ""lands of unlimited possibilities"" where the younger sons could acquire domains of their own and lord it over natives who were to serve as underpaid peasants or domestic servants, just as the Iberian Peninsula's Reconquista had provided ""castles in Spain"" to junior aristocrats during the Middle Ages, the nobility's golden age. Adventurous scions of noble families could also embark on prestigious careers as officers in conquering colonial armies or as high-ranking officials in the administration of colonial territories. (The highest functions in the colonies, for example, that of Viceroy of British India or Governor General of Canada, were indeed reserved almost exclusively for members of aristocratic families.) Finally, the nobility had started to invest heavily in capitalist activities such as mining, a branch of industry interested in overseas regions rich in minerals. The British and Dutch royal families thus acquired enormous portfolios of shares in firms that were prospecting for oil all over the world, such as Shell, so they too were likely to profit from territorial expansion.

Like its upper-middle class partner in the elite, the nobility could also expect to gain from territorial expansion in yet another way; such expansion proved useful as a means to exorcize the spectre of revolution, namely by co-opting potentially troublesome members of the lower orders and integrating them into the established order. How was this achieved?

First but not foremost, considerable numbers of proletarians could be put to work in colonized lands as soldiers, employees, and foremen on plantations and in mines (where the natives served as slaves), low-ranking bureaucrats in the colonial administration, and even missionaries. There they could not only enjoy a higher standard of living than at home but also a certain amount of social prestige, since they could lord it over, and feel superior to, the colored natives. Thus, they became more likely to identify with the state that made this form of social climbing possible and to be integrated into its established order. Second, within the mother countries themselves, a similar socialization of an even larger segment of the lower orders resulted from the acquisition of colonies. The ruthless ""super-exploitation"" that was possible in the colonies, whose denizens were robbed of their gold, their land, and other riches, and be made to slave away for virtually nothing, yielded ""super-profits.""

In the mother country, the employers could thus offer somewhat higher wages and better working conditions to their workers, and the state could start to provide modest social services. At least some of the proletarians in the mother lands thus became better off at the expense of the oppressed and exploited denizens of the colonies. In other words, the misery was exported from Europe to the colonies, to the unhappy lands that would later collectively be known as the ""Third World."" (In the USA, the prosperity and freedom of the white population was similarly made possible by the exploitation and oppression of Afro-Americans and ""Indians."") In any event, under those conditions, most European socialists (or social-democrats) increasingly developed warm feelings towards a ""fatherland"" that treated them better, so they gradually abandoned their traditional Marxist internationalism to become rather nationalistic; discreetly, they - and their socialist (or social-democratic) parties - also ceased to believe in the inevitability and necessity of revolution and migrated from Marx's revolutionary socialism to socialist ""reformism."" This explains why, in 1914, most socialist parties would not oppose the war but would rally behind the flag to defend the fatherland that had presumably been so good to them. Third, territorial expansion also offered an advantage much appreciated by the many members of the elite who subscribed to Malthusianism, a trendy ideology at the time, which blamed overpopulation for the great social problems that ravaged all the industrialized countries. It made it possible to dump the restless and potentially revolutionary demographic surplus in distant lands such as Australia, where they could acquire land and start a farm, for example, by expelling or even exterminating the natives.

Projects for territorial acquisitions, undertaken under the auspices of a strong and even aggressive state, then, were favored by the aristocratic as well as the bourgeois factions of the elite. And they received considerable popular support, because they appealed to the romantic imagination and, more importantly, because even some of the proletarians could help themselves to the crumbs that fell off the table. The second half, and particularly the final quarter, of the nineteenth century thus witnessed a worldwide territorial expansion of European as well as two non-European industrial powers, the USA and Japan. However, the conquest of territories, where desiderata such as precious raw materials were to be found and where there existed plenty of investment opportunities, was rarely possible ""next door."" The great exception to this general rule was provided by the USA, who grabbed the vast hunting grounds of the Native Americans, stretching all the way to the coast of the Pacific Ocean, and robbed neighboring Mexico of a huge part of its territory. It was generally more realistic, however, to dream of territorial acquisitions in faraway lands, above all in the ""dark continent"" that was to become the object of the famous ""scramble for Africa."" Great Britain and France acquired vast territories, mostly in Africa but also in Asia. The USA expanded not only on its own continent but robbed Spain via a ""splendid little war"" of colonial possessions such as the Philippines, and Japan managed to turn Korea into a dependence. Germany, on the other hand, did not do very well, mostly because it remained focused for too long on the establishment of a unified state; as a latecomer in the scramble for colonies, it had to settle for relatively few and certainly less desirable possessions, such as ""German Southwest Africa,"" now Namibia. In any event, the industrial giants of Europe, plus the USA and Japan, without exception states organized according to capitalist principles, morphed at that time into ""mother countries"" or ""metropoles"" of vast empires. To this new manifestation of capitalism, originally a purely European phenomenon, that was henceforth spreading itself over the entire globe, a name was given in 1902 by a British economist, John A. Hobson: ""imperialism."" In 1916, Lenin was to offer a Marxist view of imperialism in a famous pamphlet, Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism.

Imperialism generated more and more tension and conflicts among the great powers that were competing to acquire control over as many economically important territories as possible. At that time, social Darwinism was a very influential scientific ideology, and it preached that competition was the basic principle of all forms of life. Not only individuals but also states had to compete mercilessly with each other in a struggle for survival. The strongest triumphed, and thus they became even stronger; the weak, on the other hand, were the losers, and they were left behind in the race for survival and were doomed to perish. To be able to compete with other states, a state had to be economically strong, and for that reason its ""national economy"" - that is, its corporations and banks - had to have control over as much territory as possible with raw materials, potential for the export of goods and investment capital, etc. Thus was generated a merciless worldwide scramble for colonies, even for lands one did not really need but did not want to fall into the hands of a competitor. Considering all this, the British historian Eric Hobsbawm drew the conclusion that capitalism's trend towards imperialist expansion inevitably pushed the world in the direction of conflict and war.

However, in spite of tensions and crises, including a conflict about East African real estate that brought Britain and France to the brink of war in 1898, the Fashoda Crisis, Europe's imperialist powers managed to acquire vast territories without fighting a major war against each other. By the turn of the century, the entire globe seemed to be partitioned.

According to historian Margaret MacMillan, this means that the imperialist powers no longer had any reason to quarrel, and she concludes that an accusing finger cannot be pointed at imperialism when the causes of the First World War are discussed. To this it can be replied - as the French historian Annie Lacroix-Riz has done - that there remained at least one ""hungry"" imperialist power which felt disadvantaged compared to ""satisfied"" powers such as Great Britain, was not prepared to put up with the status quo, aggressively pursued a redistribution of existing colonial possessions, and was in fact willing to wage war to achieve its objectives. That ""hungry"" power was Germany, which had belatedly developed an imperialist appetite, namely after Wilhelm II became emperor in 1888 and promptly demanded for the Reich a ""place in the sun"" of international imperialism, in other words, a redistribution of the colonial possessions that would provide Germany with a larger share. Colonial possessions, Lacroix-Riz points out, may have been distributed, but they could be redistributed. That redistributing the colonial possessions was possible, but also unlikely to be achieved peacefully, was demonstrated by the case of former Spanish colonies like the Philippines, Cuba, and Puerto Rico, which were transformed into satrapies of America's ""informal empire"" as a result of the Spanish-American War of 1898.

Moreover, a considerable part of the world did in fact remain available for direct or indirect annexation as colonies or protectorates, or at least for economic penetration. MacMillan herself acknowledges that a ""serious scramble for China,"" similar to the earlier, risky race for territories in Africa, remained possible, the more so since not only the great European powers but also the USA and Japan displayed much interest in the land of unlimited possibilities that the Middle Empire seemed to be. The imperialist wolves were also keenly - and jealously - eying a couple of other major countries that had hitherto managed to remain independent, namely, Persia and the Ottoman Empire.

The competition between the imperialist powers was and remained very likely to lead to conflicts and wars, not only limited conflicts such as the Spanish-American War of 1899 and the Russian-Japanese War of 1905 but also a general conflagration involving most if not all powers. It almost came to such a conflagration in 1911 when, to the great chagrin of Germany, France turned Morocco into a protectorate. The case of Morocco shows how even supposedly satisfied imperialist powers such as France were never truly satisfied - just as immensely rich people never feel that they have enough riches - but continued to look for more ways to fatten their portfolio of colonial possessions, even if that threatened to cause a war.

Let us consider the case of the ""hungry"" imperialist power, Germany. The Reich, founded in 1871, had entered the scramble for colonies a little too late. It could actually consider itself lucky that it was still able to acquire a handful of colonies such as Namibia. But those hardly amounted to major prizes, certainly not in comparison to the Congo, a huge region bursting with rubber and copper that was pocketed by minuscule Belgium. With respect to access to sources of vital raw materials as well as opportunities for exporting finished products and investment capital, the tandem of Germany's industry and finance thus found itself very much disadvantaged in comparison to its British and French rivals. Crucially important raw materials had to be purchased at comparatively high rates, which meant that the finished products of German industry were more expensive and therefore less competitive on international markets. This imbalance between extremely high industrial productivity and relatively restricted markets demanded a solution. In the eyes of numerous German industrialists, bankers, and other members of the country's elite, the only genuine solution was a war that would give the German Empire what it felt entitled to and - to formulate it in Social-Darwinist terms - what it believed to be necessary for its survival: colonies overseas and, perhaps even more importantly, territories within Europe as well.

In the years leading up to 1914, the German Reich thus pursued an expansionist and aggressive foreign policy aimed at acquiring more possessions and turning Germany into a world power. This policy, of which Emperor Wilhelm II was the figurehead, has gone down in history under the label of Weltpolitik, ""policy on a worldwide scale,"" a term that was merely a euphemism for what was in fact an imperialist policy. In any event, Imanuel Geiss, an authority in the field of the history of Germany before and during the First World War, has emphasized that this policy was one of the factors ""that made war inevitable.""

With respect to overseas possessions, Berlin dreamed of pinching the colonies of small states such as Belgium and Portugal. (And in Great Britain a faction within the elite, consisting mostly of industrialists and bankers with connections to Germany, was in fact willing to appease the Reich, not with a single square mile of their own Empire, of course, but with the gift of Belgian or Portuguese overseas possessions.) Nevertheless, it was above all within Europe itself that opportunities seemed to exist for Germany. Ukraine, for example, with its fertile farmland, loomed as the perfect ""territorial complement"" (Erg√§nzungsgebiet) for the highly industrialized German heartland; its bread and meat could provide cheap food for German workers, which would permit keeping their wages down. Likewise eyed by German imperialists was the Balkan, a region that might serve as source of cheap agricultural products and as market for German commodities. Germans in general were impressed with America's conquest of the ""Wild West"" and Britain's acquisition of the Indian subcontinent and dreamed that their country might similarly obtain a gigantic colony, namely by expanding into Eastern Europe in a modern-day edition of Germany's medieval ""push to the East,"" the Drang nach Osten. The East would supply the Reich with abundant raw materials, agricultural products, and cheap labor in the shape of its numerous, supposedly inferior but muscular natives; and also a kind of social safety valve, because Germany's own potentially troublesome demographic surplus could be shipped as ""pioneers"" to those distant lands. Hitler's infamous fantasies with respect to ""living space,"" which he was to reveal in the 1920s in Mein Kampf and to put into practice during the Second World War, saw the light under those circumstances. In this respect, Hitler was not an anomaly at all, but a typical product of his time and space, and of the imperialism of that time and space.

Western Europe, more developed industrially and more densely populated than Europe's east, was attractive to German imperialism as a market for the finished products of German industry, but also as a source of interesting raw materials. The influential leaders of the German steel industry did not hide their great interest in the French region around the towns of Briey and Longwy; that area - situated close to the border with Belgium and Luxembourg - featured rich deposits of high-quality iron ore. Without this ore, claimed some spokesmen of German industry, the German steel industry was condemned to death, at least in the long run. It was also believed that Germany's Volkswirtschaft, its national economy, would profit greatly from the annexation of Belgium with its great seaport, Antwerp, its coal regions, etc. And together with Belgium its colony, the Congo, would of course also fall into German hands. Whether the acquisition of Belgium and perhaps even the Netherlands would involve direct annexation or a combination of formal political independence and economic dependence on Germany was a matter of debate among the experts within the German elite. In any event, in one way or another, virtually all of Europe was to be integrated into a ""great economic space"" under German control, The Reich would finally be able to take its rightful place next to Britain, the USA, etc. in the restricted circle of the great imperialist powers. (The historian Fritz Fischer has dealt with all this in his classical study of Germany's objectives in World War I.)

It was obvious that Germany's ambitions in the East could not be realized without serious conflict with Russia and the German aspirations with respect to the Balkans risked causing problems with Serbia. That country was already at loggerheads with the Reich's biggest and best friend, Austria-Hungary, but it was supported by Russia. And the Russians were also very annoyed by Germany's planned penetration of the Balkan Peninsula in the direction of Istanbul, since the straits between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean were at the very top of their own list of desiderata. St. Petersburg was almost certainly willing to go to war to deny Germany direct or indirect control of the Bosporus and the Dardanelles.

The German ambitions in Western Europe, and Belgium in particular, obviously ran counter to the interests of the British. At least as far back as the time of Napoleon, London had not wanted to see a major power ensconced in Antwerp and along the Belgian coast - and certainly not Germany, long a great power on land but now, with an increasingly impressive navy, also a menace at sea. With Antwerp, Germany would not only have at its disposal a ""pistol aimed at England,"" as Napoleon had described the city, but also one of the world's greatest seaports. That would have made Germany's international trade far less dependent on the services of British ports, sea lanes, and shipping, a major source of revenue of British commerce.

The real and imaginary interests and needs of Germany as a great industrial and imperialist power thus pushed the country increasingly rapidly, via an aggressive foreign policy, toward a war. But the possibility of war raised no great concerns within the elite of the military giant that Germany had already been for quite some time. To the contrary, among the industrialists, bankers, generals, politicians, and other members of the Reich's establishment, only some rare birds did not wish for a war; most of them preferred a war as soon as possible, and many were even in favor of unleashing a preventive war. Of course, the German elite also featured less bellicose members, but among them, there prevailed the fatalist feeling that war was simply inevitable.

That the merciless competition between the great imperialist powers - a struggle of life and death, as seen from a social-Darwinist viewpoint - was virtually certain to lead to war, was also demonstrated by the case of Great Britain. That country marched into the twentieth century as the world's superpower, in control of an unprecedented collection of colonial possessions. But the power and wealth of the Empire obviously depended on the fact that, thanks to the mighty Royal Navy, Britannia ruled the waves. And in that respect a very serious problem arose around the turn of the century. As fuel for ships, coal was quickly being replaced by petroleum on account of its far greater efficiency. Albion had plenty of coal but did not have petroleum, not even in its colonies, at least not in sufficient quantities. And so the search was on for plentiful and reliable sources of oil, the ""black gold."" For the time being, that precious commodity had to be imported from what was then the world's foremost producer and exporter, the USA. But that was not acceptable in the long run, since Britain often quarrelled with its former transatlantic colony about issues such as influence in South America, and the USA was also becoming a serious rival in the imperialist rat race.

Looking out for alternative sources, the British found a way to quench their thirst for petroleum, at least partly, in Persia. It was in this context that the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company was founded, later to be known as British Petroleum (BP). However, a definitive solution to the problem only appeared in sight when, still during the first decade of the twentieth century, significant deposits of oil were discovered in Mesopotamia, more specifically in the region around the city of Mosul. The patriciate ruling Albion - exemplified by gentlemen like Churchill - decided at that time that Mesopotamia, a hitherto unimportant corner of the Middle East destined to become Iraq after the First World War, but then still belonging to the Ottoman Empire, had to be brought under British control. That was not an unrealistic objective, since the Ottoman Empire was a large but weak country, from whose vast territory the British had already previously managed to carve attractive morsels, for example, Egypt and Cyprus. In fact, in 1899, the British had already snatched oil-rich Kuwait and proclaimed it a protectorate; they were to transform it in 1914 into a supposedly independent emirate. Possession of Mesopotamia, then, was seen to be the only way to make it possible for unlimited quantities of petroleum to flow unperturbed toward Albion's shores.

However, in 1908, the Ottoman Empire became an ally of Germany, which meant that the planned acquisition of Mesopotamia was virtually certain to trigger war between Britain and the Reich. But the need for petroleum was such that plans were nonetheless made for military action. And these plans needed to be implemented as soon as possible. The Germans and Ottomans had started to construct the Bagdad Bahn, a railway that was to link Berlin via Istanbul with Baghdad, the Mesopotamian metropolis, situated close to Mosul, and that raised the prospect that barrels full of Mesopotamian oil might one day start to roll toward Germany for the benefit of the Reich's growing collection of battleships, which happened to be the most dangerous rival of the Royal Navy! Since the Baghdad Bahn was expected to be completed in 1914, quite a few British political and military decision-makers were of the opinion that it was better not to wait very long before starting a war that appeared unavoidable in any event.

It was in this context that London's traditional friendship with Germany came to an end, that Britain joined two former archenemies, France and Russia, in an alliance known as the Triple Entente, and that the British army commanders started to work out detailed plans for war against Germany in collaboration with their French counterparts. The idea was that the massive armies of the French and the Russians would smash Germany's host, while the bulk of the Empire's armed forces would invade Mesopotamia from India, beat the Ottomans, and grab the oil fields. The Royal Navy also promised to prevent the German Navy from attacking France via the English Channel, and on land, the French army was to benefit from (mostly symbolic) assistance by the relatively tiny British Expeditionary Corps (BEF). However, this Machiavellian arrangement was concocted in the greatest secrecy, and neither the Parliament nor the public were informed about it.

On the eve of the Great War, a compromise with the Germans remained possible and even enjoyed the favor of some factions within Britain's political, industrial, and financial elite. A compromise would have provided Germany with at least a share of the Mesopotamian oil, but London sought to achieve nothing less than exclusive control over the ""black gold"" of Mesopotamia. The British plans to invade Mesopotamia were prepared as early as 1911 and called for the occupation of the strategically important city of Basra, to be followed by a march along the banks of the Tigris to Baghdad. Complemented by a simultaneous attack by British forces operating from Egypt, this invasion was to provide Britain with control over Mesopotamia and much of the rest of the Middle East. This scenario would indeed unfold during the Great War, but in slow motion, as it turned out to be a much tougher job than expected, and the objectives would only be achieved at the end of the conflict. Incidentally, the famous Lawrence of Arabia would not suddenly appear out of nowhere; he was merely one of the numerous Brits who, during the years leading up to 1914, had been carefully selected and trained to ""defend"" their country's interests - mostly with respect to oil - in the Middle East.

The conquest of the oil fields of Mesopotamia constituted the prime objective of Britain's entry into the war in 1914. When the war broke out, and the German and Austrian-Hungarian partners went to war against the Franco-Russian duo plus Serbia, there seemed to be no reason for Britain to become involved in the conflict. The government in London was confronted with a dilemma; it was honor-bound to keep the promises made to France but that would have revealed that these plans had been concocted in secret. However, Germany's violation of Belgium's neutrality provided London with the perfect pretext to go to war. In reality, the fate of the small country was of little or no concern to the British leaders, at least as long as the Germans did not proceed to grab Antwerp. Neither was the violation of a country's neutrality deemed to be a big deal; during the war, the British themselves would not hesitate to violate the neutrality of a number of countries, namely, China, Greece, and Persia.

Like all plans made in preparation for what was to become the ""Great War,"" the scenario concocted in London failed to unfold as anticipated. The French and Russians did not manage to crush the Teutonic host, so the British had to send many more troops to the continent - and suffer much greater losses - than foreseen. And in the distant Middle East, the Ottoman army - expertly assisted by German officers - unexpectedly proved to be a tough nut to crack. In spite of these inconveniences, which caused the death of about three quarters of a million soldiers in the UK alone, all was well in the end; in 1918, the Union Jack fluttered over the oil fields of Mesopotamia.

This short survey demonstrates that, as far as the rulers of Britain were concerned, World War I was not fought to save ""gallant little Belgium"" or to champion the cause of international law and justice. At stake were economic interests, the interests of British imperialism, which happen to be the interests of the rich and powerful British aristocratic gentlemen and bourgeois burghers whose corporations and banks lusted for raw materials such as petroleum - and for much else.

It is also obvious that for the patricians in power in London, the war was not a war for democracy at all. In the conquered Middle East, the British did nothing to promote the cause of democracy, to the contrary. Britain's imperialist interests were better served by subtle and not-so-subtle un- and even anti-democratic arrangements. Occupied Palestine was ruled by them in approximately the same way that occupied Belgium had been ruled by the Germans. And in Arabia, London's actions only took into account its own interests - as well as the interests of a handful of indigenous families that were considered to be useful partners. The vast homeland of the Arabs was parcelled out and distributed to those partners, who proceeded to establish states they could rule as if they were personal property. And when many denizens of Mesopotamia had the nerve to resist their new British bosses, Churchill ordered bombs to rain down on their villages, including bombs with poison gas.

On the eve of the outbreak of the Great War, in all the imperialist countries there were countless industrialists and bankers who favored a ""bellicose economic expansionism."" Nevertheless, many capitalists - and possibly even a majority - appreciated the advantages of peace and the inconveniences of war and were therefore not warmongers at all, as Eric Hobsbawm has emphasized. But this observation has wrongly caused the conservative British historian Niall Ferguson to jump to the conclusion that the interests of capitalists did not play a role in the eruption of the Great War in 1914. For one thing, countless industrialists and bankers and member of the upper-middle class displayed an ambivalent attitude with respect to war. On the one hand, even the most bellicose among them realized that a war would have most unpleasant aspects, and for that reason, they preferred to avoid war. However, as members of the elite, they also had reason to believe that the unpleasantness would be experienced mostly by others - and of course mostly by the simple soldiers, workers, peasants, and other plebeians to whom the nasty jobs of killing and dying were traditionally entrusted.

Moreover, the assumption that peace-loving capitalists did not want war reflects a binary, black-and-white kind of thinking, namely that peace was the alternative to war and vice-versa. However, reality has a way of being more complex. There was in fact another alternative to peace, namely revolution. And that other alternative to peace was far more repulsive than war to most if not all capitalists and other bourgeois and aristocratic members of the elite. The aristocracy and the bourgeoisie had been obsessed with fear of revolution ever since the events of 1848 and 1871 had revealed the revolutionary intentions and potential of the proletariat. Afterwards, working-class parties subscribing to Marx's revolutionary socialism had been founded, had become increasingly popular, and remained officially committed to overthrow the established political and social-economic order via revolution even though, as we have seen, they had in fact discreetly become reformist. The decade before the outbreak of war, finally, ironically called Belle √âpoque, witnessed not only new revolutions (in Russia, in 1905 and in China, in 1911) but also, throughout Europe, a never-ending series of strikes, demonstrations, and riots that seemed to be harbingers of revolution in the very heartland of imperialism. In this context, war was promoted not only by philosophers such as Nietzsche and other intellectuals, by military and political leaders, but also by leading industrialists and bankers as an effective antidote to revolution.

During the years leading up to 1914, countless members of the bourgeoisie (and the aristocracy) thus imagined themselves to be witnessing a race between war and revolution, a sprint whose outcome could be decided at any time. Which one of the two was going to win? The burghers, fearing revolution, prayed that war would be the winner. With revolution, rather than peace, as the most likely alternative to war, even the most peace-loving capitalists definitely preferred war. And since they were afraid that revolution might win the race, that is, might break out before war, the capitalists, and the bourgeois and aristocratic members of the elite in general, actually hoped for war to come as soon as possible, which is why they experienced the outbreak of war in the summer of 1914 as a deliverance from unbearable uncertainty and tension. This relief was reflected by the fact that the famous pictures of folks enthusiastically celebrating the declaration of war, taken mostly in the ""better"" districts of the capitals, almost exclusively featured well-dressed ladies and gentlemen, and not workers or peasants, who are known to have been mostly depressed by the news.

In its imperialist manifestation, capitalism was definitely responsible for the many colonial wars that had been waged and was also responsible for the Great War that broke out in 1914. Countless contemporaries realized this only too well. As the great French socialist leader Jean Jaur√®s already declared in 1895, ""capitalism carries war within itself just like the thundercloud carries the storm."" Jaur√®s was a convinced anticapitalist, of course, but many members of the bourgeois and aristocratic elite were also keenly aware of the link between war and their economic interests, and occasionally acknowledged this. General Haig, for example, who would command the British Army from 1915 until the end of the war, declared on one occasion that he was not ""ashamed of the wars fought to open up the markets of the world to our traders."" It was the fateful emergence of the imperialist version of capitalism, then, that, to use Eric Hobsbawm's words, ""pushed the world to conflict and war."" In comparison, the fact that numerous individuals among the industrialists and bankers may privately have cherished peace is of little or no importance and certainly does not permit the conclusion that capitalism did not lead to the Great War. It would be equally fallacious to conclude that Nazism was not really anti-Semitic and did not play a role in the origins of the Holocaust, because quite a few individual Nazis were personally not anti-Semitic.

It is also because imperialist aspirations were responsible for it, that the war that broke out in 1914, essentially a European conflict, developed into a world war. We should not forget that there was fighting not only in Europa but also in Asia and Africa. While the great powers would fight each other primarily, and most ""visibly,"" in Europe, their armies would also do battle in each other's colonial possessions in Africa, in the Middle East, and even in China. Finally, in Versailles, the victors would divide and claim not only the relatively modest booty represented by Germany's former colonies but especially the petroleum-rich regions of the Middle East that had belonged to the Ottoman Empire.

Let us take a quick look at the role played by Japan in the Great War. With its victory over Russia in 1905, the ""land of the rising sun"" revealed itself to be the only ""non-Western"" member of the restricted club of imperialism's great powers. Like all other imperialist powers, Japan was henceforth keen to acquire additional lands as colonies or protectorates in order to make raw materials and such available to its industry, thus making it stronger vis-a-vis the competition - for example, from the USA. The war that broke out in Europe in 1914 provided Japan with a golden opportunity in this respect. On September 23 of that year, Tokyo declared war on Germany for the simple reason that this made it possible to conquer the Reich's mini-colony (or ""concession"") in China, the Bay of Kiao-Chau (or Kiao-Chao), as well as its island colonies in the Northern Pacific. In the case of Japan, it is obvious that the country went to war in order to achieve imperialist objectives. In the case of the Western imperialist powers, however, we continue to be told that in 1914, arms were taken up solely to defend liberty and democracy.

The Great War was a product of imperialism. Its focus was therefore on profits for the big corporations and banks under whose auspices imperialism had developed and whose interests imperialism purported to serve. In this respect, the war did not disappoint. It was admittedly a catastrophe for millions of human beings, for the plebeian masses, for whom it offered nothing but death and misery. But for the industrialists and bankers of each belligerent country - and quite a few neutral countries, such as the USA before 1917 - it revealed itself as a cornucopia of orders and profits.

The conflict of 1914-1918 was an industrial contest in which modern weapons such as cannon, machine guns, poison gas, flamethrowers, tanks, airplanes, barbed wire, and submarines were decisive. This materiel was mass produced in the factories of the industrialists, yielding gargantuan profits, profits that were taxed only minimally in most countries. Profitability was also maximized by the fact that in all belligerent countries the wages (but not the prices) were lowered, while the working hours were lengthened and strikes were forbidden. (That was possible because, as we have seen earlier, imperialism had integrated the leaders and the rank-and-file of the supposedly internationalist and revolutionary socialist parties - and labor unions - into the established order and turned them into patriots, who in 1914 revealed themselves ready to rush to the defense of the fatherland and make the sacrifices presumably required to ensure its victory.) The most famous of the arms manufacturers to be blessed with war profits was Krupp, the world-famous German producer of cannon. But in France too, ""merchants of death"" did a wonderful business, for example, Monsieur Schneider, known as the French Krupp, who in 1914-1918 enjoyed ""a veritable explosion of profits,"" and Hotchkiss, the great specialist in the production of machine guns. State orders for war materiel signified huge profits not only for corporations but also for the banks that were asked to loan the huge sums of money needed by governments to finance these purchases and the costs of the war in general. In the USA, J.P. Morgan & Co, also known as the ""House of Morgan,"" was the undisputed champion glutton in this field. Morgan not only charged high interest rates on loans to the British and their allies but also earned fat commissions on sales to Britain by American firms that belonged to its ""circle of friends,"" such as Du Pont and Remington.

In the spring of 1917, after a revolution had broken out in Russia and the French ally was rocked by mutinies in its army, it was feared that the British might lose the war and therefore not be able to pay back their war debts. It was in this context that the Wall Street lobby, headed by Morgan, successfully pressured President Wilson to declare war on Germany, thus enabling Albion to ultimately win the war and avoid a catastrophe for the US banks, especially Morgan. This development likewise illustrates the fact that the First World War was primarily determined by economic factors, that it was the fruit of imperialism, a system that purported to serve the profit-maximizing interests of corporations and banks - and did.

With respect to the entry of the USA into the great clash of imperialisms of 1914-1918, another remark is in order. It was clear that the imperialist powers that would exit the war triumphantly would pocket great imperialist prizes, and that the losers would have to cough up some of their imperialist assets. And what about the neutrals? In January 1917, the French Prime Minister, Aristide Briand, publicly gave the answer, obviously anticipating a victory for the Triple Entente; neutral countries would not be invited to the peace conference and would not receive a share of the loot, that is, of goodies such as German colonies, the oil-rich regions of the doomed Ottoman Empire, and concessions and lucrative business opportunities in China. In this respect, Japan, America's great competitor in the Far East, had already made a move in 1914 by declaring war on Germany and pocketing the Reich's concession in China. In the USA, this conjured up the risk that Japan might end up monopolizing China economically, excluding American business. It is extremely likely that Washington took Briand's hint and that this consideration also influenced the decision, taken in April of 1917, to declare war on Germany. In the 1930s, an inquiry by the Nye Committee of the American Congress was to come to the conclusion that the country's entry into the war had indeed been motivated by the wish to be present when, after the war, the moment would come ""to redivide the spoils of empire.""

The war provided a mighty stimulus for the maximization of profits made by corporations and banks. But was that not one of the reasons why they had looked forward to war? (Another reason was of course the elimination of the revolutionary threat.) But the conflict also yielded them other considerable benefits. In all belligerent countries, the war reinforced the trend toward gigantism, that is, the ongoing emergence of a relatively small elite of very big corporations and banks. This was so because only big firms could benefit from the state orders for weapons and other war materiel. Conversely, small producers did not profit from the war. Many of them lost their personnel, their suppliers, or their customers; their profits declined, and many of them disappeared from the scene, never to return. In this sense, it is true what Niall Ferguson has pointed out, that during the Great War, the average profits of businesses were not very high; however, the profits of the big firms and banks, the capitalist big boys who dominated the economy since the emergence of imperialism were in fact considerable, as Ferguson himself acknowledges.

Class conflict is a complex, multifaceted phenomenon, as Domenico Losurdo has emphasized in a book on that topic. It is not merely a bilateral conflict between capital and labor but also reflects contradictions between bourgeoisie and nobility, between industrialists of different countries, between the colonies and their mother countries, and also between factions within the bourgeoisie. An example of the latter is the conflict between big and small producers, big business and little business, the upper-middle class or haute bourgeoisie, and the lower-middle class or petite bourgeoisie. Imperialism was - and continues to be - the capitalism of the big boys, the corporations and big banks, and it was imperialism that gave birth to the Great War. It is no coincidence that this big war also favored the big capitalists in their struggle against the little capitalists.

The Great War also privileged the upper-middle class, the gentlemen of industry and finance, vis-a-vis their partner within the elite, the landowning nobility. The nobility had also wanted war, because it expected many advantages from it. But the conflict revealed itself as something very different from the old-fashioned kind of warfare they had expected, in which their beloved cavalry and traditional weapons such as swords and lances would be decisive but, as Peter Englund has written, ""an economic competition, a war between factories."" The Great War was an industrial war, fought with modern weapons mass-produced in the factories of the bourgeois industrialists, and in the course of the war, representatives of corporations and banks - such as Walter Rathenau in Germany - played an increasingly important role as ""experts"" within governments and state bureaucracies. The bourgeoisie thus managed to increase not only its wealth but also its power and prestige - very much to the disadvantage of the aristocrats, whose weapons and expertise proved useless for the purpose of twentieth-century warfare. Until 1914, the haute bourgeoisie had been the junior partner of the nobility within the elite in most countries but that changed during the war and because of the war. After 1918, within the elite, the industrial and financial haute bourgeoisie was on top, with the nobility as its sidekick.

The Great War was very much determined by economic factors, and it was the product of the merciless competition among the imperialist powers, a competition about territories with considerable natural and human resources. It is therefore only logical that this conflict was eventually decided by economic factors; the imperialist powers that emerged as victors in 1918 were those who already controlled the greatest colonial and other territorial riches when the war started in 1914 and were therefore abundantly blessed with strategic raw materials, especially rubber and petroleum, needed to win a modern, industrial war. Let us examine this issue in greater detail.

In 1918, Germany managed to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory, so to speak, because in the spring and summer of that year, the Reich had actually come tantalizingly close to achieving victory. The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, signed with revolutionary Russia on March 3, 1918, had enabled the Reich's army commanders, led by General Ludendorff, to transfer troops from the eastern to the western front and launch a major offensive there on March 21. Considerable progress was achieved at first, but the Allies succeeded time and again to bring in the reserves of men and materiel needed to plug the gaps in their defensive lines, slow down the German juggernaut's advance, and finally to arrest it. August 8 was the date when the tide turned. On that day, the Germans were forced onto the defensive and had to withdraw systematically until they finally capitulated on November 11. The allied triumph was made possible by the fact that they - and especially the French - disposed of thousands of trucks to quickly transport large numbers of soldiers to wherever they were needed. The Germans, on the other hand, still moved their troops mostly by train, as in 1914, but crucial sectors of the front were hard to reach that way. The superior mobility of the Allies was decisive. Ludendorff was to declare later that the triumph of his adversaries in 1918 amounted to a victory of French trucks over German trains.

However, this triumph can also be similarly described as a victory of the rubber tires of the Allies' vehicles, produced by firms such as Michelin and Dunlop, over the steel wheels of German trains, produced by Krupp. Thus it can also be said that the victory of the Entente against the Central Powers was a victory of the economic system, and particularly the industry, of the Allies, against the economic system of Germany and Austria-Hungary, an economic system that found itself starved of crucially important raw materials because of the British blockade. ""The military and political defeat of Germany,"" writes the French historian Fr√©d√©ric Rousseau, ""was inseparable from its economic failure."" But the economic superiority of the Allies clearly has a lot to do with the fact that the British and French - and even the Belgians and Italians - had colonies where they could fetch whatever was needed to win a modern, industrial war, especially rubber, oil, and other ""strategic"" raw materials - plus plenty of colonial laborers to repair and even construct the roads along which trucks transported allied soldiers.

Rubber was not the only strategic type of raw material that the Allies had in abundance while the Germans lacked it. Another one was petroleum, for which the increasingly motorized land armies - and rapidly expanding air forces - were developing a gargantuan appetite. During a victory dinner on November 21, 1918, the British minister of foreign affairs, Lord Curzon, was to declare, not without reason, that ""the allied cause floated to victory upon a wave of oil,"" and a French senator proclaimed that ""oil had been the blood of victory."" A considerable quantity of this oil had come from the USA. It was supplied by Standard Oil, a firm belonging to the Rockefellers, who made a lot of money in this type of business, just as Renault did by producing the gas-guzzling trucks. It was only logical that the Allies, swimming in petroleum, had acquired all sort of modern, motorized, gas-guzzling equipment. In 1918, the French not only had huge quantities of trucks but also a major fleet of airplanes. And in the war's final year, the French as well as the British also disposed of cars equipped with machine guns or cannon and above all of large numbers of tanks. If the Germans had no significant quantities of trucks or tanks, it was also because they lacked petroleum; only insufficient amounts of Rumanian oil were available to them.

The Great War happened to be a war between imperialist rivals, in which the great prizes to be won were territories bursting with raw materials and cheap labor, the kind of things that benefited a country's ""national economy,"" more specifically its industry, and thus made that country more powerful and more competitive. It is therefore hardly a coincidence that the war was ultimately won by the countries that had been most richly endowed in this respect, namely the great industrial powers with the most colonies. In other words: that the biggest imperialisms - those of the British, the French, and the Americans - defeated a competing imperialism, that of Germany, admittedly an industrial superpower, but underprivileged with respect to colonial possessions. In view of this, it is even amazing that it took four long years before Germany's defeat was a fait accompli. On the other hand, it is also obvious that the advantages of having colonies and therefore access to unlimited supplies of food for soldiers and civilians as well as rubber, petroleum, and similar raw materials, as well as a virtually inexhaustible reserve labor force, were only able to reveal themselves in the long run. The main reason for this is that in 1914, the war started as a continental kind of Napoleonic campaign that was to morph - imperceptibly, but inexorably - into a worldwide contest of industrial titans. In 1914, Germany, a military superpower, still stood a chance to win the war, especially since it had excellent railways to ferry its armies to the western and eastern fronts - and more than enough of the coal needed as fuel for the steam trains. This is how a big victory was achieved against the Russians at Tannenberg. However, after four long years of modern, industrial, and in many ways ""total"" war, economic factors revealed themselves as decisive. By the time Ludendorff launched his spring-offensive in 1918, the prospects for a final victory had long gone up in smoke for a German Reich that was prevented by a Royal Navy blockade from reaching territories where it might have been able to fetch adequate amounts of the collective sine qua non of victory in a modern war - strategic raw materials such as petroleum, food for civilians as well as soldiers, cheap labor for industry and agriculture, and so forth.

The Great War of 1914-1918 was a conflict in which two blocks of imperialist powers fought each other for the possession of lands in Europe itself, Africa, Asia, and the entire world. The result of this titanic struggle was a victory for the Anglo-French duo, a major defeat for Germany, and the inglorious demise of the Austrian-Hungarian Empire. In reality, the outcome of the war was unclear, confusing, and unlikely to please anybody. Great Britain and France were the victors but were exhausted by the enormous demographic, material, financial, and other sacrifices they had had to bring; they were no longer the superpowers they had been in 1914. Germany had likewise paid a heavy price, found itself punished and humiliated at Versailles, and lost not only its colonies but even a large part of its own territory; the country was allowed to have only a tiny army, but it remained an industrial superpower that was likely to try once again to achieve great imperialist objectives, as in 1914. Moreover, the war had been an opportunity for two non-European imperialisms to reveal their ambitions, namely, Japan and the USA. The struggle for supremacy among imperialist powers, which is what 1914-1918 had been, thus remained undecided. To make the situation even more complex, along with Austria-Hungary yet another major imperialist actor had departed from the scene, though in a very different way. Russia had morphed, via a great revolution, into the Soviet-Union. That resolutely anti-capitalist state revealed itself to be a thorn in the imperialist side, because it functioned not only as source of inspiration for revolutionaries within each imperialist country but also encouraged anti-imperialist movements in the colonies. Under these circumstances, Europe and the entire world continued to experience great tensions and conflicts that were to yield a second world war or, as many historians now see it, the second act of the great ""Thirty Years' War of the 20th Century.""

Field Marshall Helmut Von Moltke's dictum that ""No plan of operations extends with certainty beyond the first encounter with the enemy's main strength"", is among the most quoted remarks about the realities of war. As it is in the field of battle, so it is in the arena of politics! No plan survives the first contact with reality, which is the ""enemy"" in politics. Plans must be revised, redrawn, improvised, corrected, ascertained and even abandoned, when they come in contact with the objective conditions of life and circumstances in the field.

Plans drawn up in the political party rooms and offices, when brought in contact with the realities of societal chaos, group or personal interests, political and economic complexities and the general convolutions of public policy, might no longer look the same or even seem appropriate to the conditions confronting the leader at any given time or moment. Coming into office from the opposition with a mindset to undo what the predecessor government has done may seem logical, however, it may be perilous as well, when tested against the obligations that have been assumed in the name of the people and the country at large.

As such, when leaders make pronouncements, they must make allowance for ""unforeseen circumstances"" and room for adjustments should be made in case things turn out different from their earlier supposition. It is with these possibilities in mind that I write today about the challenges awaiting President Bassirou Diomaye Faye of Senegal, who was sworn into office on Wednesday, April 2, 2024. In his inauguration address, President Faye outlined his vision for his country in terms of what he could deliver while in office. His vision is clear, forthright and laudable. But the notion of ""Mission, Vision and Objectives"" are corporate fictions that are usually made up to provide a semblance of respectability to the outlooks of companies while in reality, they may not necessarily be what they stand for.

In government, caution is the best accompaniment of policies, which serves to restrain the policy-makers from being carried away by enthusiasm and a sense of ""mission"" that might end up in disappointment and apathy. Accordingly, in order to stay within the boundaries of objectivity and realism, a dose of caution, creative thinking and decisiveness is required when all the facts and factors are put into the scale of chance and weighed carefully in the estimation of the policy-makers.

President Bassirou Diomaye Faye has stated that he would review some major contracts that have been executed by the erstwhile government of his predecessor, President Macky Sall, especially in the oil, gas and minerals sectors. This is within his right as a president, but the implication is that the sacrosanct nature of contractual obligations will now be put into question in Senegal, while the appropriateness of decisions of an elected government acting in sovereign capacity in the name and the interest of the people may be subjected to second guessing.

Under these circumstances, any future government that comes into office may as well decide to revise any decisions or contracts that would be executed by President Faye, and invalidate them as a matter of ""policy"". The stability for which Senegal is renowned and the sense of certainty around which government activities are carried out, will now be put into question, and doubts about Senegal's commitment to meeting its obligations might become a new sentiment at home and abroad.

President Faye may seem eager to keep his campaign promises to renegotiate the terms of oil, gas and mineral contracts entered into with foreign companies in the country. However, for practical purposes and in line with observing legal niceties, it would be much better if he would defer to the advice of his government departments that were responsible for making the initial arrangements with these foreign operators. At the moment, the decision to review the contracts might affect some notable companies that have received concessions to explore and produce oil and gas as well as minerals like gold in Senegal.

Among these are the following: British Petroleum, BP, which operates the Greater Tortue Ahmeyin liquified natural gas, LNG, assets; Kosmo Energy of the USA which is responsible for developing the Yakaar-Teranga gas field together with BP; Woodside Energy of Australia that works the Sangomar oil and gas assets; Total of France that searches for oil and gas offshore in the Rufisque area; Oranto of Nigeria that is involved in exploration in the Cayer offshore area; Endeavour of Australia that is working the Sabodala-Massawa goldfields and others; Managem of Morocco that is also involved in the Boto Gold Project; as well as Dangote Cement of Nigeria that is producing about 1.5 million tons of the product per year in Senegal.

These and other projects involving foreign investors and their local partners no doubt contribute to the development of the Senegalese economy from any angle that they may be viewed. Regardless of this however, any measures that may be taken to ensure probity in reaching contractual agreements should be welcomed so long as they do not appear contradictory to the spirit of mutual understanding and benefits in the exploitation of the country's natural resources.

The political-economy of extracting natural resources in Africa or any other parts of the world is a complex issue that would require careful handling and appropriate recourse to existing best practices. As such, the Diomaye Faye government will be well advised to consult broadly before undertaking the intended review of contracts in the extractive sector. This is because of longterm impacts like legal actions against it for breaches of contracts and reneging on contractual obligations.

African governments do have recourse to sound and professional advice when negotiating contracts with multinational corporations in the field of extractive industries. Institutional leverage provided by groups like the African Development Bank, AfDB, and the UN Economic Commission for Africa, UN-ECA, for instance, could be taken advantage of, in order to arrive at better deals for the countries involved in such transactions with foreign corporations. The Norwegian Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, EITI, is also another facility that could be leveraged by African governments to ensure the soundness of contracts with foreign corporations and the observance of appropriate probity in the policies of concessions in exploitation of resources.

Where there are fears of malpractices or untoward behaviours, international anti-corruption agencies like GIABA which is located in Dakar, Senegal, and the UN Office on Drugs and Crime, UNODC, as well as national anti-corruption agencies and professional bodies, could be involved in the negotiation processes, to ensure probity and protect the integrity of the contracts. Also, reflecting the relevant provisions of the legally binding United Nations Convention Against Corruption (2003) in contracts could be another measure that may be adopted to prevent unwholesome practices creeping into the award of concessions in our countries.

The declared intention of carrying out an 'audit' of the contracts for extraction of natural resources in Senegal may seem timely, especially against the background of pervasive corruption in such situations in most of Africa. However, if such an exercise is done with a mind to embarrass an exiting government, then it would seem inappropriate by the standards of political judgement that does not distinguish between obligations and reciprocal trust in given commitments. Contractual obligations no matter how odious must be deemed sacrosanct until and unless they are proven detrimental in their substance and purpose to the commonwealth, or to one party to the deal in particular.

Where no such facts are established, it would be better to carry on with the projects while carefully determining the pace of their execution, with an intended purpose of reviewing the provisions of their terms and conditions at opportune moments. This may sound conservative and even reactionary to the radical mind, but it should be realised that between 1918 and 1922 or thereabouts, contracts that were entered into by the Tsarit government in Russia, including those to do with loans from the capitalist countries, were honoured by the Bolsheviks under Vladimir Ilyich Lenin. That was purposefully done for the sake of survival of the new regime and the possibilities of accessing much needed capital from the Western countries.

Likewise, for Senegal to retain its image as a favoured destination of investment in Africa, as well as live up to its name as a stable democracy in the continent, the policy of reviewing contractual obligations should be weighed carefully against the consequences that might imperil the larger economic interests of the country.

I would therefore urge President Faye to be seized more with finding ways to address the growing youth unemployment in his country and the protection of his key natural resource which is the fisheries industry, from the ravages of uncontrolled exploitation by foreign fishing fleets.

Henry Cuellar (D-TX) has diverted over half of his 2024 campaign funds to cover legal fees as he faces charges related to allegedly accepting bribes from foreign actors in exchange for pushing policies favorable to them.

More than $784,900 of the roughly $1.5 million that Cuellar's campaign spent in total through the end of March went to legal fees, a new OpenSecrets analysis found.

The payments represent a shift from previous cycles when Cuellar spent donor money mostly on media and other more typical campaign expenses.

In a statement denying the allegations, Cuellar claimed he ""proactively sought legal advice from the House Ethics Committee, who gave [him] more than one written opinion, along with an additional opinion from a national law firm.

The bulk of the legal fees paid with Cuellar's campaign funds went to Clifford Chance LLP, a British multinational law firm representing the congressman in the federal investigation. Cuellar's campaign has paid the law firm about $690,000 since the start of the 2024 election cycle. No other federal political committees have reported payments to the firm.

Perkins Coie, a law firm known for providing political compliance and legal services to Democrats, received another $46,900 from Cuellar's campaign coffers.

Cuellar's campaign also paid $28,100 to Miller and Chevalier, a boutique D.C. firm that specializes in complicated financial cases and has represented former President Donald Trump's onetime campaign chairman Paul Manafort, as well as several other candidates facing ethics inquiries or seeking counsel on other issues.

In February, Cuellar's campaign started paying Mololamken LLP for legal services, racking up a $25,000 bill by March. The firm has only been paid by two other federal political committees. America First Action, a pro-Trump super PAC, paid Mololamken LLP during the 2020 election cycle and Rep. Lori Trahan (D-N.H.) paid the firm about $12,100 in March of 2020. That year, Trahan faced a House Ethics Committee inquiry into whether her campaign accepted impermissible contributions and misreported information to the FEC. The inquiry was dismissed two months later in June 2020.

Cuellar is the second high-profile Democrat in Congress to face bribery and foreign influence charges in the past year. In September, the Justice Department charged Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) and his wife after they allegedly accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes in return for promoting the interests of three New Jersey businessmen and benefitting the Egyptian government. Menendez stepped aside from serving as Senate Foreign Relations chair but pleaded not guilty. Opening arguments for the trial began May 16.

Like Cuellar, Menendez has precipitously ramped up legal spending while facing mounting legal issues. Since the start of the 2024 cycle, the Menendez campaign steered more than 70% of its campaign donor funds to lawyers. By far, the scandal-plagued senator's top campaign expense is legal services this cycle -- with over $2.5 million of the $3.6 million it has spent in total during the 2024 cycle going to legal fees.

Piecing together Cuellar's alleged bribery scheme

Prosecutors say Cuellar and his wife, Imelda, used shell companies to launder nearly $600,000 in bribes in exchange for agreeing to ""influence U.S. foreign policy in favor of Azerbaijan"" and advance the interests of a Mexico City bank from at least 2014 through 2021.

The Cuellars were charged with 14 counts ranging from conspiracy to commit bribery to wire fraud, money laundering and working on behalf of a foreign government. The Cuellars made their first court appearances on May 3 and were each released on a $100,000 bond. If convicted, the Cuellars could face up to decades in prison.

The Texas Democrat's efforts to push U.S. policy in favor of Azerbaijan ranged from delivering a speech promoting Azerbaijan's interests on the House floor to integrating language into spending bills to bolster U.S. backing for Azerbaijan. He also helped kill legislation supporting Armenia in its decades-old conflict with Azerbaijan.

Cuellar's connections to Azerbaijan go back to at least January 2013, the same month Cuellar was appointed to the House Appropriations Committee. It was also the month that Cuellar and his wife flew to the Eastern European country on a trip sponsored by an entity calling itself the Turquoise Council of Americans and Eurasians, according to congressional disclosure reports.

The Turquoise Council of Americans and Eurasians was run by Turkish-American businessman Kemal Oksuz, who also formed the Assembly of the Friends of Azerbaijan months after Cuellar's trip. The Office of Congressional Ethics later found that Oksuz ""used the entities interchangeably."" The indictment's description of ""Individual-1"" appears to reference Oksuz.

In disclosures to Congress, Oksuz initially claimed that Cuellar's January 2013 trip and a subsequent May 2013 congressional tour of Azerbaijan were paid for by the Turquoise Council and the Assembly of the Friends of Azerbaijan. But Oksuz later admitted that the May 2013 trip was paid for by SOCAR, the State Oil Company of Azerbaijan Republic, a national oil and gas company wholly owned by the country's government.

Oksuz openly stated that the event's corporate backers included SOCAR, Caspian Drilling Company and drilling fluids businesses such as M-I Swaco and Azeri M-I Drilling Fluids Ltd, as well as oil and gas companies British Petroleum, ConocoPhillips and Chevron. But he later confessed to concealing sponsors' role in funding travel for members of Congress, which is legally required to be disclosed.

A 2015 report by the Office of Congressional Ethics found that SOCAR steered $750,000 to the nonprofits in May 2013, which was then used to fund travel to Azerbaijan for Congress members and staffers.

The May 2013 conference's guest list included members of Congress, congressional staff, state representatives, former governors and White House officials. Oksuz estimated that the event cost roughly $1.5 million. Attendees were paid thousands of dollars in honorariums on top of ""pricey gifts.""

After the Houston Chronicle found that all 10 members of Congress who participated in the trip to Baku supported pro-Azerbaijan amendments in the U.S. House, the Office of Congressional Ethics launched an investigation into the funding behind the travel.

While Cuellar did not attend the second trip, both excursions were reported as funded through the Turquoise Council of Americans and Eurasians and at least one of Cuellar's staffers joined the second trip. The itinerary for Cuellar's January 2013 trip also included a ""briefing"" at SOCAR and ""dinner with SOCAR Executive Team.""

After that trip, Cuellar's relationship with SOCAR flourished. According to the indictment unsealed on May 3, agents working on behalf of the Azerbaijani government recruited Cuellar to work with them on U.S. policy helping their country.

In July 2013, Cuellar spoke at a Washington, D.C. reception in honor of SOCAR to highlight the importance of a pipeline to deliver natural gas to Europe.

By September 2013, Cuellar had sponsored a resolution in Congress expressing support for Azerbaijan's Southern Gas Corridor project, asserting that it was in the ""U.S. national interest"" to have the pipeline completed. The House Foreign Affairs Committee adopted the resolution and a portion of the pipeline began commercial operations to deliver gas from Azerbaijan to Italy in 2020.

Cuellar's campaign also accepted money from Oksuz, including $1,000 in 2012 and $2,500 in 2015.

After Oksuz pleaded guilty to filing false statements and ""orchestrating a scheme to funnel money to fund the trip,"" prosecutors say payments from SOCAR to Cuellar paused.

Cuellar is also accused of accepting bribes in exchange for helping to further the political agenda of a Mexico City bank.

""Foreign Bank-1"" appears to reference Banco Azteca, a subsidiary of Grupo Elektra, a retail and banking company that's part of a corporate conglomerate led by Mexican billionaire Ricardo Salinas Pliego. In 2012, Grupo Elektra acquired U.S.-based payday lender Advance America, which matches the indictment's description of ""U.S. Affiliate-4.""

The indictment describes ""U.S. Affiliate-3"" as a Spanish-language media and entertainment company that appears to be TV Azteka, a subsidiary of Grupo Elektra under the umbrella of Mexican conglomerate Grupo Salinas.

In addition to fighting an anti-money laundering policy that threatened the bank's interests, prosecutors say Cuellar tipped off its vice chairman about a proposal to pause the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau from making new regulations on the payday lending industry that could impact the company.

Similar to Cuellar's arrangement with Azerbaijan, the Mexico City bank allegedly funneled fake consulting fees through a shell company operated by the congressman's wife, Imelda Cuellar.

Prosecutors say ""Individual-3,"" whose description matches the identity of Florencio ""Lencho"" Rendon, served as a middleman between Cuellar and the Mexico City bank and used his consulting company to funnel money. In a plea agreement, Rendon said Cuellar ordered him to pay off a Mexican politician because he ""brought the deal to the table.""

Another middleman described in the indictment is ""Individual-4,"" which appears to be a reference to Colin Strother, who served as Cuellar's former chief of staff and campaign manager. Prosecutors claim that Rendon steered the monthly payments to Strother, who would then pass the money to sham consulting companies run by the congressman's wife.

Prosecutors allege that Cuellar suggested using Strother's consulting company as a middleman. Like Rendon, Strother also pleaded guilty and entered into a cooperation agreement, admitting to participating in a scheme to funnel funds ""obtained through unlawful activity, namely bribery"" to Henry Cuellar, who Strother says was the ""true, intended beneficiary recipient"" of the money.

Irada Akhoundova also entered into a plea agreement and admitted to helping facilitate a $60,000 payment while working for an affiliate of Azerbaijan's state-run oil company.

All in the family

Imelda Cuellaris not the only family member with connections to the shell companies that were allegedly used to launder bribes. The indictment alleges Henry Cuellar recruited family, friends and associates to facilitate the payments.

OpenSecrets' review of corporate records found that Henry Cuellar's two daughters Catherine and Christine, wife Imelda and brother Martin are all listed as members, agents and owners of various limited-liability companies with little or no paper trail.

Prosecutors do not divulge the names of the entities allegedly used in the scheme to launder bribes in the indictment but describe three shell companies that match the identities of limited-liability companies incorporated in Texas.

Originally incorporated in 2012 as IRC Business Solutions Inc., IRC Business Solutions LLC was recreated as a limited liability company in 2014, matching the description of ""Shell Company-1"" in the indictment.

Imelda Cuellar wholly owns IRC Business Solutions, which her husband describes in personal financial disclosures on file with Congress as a ""limited liability company that consults on business activities."" While Imelda Cuellar is IRC Business Solutions LLC's sole member, it was incorporated in 2014 by Raul Vazquez, a former judge whose law office is listed as the registered office street address for the limited liability company and who has spoken highly of Henry Cuellar.

Personal financial disclosures also reveal that Imelda Cuellar has a 60% interest in Global Gold Group LLC, a limited liability company that the congressman claims ""provides general consulting services.""

Incorporation records show Global Gold Group LLC was created in 2017 and its other two members are the Cuellars' daughters, Christina and Caroline, matching the indictment's description of ""Shell Company-2.""

Obsidian Ora LLC, which operated out of the same address as Global Gold Group from 2021 to 2023 with Christine Cuellar as its sole member and agent, matches the description of ""Shell Company-3.""

While three shell companies are highlighted in the indictment, the Cuellar family is also connected to other companies with little paper trail.

Ivcz Parts, Supplies, and Services LLC is described in Henry Cuellar's financial disclosures as a limited-liability company that ""sells business parts, supplies and services."" Created in 2015, the LLC is 50% owned by his wife. Ivcz Parts, Supplies, and Services LLC does not match any of the descriptions of purported sham companies in the indictment.

Henry Cuellar's brother, Martin, is also listed as a member and registered agent of Ivcz Parts, Supplies, and Services LLC. Martin Cuellar serves as the sheriff of Webb County in Texas, where he is up for reelection this year. The primary runoff will occur on May 28 with the general election in November.

Through various contract agreements, money was funneled by SOCAR through Azerbaijani front companies.

The indictment's description of one of SOCAR's U.S.-based front companies ""U.S. Affiliate-2"" matches a now-defunct company in Katy, Texas called OLIMP USA LLC that was controlled from 2017 to 2021 by former Azerbaijani diplomat Elshan Baloghlanov.

Baloghlanov, who now serves as the Permanent Delegate of the Government of Azerbaijan to UNESCO, matches the indictment's description of ""Individual-2."" The indictment notes that ""Individual-2 served as Vice Consul at the Azerbaijani Consulate in Los Angeles, reporting to Azerbaijani ""Diplomat-1.""

""U.S. Company-1,"" an import/export management company operated by Baloghlanov in Maryland, appears to be WCC International. Baloghlanov previously served with Suleymanov, who served as Azerbaijan's U.S. ambassador from 2011 to 2021, and allegedly acted as Suleymanov's middleman with Cuellar, helping to relay messages and arrange meetings.

That included an October 2017 lunch between Imelda Cuellar and SOCAR officials at a San Antonio steakhouse to negotiate their arrangement. The indictment doesn't include the name of the steakhouse but federal campaign finance reports reveal that Cuellar's campaign spent $103 at Ruth's Chris in San Antonio around that time, as first reported by San Antonio Express-News.

""Diplomat-1"" matches Elman Abdullayev, who served as the Consulate General of Azerbaijan in Los Angeles from 2005 to 2010.

Henry Cuellar (D-TX) has diverted over half of his 2024 campaign funds to cover legal fees as he faces charges related to allegedly accepting bribes from foreign actors in exchange for pushing policies favorable to them.

More than $784,900 of the roughly $1.5 million that Cuellar's campaign spent in total through the end of March went to legal fees, a new OpenSecrets analysis found.

The payments represent a shift from previous cycles when Cuellar spent donor money mostly on media and other more typical campaign expenses.

In a statement denying the allegations, Cuellar claimed he ""proactively sought legal advice from the House Ethics Committee, who gave [him] more than one written opinion, along with an additional opinion from a national law firm.

The bulk of the legal fees paid with Cuellar's campaign funds went to Clifford Chance LLP, a British multinational law firm representing the congressman in the federal investigation. Cuellar's campaign has paid the law firm about $690,000 since the start of the 2024 election cycle. No other federal political committees have reported payments to the firm.

Perkins Coie, a law firm known for providing political compliance and legal services to Democrats, received another $46,900 from Cuellar's campaign coffers.

Cuellar's campaign also paid $28,100 to Miller and Chevalier, a boutique D.C. firm that specializes in complicated financial cases and has represented former President Donald Trump's onetime campaign chairman Paul Manafort, as well as several other candidates facing ethics inquiries or seeking counsel on other issues.

In February, Cuellar's campaign started paying Mololamken LLP for legal services, racking up a $25,000 bill by March. The firm has only been paid by two other federal political committees. America First Action, a pro-Trump super PAC, paid Mololamken LLP during the 2020 election cycle and Rep. Lori Trahan (D-N.H.) paid the firm about $12,100 in March of 2020. That year, Trahan faced a House Ethics Committee inquiry into whether her campaign accepted impermissible contributions and misreported information to the FEC. The inquiry was dismissed two months later in June 2020.

Cuellar is the second high-profile Democrat in Congress to face bribery and foreign influence charges in the past year. In September, the Justice Department charged Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) and his wife after they allegedly accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes in return for promoting the interests of three New Jersey businessmen and benefitting the Egyptian government. Menendez stepped aside from serving as Senate Foreign Relations chair but pleaded not guilty. Opening arguments for the trial began May 16.

Like Cuellar, Menendez has precipitously ramped up legal spending while facing mounting legal issues. Since the start of the 2024 cycle, the Menendez campaign steered more than 70% of its campaign donor funds to lawyers. By far, the scandal-plagued senator's top campaign expense is legal services this cycle -- with over $2.5 million of the $3.6 million it has spent in total during the 2024 cycle going to legal fees.

Tesla has launched multiple rounds of layoffs over the past few weeks, seemingly including multiple whole departments like the advertising and Supercharging teams.

However, just as the company has hired back a key executive from the Supercharging team who was laid off, yet another executive in Europe who left months ago has officially assumed the lead position at another charging company.

Prior to the layoffs, the former head of the European Supercharger network, Jeroen van Tilburg, departed from the company in December. In a LinkedIn post on Monday, van Tilburg officially highlighted his first day in a new role as the CEO of IONITY, a charging network developer created as a joint venture between BMW, Ford, Hyundai, Mercedes-Benz, and Volkswagen.

IONITY originally announced the news in a press release last month, with van Tilburg officially succeeding former CEO Michael Hajesch on Monday.

""I am honored and excited to assume the role of CEO at IONITY, as we enter a pivotal moment for the charging business in Europe,"" van Tilburg said in the release. ""Guided by our mission of enabling electric travel for everyone, we are uniquely positioned to solidify our position as a leader in the industry.

""Our responsibility to deliver a premium customer experience - through comprehensive coverage, resilient capacity, unparalleled reliability, and supporting all vehicle brands - has never been more critical.""

IONITY is currently building out its High-Power Charging (HPC) network along European highways, offering up to 350 kW charging speeds. The company currently has over 3,600 individual HPC charging points across Europe, located at more than 600 sites across 24 countries.

The former Tesla Supercharger executive's start date comes just as Tesla has hired back Max de Zegher, North American charging team Director. As reports of the charging team layoffs surfaced, leaving many sites in the U.S. on the line with utilities providers and property developers, other companies such as bp (formerly British Petroleum) and New York-based ride-sharing platform and charging station builder Revel have expressed interest in snatching up these locations.

In an interview with Bloomberg, BP Pulse Americas CEO Sujay Sharma said the brand is eager to snap up sites to place its chargers. Its main target? Properties Tesla once purchased with Superchargers in mind.

""If there are stranded real estate partners who are looking for someone to call, they should feel free to pick up the phone and call me or look me up on LinkedIn,"" Sharma said.

Tesla was once the EV charging world's holy grail. When the Department of Energy revealed last month that the United States possesses one fast EV charging station for every 15 gas stations, Tesla was behind roughly a quarter of the boon. The storied EV company has spent the last year and a half installing so many chargers that it's asked customers where they want new stations. Both new and legacy automakers were working to adopt Tesla's charging standard. With the US projected to require about 2.3 million EV chargers by 2030, Tesla was expected to help meet that demand. Even President Biden lauded Tesla's vast charging network in February 2023, when the White House wrote new guidelines for federally-funded EV chargers.

But at the end of April, Tesla axed most of its Supercharger team, which employed nearly 500 people. Someone familiar with the matter told Bloomberg that the layoffs would slow the charging network's growth -- a statement confirmed by CEO Elon Musk in an X post from the same day. ""Tesla still plans to grow the Supercharger network, just at a slower pace for new locations and more focus on 100% uptime and expansion of existing locations,"" Musk wrote, neglecting to offer an explicit reason for the decision.

Now, BP Pulse is looking to pick up Tesla's slack. Sharma said last week that BP was ""aggressively looking to acquire real estate to scale our network, which is a heightened focus following the recent Tesla announcement."" The division reportedly plans to build at least 3,000 US charging points within two to three years. By 2030, it will have spent $1 billion on EV charging stations, with some comprising ""Gigahubs,"" BP Pulse's 12-plus charger stations. The company unveiled its first Gigahub this March at its headquarters in Houston.

To support this growth, BP Pulse also hopes to bring some of Tesla's terminated staff. Amid a ""fairly significant change in the competitive dynamic in the charging space,"" Sharma said BP Pulse is ""actively seeking good talent"" interested in and experienced with EV charger hardware.",extremetech.com,news,ExtremeTech,Adrianna Nine,0.1764705882352942,453304865,1,https://i.extremetech.com/imagery/content-types/01p5BJdWbfYhD774a4WPL6b/hero-image.fill.size_1200x675.png,eng-9560622

Last year, British petroleum giant BP has announced that its EV charging business, BP Pulse will purchase Tesla Superchargers for deployment on an independent EV charging network.

The deal with BP Pulse is part of the British petroleum firm's plans to invest up to US$1 billion (RM4.75 billion) in EV charging operations across the United States by 2030, and BP Pulse has installed more than 27,000 charging points to date, with 100,000 charging points targeted for roll-out by 2030, according to BP.

""We are aggressively looking to acquire real estate to scale our network, which is a heightened focus following the recent Tesla announcement,"" a BP spokesperson said in a statement, according to Reuters.

This comes after Tesla was revealed to be laying off more than 10% of its global workforce, with the job cuts to affect around 14,000 persons, according to the New York Times last month.

Last October, BP placed an order for Tesla chargers worth US$100 million (RM475 million), though BP itself had also cut its EV charging business workforce by 10% and withdrew from several markets as commercial EV fleets did not grow as rapidly as predicted, Reuters cited company sources as saying.

Monday again? It seems like only yesterday it was Sunday. Oh well, that means it's time to kick off the working week with a dose of Who, Me? - The Reg's weekly confessional, where readers share tales of tech mischief and misadventure.

This week, meet a reader we'll Regomize as ""Nick"" whose career in finance once had him working for ""a large US bank in the City"" (for non-UK readers, that means the financial district in London).

One of his functions was keeping an eye on market data, which was sent out regularly by services like Reuters among others. These were early days, so the system was not all high-res and fancy like it is now. Users would type into an X-terminal, and Reuters would send its reports in a standard format: 64 columns by 17 rows.

Most importantly, all the banks' systems were standardized on that format, so that as data was sent out everyone could read it with no issues of formatting. You would enter a code for a particular company - say, for British Petroleum - and up would come the latest info that the markets might need to know. Not a lot of information fit in a page, but it was functional.

Of course, as we all know, technology inevitably improves with the relentless march of time. And one day Reuters sent out a memo informing users that it was trying out a new format: 80 columns by 25 entire rows. Can you imagine the vast panoramas of data that were promised?

It was, of course, just a beta test, so don't go trying it unless you know your system can handle the new format. You don't want to go crashing your bank's computers, now.

Well, Nick was confident his bank's systems were up to date and bleeding edge, so he went and had a go. He entered - where the indicated that he wanted the long form document - and his screen automagically reformatted itself to the new size. Up came a massive page with everything he could want to know. And space for more!

He showed it to a colleague, who was duly impressed. The colleague suggested he might tell a friend of his, who worked at a different bank. Nick recounted for Who, Me? the half of the conversation he heard:

""Hey, have you seen these new large pages from Reuters?""

It appeared that Nick's colleague's friend at the other bank had not checked first to ensure that the system could handle the new format pages, and had found out - the very hard way - that no, it could not. The system crashed completely.

Nick never did find out what the consequences were - if any - of the unscheduled downtime. He wasn't game to call and find out.

But to the extent that he bore any responsibility as the instigator of the ill-fated attempt to load a page, he escaped completely scot-free. As Nick put it: ""It was Reuters who crashed their system - not us. All we did was load the gun.""

You can argue that one in the comments.

If you've ever set in motion a chain of events that led to technological chaos, then escaped even a hint of blame, this is where you can tell all, anonymously, and finally have your evil genius appreciated.

Or follow us on Google News!

One of the most important assets Tesla has is its Supercharger network. The company realized early on that people would not buy lots of electric cars unless they had a reliable way to charge them when away from home, and so Tesla invested early in creating its own charging network, which now includes more than 50,000 chargers worldwide. The beauty of the Supercharger system is that Tesla is able to make its own charging equipment at a cost which some analysts claim is up to 70% less than the competition.

Not only that, the Tesla Superchargers work as intended -- something that can't be said for the chargers at other EV charging companies. Arrive, plug in, and charging begins in seconds. The cost of each charging session is automatically billed to the credit card associated with the customer's Tesla account -- no cards to tap or apps to download. The Supercharger network is recognized as the gold standard that all other charging companies aspire to match if they can. So far, none have.

In North America, Tesla uses a proprietary plug that is a thing of efficiency and beauty compared to the clunky CCS equipment everyone else uses. The Tesla device, known as NACS, which stands for North American Charging Standard, is so superior to the CCS option that virtually all other EV manufacturers agreed to adopt for their cars sold in North America. SAE quickly created a new standard known as J3400. By 2025, virtually all electric cars sold in North America will come from the factory with charging ports that use the J34o0 standard.

The Biden administration had made billions of dollars available to bring more EV chargers to America, not just along interstate highways and other major transportation routes, but in cities and rural areas where chargers today are scarcer than chicken lips. But now Elon has had one of his typical brain farts. Like an infant throwing toys out of the crib, he has summarily fired the head of the Supercharger division along with about 500 people who were part of the Supercharger team.

In truth, no one quite knows yet what the result of this new course change by Tesla will be. We aren't sure if even Elon knows. But other companies are sniffing around, wondering if there is an opportunity here. It is unlikely those former Tesla Supercharger team members will be unemployed for long. One of those companies is BP, once known as British Petroleum. It has created a new division called BP Prime that purports to be seeking ways for the company -- one of the biggest polluters in history -- to transition to a low-carbon business model.

BP now says it is eager to snap up Tesla Supercharger sites across the US -- along with the employees who made them possible. It has pledged $1 billion by 2030 to expand its network. The company said it ""is aggressively looking to acquire real estate to scale our network, which is a heightened focus following the recent Tesla announcement."" It plans to spend half of that $1 billion within the next two to three years to install more than 3,000 charging points across the US. A key part of the strategy is building large scale hubs with 12 or more chargers it will call Gigahubs, an obvious allusion to Elon's penchant for applying the term ""giga"" to everything he touches.

""If there are stranded real estate partners who are looking for someone to call, they should feel free to pick up the phone and call me or look me up on LinkedIn,"" Sujay Sharma, chief executive officer of BP Pulse Americas, said in an interview with Bloomberg. ""We are actively seeking good talent and real estate opportunities that allow us to help grow, despite whatever else is going on around us,"" Sharma said. The company last year signed a deal to procure about $100 million worth of Tesla Supercharger hardware, with the deployment expected to start later this year and early 2025, he said. That may be so, but Reuters reports that BP trimmed 10 percent of its the employees in its electric vehicle charging business recently and pulled out of several markets after a bet on rapid growth in commercial EV fleets didn't pay off.

Other companies, including EVgo, see Tesla's slowdown as a positive development that will help increase their market share, according to CEO Badar Khan. He foresees ""a fairly significant change in the competitive dynamic in the charging space"" that allows competitors like EVgo to pick up ""the slack"" in growth left behind by Tesla, he said on the company's earnings call last week. The firm also is eager to take on Tesla employees and is in talks with site hosts left in the lurch. Tesla summarily cancelled many proposed new Supercharger locations, saying it would add more chargers to existing locations instead.

The DC fast chargers that BP Pulse plans to use will be compatible with both the North American Charging Standard (NACS) and Combined Charging System (CCS) standard and will provide 250 kW of power. That's mid range power today, with many chargers capable of supplying 350 kW or more to cars that are able to accept that level of power.

Every dark cloud has a silver lining. Whatever Musk and Tesla are up to, others -- like BP -- are seeing opportunities that didn't exist a few weeks ago. How this will play out won't be known for some time, but no one is going to leave billions of federal dollars on the table untouched, except for certain red states which are actively opposed to all this woke nonsense about electric cars. They see the transition to zero emission transportation as a vast left-wing plot to deny Americans the right to experience the soul-stirring sound of a V-8 engine. Who cares about the environment? Let Mother Nature take care of herself!

It is interesting that BP, which brought us the horrific Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico, now wants to present a new, more climate friendly face to the world. Perhaps it should be applauded for doing so, but the deeply cynical policies of the fossil fuel companies makes it hard to believe they are suddenly interested in spreading low emissions pixie dust around. Perhaps as the shock waves from Tesla's sudden decision to dismantle its Supercharger team settle down, we will get a clearer picture of what the future or high-speed charging in North America will look like.",cleantechnica.com,news,CleanTechnica,Steve Hanley,0.1450980392156862,453261768,1,https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/430857184_275173535610649_6173585938900189041_n.jpg,eng-9560622

The current declines come amid deescalating tensions in the Middle East and on signs that the U.S. economy is slowing, putting downward pressure on oil demand forecasts. America remains the world's biggest consumer of energy products such as oil and natural gas. At the same time, the economy in China, the world's second-largest oil consumer, also continues to slump. All eyes are now on a meeting of OPEC+ oil producers that is scheduled for June 1.

The current situation is proving to be difficult on energy companies, particularly oil producers and refiners, pushing their share prices lower. Here are the three most undervalued energy stocks to buy in May 2024.

Marathon Petroleum Corp. (NYSE:MPC) looks like a screaming buy with its share price down 15% in the last month. MPC stock is currently trading at just nine times future earnings estimates, and it offers shareholders a quarterly dividend payment of 82 cents a share, which is good for a yield of 1.82%. Even with the current pullback, Marathon Petroleum's stock is still up 17% this year, 60% in the past 12 months and 237% over five years. The gas station chain has been a consistent winner for its shareholders.

The drop in the share price comes after Marathon Petroleum issued its latest financial results. The company managed to beat Wall Street forecasts on the top and bottom lines. For the year's first quarter, Marathon Petroleum reported earnings per share of $2.58, which was ahead of the $2.54 expected among analysts. Sales in the quarter came in at $33.2 billion, which topped a consensus estimate of $32.01 billion. Unfortunately, the stock has been hurt by lower refining margins. Marathon is one of the biggest refiners.

Still, Marathon Petroleum returned $2.5 billion of capital to shareholders in Q1 through $2.2 billion worth of stock buybacks and $299 million of dividend payments.

Diamondback Energy (NASDAQ:FANG) has a potential multiyear catalyst with its $26 billion acquisition of Endeavor Energy Partners. The purchase of Endeavour gives Diamondback Energy the largest privately held oil and gas producer in the Permian Basin of Texas. Endeavour Energy's operations span 350,000 acres in the Midland, Texas area of the Basin that straddles West Texas and eastern New Mexico. The additional land and operations will make Diamondback a top player in the oil-rich region.

Ahead of the deal closing, FANG stock looks a little undervalued, trading at 11 times future earnings estimates and offering a quarterly dividend of $2.32 a share for a monstrous yield of 4.6%. Diamondback Energy has also been a top energy stock over the past year, having risen 54% in the last 12 months, including a 28% gain in 2024. The purchase of Endeavour Energy is expected to close by the end of this year, paving the way for strong and sustained growth at Diamondback Energy.

For a big international play, consider British Petroleum (NYSE:BP). The oil major's stock looks undervalued right now trading at 12 times future earnings estimates and with a quarterly dividend payout of 44 cents a share, giving it a hefty yield of 4.6%. In the last year, BP stock has increased only 3%. Through five years, the company's share price has declined 9%. Volatile crude oil and natural gas prices are to blame for the poor performance of BP stock. However, the company's prospects continue to look bright, making BP a solid choice for investors looking for undervalued energy stocks.

Lower oil and gas prices led to weak fuel margins at the energy major, hurting its Q1 earnings and depressing the share price. However, BP is taking steps to keep its business humming despite ongoing volatility in energy markets. Management says they remain on track to deliver $2 billion in cost savings by the end of 2026, which should help improve margins. Additionally, the company continues to prioritize its shareholders, recently announcing a new stock buyback program of $3.5 billion for the first half of this year.",investorplace.com,news,InvestorPlace,Joel Baglole,-0.1294117647058823,453058919,1,https://investorplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/shutterstock_1007906431.jpg,

British Petroleum (BP) Pulse recently told Bloomberg that it would aggressively pursue an expansion of its charging network with a ""heightened focus following the recent Tesla announcement.""

BP's EV charging business aims to gain ground on the automaker as it cancels some planned charging sites. Recent reports show that Tesla nixed a handful of Supercharger locations in New York, though it's unclear how the layoffs and business plans will affect other future sites.

The oil giant previously reported its plans to invest more than $1 billion to expand its network in partnership with Love's Travel Stops and Pilot-Flying J. It has also ordered tens of millions of dollars worth of Tesla Superchargers, though it will manage them independently of the automaker.

Other charging companies are eying expansions to fill any gaps left in the wake of Tesla's upheaval. EVGo's CEO said his organization would look to ""pick up some of the slack"" that the company leaves behind, and others have looked to take over Tesla's canceled charging locations.

Even if Tesla's charging network floats on relatively unchanged, it's clear others see an opportunity and aren't willing to wait and see how its fortunes unfold. That said, the Supercharger network is widely regarded as one of the nation's best, so there's no way to know if new locations from outside entities will offer anything near the same experience as they grow.",thetruthaboutcars.com,news,The Truth About Cars,,0.1843137254901961,453050260,1,https://cdn-fastly.thetruthaboutcars.com/media/2024/05/10/10461/bp-is-looking-to-fill-any-gaps-left-by-tesla-supercharger-team-s-upheaval.jpg?size=1200x628,eng-9549075

Let&CloseCurlyQuote;s start with LNG Energy Group, market capitalization C$46.53 million, an acquirer and developer of natural gas production and exploration assets in Latin America with over 50 per cent insider ownership.

The company, active in Colombia and Venezuela, holds over 800,000 acres of land for development and exploration in close proximity to markets and pipelines allowing for rapid monetization of new production. It was producing 19 million cubic feet of natural gas equivalent per day (bcfe/d) and sitting on 98 bcfe of proven and probable reserves valued at US$306 million as of March 2024, and boasts a management team whose extensive M&A and capital markets experience in oil and gas, including at Bank of America and British Petroleum, sets it up for future expansion across Latin America.

If LNG Energy&CloseCurlyQuote;s robust turn to profitability, posting net income of US$18.47 million in Q3 2023 after years of losses, is any indication, it&CloseCurlyQuote;s that the company is now capable of putting up solid results in the midst of active growth, as detailed in its year-end 2023 results.

LNG Energy Group stock (TSXV:LNGE) last traded at C$0.30 per share. The stock has given back 31.82 per cent year-over-year, but only 6.25 per cent since inception in September 2023.

Ur-Energy, market capitalization C$691.39 million, is a uranium mining company that has produced and packaged approximately 2.8 million pounds of U3O8 from its Lost Creek in-situ recovery facility in Wyoming since 2013, with an estimated 12.7 million pounds eU3O8 measured and indicated and 6.1 million pounds eU3O8 inferred remaining to be exploited over a 13-year mine life.

The company is also building Shirley Basin, its second in situ recovery facility in Wyoming, which will be able to produce up to 1 million pounds of U3O8 per year and is expected to recover 6.4 million pounds of an estimated 8.8 million pounds eU3O8 measured and indicated. Construction is estimated to finalize in 2025 with operating costs estimated at US$24.40 per pound.

With uranium prices up by about 5x over the past five years to US$93.50 per pound, Ur-Energy&CloseCurlyQuote;s long-tenured management team, de-risked by working lifetimes in mining and uranium, benefits from a runway extending from 2024 well into the next decade to continue creating shareholder value.

Ur-Energy stock (TSX:URE) last traded at C$2.44 per share. The stock has added 83.46 per cent year-over-year and 119.82 per cent since 2019.

Our final small-cap stock pick to bolster the commodity sleeve of your portfolio is Pampa Metals, market capitalization C$17.53 million, a copper-gold explorer developing the Piuquenes copper-gold porphyry project in Argentina, on which it holds an option to acquire an 80 per cent interest.

The junior miner has backed up historical intercepts from the 1990s, including 558.2 m grading 0.38 per cent copper, 0.42 g/t gold and 2.4 g/t silver, with 422 m at 1 per cent copper equivalent (CuEq), including 132 m at 1.45 per cent CuEq in March 2024, and 448 m grading 0.42 per cent copper and 0.46 g/t gold, including 126 m at 0.66 per cent copper and 0.74 g/t gold in May 2024. Piuquenes&CloseCurlyQuote; highly mineralized porphyry system remains open to depth and to the northeast, with results pending for Pampa&CloseCurlyQuote;s third drill hole.

Management - ex Rio Tinto, BHP, Goldman Sachs, UBS - believes Piuquenes could be a company-maker, seeing the potential for a cluster of deposits across the property, with a second undrilled outcropping porphyry identified at Piuquenes East and numerous other nearby targets still to be explored.

When we consider copper&CloseCurlyQuote;s current nearly 40-year high at US$4.61 per pound - including a massive 28 per cent gain since Feb. 2024 - the metal&CloseCurlyQuote;s essential role in the energy transition thanks to its unmatched electrical conductivity, and Pampa stock&CloseCurlyQuote;s approximately 60 per cent gain since optioning Piuquenes in November 2023, it seems plain as day that the market is warming up to the copper stock&CloseCurlyQuote;s long-term value proposition.

Pampa Metals stock (CSE:PM) last traded at C$0.26 per share and is down by 53.64 per cent over the past five years, positioning it for a significant re-rating upon positive results should copper hold or shoot higher.

Iran's proxy Hamas initiated a war against Israel on October 7, 2023, unleashing region-wide violence. Until Iran's massive, coordinated drone and missile attacks on Israel on April 14, 2024, the Iran-backed Houthi attacks on Red Sea shipping had been the most urgent problem for the U.S. and its allies. Between mid-November 2023 and March 2024, the Houthis carried out more than 60 attacks on commercial shipping and warships -- most of which missed their target.REF Increasingly, however, Houthi attacks are becoming more successful.

On February19, U.S. Central Command confirmed that two Houthi anti-ship ballistic missiles struck and severely damaged a Belize-flagged, British-registered, and Lebanese managed vessel.REF The most recent seizure of Portuguese-flagged container ship MSC Aries on April 13 by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) near the Strait of Hormuz increased Iran's pressure on the United States and Israel by disrupting trade through the Strait of Hormuz.REF After several months of U.S. and British airstrikes, the Houthis have been unrelenting in their attacks, and with renewed concerns of a closure in the Strait of Hormuz, the costs to global trade are mounting.

Acting in concert with Iran's wider regional interests, the Houthis' ongoing provocations aim to disrupt international trade, threaten global supply chains, and worsen historically high global inflation -- economic pressures that will only drive up prices for everyday Americans. The Houthis hope that these economic pressures will incentivize America to cease support for Israel. Meanwhile, U.S. adversaries, notably China and Russia, are not subject to intentional Houthi attacks and may actually gain an advantage by their free passage through the Red Sea and Suez Canal.

This unfortunate situation was avoidable. Before this round of Middle East chaos, the Biden Administration had inherited a relatively stable region. By confronting the Iranian regime's hostile actions and embracing partners in concert with the historic Abraham Accords, the Trump Administration was able to chart a new peaceful path forward. However, a series of poor policy choices by the Biden Administration set in motion the chaos unfolding in the Middle East today. Failing to reverse this disastrous course risks U.S. interests, dangerously distracting the United States from a potential showdown with China in Asia.

With one-third of all container traffic flowing through it, the Red Sea is one of the most important arteries in the global shipping system.REF Another 12 percent of seaborne oil and 8 percent of liquified natural gas (LNG) transit the Suez Canal.REF The Red Sea is also a major Internet choke point, home to 16 undersea cables that connect Europe and Asia and also, in addition to being used to conduct financial transactions, enable governments to communicate securely across the region.REF In response to the Houthi attacks, many global shipping and energy companies such as Shell and British Petroleum suspended their Red Sea routes indefinitely and are now redirecting their ships around the Cape of Good Hope.REF This rerouting adds fuel costs and increases demand for additional tankers to sustain trade flows.REF If the impacts on shipping were also to include the Strait of Hormuz, the region's oil shipments, or 20 percent of global oil supplies, would be imperiled.REF

On December 18, 2023, the Secretary of Defense announced that the U.S., along with its allies, was establishing a joint maritime task force, Operation Prosperity Guardian, to defend against Houthi attacks. Although the operation supposedly brings together 20 countries, more than half of these countries have not acknowledged their participation. Long-standing allies like Spain and Italy have naval forces in the region but have not actively participated in the operation.REF So far, only the United States and the United Kingdom have carried out strikes to degrade the Houthis' military capacity to attack shipping in the Red Sea.REF

As Houthi attacks continue, it is clear that Operation Prosperity Guardian is failing to re-establish freedom of navigation and the safety of maritime traffic in the Red Sea.REF Worse, America's Middle East strategy and military posture in the region have proved to be demonstrably ineffective.

Only an unambiguous signal to Iran will prevent escalation toward a regional war. The U.S. must impose costs on the Houthis to end their assault on shipping. This means, among other things that need to be done, restoring and enforcing the Houthi Designation as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO). The U.S. must also degrade the capacity of Iran's paramilitary Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps to sow chaos throughout the region by disrupting the flow of Iranian weapons to Tehran's proxies. Finally, the U.S. needs to offer a more positive vision for the region by broadening and strengthening the Abraham Accords. Such actions will better ensure and sustain freedom of commerce and security against the worst proclivities of the mullahs in Tehran.

Sadly, however, there has been little indication that the Biden Administration will act accordingly. Failing to take decisive action will accelerate an already growing divide between the U.S. and key regional partners. In the absence of effective military responses, Iran and its regional proxies will continue to destabilize the Middle East, further drawing limited U.S. resources away from Washington's most pressing threat: China.

Threats to shipping in the Red Sea compound other maritime challenges. For months, shipping has been delayed through the Panama Canal. A drought has slowed the canal authority's ability to retain canal water depth.REF Added to the disruptions in the Red Sea, these pressures will accelerate ongoing efforts to harden and diversify U.S. production. Supply chain issues during COVID-19 forced some U.S. industry to onshore and near-source goods made overseas. Thankfully, the fact that U.S. markets are more reliant on trade across the Atlantic and Pacific reduces the impact of Houthi attacks in the Red Sea on U.S. markets.

There are, however, trickle-down effects from Houthi attacks in the Red Sea that drive up the costs for everyday Americans. Increased shipping costs may force wholesalers and retailers that import and export their goods to mark up their prices to maintain margins. Consumer goods, apparel, and chemical producers are particularly vulnerable sectors. It is expected that major retailers like Walmart, H&M, and Target, which rely heavily on the Suez Canal to transport goods from Asia, will be affected.REF As containers and goods adjust to increased shipping costs, that effect adds to inflationary pressures here at home. Americans might first see price increases across import-dependent sectors like electronics, clothing, and gasoline.

Europe is more directly affected by attacks in the Red Sea because many European countries rely on the Red Sea for 40 percent of their imports from and 10 percent of their exports to the Middle East and Asia.REF Delayed shipments increase prices -- both factors that worsen inflation and drive up interest rates.

Energy is another problem. Russia's war on Ukraine has increased Europe's dependence on Middle East energy that travels through the Red Sea, with further disruptions to either Brent crude or natural gas a major concern.REF If the current Middle East crisis is not resolved soon, prices for energy and goods in Europe could increase even further.

In Egypt, Red Sea disruptions have affected ""the daily influx of $25 [million] to $30 million...collected through fees from ships and additional services provided by the Suez Canal Authority.""REF This further stresses Egypt's troubled economy, already straining under a staggering 33.3 percent inflation rate as of March 2024 in addition to a weakening currency and historically elevated debt-to-GDP ratio of 88.97 percent.REF Lost revenue deepens Cairo's long-running currency shortage and puts pressure on President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi to make key structural reforms.REF In March, after its currency plummeted, Egypt announced three economic deals: an $8 billion dollar deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF); a $35 billion investment deal with the Emirati Sovereign Wealth Fund (ADQ); and an $8.06 billion aid deal with the European Union.REF These deals provide the necessary influx of cash to buy time for Cairo. Any instability in Egypt could further exacerbate Red Sea disruptions and make the movement of U.S. naval forces between the Indian Ocean and the Mediterranean through the Suez Canal more difficult.

China's economy -- as noted, already under strain -- will face added downward pressures if attacks in the Red Sea increase in lethality or frequency. Shipping has already come under attack in the Arabian Sea, and matters would be made significantly worse if such attacks were to expand into the Strait of Hormuz. These attacks increasingly pose a dilemma for China, which sources a significant share of its energy needs from the Arabian Gulf and sizeable trade with Europe. So far, however, China, like Russia, has benefited because it is not being targeted.

Maritime shipping accounts for 95 percent of China's exports, and the Red Sea is one of the principal trade arteries upon which it relies to ship its goods to Europe. The cost of shipping goods to Europe has more than doubled since December 2023. High shipping prices come at a time when China is trying to boost its exports to offset the effects of a real estate crisis on its economy.REF China imports approximately half of its crude oil from Iran (some of which is suspected of being transshipped via Malaysia) and Gulf States: Kuwait; the United Arab Emirates (UAE); Qatar; and Saudi Arabia.REF

So far, the Red Sea attacks have not seriously affected Chinese trade.REF If Beijing managed to convince the Houthis to stop attacks in the Red Sea, the result could be to justify China's naval buildup and global port investments across strategic trade routes. For now, the Chinese are benefitting by letting the situation play out because their ships are not targeted by the Houthis.REF This ""protection"" gives Beijing a shipping advantage over the United States and its European partners as its trade sails through uninhibited.

For Russia, threats to the energy trade could be a strategic challenge. Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Russian oil destined for Europe has been diverted to China and India, sometimes illicitly on so-called dark fleets of unregistered tankers. These oil shipments from Russia accounted for around 75 percent of southbound Suez Canal oil traffic in the first half of 2023.REF Like China's, Russian vessels are not being targeted by the Houthis. Russian oil tankers are therefore sailing through the Red Sea largely unmolested.REF

Despite the wider economic impact of Houthi attacks in the Red Sea, only the United Kingdom and the U.S. have conducted military operations against the Houthis. De-escalation efforts so far have failed, leaving the U.S. at risk not only of economic pressure, but also of another prolonged military confrontation in Middle East. Today's situation was avoidable and is the product of a series of bad policy choices by the current Administration.

Before the horrific October 7 Hamas attacks, the Middle East was not at the top of President Biden's action list. The Administration's October 2022 National Security Strategy (NSS), for example, references ""climate change"" twice as many times as it references ""Middle East.""REF A year later, in September 2023, Biden's National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan stated that the region was ""quieter today than it has been in two decades.""REF Weeks later, this statement would haunt the U.S. and Israel.

According to the NSS, decades of U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East allegedly advanced ""military-centric policies"" rooted in an ""unrealistic faith in force and regime change.""REF To ensure stability and prosperity, the Biden Administration proposed a new strategic framework focused on diplomatic de-escalation with Iran. This approach, if successful, ostensibly could enable the Administration to redirect resources currently concentrated in the Middle East to focus on China's threat to the Indo-Pacific.REF This was the logic behind the Administration's Iran-centered regional strategy with attempts to revive the 2015 Iran nuclear deal -- the deeply flawed Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) -- playing a pivotal role.

Given the dire state of the region today, it is clear the Biden Administration's Middle East strategy has failed. This failure is rooted in three key policy mistakes: the decision to appease Iran instead of confronting the regime, the decision to snub regional partners, and the decision to neglect the Abraham Accords.

In the Biden Administration's final year, the Middle East is on fire again. While Israel fights to defeat Hamas in Gaza, Iran and its proxies have stepped up their attacks against Israeli and U.S. forces across the region. In Iraq and Syria, Iranian proxies have attacked U.S. troops largely unopposed more than 168 times and with deadly consequences. On January 28, three U.S. servicemembers were killed and 34 were wounded in a drone attack by an Iranian-backed militia in Iraq.REF As the situation has worsened, Congress has approved aid to Israel and passed multiple bills sanctioning Iranian officials and Iran's energy sector.REF These congressional actions were taken after Iran significantly escalated tensions following a surgical Israeli strike on the Iranian embassy compound in Damascus on April 1 that killed senior IRGC leadership coordinating the attacks on Israel.

On April 14, Iran and its proxies in Yemen, Lebanon, Iraq, and Syria responded by launching more than 300 missiles and attack drones at Israel. All but five ballistic missiles were intercepted by Israeli air defense systems (Iron Dome and Arrow 3) and by U.S., British, French, and Jordanian aircraft.REF The attack was the first time the mullahs in Tehran had executed a direct attack on Israel from Iranian territory. Israel's limited strike in response reduced tensions between the two for now, but the situation could escalate at any moment.REF

Meanwhile, to the south, global trade remains held hostage by the Houthis -- one of several factions vying for power in war-torn Yemen.REF The Houthis are suspected of receiving assistance in their targeting of attacks by the persistent presence of the Iranian spy vessel Behshad, which has been in the Red Sea since 2021.REF The spy ship, however, is currently en route back to Iran, likely decreasing the Houthis' ability to target vessels accurately.

The Houthis their attacks in April, but have since resumed attacking ships.REF Because of these attacks, half of the global shipping fleet that regularly travels the Red Sea is rerouting around the Cape of Good Hope in Africa. This represents significant lost business for the Egyptian Suez Canal and is costing global shipping companies billions of dollars in additional fuel, delays, and insurance premiums.

Washington's actions have neither curtailed nor diminished the impact on the attacks in the Red Sea. Sadly, the Biden Administration refuses to take concrete, material steps to shift its failed policies, apparently preferring to leave the problem for a future President. A future Administration should therefore:

Make no mistake: The Middle East is aflame because of the Biden Administration's poor policy choices. The United States must be strategic in its approach to avoid falling into another Middle East conflict. The Houthi threat in the Red Sea is a symptom of a larger problem with Iran. To address this threat, the United States must embrace its Arab and Israeli partners to isolate Iran. Greater sanctions pressure and weapons interdiction are short-term solutions, but in the long term, America must work to strengthen the Abraham Accords in a way that creates more burden-sharing among Arab partners to address the Iranian threat so that the United States can focus on China.

The President should have embraced the Abraham Accords and sustained comprehensive pressure on Iran. Instead, the Administration redeployed deterrent military capabilities out of the Middle East, spurned key regional partners such as the UAE and Saudi Arabia, ignored attacks against U.S. troops in Syria and Iraq, eased sanctions, and released funds -- all to appease Iran. Its actions have effectively enabled our top regional adversary to finance and supply its proxies that are behind all of the chaos that we see today. Moreover, the massive April 14 missile and drone attack against Israel is a clear escalation by Iran and must not be viewed as in any way acceptable. To reverse course and ultimately to keep Iran in check, the Biden Administration must embrace its Israeli partner instead of appeasing its Iranian adversary.

Without U.S. leadership, the Middle East will look for alternative partners. China is already making commercial and strategic inroads in the region. The Middle East links Europe, Africa, and Asia and is home to key commercial, communication, and energy arteries that the Chinese Communist Party relies on to sustain its economy. Taking a step back from the Middle East will open the door for greater Chinese encroachment and further elbow the U.S. out at great security and economic risk to all Americans.",heritage.org,news,The Heritage Foundation,Brent Sadler,-0.403921568627451,452979511,1,https://www.heritage.org/themes/heritage/src/images/bell.png,eng-9550670

Field Marshall Helmut Von Moltke's dictum that ""No plan of operations extends with certainty beyond the first encounter with the enemy's main strength"", is among the most quoted remarks about the realities of war. As it is in the field of battle, so it is in the arena of politics! No plan survives the first contact with reality, which is the ""enemy"" in politics. Plans must be revised, redrawn, improvised, corrected, ascertained and even abandoned, when they come in contact with the objective conditions of life and circumstances in the field.

Plans drawn up in the political party rooms and offices, when brought in contact with the realities of societal chaos, group or personal interests, political and economic complexities and the general convolutions of public policy, might no longer look the same or even seem appropriate to the conditions confronting the leader at any given time or moment. Coming into office from the opposition with a mindset to undo what the predecessor government has done may seem logical, however, it may be perilous as well, when tested against the obligations that have been assumed in the name of the people and the country at large.

As such, when leaders make pronouncements, they must make allowance for ""unforeseen circumstances"" and room for adjustments should be made in case things turn out different from their earlier supposition. It is with these possibilities in mind that I write today about the challenges awaiting President Bassirou Diomaye Faye of Senegal, who was sworn into office on Wednesday, April 2, 2024. In his inauguration address, President Faye outlined his vision for his country in terms of what he could deliver while in office. His vision is clear, forthright and laudable. But the notion of ""Mission, Vision and Objectives"" are corporate fictions that are usually made up to provide a semblance of respectability to the outlooks of companies while in reality, they may not necessarily be what they stand for.

In government, caution is the best accompaniment of policies, which serves to restrain the policy-makers from being carried away by enthusiasm and a sense of ""mission"" that might end up in disappointment and apathy. Accordingly, in order to stay within the boundaries of objectivity and realism, a dose of caution, creative thinking and decisiveness is required when all the facts and factors are put into the scale of chance and weighed carefully in the estimation of the policy-makers.

President Bassirou Diomaye Faye has stated that he would review some major contracts that have been executed by the erstwhile government of his predecessor, President Macky Sall, especially in the oil, gas and minerals sectors. This is within his right as a president, but the implication is that the sacrosanct nature of contractual obligations will now be put into question in Senegal, while the appropriateness of decisions of an elected government acting in sovereign capacity in the name and the interest of the people may be subjected to second guessing.

Under these circumstances, any future government that comes into office may as well decide to revise any decisions or contracts that would be executed by President Faye, and invalidate them as a matter of ""policy"". The stability for which Senegal is renowned and the sense of certainty around which government activities are carried out, will now be put into question, and doubts about Senegal's commitment to meeting its obligations might become a new sentiment at home and abroad.

President Faye may seem eager to keep his campaign promises to renegotiate the terms of oil, gas and mineral contracts entered into with foreign companies in the country. However, for practical purposes and in line with observing legal niceties, it would be much better if he would defer to the advice of his government departments that were responsible for making the initial arrangements with these foreign operators. At the moment, the decision to review the contracts might affect some notable companies that have received concessions to explore and produce oil and gas as well as minerals like gold in Senegal.

Among these are the following: British Petroleum, BP, which operates the Greater Tortue Ahmeyin liquified natural gas, LNG, assets; Kosmo Energy of the USA which is responsible for developing the Yakaar-Teranga gas field together with BP; Woodside Energy of Australia that works the Sangomar oil and gas assets; Total of France that searches for oil and gas offshore in the Rufisque area; Oranto of Nigeria that is involved in exploration in the Cayer offshore area; Endeavour of Australia that is working the Sabodala-Massawa goldfields and others; Managem of Morocco that is also involved in the Boto Gold Project; as well as Dangote Cement of Nigeria that is producing about 1.5 million tons of the product per year in Senegal.

These and other projects involving foreign investors and their local partners no doubt contribute to the development of the Senegalese economy from any angle that they may be viewed. Regardless of this however, any measures that may be taken to ensure probity in reaching contractual agreements should be welcomed so long as they do not appear contradictory to the spirit of mutual understanding and benefits in the exploitation of the country's natural resources.

The political-economy of extracting natural resources in Africa or any other parts of the world is a complex issue that would require careful handling and appropriate recourse to existing best practices. As such, the Diomaye Faye government will be well advised to consult broadly before undertaking the intended review of contracts in the extractive sector. This is because of longterm impacts like legal actions against it for breaches of contracts and reneging on contractual obligations.

African governments do have recourse to sound and professional advice when negotiating contracts with multinational corporations in the field of extractive industries. Institutional leverage provided by groups like the African Development Bank, AfDB, and the UN Economic Commission for Africa, UN-ECA, for instance, could be taken advantage of, in order to arrive at better deals for the countries involved in such transactions with foreign corporations. The Norwegian Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, EITI, is also another facility that could be leveraged by African governments to ensure the soundness of contracts with foreign corporations and the observance of appropriate probity in the policies of concessions in exploitation of resources.

Where there are fears of malpractices or untoward behaviours, international anti-corruption agencies like GIABA which is located in Dakar, Senegal, and the UN Office on Drugs and Crime, UNODC, as well as national anti-corruption agencies and professional bodies, could be involved in the negotiation processes, to ensure probity and protect the integrity of the contracts. Also, reflecting the relevant provisions of the legally binding United Nations Convention Against Corruption (2003) in contracts could be another measure that may be adopted to prevent unwholesome practices creeping into the award of concessions in our countries.

The declared intention of carrying out an 'audit' of the contracts for extraction of natural resources in Senegal may seem timely, especially against the background of pervasive corruption in such situations in most of Africa. However, if such an exercise is done with a mind to embarrass an exiting government, then it would seem inappropriate by the standards of political judgement that does not distinguish between obligations and reciprocal trust in given commitments. Contractual obligations no matter how odious must be deemed sacrosanct until and unless they are proven detrimental in their substance and purpose to the commonwealth, or to one party to the deal in particular.

Where no such facts are established, it would be better to carry on with the projects while carefully determining the pace of their execution, with an intended purpose of reviewing the provisions of their terms and conditions at opportune moments. This may sound conservative and even reactionary to the radical mind, but it should be realised that between 1918 and 1922 or thereabouts, contracts that were entered into by the Tsarit government in Russia, including those to do with loans from the capitalist countries, were honoured by the Bolsheviks under Vladimir Ilyich Lenin. That was purposefully done for the sake of survival of the new regime and the possibilities of accessing much needed capital from the Western countries.

Likewise, for Senegal to retain its image as a favoured destination of investment in Africa, as well as live up to its name as a stable democracy in the continent, the policy of reviewing contractual obligations should be weighed carefully against the consequences that might imperil the larger economic interests of the country.

I would therefore urge President Faye to be seized more with finding ways to address the growing youth unemployment in his country and the protection of his key natural resource which is the fisheries industry, from the ravages of uncontrolled exploitation by foreign fishing fleets.

He should also immediately seek ways to diversify the economy of Senegal to create more opportunities for value addition especially in the agricultural sector, in order to generate more capital and employment. Stemming the migration of Senegalese making the perilous journey across the Atlantic to Europe, should also be an urgent task of the government, by which the lives of young Senegalese might be preserved, and their dignity and respect enhanced.",peoplesdailyng.com,news,Peoples Daily Newspaper,Peoples Daily,-0.1607843137254902,452937446,1,,

The services on the A689 were opened by the convenience store brand Penny on the Move on Wednesday, April 28.

The opening store follows the demolition and rebuilding of the previous Crosby Moor site by Penny on the Move in partnership with British Petroleum (BP).

The new store is not Penny on the Move's first service station in Cumbria, however, the new site includes amenities such as Food on the Move, Costa Express, a laundrette, Just Eat delivery service, and a full convenience store.

Penny on the Move have also partnered with Cumbrian butchers Cranstons at the new service station to stock cold food in its chillers and hot food at its food counter.

Following the opening, Penny on the Move's chief operating officer Vicky Hennessy discussed how the prime location of the site was a key factor leading to the creation of the new service station.

She said: ""We are really proud of this site. It is our latest design and I think it is a significant investment for us but it is also significant for that area as there is not a lot else in that area.

""The early indication and feedback from local people have been really positive on social media as well as on the site.

Many well-known blue-chip companies that were expected to knock the cover off the ball with their prints ended up striking out. In turn, this badly hurting their share prices in the process and drawing the ire of shareholders. The poor results come at a difficult time. The stock market is seeking direction and adjusting to the reality of higher for longer interest rates and the potential for zero rate cuts this year.

Management teams have put their best spin possible on their company's financial performance. They have sought to provide context for earnings and outlooks that disappointed. However, analysts and investors don't seem to be very tolerant right now. As is almost always the case, the immediate reaction to earnings prints has been extreme. In fact, many stocks fell 10% or more in a single day after a bad reading.

Energy giant British Petroleum (NYSE:BP) is down after reporting a 40% decline in its Q1 profit. BP showed a net profit of $2.7 billion, down from $3 billion in Q4 of 2023. That was below Wall Street estimates of $2.9 billion. The profit translated to earnings per share (EPS) of 97 cents, which missed expectations of $1.02. Revenue totaled $48.88 billion, which missed consensus forecasts of $56.87 billion.

The London-based company said the results were due entirely to lower oil and gas realizations that led to weak fuel margins. Despite the poor showing, BP executives said they remain on track to deliver $2 billion in cost savings by 2026. Also, the company announced a new stock buyback program of $3.5 billion for the year's first half. While the cost cuts and share repurchases are encouraging, investors seem to be having none of it. The BP stock went down 4% after the print. In the last 12 months, the share price is up 2%.

Walt Disney Co. (DIS)

In its worst showing in nearly a year, Walt Disney Co.'s (NYSE:DIS) stock fell 10% after reporting mixed financial results which showed weak forward guidance. The soft outlook overshadowed news that the Mouse House is nearly profitable on its streaming services, reversing years of losses. Disney reported EPS of $1.21 for what was its fiscal second quarter, ahead of expectations that called for $1.10. Revenue in the period amounted to $22.08 billion, which was slightly below the $22.11 billion estimated on Wall Street.

Yet, despite mixed results, Disney said that its operating income rose 17% as its Disney+ and Hulu streaming services turned a profit in the quarter for the first time. When combined with ESPN+, the streaming businesses lost $18 million. However, that was much better than a loss of $659 million posted a year ago. Disney+ subscribers grew by more than six million in the quarter to 117.6 million global customers. Also, the parks and experiences division saw revenue rise 7% to $5.96 billion.

While Disney projects all streaming services will reach profitability by the current fiscal year's, the company warned of more losses in its entertainment direct-to-consumer unit. And this certainly didn't impress analysts or investors.

Tyson Foods (TSN)

Biggest U.S. meat company Tyson Foods' (NYSE:TSN) stock is struggling after sales reported mixed financial results as it undertakes strict cost control measures. TSN reported EPS of 62 cents, which was well ahead of the 39 cents consensus expectation of analysts. Revenue in the company's fiscal Q2 came in at $13.07 billion, below the consensus estimate of $13.15 billion on Wall Street. The latest results come as Tyson Foods closes some of its chicken processing plants to reduce costs.

Further, Tyson has closed six chicken plants in four states since the start of 2023, laid off corporate employees and announced plans to close a pork plant. The moves come as the company tries to turn around its chicken unit after struggling with excess supply. Tyson is grappling with slowing demand from price-conscious consumers who have been cutting back on their meat purchases in recent months. With inflation proving sticky and interest rates expected to remain higher for longer, the consumer pullback is likely to continue.

TSN stock is today trading 26% lower than its price from five years ago.

Verizon (VZ)

Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) latest earnings print was a case of ""not as bad as feared."" Analysts were cheering news that the telecommunications firm only lost 68,000 monthly bill-paying wireless phone subscribers during Q1. In fact, that was less than the 100,000 the company was expected to lose in the quarter.

Although the subscriber losses have slowed from a peak of 127,000 wireless subscribers who ditched Verizon in Q1 of 2023, the reality is that the company continues to lose customers at a steady clip.

Another bad sign is that Verizon's free cash flow at the end of Q1 stood at $2.7 billion, well below the $3.6 billion analysts' forecast. The company plans to attract and retain customers through flexible plans and discounts on streaming bundles for services such as Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). But how far Verizon can get on discounted services remains to be seen. The strategy hasn't helped VZ stock, which is down 30% over the last five years.

Hershey (HSY)

Chocolate giant Hershey (NYSE:HSY) is by no means out of the woods. Cocoa prices, the active ingredient in chocolate, still trades above $8,000 per ton. While the price of cocoa has fallen from a record high above $10,000 per ton, it remains more expensive than most industrial and precious metals. Prices spiked because the cocoa harvest in Africa has been wiped out by severe weather and disease. Unfortunately, it shows no signs of easing anytime soon.

Hershey has managed to report better-than-expected financial results, despite the price of cocoa reaching all-time highs, by passing on the added cost to consumers. But how long will it be before cash-strapped consumers start buying fewer Kit Kat chocolate bars and Milk Duds candy? Hershey is already calling for flat earnings in 2024 and for sales to grow only about 2%. That tepid outlook could worsen in coming months if cocoa prices spike or the consumer rolls over. HSY stock has declined nearly 30% in the past 12 months.

United Airlines (UAL)

After clawing its way back after the Covid-19 pandemic, United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) swung to a financial loss in this year's first quarter as it struggles with order delays from troubled aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. (NYSE:BA). The carrier reported a Q1 loss per share of 15 cents. But that was actually better than a loss of 57 cents expected by Wall Street. Revenue in the quarter totaled $12.54 billion versus $12.45 billion that was the consensus forecast of analysts.

Management said that the quarterly earnings were negatively impacted by growth challenges caused by delayed aircraft deliveries from Boeing. The commercial aircraft manufacturer has been forced by regulators to slow its production of commercial aircraft after encountering several safety problems. United said that it now expects to receive 61 narrow-body planes from Boeing this year, down from an initial order of 101. United said it would have reported a Q1 profit of $200 million if not for the problems at Boeing.

Finally, UAL stock is trading 38% below where it was five years ago, before the pandemic.

Palantir Technologies (PLTR)

Also, Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) issued disappointing guidance, torpedoing its stock in the process. PLTR stock fell 15% after the data analytics company announced a weaker-than-expected outlook that left analysts wanting. Palantir reported EPS of 8 cents, matching Wall Street expectations. Revenue in Q1 amounted to $634 million versus estimates of $625 million. Sales were up 21% from a year earlier. Sadly, the guidance overwhelmed the results.

Also, management said that they expect current Q2 revenue of $649 million to $653 million versus $653 million that was the consensus expectation among analysts. For all of this year, Palantir anticipates revenue of $2.68 billion to $2.69 billion, weaker than consensus estimates of $2.71 billion. Management said they ran 660 ""boot camps"" with prospective customers during Q1. This strategy allowed consumers to get hands-on time with the company's data analytics technology. That seemed to mean little to investors who weren't in a forgiving mood after PLTR stock had risen 225% over the last 12 months.",investorplace.com,news,InvestorPlace,Joel Baglole,-0.06666666666666665,452889832,1,https://investorplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/blue-chip-tickers.jpg,eng-9547718

As a Dotdash fact checker since 2020, he has validated over 1,100 articles on a wide range of financial and investment topics.

A company can list its shares on more than one exchange, which is often referred to as a dual listing. A stock can trade on any exchange in which it is listed. However, companies must meet all of the exchange's listing requirements and pay for any associated fees in order to be listed.

Understanding Why Stocks Trade on Multiple Exchanges

Although companies can list their stocks on multiple exchanges, very few companies actually do it. Companies such as Charles Schwab (SCHW) and Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA -- formerly known as Walgreens -- previously experimented with being dual-listed on the NYSE and NASDAQ, but have since returned to being listed only on a single exchange.

Liquidity

One reason for listing on several exchanges is that it increases a stock's liquidity, which means that there are plenty of shares available for market demand. A dual listing allows investors to choose from several different markets in which to buy or sell shares of the company.

A stock's liquidity can be measured by the bid-ask spread, which is the amount by which the selling price, called the ask price, exceeds the buy price, called the bid price. The increased liquidity for stocks on multiple exchanges makes the stock's bid-ask spread decrease, making it easier for investors to buy and sell the security at any time.

Multinationals

Multinational corporations also tend to list on more than one exchange. These companies may list their shares on both their domestic exchange and the major ones in other countries. For example, the multinational corporation BP (BP) -- formerly British Petroleum -- trades on the London Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).

Listing on Exchanges Through Depositary Receipts

The popularity of depositary receipts has increased the number of companies trading on exchanges in different countries. A depositary receipt (DR) is a negotiable certificate that represents equity shares in a foreign company that's traded on an international stock exchange.

Depositary receipts are helpful to investors since they allow the purchase of equity shares of foreign companies without trading directly on a foreign market. In other words, companies can list their shares on their local exchange and also through a depository receipt in another market so that foreign investors have access. A depositary receipt can be issued on a foreign exchange by the bank holding the shares with or without the endorsement of the company being traded.

Investors in the U.S. can access foreign stocks through American depositary receipts (ADRs). An ADR is denominated in U.S. dollars whereby a U.S. financial institution overseas holds the shares. ADRs are a great way to buy shares in a foreign company while earning capital gains on the investment and dividend income -- or cash payments by companies to their shareholders.

Depositary receipts allow investors around the world to purchase and sell large international companies' stock. An example of a well-known company with a heavily traded depositary receipt trading on the NASDAQ is the Chinese technology giant, Baidu (BIDU).",investopedia.com,news,Investopedia,Brian Beers,0.05882352941176472,452885517,1,https://www.investopedia.com/thmb/oa8unLqU8HgHffMOENq2w08yaGQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/technology-gadget-chart-brand-design-screenshot-756288-pxhere.com-18a59ea5dac3414abc819ef2ac1bedfe.jpg,

Plans drawn up in the political party rooms and offices, when brought in contact with the realities of societal chaos, group or personal interests, political and economic complexities and the general convolutions of public policy, might no longer look the same or even seem appropriate to the conditions confronting the leader at any given time or moment. Coming into office from the opposition with a mindset to undo what the predecessor government has done may seem logical, however, it may be perilous as well, when tested against the obligations that have been assumed in the name of the people and the country at large.

As such, when leaders make pronouncements, they must make allowance for ""unforeseen circumstances"" and room for adjustments should be made in case things turn out different from their earlier supposition. It is with these possibilities in mind that I write today about the challenges awaiting President Bassirou Diomaye Faye of Senegal, who was sworn into office on Wednesday, April 2, 2024. In his inauguration address, President Faye outlined his vision for his country in terms of what he could deliver while in office. His vision is clear, forthright and laudable. But the notion of ""Mission, Vision and Objectives"" are corporate fictions that are usually made up to provide a semblance of respectability to the outlooks of companies while in reality, they may not necessarily be what they stand for.

In government, caution is the best accompaniment of policies, which serves to restrain the policy-makers from being carried away by enthusiasm and a sense of ""mission"" that might end up in disappointment and apathy. Accordingly, in order to stay within the boundaries of objectivity and realism, a dose of caution, creative thinking and decisiveness is required when all the facts and factors are put into the scale of chance and weighed carefully in the estimation of the policy-makers.

President Bassirou Diomaye Faye has stated that he would review some major contracts that have been executed by the erstwhile government of his predecessor, President Macky Sall, especially in the oil, gas and minerals sectors. This is within his right as a president, but the implication is that the sacrosanct nature of contractual obligations will now be put into question in Senegal, while the appropriateness of decisions of an elected government acting in sovereign capacity in the name and the interest of the people may be subjected to second guessing.

Under these circumstances, any future government that comes into office may as well decide to revise any decisions or contracts that would be executed by President Faye, and invalidate them as a matter of ""policy"". The stability for which Senegal is renowned and the sense of certainty around which government activities are carried out, will now be put into question, and doubts about Senegal's commitment to meeting its obligations might become a new sentiment at home and abroad.

President Faye may seem eager to keep his campaign promises to renegotiate the terms of oil, gas and mineral contracts entered into with foreign companies in the country. However, for practical purposes and in line with observing legal niceties, it would be much better if he would defer to the advice of his government departments that were responsible for making the initial arrangements with these foreign operators. At the moment, the decision to review the contracts might affect some notable companies that have received concessions to explore and produce oil and gas as well as minerals like gold in Senegal.

Among these are the following: British Petroleum, BP, which operates the Greater Tortue Ahmeyin liquified natural gas, LNG, assets; Kosmo Energy of the USA which is responsible for developing the Yakaar-Teranga gas field together with BP; Woodside Energy of Australia that works the Sangomar oil and gas assets; Total of France that searches for oil and gas offshore in the Rufisque area; Oranto of Nigeria that is involved in exploration in the Cayer offshore area; Endeavour of Australia that is working the Sabodala-Massawa goldfields and others; Managem of Morocco that is also involved in the Boto Gold Project; as well as Dangote Cement of Nigeria that is producing about 1.5 million tons of the product per year in Senegal.

These and other projects involving foreign investors and their local partners no doubt contribute to the development of the Senegalese economy from any angle that they may be viewed. Regardless of this however, any measures that may be taken to ensure probity in reaching contractual agreements should be welcomed so long as they do not appear contradictory to the spirit of mutual understanding and benefits in the exploitation of the country's natural resources.

The political-economy of extracting natural resources in Africa or any other parts of the world is a complex issue that would require careful handling and appropriate recourse to existing best practices. As such, the Diomaye Faye government will be well advised to consult broadly before undertaking the intended review of contracts in the extractive sector. This is because of longterm impacts like legal actions against it for breaches of contracts and reneging on contractual obligations.

African governments do have recourse to sound and professional advice when negotiating contracts with multinational corporations in the field of extractive industries. Institutional leverage provided by groups like the African Development Bank, AfDB, and the UN Economic Commission for Africa, UN-ECA, for instance, could be taken advantage of, in order to arrive at better deals for the countries involved in such transactions with foreign corporations. The Norwegian Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, EITI, is also another facility that could be leveraged by African governments to ensure the soundness of contracts with foreign corporations and the observance of appropriate probity in the policies of concessions in exploitation of resources.

Where there are fears of malpractices or untoward behaviours, international anti-corruption agencies like GIABA which is located in Dakar, Senegal, and the UN Office on Drugs and Crime, UNODC, as well as national anti-corruption agencies and professional bodies, could be involved in the negotiation processes, to ensure probity and protect the integrity of the contracts. Also, reflecting the relevant provisions of the legally binding United Nations Convention Against Corruption (2003) in contracts could be another measure that may be adopted to prevent unwholesome practices creeping into the award of concessions in our countries.

The declared intention of carrying out an 'audit' of the contracts for extraction of natural resources in Senegal may seem timely, especially against the background of pervasive corruption in such situations in most of Africa. However, if such an exercise is done with a mind to embarrass an exiting government, then it would seem inappropriate by the standards of political judgement that does not distinguish between obligations and reciprocal trust in given commitments. Contractual obligations no matter how odious must be deemed sacrosanct until and unless they are proven detrimental in their substance and purpose to the commonwealth, or to one party to the deal in particular.

Where no such facts are established, it would be better to carry on with the projects while carefully determining the pace of their execution, with an intended purpose of reviewing the provisions of their terms and conditions at opportune moments. This may sound conservative and even reactionary to the radical mind, but it should be realised that between 1918 and 1922 or thereabouts, contracts that were entered into by the Tsarit government in Russia, including those to do with loans from the capitalist countries, were honoured by the Bolsheviks under Vladimir Ilyich Lenin. That was purposefully done for the sake of survival of the new regime and the possibilities of accessing much needed capital from the Western countries.

Likewise, for Senegal to retain its image as a favoured destination of investment in Africa, as well as live up to its name as a stable democracy in the continent, the policy of reviewing contractual obligations should be weighed carefully against the consequences that might imperil the larger economic interests of the country.

I would therefore urge President Faye to be seized more with finding ways to address the growing youth unemployment in his country and the protection of his key natural resource which is the fisheries industry, from the ravages of uncontrolled exploitation by foreign fishing fleets.

He should also immediately seek ways to diversify the economy of Senegal to create more opportunities for value addition especially in the agricultural sector, in order to generate more capital and employment. Stemming the migration of Senegalese making the perilous journey across the Atlantic to Europe, should also be an urgent task of the government, by which the lives of young Senegalese might be preserved, and their dignity and respect enhanced.",opinionnigeria.com,news,Opinion Nigeria,Opinion Nigeria,0.03529411764705892,452856886,1,https://www.opinionnigeria.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Senegal-President-elect-Bassirou-Diomaye-Faye.webp,

This field was discovered in 1999 by the Shah Deniz consortium during exploration drilling in the Caspian Sea. The consortium comprises several international oil and gas companies, with bp being the operator.

The development of the Shah Deniz field has been conducted in multiple phases to maximize its production capacity and economic viability. The initial phase, known as Shah Deniz Phase 1, involved the development of production infrastructure and facilities to produce and export natural gas to regional and international markets. Subsequent phases, including Shah Deniz Phase 2 and potential future expansions, aim at further increasing production capacity and exploring additional reserves within the field.

Shah Deniz field represents a significant strategic asset for Azerbaijan and its partners, contributing to the country's energy sector development, economic growth, and regional cooperation in the Caspian region and beyond.

The State Oil Fund of the Republic of Azerbaijan (SOFAZ) earned $202.715 million from the Shah Deniz (gas and condensate) field from the beginning of the current year until May 1.

Revenues from the Shah Deniz field have experienced a drastic decline, plummeting by 4.6 times compared to the corresponding period last year.

Notably, revenues from condensate sales on the Shah Deniz field have seen a staggering 3.2 times decrease during this period, amounting to $60.784 million.

This downturn in revenues underscores the challenges facing the energy sector, necessitating a closer examination of market conditions and potential strategies for recovery.

The 4.6-fold decrease in revenues from the Shah Deniz field compared to the corresponding period of last year can be attributed to several factors:

Market Conditions: Fluctuations in global gas and condensate prices can significantly impact revenues from the Shah Deniz field. If prices have declined sharply compared to the previous year, it would directly affect the revenue generated, leading to a drastic decrease.

Production Levels: Reduced production levels from the Shah Deniz field could also contribute to the decline in revenues. Factors such as maintenance shutdowns, technical issues, or natural decline in reservoir productivity can lead to lower production volumes and consequently lower revenues.

Contractual Agreements: Changes in contractual agreements, including pricing structures or sales volumes, could influence revenue outcomes. If the terms of the agreements have become less favorable, it could result in decreased revenues even if production levels remain constant.

Market Demand: Changes in market demand for gas and condensate products can impact revenues. If demand decreased compared to the previous year due to factors such as economic downturns or shifts in energy consumption patterns, it would lead to lower sales volumes and revenues.

The decrease is also related to another field, ACG.

The ""Azeri-Chirag-Gunashli"" (ACG) oil field block is one of the largest and most significant oil-producing assets in Azerbaijan and the wider Caspian Sea region.

The ACG field is located in the Azerbaijani sector of the Caspian Sea. It encompasses several individual oil fields, including the Azeri, Chirag, and Gunashli fields, which are operated collectively under the ACG project.

The ACG project is operated by bp (British Petroleum) in collaboration with other international oil companies and Azerbaijan's state-owned oil company, SOCAR (State Oil Company of Azerbaijan Republic). The current shareholders in the ACG project and their respective stakes are as follows:

BP-30.37%, SOCAR-25%, MOL Group-9.57%, INPEX-9.31%, Equinor- 7.27%, ExxonMobil, 6.79%, TPAO (Turkish Petroleum Corporation)- 5.73%, ITOCHU-3.65%, ONGC Videsh Limited (OVL)-2.31%.

The Azeri-Chirag-Gunashli (ACG) oil field block represents a cornerstone of Azerbaijan's oil industry and a key driver of its economy, playing a crucial role in the country's energy security and prosperity.

In January-April of this year, the State Oil Fund of Azerbaijan (SOFAZ) reported an income of 1 billion 798.6 million US dollars from the ""Azeri-Chirag-Gunashli"" (ACG) oil field block located in the Azerbaijani sector of the Caspian Sea.

It is noted that this figure is 669.4 million US dollars, or 27.1% less than the revenue recorded in the same period of 2023.

It is worth noting that in January-April 2023, SOFAZ received an income of 2 billion 468 million US dollars from ACG.

Regarding the 27.1 percent decrease in revenues of the State Oil Fund of Azerbaijan (SOFAZ) for the ""Azeri-Chirag-Gunashli"" (ACG) field block during the four months of the current year compared to the same period last year:

Production Volume: One possible reason for the decrease in revenues from the ACG field block is a decline in production volume. If production levels have decreased due to factors such as reservoir depletion or operational issues, it would directly impact the revenue generated from oil sales.

Oil Prices: Fluctuations in global oil prices can significantly influence revenues from oil-producing assets like the ACG field block. If oil prices have decreased compared to the previous year, it would lead to lower revenues even if production levels remain constant.

Contractual Changes: Changes in contractual agreements, such as adjustments to revenue-sharing arrangements or taxation policies, could affect the revenue outcomes for the ACG field block. If the terms of the agreements have become less favorable, it could result in decreased revenues for SOFAZ.

Operational Costs: Increased operational costs associated with oil extraction and transportation could also contribute to the decline in revenues. If expenses have risen significantly compared to the previous year, it would impact the net revenue generated from oil sales.

Overall, a combination of factors including market conditions, production levels, contractual agreements, and operational costs likely contributed to the decrease in revenues from both the Shah Deniz and ACG field blocks.",today.az,news,Today.Az,,0.2705882352941176,452854330,1,http://www.today.az/pictures/pic248084.jpg,

Field Marshall Helmut Von Moltke's dictum that ""No plan of operations extends with certainty beyond the first encounter with the enemy's main strength"", is among the most quoted remarks about the realities of war. As it is in the field of battle, so it is in the arena of politics! No plan survives the first contact with reality, which is the ""enemy"" in politics.
