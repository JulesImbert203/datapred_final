When asked about Starmer's backtracking in Glasgow on Friday, Swinney said he did not want to be part of a Labour plan he felt would spark job losses in the oil and gas sector.

The First Minister said: ""Having listened to what's been said this morning, I don't have certainty over what this proposal [GB Energy] involves.

""Keir Starmer said on the radio it wasn't actually going to be an energy company but it's going to be an investment vehicle. Well, we have lots of them already.

""In my first week as First Minister we delivered investments in renewable energy in Scotland.

""So I'm all for energy investment but I do put out a cautionary word that a lot of what I hear of Labour's energy plans will result in a significant loss of employment in the north east of Scotland in the oil and gas sector and I don't want to be part of that.""

Last June, Starmer (above) delivered a speech in Edinburgh in which he hailed plans for ""a new home-grown energy company"".

He compared Labour's proposed GB Energy company with Denmark's Ørsted and Vattenfall in Sweden, both of which produce and sell energy.

The SNP said the interview Starmer gave on BBC's Good Morning Scotland showed him up as ""utterly clueless"" about Scotland's energy sector.

Starmer - who was campaigning in Greenock on Friday morning with Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar - said he expected GB Energy to be profitable and that it would create jobs.

He also insisted oil and gas would ""be part of the mix for decades to come"" and that would not be ""turning off of the pipes"".

When asked whether he was reassured by Starmer's pledge GB Energy would ""turn the page"" on the cost of living crisis, Swinney added: ""I'm all for making progress on energy security and when I set out those statistics on the fact we've gone from essentially generating 20 per cent of our net electricity consumption from renewables to the equivalent of 113% over the course of the years in which the SNP has been in office, I think that's a pretty formidable contribution to energy security.

""Of course, Scotland's contribution to renewable energy is not over yet. We've got enormous potential, that's why big investments have happened in the north of Scotland in offshore renewables and a variety of other technologies.""

The move enables the offshore wind research lease, located about 28 nautical miles off Maine, to advance. Maine has 30 calendar days to accept, reject or request modifications to the lease.

""Floating wind technology can make offshore wind a reality in the Gulf of Maine,"" said BOEM Director Elizabeth Klein. ""BOEM will continue to work in partnership with the state of Maine as we move forward to facilitate the responsible development of offshore wind in this region, as well as the deployment of floating offshore wind technology nationwide.""

The state requested the research lease in October 2021 to study floating offshore wind energy technology and its deployment. If developed, the site would include up to 12 floating offshore wind turbines capable of generating up to 144 megawatts (MW) of renewable energy, according to BOEM.

The U.S. aims to have 30 gigawatts (GW) of offshore wind capacity by 2030 and 15 GW of floating wind capacity by 2035.

Waga Energy and Engie signed a biomethane purchase agreement (BPA) for renewable natural gas produced at the Veolia site in Claye-Souilly near Paris, Waga said on May 29.

The 13-year contract, which is the longest BPA signed to date in France, values the biomethane at a higher price than the subsidized tariff, Waga said in a news release. ""This enables Waga Energy to secure financing for the production unit through a long-term credit facility with the banks CIC and Arkéa Banque Entreprises et Institutionnels,"" the company said.

The contract took effect May 1.

Up to 120 gigawatt hours (GWh) of RNG, equivalent to the consumption of 20,000 households, is produced annually at the Veolia site, according to Waga.

""Veolia is a key player in the production of bioenergy, already producing 1.6 terawatt-hour of biogas from waste anaerobic digestion in France alone,"" Veolia CEO Estelle Brachlianoff said. ""Through this partnership with Waga Energy and Engie, we are contributing to the development of a genuine green gas production industry at the European level, essential for the ecological transformation.""

Energy storage provider Torus will provide 26 megawatt hours (MWh) of energy storage capacity across a portion of real estate developer Gardner Group's portfolio, equivalent to powering nearly 1,000 homes for a full day.

Under a landmark deal, Torus will install its Torus Station energy storage and management system at Gardner's multiple properties, the company announced May 29.

The Torus Stations will integrate ""advanced"" battery and flywheel energy storage systems with Torus' software platform.

Torus said the integration enables energy management and demand response capabilities and connects renewable energy sources and electric vehicle charging infrastructure.

The systems will be manufactured at Torus' South Salt Lake City, Utah, facility and are expected to begin installation in fourth-quarter 2024 with completion by first-quarter 2026.

""Partnering with Torus allows us to optimize our energy management, reduce our carbon footprint and provide enhanced value to our tenants,"" said Christian Gardner, CEO of Gardner Group. ""We look forward to the positive impact this project will have on our properties and the broader community.""

Verbund, an Austria-based electricity company, partnered with TotalEnergies and EREN Groupe joint venture company TE H2 to study implementation of a green hydrogen project in Tunisia.

Called H2 Notos, hydrogen would be produced with electrolyzers powered by onshore wind and solar energy with desalinated sea water, TotalEnergies said May 28. Ambitions are to initially produce 200,000 tons of green hydrogen per year, potentially scaling up to 1 million tons per year.

""H2 Notos has the potential to become a significant supplier of green hydrogen for Europe while fostering significant jobs creation in Tunisia,"" said TE H2 CEO David Corchia. ""We are entering into a phase of greenfield development and major technical work to assess the feasibility of the project and we will need to further deepen the highly constructive and fruitful collaboration we have enjoyed with the national and local authorities through H2 Notos.""

The hydrogen will access the European market via the SoutH2 Corridor hydrogen pipeline, which is expected to be commissioned around 2030. The pipeline connects North Africa to Italy, Austria and Germany.

Verbund will coordinate the transport of hydrogen toward Central Europe, according to the release, while TE H2 and Verbund will jointly develop, finance, construct and operate the project, according to the release.

Italy, Germany and Austria have signed an agreement to cooperate on the development of a network to transport hydrogen from the southern Mediterranean to northern Europe, the energy ministries of the three countries said on May 30.

The official announcement marks a concrete step in the European Union's strategy to secure renewable hydrogen supplies by 2030 to help decarbonize its most polluting industries.

""The Southern Hydrogen Corridor will provide renewable hydrogen imports from North Africa via southern Italy and further connect to the major hydrogen demand hubs in Italy, Austria and Germany,"" the German ministry said in a statement.

The link dubbed SoutH2, which last year won priority status from the European Commission, is considered important to develop a European market for renewable fuel.

A group of companies, including Italian gas grid operator Snam, have teamed up to build the SoutH2 pipeline by the beginning of the next decade, with a financial commitment of more than 4 billion euros ($4.3 billion).

EDP Renewables North America has completed its 175-MW Crooked Lake Solar Park in Arkansas, the company said May 29.

Located near Blytheville in Mississippi County, the solar park is expected to generate enough electricity to power the equivalent of about 30,000 Arkansas homes annually. The solar park is the latest utility-scale addition for EDPR, which now has facilities in 19 U.S. states.

""We're proud to continue our expansion in the South with a focus on serving the clean energy needs of Arkansas,"" stated EDP Renewables North America CEO Sandhya Ganapathy. ""By providing sustainable energy to Mississippi County and the surrounding area, we are generating economic growth and grid stability for generations to come in the region.""

The solar park, located on an approximately 1,800-acre site, utilizes single-axis tracking photovoltaic panels.

Florida-based Apricus Generation has acquired a controlling interest in Nexus Renewables, a solar and energy storage developer, according to a May 29 news release.

Nexus, which has a pipeline of about 500 MW of solar and energy storage projects in North America, is the first strategic acquisition of Apricus. The holding company launched earlier this year.

""As with many independent developers, Nexus has more project opportunities than access to capital,"" said Gautam Chandra, executive chairman and co-founder of Apricus Generation. ""By joining Apricus, they now have access to capital and expertise that will allow them to execute on their pipeline.""

New Jersey officials said the state will receive $125 million from a legal settlement with Denmark's Ørsted over the company's cancellation last year of two offshore wind farm projects.

The New Jersey Board of Public Utilities said in a statement that the funds will be used for investments in wind component manufacturing facilities and wind farms.

The settlement comes nearly seven months after Ørsted said it would stop developing the Ocean Wind 1 and 2 projects off the coast of New Jersey as it struggled with soaring costs and supply chain delays.

The cancellations triggered an angry response from New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy, who is banking on offshore wind to help achieve the state's climate change goals.

His administration said it would speed up the state's plans to procure additional offshore wind capacity by soliciting bids for new projects in the second quarter of 2025, more than a year ahead of schedule.

The utility regulator also said it would pause an offshore wind transmission planning effort with the regional power grid operator, PJM Interconnection, while it considers the impact of a new rule from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that reforms how large power lines are approved and paid for.",hartenergy.com,news,Hart Energy,,0.2549019607843137,454876280,4,https://www.hartenergy.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_650x650/public/image/2024/05/et-roundup_0.jpg?itok=wJmtyrgu,

However, there is a problem when it comes to methanol. Today, 99% of methanol production is based on coal and natural gas, and that's as far from green as it gets. DTU has contributed to developing a new method for producing biogas-based methanol.

""When methanol is produced from biogas, methanol is green because it comes from a renewable source. Biogas is a product of degraded waste from households, agriculture, and production,"" explains Associate Professor Philip Fosbøl, DTU Chemical Engineering, one of the researchers behind the project.

In the autumn of 2022, the technology was installed in a 40-foot container at Lemvig Biogas, and a year later the plant produced the first liters of methanol.

Traditionally, green methanol is produced from CO by adding hydrogen. The hydrogen is obtained through a process called electrolysis, where water molecules are split into hydrogen and oxygen. But electrolysis requires a large energy supply in the form of electricity, and although electricity prices have fallen, it is still so expensive that this form of methanol production cannot compete with methanol produced from fossil sources. DTU's new method does not require the addition of hydrogen to form methanol.

""We take biogas and turn it into synthesis gas, and then we take the synthesis gas and turn it into methanol. And we have a plant that can recycle and use CO together with hydrogen and produce even more methanol,"" says Fosbøl.

Biogas typically consists of two-thirds methane and one-third CO. Synthesis gas consists of carbon monoxide and hydrogen. To get from biogas to synthesis gas, a catalyst is required to make the process happen, and usually problems arise with deposition of coal on the catalyst. But using a new and innovative catalyst, DTU researchers eliminate this problem.

Since hydrogen is produced by the formation of synthesis gas, there is no need to add hydrogen to produce methanol. However, since biogas contains one-third CO, you need to recirculate CO together with hydrogen from the synthesis gas in order to also convert CO into methanol. This process is brand-new and patented, and is one of the secrets of great efficiency. The finished product consists of 95% pure methanol, and 99.9% can be achieved if additional hydrogen from another source is added. Overall, the method has been a breakthrough for green methanol production.

""I do believe we're the first ever to demonstrate that you can produce methanol from biogas,"" says Fosbøl.

The large biogas plants have generally focused on producing biomethane for the gas grid. The technology DTU researchers are working on here is also intended for small biogas plants that cannot send their biomethane into the gas grid. Instead, they are forced to burn the biogas for heat or electricity production.

There are also biogas plants that are located at too great a distance from hydrogen producers, and therefore do not have the opportunity to convert CO into biogas via hydrogen input. There are many such plants not only in Denmark, but also in Germany, where there are about 10,000 of these smaller biogas plants, and here the new technology can be extremely attractive, says Fosbøl. For the DTU researcher and his colleagues, it has been crucial to create a methanol plant that was flexible, because future needs can change quickly.

""Our plant is designed to operate in a future where you adapt to changing needs. We can operate with different feed gases and switch very quickly,"" he says.

This means you can occasionally utilize the entire biogas, so both methane and CO are converted to methanol. Sometimes you can only produce methanol from methane, and other times you can choose to make methanol only from CO, while the methane is utilized for gas production. This makes it incredibly flexible, explains Fosbøl.

If biogas cannot be disposed of for the gas grid, there will also be a need for storage. And converting the biogas into liquid in the form of methanol is an obvious solution, as it occupies a much smaller volume, and then the biogas plants themselves can store the fuel over a longer period of time.

Methanol produced from biogas is much cheaper than traditional e-methanol produced from CO and hydrogen. But it is still more expensive than methanol produced from coal and natural gas. One solution that Fosbøl envisions is to tax black methanol for a period of time, making it more expensive than green methanol. In this way, green methanol can become profitable to produce, and as production methods are developed, green methanol will become competitive on normal market terms.

The methanol plant that is now up and running is a demonstration plant. This means that it is no longer just on a laboratory scale, but has ""moved into reality,"" as the DTU associate professor phrases it. It can produce 400 liters of methanol daily if it runs 24/7, but the daily production has been less than 100 liters because production has only run during the daytime.

""The big breakthrough is that we've been able to do this without any breakdowns,"" states Philip Fosbøl, who explains that the longest continuous production period has been 72 hours. The next milestone will be production for 500 hours straight.

The plant at Lemvig Biogas can convert 10 m biogas per hour. The next step will be upscaling to 200 m per hour, equivalent to a full-scale commercial facility. But this requires large-scale support.

""The research project we have carried out has a budget of just under DKK 20 million, but the next scale-up can easily cost in the region of DKK 100 million, so it's obviously something that requires public support,"" says Fosbøl.

The project has so far been supported by the Danish Energy Agency's Energy Technology Development and Demonstration Programme (EUDP), which has included three partners in addition to DTU. Pentair Union has headed the construction of the processing plant, while the demonstration plant was built by Elplatek. Lemvig Biogas has supplied biogas to the demonstration plant.

When DTU's technology is fully developed, it will be able to produce up to 60,000 tons of methanol from a typical large Danish biogas producer. With an annual requirement of 750,000 tons of methanol for Maersk's future fleet of 25 methanol-powered container ships, it will require a large number of biogas plants just to cover this need.",techxplore.com,news,Tech Xplore,,-0.04313725490196074,454874329,7,https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/green-methanol-on-the.jpg,eng-9619007

At the turn of the year, Denmark reached 200,000 registered electric cars, and last year electric cars accounted for 36% of all newly registered cars. However, the figure is quite different for electric trucks.

Electric trucks only make up about 1% of the total truck fleet in Denmark. However, according to new calculations, this figure will soon change significantly. In fact, calculations predict that the transition from fossil fuel trucks to electric trucks will overtake the transition for passenger cars in Denmark.

""In all the scenarios we have calculated, it appears that the transition from diesel to electric trucks will overtake the transition from fossil fuel cars to electric cars. We have tested different scenarios, and they all indicate that the percentage of trucks running on electricity will be much higher than that for passenger cars within the next 10 years,"" says Jeppe Rich, Professor at DTU Management, who together with Assistant Professor Ahmed Karam have made the calculations.

If you look at the climate figures, the transition will be significant. On EU roads, heavy vehicles weighing more than 12 metric tons account for more than 25% of greenhouse gas emissions. This is why the European Commission has introduced stricter CO emission standards for heavy-duty vehicles, aiming for a reduction of 45% by 2030 and 90% by 2040, compared to 2019 levels.

It is precisely the heavy vehicles on which DTU Management's calculations are based. More specifically, semi-trailer trucks -- trucks weighing more than 12 metric tons with one trailer attached -- that transport goods within Denmark. Semi-trailer trucks make up about 33% of trucks in Denmark, but account for about 67% of the kilometers driven.

""Specifically, we have looked at a line haul network, where trucks transport goods from one warehouse to another before smaller vehicles pick up the goods and bring them to the cities. These are the trucks that the calculations predict will all run on electricity by 2035,"" says Jeppe Rich

Among other organizations, the Green Transition Denmark (Rådet for Grøn Omstilling) also predicts a major transition, and estimates that about half of the trucks in Denmark will run on electricity in 2035, while the Danish Energy Agency only expects that about a fifth of the trucks will run on electricity by then.

The calculations are based on multiple factors that can influence the speed of the transition.

One of the political aspects that could have an impact is the new road charges and tolls that will enter into force in 2025. Trucks weighing more than 12 metric tons will from 2025 have to pay tolls according to their mileage in Denmark. The toll will be differentiated according to the trucks' CO emissions, which means that green trucks will have to pay the least.

""The speed of the transition depends, among other things, on whether there will be enough fast chargers and better batteries, truck prices, and the political aspects in the form of charges. If we imagine that the development goes as planned with the upcoming taxes and fast chargers, we believe that a full transition to electric is possible within the next ten years. However, this will require investment in the industry,"" says Ahmed Karam.

In addition to the savings by going green on the roads, new charging parks will also motivate the industry to run on electricity. In Denmark, almost DKK 700 million is being invested in a roll-out plan, which includes the establishment of 25 charging parks with 175 fast-charging stations. According to the plan, the first five charging parks will open in 2025, while the remaining 20 will be established continuously until 2030.

Despite the many incentives for the transition, it first and foremost requires that companies themselves prioritize electric trucks over the fossil ones.

""We have had conversations with several stakeholders in the industry who confirm that the development trends towards electric trucks. But we have also talked to others who are more conservative and just need to see if the new trucks will be able to work in practice. What is certain, however, is that they feel pressure from their business partners who want CO-free shipping. So, of course, it's a question of price and competitiveness. Looking at the numbers, it appears that truck battery prices will fall, which will make the trucks more financially attractive,"" says Jeppe Rich.

Elsewhere at DTU, other solutions are being developed to organize electricity production, so it can meet the increasing charging needs. This is done through the EU innovation project Begonia, which together with companies in the industry is looking at new solutions.

""The companies running large parcel centers state that the smaller trucks transporting the goods the final kilometers in the cities will be the first to transition to electricity. I'm not so sure that things will be as rapid for large trucks, where I sense a certain skepticism from hauliers. But as batteries improve, the large trucks will also run on electricity at some point,"" says Henrik Madsen, Professor at DTU Compute, who is working on the Begonia project.",techxplore.com,news,Tech Xplore,,0.1137254901960785,454873656,46,https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2021/electric-truck.jpg,

Tashkent, Uzbekistan (UzDaily.com) -- Trips of the President of Uzbekistan Shavkat Mirziyoyev to the regions are traditionally accompanied by the launch of major projects. Thus, today the construction of large energy and transport complexes has begun in Bukhara region.

Over the past five years, the volume of the processing industry in our country has increased 1.4 times, and last year alone it amounted to 553 trillion soums. In Bukhara, this figure increased 1.6 times and reached 30 trillion soums.

In the region, work is underway on 41 projects worth US$7 billion in foreign investment and 39 projects through local investment for the same amount.

It is planned to build three more large facilities - a gas chemical complex, a solar power plant and an international airport in Bukhara.

At the start of work ceremony, President Shavkat Mirziyoyev emphasized the importance of these projects.

The gas chemical complex, which will be built in the Karakul free economic zone, will be the first plant in our country operating using the methanol to olefins (MTO) technology.

The project will attract about US$5 billion in investments and advanced technologies from the USA, Germany, Denmark, Austria, Italy and China. The complex will process 1.3 billion cubic meters of natural gas and 430 thousand tons of naphtha per year with the production of 1.1 million tons of polymer products in demand both on the domestic and global markets. According to calculations, the added value of these products will exceed the cost of gas by five times.

The new plant will employ 2 thousand people. In addition, it will give impetus to the creation of dozens of enterprises in the construction, textile, leather and footwear, automotive, electrical and other related industries, and will lead to the creation of another 4 thousand jobs.

The launch of these projects will turn Bukhara into a ""driver"" not only of tourism, but also of industry.

Steady economic growth increases demand for electricity by an average of 6 percent per year. Therefore, new generating capacities are being created in the regions.

In recent years, 10 solar and wind power plants with a capacity of 2 gigawatts have come online with US$2 billion in foreign investment. Currently, 32 green generation facilities with a total capacity of 18.3 gigawatts worth US$19 billion are being built together with foreign partners.

The first 2.6 gigawatts of 14 solar and wind farms will come online this year. As a result, the share of renewable energy in the total electricity production in our country will increase from 9 to 15 percent. In general, by 2030 this figure is planned to increase to 40 percent.

In this, of course, sunny Bukhara occupies a special place. Currently, 9 large projects with a capacity of 4 gigawatts worth about US$4.5 billion in foreign investment are being implemented in the region.

Now they will be added to a solar power plant with a capacity of 250 megawatts, which will be built by the Masdar company from the United Arab Emirates. 648 hectares of land have been allocated for this project in the Alat region. The station is planned to be connected to the unified energy grid in December 2025.

In addition, renewable energy complexes are being built in the Bukhara region by ACWA Power from Saudi Arabia and Gezhouba from China. By 2030, the region's capacity will increase 9 times - up to 12.5 billion kilowatt-hours of green energy per year.

Another project that has started is a new international airport.

Thanks to the openness policy of our state, ties with the world are strengthening. Uzbekistan has introduced a visa-free regime for citizens of more than 90 countries.

As a result, the flow of foreign visitors has increased. Over the past 2 years, the share of tourism in exports of services has reached 40 percent. 283 hotels, 486 hostels, 1.2 thousand family guest houses were built. Tourist flow increased by 35 percent.

Thus, in 2023, about 1.4 million foreign tourists came to Bukhara.

Such factors require an increase in the number of flights at the region's international airport. Therefore, on the terms of a private partnership, it is planned to build a new international airport in the Bukhara region.

This US$226 million project will create airport infrastructure that meets international standards. Conditions are provided to serve 1.2 thousand passengers per hour. By improving the quality of service for passengers and aircraft, new international airlines will be attracted.

President Shavkat Mirziyoyev launched the construction of these complexes by pressing a symbolic button.

But the country is under mounting pressure both at home and abroad to do so. This is reflected in the gradual change in tone and tune of politicians. For example, during the World Economic Forum (WEF) in January, Swiss Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis declared that frozen Russian assets ""could possibly be used to rebuild Ukraine."" He did include an important caveat by noting this would require a legal basis and international cooperation.

Vague as that statement was, it was enough to trigger jitters in the Swiss financial center. Just six months earlier, the same Cassis, who represents the centre-right Radical Liberal Party in the Federal Council, had vehemently warned against expropriation. It would be a ""dangerous precedent,"" he said during the Ukraine Recovery Conference in the Swiss town of Lugano.

That shift in rhetoric makes two things clear. First, Switzerland will not lead the way. That's not particularly surprising in a country that has been traditionally protective of its financial sector. Switzerland hesitated on sanctions against Russia before eventually following the European Union's lead. The war in Ukraine has proven a delicate balancing act for Switzerland. On the one hand, it does not want to upset the US and Europe. On the other, it wants to uphold its reputation as a safe destination for the world's assets, beyond the reach of arbitrary measures.

Second, a move to freeze Russian funds would not be in line with Swiss law. The right to ownership is enshrined in the Swiss constitution. Swiss legal experts say that there is no legal basis to use private frozen Russian funds to rebuild Ukraine. That view was recently confirmed by a high-level working group headed by the Federal Office of Justice.

But to be fair, other Western countries have not rushed to freeze Russian assets either. So far, only Canada and Croatia have announced that they would use private Russian funds for Ukraine's reconstruction. Other countries are still discussing the issue. Ukraine is not the only country putting pressure. Eastern European countries and the US have also urged Switzerland to do so; although it remains to be seen whether Washington will still back such far-reaching confiscations now that Republicans control the House of Representatives.

Switzerland has been in the spotlight of this debate due to the massive sums of money Russian oligarchs stashed away in Swiss accounts. According to the Swiss Bankers Association, Swiss banks hold between CHF150 billion and CHF200 billion ($160-$214 billion) in assets that belong to Russian clients. So far, some CHF7.5 billion and 17 Russian-owned properties have been seized. By comparison €19 billion (CHF19 billion) of Russian assets have been frozen in the entire EU.

The Russian central bank also uses Swiss bank accounts. A fact sheet from Switzerland's State Secretariat for International Financial Matters states that up to 2% of Russian central bank funds are in Switzerland. Even though the money is not officially frozen it cannot be transferred. Some legal experts have expressed the opinion that a legal basis for confiscation is most likely to emerge or be invented for these funds.

Switzerland has not endeared itself to Western countries with its ban on the re-export of war materiel. The most prominent example of this was when Switzerland refused to send ammunition for the German Gepard tanks to help the war effort in Ukraine. It also rejected similar requests from Spain and Denmark.

Germany's decision to restart the production of ammunition for Gepard tanks on its own soil triggered in Switzerland a discussion about the future of the Swiss arms industry. The defence industry's contribution to the overall economy is negligible. It accounts for only 2.5% of the annual turnover of the entire metal, electrical and machine (MEM) industry.

But the Swiss arms industry conducts considerable lobbying. Its most powerful argument: without exports the Swiss arms industry would struggle to survive in its current size for economic reasons. This would hurt Switzerland's self-sufficiency when it comes to weapons and compromise in turn the principle of armed neutrality. It is a logic that resonates strongly with the national-conservative swing of Swiss politics, which is protective of the industry.

The Federal Law on War Material (FLMG), which was tightened last year, prohibits the re-export of Swiss war material to war zones from third countries. For years, parties on the left and in the center of the political spectrum have put pressure on the Swiss arms industry. Russia's war on Ukraine turned debates over this restriction even more heated. Even those in left-wing parties are having second thoughts.

The international community applauded Switzerland when it finally decided to join EU sanctions against Russia at the end of February 2022. This may have had something to do with the fact that it took longer to reach a decision. But above all, the reactions demonstrated that Swiss neutrality is not understood abroad. Sanctions have been part of Swiss foreign policy since the 1990s.

It is important to note that Switzerland interprets neutrality in military terms rather than as a universal principle. Simply put, it does not take part in armed conflicts and does not supply weapons to warring parties. That approach is enshrined in the 1907 The Hague Convention, which Switzerland still considers legally binding.

There have a few exceptions in Swiss history when the Convention was not upheld. This was the case during WWII and the Cold War. But they are considered isolated incidents. In the view of some experts, an amendment to the Federal Law on War Material - effectively allowing indirect arms deliveries to Ukraine - would mark the beginning of the end of Swiss neutrality.

International law expert Oliver Diggelmann of the University of Zurich recently said in an interview with the German-speaking TagesAnzeiger daily: ""It would not be an un-Swiss way (...) We would act as if we did not know that this is not permitted under the law of neutrality. And in this way, we could cushion the international pressure.""

In 2022, Switzerland saw the largest influx of refugees since World War II. The systems providing shelter and care are at their limit. Around 75,000 people, mainly women and children, have arrived from Ukraine. The number of asylum seekers from other countries has also increased after stalling during the Covid-19 pandemic. Around 24,000 applications were submitted in 2022, and the trend is rising.

Switzerland granted refugees from Ukraine protection status S, allowing them to work and lead as normal a live as possible. Many Ukrainian families were initially accommodated privately. Not everything went smoothly. But, so far, public perception on how the country has handled things is positive, according to multiple media reports.

There are problems, however, such as integration into the labour market. Despite the high level of education of the Ukrainian refugees, only 15% have found a job. Swiss classrooms are short on teachers. There is also increasing criticism of the accommodation provided to refugees. Some cantons have had to resort to emergency solutions.

Concerns about Switzerland's energy security dominated the headlines in the summer and autumn. The government launched a campaign calling on people to save energy as shortages were expected. But it kept its demands small and simple, encouraging people to shower instead of taking a bath, for example.

A mild autumn and several European interventions such as importing liquified gas from overseas averted the looming energy crisis. Russian President Vladimir Putin's gas embargo was a lot less effective than expected. The issue moved to the backburner in Switzerland like in much of Europe.

What remains are long-term effects such as new supply chains for natural gas, a boom in the heat pump industry and, above all, higher living costs. Electricity prices in Switzerland have risen considerably, and this is reflected in consumption. Although inflation is lower than in the European environment, it was still an unusual 3.3% for Switzerland in January. Some parties are taking advantage of the situation to question Switzerland's nuclear phase-out and its timetable.",swissinfo.ch,news,SWI swissinfo.ch,Marc Leutenegger,0.03529411764705892,454863028,1,https://www.swissinfo.ch/content/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2023/02/1b5766b6505ebd9d27609ba363ec2a99-541092800_highres-data.jpg,

There are two ways to fix Britain, if you're a politician. You can do years of work following a plan that will turn things around in the future, when your opponents can either take the credit or trash the whole thing. Or, you can whack a Union Jack on it and take the credit now. Trains don't work? Great British Railways! Chronic under-investment in the private sector? British Business Bank! Widespread fuel poverty and terrifying environmental collapse? Great British Energy!

Keir Starmer has just re-announced the last of these in Greenock in Scotland. Labour intends to base Great British Energy (GBE), its planned state-owned energy company, in Scotland, where much of the UK's energy industry is already based. GBE would raise £8.3bn through windfall taxes on oil and gas over the next parliament and deploy this as ""early investments"" in renewables. This is either too much (if you're a Tory) or too little (if you're a Green). In reality it is a decent chunk of change. SSE, which is currently building the world's largest offshore wind farm at Dogger Bank, is investing £20.5bn in renewables by 2027. If GBE invests £8.3bn it will become one of the bigger investors in renewables in the UK.

There are good reasons to do this as a state, the main one being that the government can always borrow more cheaply than anyone else. Starmer has said that energy independence would remove ""Putin's boot from our throat"", but the boot is not only Putin's. Another belongs to energy companies such as British Gas, which increased its profits ten-fold in 2023, and to the banks that lend to energy companies. Renewables are typically funded by debt, and those finance costs translate directly into higher bills.

Almost half of the UK's offshore wind is already publicly owned, just not by the British public: state-owned companies such as Denmark's Ørsted and France's EDF. Governments are good at investing in renewables because they are less concerned by the risks (volatile prices, less reliable supply) and more concerned by externalities (all the other costs caused by the climate crisis) than a fossil fuel company. Mathew Lawrence, director of the Common Wealth think tank, says companies such as BP and Shell have ""pivoted away"" from renewables in favour of the higher profits to be had from more oil and gas extraction, and that markets need more than a ""nudge"" for the systemic change that's needed. A national energy company could, he says, be ""the NHS of the 21st century, in that it is a national institution that has both a moral imperative - but also a material offer"".

However, other energy analysts say the market is already doing the job of building energy generation - the UK was the world's largest recipient of foreign direct investment in renewables in 2022 - and that the really significant challenges, which only the government can take on, are a harder problem.

It won't really matter if Britain becomes, as Boris Johnson once put it, ""the Saudi Arabia of wind"" if it isn't also a very successful builder of electricity pylons, interconnectors, electric cars, insulation and new homes. Decarbonising Britain's electricity is much more than a question of supply. We have some of the oldest and least energy-efficient houses in Europe and 80 per cent of homes are heated by gas: it will not matter if we change the mix of electricity generation if we don't also all switch to using electricity for cooking and heating, and save energy through insulation.

However, these are difficult to achieve politically: you have to decide who gets free state-funded insulation (and who doesn't), who can put a heat pump on the wall of their block of flats, who has their view ruined by pylons. The Conservatives effectively banned onshore wind generation in 2015 by tightening planning rules, and they did so because their voters wanted them to. A genuinely decarbonised grid involves a lot more local strife. There's also a fight to be had about the high cost of electricity - which is pushed up because the policy costs of transition are loaded on to electricity bills, not gas bills - but again this is hard work. It's a lot easier to build a Union Jack wind farm a few miles offshore, even if the market is already doing that.

The job of the state should be to do the bits for which the market has no appetite. For example, one issue with a mostly renewable grid is that you need an option for when there's a high-pressure weather system during the winter, and most of Europe has little sun or wind to keep the lights on. You might actually need some state-owned gas power stations to provide an intermittent power service, but of course the optics of a government building or buying fossil fuel plants are not going to allow that to happen.

With a big enough majority, Labour could spend a lot of political capital dramatically increasing our stock of new housing, insulating millions of old homes, providing new incentives to buy electric cars, and investing in the grid.

The failure to implement infrastructure projects has been a recurring issue across African nations - with South Africa no exception. Researchers say that only some 20% of African mega projects reach financial closure because of insufficient labour skills and expertise, low labour efficiency, improper, haphazard and fragmented planning and execution, corruption, slow decision-making, mismanagement, lack of infrastructure maintenance, economic policies and political turbulence.

This mix has also created an almost perfect storm in South Africa, critically affecting societal needs for such basic essentials as energy and water.

""There is no argument to the fact that we are facing an energy crisis,"" says Tivon Loubser, Fund Manager of the Twelve B Energy Fund, a Gro-Vest subsidiary. ""Despite load shedding having been suspended for the last while, it would be naïve to believe we are through the worst of it. Eskom is faced with aging infrastructure and a huge capital outlay required for improvements, maintenance and the roll out of transmission lines. All this while their customer base dwindles, as mines and other large customers shift to more stable and renewable energy sources.

""The silver lining to this energy crisis is that it has been a catalyst for the growth of renewables, leapfrogging South Africa to a lower carbon economy. At the end of 2023, South Africa had an installed capacity of just under 8GW, which accounts for almost 50% of installed capacity on the continent. ""

The benefits of bridging the multi-trillion-dollar infrastructure gap in Africa are immense for all economic stakeholders, including investors seeking to unlock alternative sources of stable long-term returns. One such investor is Prescient Investment Management, through its Prescient Clean Energy and Infrastructure Fund.

Says Conway Williams, Prescient Investment Management's Head of Credit: ""We need to unlock the gridlock and decode Africa and South Africa's struggles with infrastructure implementation"".

""Our investment philosophy rests upon capital preservation and prudent fund management and by taking a comprehensive and cohesive approach to responsible investing, we can allocate our clients' capital in a way that fosters sustainability - and that includes investment into renewable energies and renewables infrastructure.

""Infrastructure is the bedrock of development, catalysing economic expansion, poverty alleviation, and enhanced quality of life.""

Williams says the country's infrastructure needs are enormous, and the government's push for infrastructure investing, driven by the need for economic development and job creation, has created significant opportunities for private investment. Moreover, infrastructure investments offer an excellent asset liability match for pension funds, with their long investment horizons and stable cash flows.

""South Africa needs a comprehensive strategy, including

investment into renewable energy""

""The term 'Just Energy Transition' refers to the shift from fossil fuel-based energy systems to more sustainable and equitable alternatives while ensuring that the process is fair, inclusive, and addresses social, economic, and environmental concerns,"" says Williams. It emphasises the need to protect vulnerable communities and workers who might be adversely affected by the transition.

""The global importance of a just energy transition is underscored by the urgent need to mitigate climate change. By transitioning to cleaner energy sources, the world can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, slow down global warming, and promote environmental sustainability. It can also enhance energy security and reduce dependence on finite fossil fuel resources.

""Its importance to South Africa is that this country has one of the highest coal dependency rates globally, with coal-fired power plants supplying the majority of the country's electricity. While coal has been a reliable source, it poses environmental and health challenges, contributing to air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Transitioning to cleaner energy sources is vital for meeting international climate commitments and reducing the environmental impact of energy production, plus a just transition ensures that vulnerable communities and workers are not left behind.""

The positives, Williams says, include environmental sustainability, job creation and job opportunities in the green economy; and energy security by diversifying the energy mix.

""The negatives are job displacements and potential job losses in the coal sector, impacting communities that heavily depend on the industry and initial upfront costs for building new infrastructure for renewable energy.

""There are, however, some countries making serious strides in on the just energy transition front, such as Germany, Denmark, Costa Rica, Norway, Sweden, the Netherlands, United Kingdom, China, Canada and Portugal.

""To manage the transition, South Africa needs a comprehensive strategy, including investment into renewable energy, developing solar, wind, and other renewable energy sources. There needs to be skills development and providing training and support for workers to transition to jobs in the renewable energy sector. There needs to be social programmes and implementing social safety nets to support communities impacted by the decline of the coal industry.

""Readiness has taken on new meaning as South Africa faces a just energy transition. While there have been efforts to diversify the energy mix with renewable projects, the pace needs to accelerate. There needs to be stronger policies, investment, and community engagement to ensure a smooth and equitable transition. Government, industry, and civil society collaboration will be crucial in navigating the challenges and ensuring a sustainable and just energy future for South Africa.""

Catalysing investment in renewable energy

Williams says that amid the global shift towards sustainable energy solutions, South Africa has been a leading player in renewable energy adoption through its Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Programme (REIPPP), adding that South Africa's REIPPP has been instrumental in catalysing private sector investment in renewable energy projects.

""The progress made through the programme highlights the sheer quantum of private sector capital that has been deployed into the renewable energy and infrastructure ecosystem to date and is an acknowledgement of the critical importance of incorporating renewable energy sources into our energy matrix to combat climate change while improving energy resilience.""

""We believe that as South Africa moves ahead, this country faces a pivotal year in 2024 with twin challenges that are critical to the REIPPP's continued success. Firstly, the integration of renewable energy into the national power grid, and secondly, significant advancements in energy storage technologies. These challenges are central to ensuring a stable, efficient, and sustainable energy landscape capable of supporting an increased reliance on renewable sources. Addressing these challenges needs responsible environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investment. We have intentionally incorporated ESG considerations into our investment process and the way we evaluate potential infrastructure investments.""

Williams also highlights the importance of South Africa's IRP2023, the country's blueprint for electricity infrastructure, detailing both expected demand and supply.

""While noting the announced bid windows of renewable energy, battery storage and gas, we at Prescient, however, view the document as falling short in certain areas, not fully addressing the country's energy needs. In light of continued load-shedding, one cannot underscore the importance of the IRP2023. Even in its current form, it foresees continued load-shedding until 2027, highlighting the failure to address the pressing issue of electricity supply. One only needs to look at the continued decline in Eskom's Energy Availability Factor (EAF) to understand the stark reality that we as a country face. Eskom's EAF has declined from the reported 58% in 2022 to 54.7% in 2023.""

Prescient has recently supported two landmark transactions, facilitating BEE ownership in large scale projects which have positive environmental impact. The first is an equity finance facility to Reatile Renewables Virginia through the Prescient Clean Energy and Infrastructure Debt Fund (CEIDF). Funding is being utilised to allow Reatile to acquire 31.5% of Ursa Energy, a 240MW solar PV farm which forms part of bid window six of the REIPPPP.

The second is the CEIDF providing equity finance to Jade Sky Virginia. This will fund Jade Sky's equity contributions to its round six renewable energy project company, positioning it as a 15% shareholder.

Prior to these transactions, the CEIDF had already committed over R4 billion to 30 renewable energy projects and infrastructure opportunities and contributed towards enabling an additional 2.2GW of clean energy - the equivalent of one million average South African homes.

Capacity and stability

Williams emphasises that the integration of renewable sources into South Africa's grid is a monumental task and one that is critical to this country's future. He also says that this is a significantly complex endeavour, primarily due to the variable nature of renewable energy sources, added to which, grid capacity and voltage stability are vital for success. These must be addressed to enable further renewable energy sources to be integrated at scale.

""Notwithstanding the progress made, risks still abound. While the availability of capital is not one of these risks, tight timeframes are concerning, and so is coordinating multiple stakeholders, including government entities, utilities, and private investors. This poses a complex challenge requiring effective collaboration and streamlined decision-making processes.

""We believe that with strategic partnerships between international experts, local players and those charged with policy development and execution will ultimately encourage further private sector participation.

""South Africa's challenges in bringing sufficient renewable energy online are not insurmountable. Instead, they present opportunities for innovation and progress. By emphasising infrastructure upgrades, fostering collaboration among stakeholders, embracing advanced technologies, and prioritising the needs of our REIPPP, we believe South Africa can overcome the hurdles and chart a path towards a more sustainable energy future,"" concludes Williams.

South African energy sector opportunities

By global standards, SA is extremely attractive for energy sector investors. This is evidenced by over R400bn of private sector capital deployment in the renewable energy sector over the past 14 years, with attractive returns for both equity and debt investors. Major beneficiaries have been offshore developers and equipment suppliers (European, Japanese, Chinese), overseas DFIs and funds, as well as local developers, banks, DFIs and infrastructure funds. Of interest is the explosion over the past 10 years of ""empowered"" developers, who may well spark a trickle-down effect of more empowered participants in the energy value chain.

Whereas the first wave from 2011 to date was anchored on wind and solar power generation, the next phase offers a blend of renewables, gas-fired power, grid investment and open market direct and indirect (value-chain) market opportunities.

The IEA Africa Energy Outlook 2022 asserts that ""Africa's industrialisation relies in part on expanding natural gas use"" and further explains that ""more than 5 000 billion cubic metres (bcm) of natural gas resources have been discovered to date in Africa which have not yet been approved for development. These resources could provide an additional 90 bcm of gas a year by 2030, which may well be vital for the fertiliser, steel and cement industries as well as water desalination"".

IEA further qualifies that ""Natural gas demand in Africa increases in the Sustainable Africa Scenario (SAS), but it maintains the same share of modern energy use as today, with electricity generation from renewables outcompeting it in most cases"" and that ""the use of domestic natural gas production makes sense for African consumer countries, offering the considerable advantage of lower energy costs compared with fuel imports"".

An optimal energy mix considers full cost of energy (FCOE), availability, security of supply, reliability, safety (for humans, animal life), and the environment (air, soil, plants, marine life) in its construct.

It is further driven by industrial policy, regional geo-politics, regional power pool dynamics (transmission capacity, traded volume, pricing), whilst addressing historic geo-spatial demand imbalances.

Gas is cited as a suitable primary energy source for meeting over 13GW of new build, as part of the SA energy resource base which the draft Integrated Energy Plan, classifies as: Renewables (Wind, Solar, Hydro, Biomass), Fossil fuels (Natural Gas, Crude Oil, Coal), and Nuclear fuels (Uranium). Conversion of these primary sources coupled with storage, transmission/transport, end-user servicing promises well over R500bn of medium-term sustainable investment opportunities for investors in:

*natural gas upstream activities (given the high hydrocarbon potential onshore and offshore SA)

*natural gas midstream infrastructure including liquefaction or re-gasification (requires port access rights through either a Department of Transport Section 56 process or a Ministerial Section 79 directive),

*gas-to-power via Government procurement and Commercial and Industrial (C&I) clients,

*gas for use in industrial or agricultural processes,

*embedded/captive rooftop and commercial space solar to residential (called SSEG) and C&I

*wheeled solar and wind power to C&I clients

*gas-derived products (ammonia, ammonium, fertiliser, cleaning, refrigerants, etc.)

*biogenic carbon / biomass (including municipal solid waste, agriculture and food waste, and wastewater)

*co-generation (such as from paper/pulp and sugar/bagasse operations)

*biofuels (manufacture, storage, transport and blending)

*Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG)

*power transmission self-build (for independent power producers)

*virtual power stations (with AI enablement for supply-demand balancing)

Other non-direct opportunities related to the energy value chain include:

*battery assembly

*low-carbon transportation (such as synfuels, hydrogen, methane driven heavy duty vehicles)

*maintenance and equipment supply in generation

*high voltage (HV) transmission network materials

*industrial, agricultural and residential heating and cooling (that use de-centralised power)

*digitisation and the new energy economy and business models (driven by 2050 Net Zero Emissions scenario) which will also include alternative payment methods enabled by decentralised finance (deFi), energy tokenisation, and energy-backed cryptocurrency (stablecoins).

SA capital providers including banks, DFIs and infrastructure funds which draw on long-term capital from pensions and offshore capital are well-positioned to provide funding in support of developers, manufacturers and service providers wishing to leverage these opportunities.",mg.co.za,news,The Mail & Guardian,Rebecca Haynes,-0.04313725490196074,454852888,10,https://mg.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Energy.png,eng-9607050

These cells use new electrodes made of nickel and gadolinium-doped ceria (Ni-GDC) and have shown promising results after 1,000 hours of testing.

Electrolysis cells are crucial for converting green electricity from wind turbines and solar panels into fuels like hydrogen, methanol, and ammonia.

These fuels can help reduce CO2 emissions and promote sustainable transportation and industry.

The DTU team, led by Professor Henrik Lund Frandsen, tested the new Ni-GDC fuel electrodes and found that they maintained their performance over time, without wearing out.

This increased durability could lead to significant savings in material costs and reduce the price of green hydrogen by up to 5%.

""If we can implement ceramic electrolysis cells in power-to-x (PtX) technology worldwide, their efficiency could save 25% of the electricity needed to produce green fuel and reduce the price of hydrogen by up to 20%.

Improving the lifespan of the cells will also result in material savings, reducing costs by an additional 5%,"" Frandsen explained.

The tests, conducted by postdoc Morten Phan Klitkou and his team, involved running the cells at different currents for 1,000 hours.

The results showed only slight degradation in the fuel electrode's resistance at very high current draws.

This is a significant improvement over conventional ceramic electrolysis cells, which typically degrade under similar conditions. The nickel in the new electrodes remained stable, even under high stress.

However, the researchers encountered a new issue with the electrolyte in the electrolysis cells. Despite this complication, they are optimistic about the potential of Ni-GDC cells and believe they offer a scalable solution for creating efficient and long-lasting electrolysis cells.

Hydrogen production through electrolysis is essential for the green transition. The first step in any PtX process is to produce hydrogen, which can then be used to make various green fuels.

In the future, large amounts of power from wind turbines and solar cells, including energy from two planned energy islands in the North Sea and on Bornholm, will be used to produce these fuels.

This green electricity will power applications that are difficult to electrify, such as heavy road transportation, aviation, shipping, and various industrial processes.

In Denmark, a lot of research and development in ceramic electrolysis cells has been carried out through a collaboration between the company Topsoe and DTU researchers. In 2014, they entered a license agreement to manufacture and develop ceramic electrolysis cells (SOEC).

This led Topsoe to begin building the world's first large-scale factory to produce high-temperature electrolysis cells in Herning.

The factory, set to open in 2025, will initially produce 500 MW of electrolysis units annually, expanding to 5 GW by 2030.

Frandsen estimates that it will take up to ten years for Ni-GDC electrolysis cells to be fully scaled up and used in PtX plants worldwide.",knowridge.com,news,Knowridge Science Report,,0.2627450980392156,454847610,10,https://knowridge.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Scientists-develop-cheaper-long-lasting-electrolysis-cells-for-green-hydrogen.jpg,

At the turn of the year, Denmark reached 200,000 registered electric cars, and last year electric cars accounted for 36 per cent of all newly registered cars. However, the figure is quite different for electric trucks. Electric trucks only make up about 1 per cent of the total truck fleet in Denmark. However, according to new calculations, this figure will soon change significantly. In fact, calculations predict that the transition from fossil fuel trucks to electric trucks will overtake the transition for passenger cars in Denmark.

""In all the scenarios we have calculated, it appears that the transition from diesel to electric trucks will overtake the transition from fossil fuel cars to electric cars. We have tested different scenarios, and they all indicate that the percentage of trucks running on electricity will be much higher than that for passenger cars within the next ten years,"" says Jeppe Rich, Professor at DTU Management, who together with Assistant Professor Ahmed Karam have made the calculations.

If you look at the climate figures, the transition will be significant. On EU roads, heavy vehicles weighing more than 12 tons account for more than 25 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions. This is why the European Commission has introduced stricter CO2 emission standards for heavy-duty vehicles, aiming for a reduction of 45 per cent by 2030 and 90 per cent by 2040, compared to 2019 levels.

It is precisely the heavy vehicles on which DTU Management's calculations are based. More specifically, semi-trailer trucks -- trucks weighing more than 12 tons with one trailer attached -- that transport goods within Denmark. Semi-trailer trucks make up about 33 per cent of trucks in Denmark, but account for about 67 per cent of the kilometres driven.

""Specifically, we have looked at a line haul network, where trucks transport goods from one warehouse to another before smaller vehicles pick up the goods and bring them to the cities. These are the trucks that the calculations predict will all run on electricity by 2035,"" says Jeppe Rich

Among other organizations, the Green Transition Denmark (Rådet for Grøn Omstilling) also predicts a major transition, and estimates that about half of the trucks in Denmark will run on electricity in 2035, while the Danish Energy Agency only expects that about a fifth of the trucks will run on electricity by then.

Complicated equation

The calculations are based on multiple factors that can influence the speed of the transition.

One of the political aspects that could have an impact is the new road charges and tolls that will enter into force in 2025. Trucks weighing more than 12 tons will from 2025 have to pay tolls according to their mileage in Denmark. The toll will be differentiated according to the trucks' CO2 emissions, which means that green trucks will have to pay the least.

""The speed of the transition depends, among other things, on whether there will be enough fast chargers and better batteries, truck prices, and the political aspects in the form of charges. If we imagine that the development goes as planned with the upcoming taxes and fast chargers, we believe that a full transition to electric is possible within the next ten years. However, this will require investment in the industry,"" says Ahmed Karam.

In addition to the savings by going green on the roads, new charging parks will also motivate the industry to run on electricity. In Denmark, almost DKK 700 million is being invested in a roll-out plan, which includes the establishment of 25 charging parks with 175 fast-charging stations. According to the plan, the first five charging parks will open in 2025, while the remaining 20 will be established continuously until 2030.

Is the industry ready?

Despite the many incentives for the transition, it first and foremost requires that companies themselves prioritize electric trucks over the fossil ones.

""We have had conversations with several stakeholders in the industry who confirm that the development trends towards electric trucks. But we have also talked to others who are more conservative and just need to see if the new trucks will be able to work in practice. What is certain, however, is that they feel pressure from their business partners who want CO2-free shipping. So, of course, it's a question of price and competitiveness. Looking at the numbers, it appears that truck battery prices will fall, which will make the trucks more financially attractive,"" says Jeppe Rich.

Elsewhere at DTU, other solutions are being developed to organize electricity production, so it can meet the increasing charging needs. This is done through the EU innovation project Begonia, which together with companies in the industry is looking at new solutions.

""The companies running large parcel centres state that the smaller trucks transporting the goods the final kilometres in the cities will be the first to transition to electricity. I'm not so sure that things will be as rapid for large trucks, where I sense a certain scepticism from hauliers. But as batteries improve, the large trucks will also run on electricity at some point,"" says Henrik Madsen, Professor at DTU Compute, who is working on the begonia project.

The industry could use the same workforce, the same shipyards and possibly even the same platforms to generate renewable power.

With designs, data and offshore leases from Texas, Herman Schellstede and his team planned to build a 62-turbine wind farm off Galveston's coast -- one of the first such proposals in the United States and the first in the Gulf of Mexico.

The team approached banks and even Koch Industries seeking financing for the $300 million wind farm, he said. But financing nascent offshore wind was apparently too risky a proposition in the wake of the 2008 financial meltdown. The wind farm was eventually scuttled.

""We were still too early,"" said Schellstede, the Louisiana oil and gas entrepreneur who is still designing offshore wind turbines for proposed projects in the gulf.

Now, 33 years after the first offshore wind farm was built in waters off Denmark, it's still unclear if the time is right -- or will ever be right -- for the United States. In those years, only four wind farms generating 242 megawatts of power have been built off the U.S. coast; the largest just went into service in 2024.

Last year, inflation, supply chain problems and other macroeconomic issues led to the cancellation or renegotiation of about half of all proposed offshore wind projects. And while the Biden Administration is moving as quickly as possible to approve new lease sales and projects -- expanding the amount of power generated by 10-fold -- former President Donald Trump has promised to end offshore wind if elected.

The industry and advocates, however, do not seem daunted. Studies show offshore wind could meet 5% of the nation's energy needs by 2035, and up to 25% by 2050.

""We're all in this room today, not because we just see offshore wind as a massive opportunity -- which it is to build you clean energy -- but also we see the necessity of offshore wind,"" said Amanda Lefton, vice president of offshore development for the renewable energy company RWE.

Lefton, speaking at an April conference of the offshore wind industry in New Orleans, said the technology is needed to meet national and state decarbonization goals. RWE is developing projects off the East Coast and California and working to create a supply chain for offshore wind in the Gulf of Mexico with a large Louisiana-based coalition.

""We know the fundamentals exist in these markets,"" said Lefton, the former head of the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management who leads RWE's East Coast operations. ""We know that it's not an if, it's a when.""

In the years since Schellestede's wind project proposal, the industry has moved forward in fits and starts. In 2016, the small scale 30-megawatt Block Island Wind Farm off the coast of Rhode Island became the first U.S. offshore wind project to be completed.

Cape Wind, the first large-scale offshore wind project in the United States off the shores of Massachusetts, was canceled the following year after 16 years of controversy.

In 2020, a 12-MW pilot project -- the first in federally controlled waters -- came online off Virginia's coast.

So far this year, the industry has made historic progress as South Fork Wind Farm off New York began producing 132 MW of electricity, and Massachusetts' Vineyard Wind started spinning the first five of 62 turbines, sending 68 MW of power to the grid. At full operation, the wind farm is designed to generate 805 MW.

By contrast, worldwide there are almost 73,000 MW, or 73 gigawatts, of offshore wind operating, with half of that amount off China's coast.

Some of the delay in the U.S. industry occurred during Donald Trump's presidency. His administration held no offshore lease sales for federally owned waters. Trump ordered an environmental review for the Atlantic Coast, killing or delaying projects in various states of development.

As he did in his May 12 speech in New Jersey, Trump often repeats the falsehood that offshore wind is killing whales -- a claim dismissed by the federal government's own scientists. But groups funded by or tied to oil and gas interests including the American Petroleum Institute continue to perpetuate it, insisting offshore wind also harms fisheries and tourism.

""There is zero evidence for offshore wind activities causing whale deaths,"" said Helen Rose Patterson, senior campaign manager with National Wildlife Federation's offshore wind energy program. Patterson calls the claims ""disinformation,"" or false information that is intentionally spread.

She said the greatest threat to the whales is climate change, which offshore wind could help mitigate. North American right whales now must travel farther north to hunt their cold water prey, Patterson said, putting them closer to ships and fishing that put them at risk. ""The North Atlantic right whales are in different places because of climate change.""

When Joe Biden took office in 2021, he ordered a 180-degree turn on federal offshore wind policy.

During his first year in office, the Democrat established a target to deploy 30 GW of offshore wind -- the equivalent of about 30 new nuclear plants -- by 2030 to help reach his national climate goal of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.

So far, the administration has approved 10 GW of offshore projects and is expected to approve more by the end of the year in what some observers see as a rush to get more wind farms started in the event Trump wins the November election.

At the Oceantic Network conference in New Orleans, Interior Secretary Deb Haaland announced 12 offshore wind leasing sales over the next five years, ranging from New York to Hawaii and the Gulf of Mexico to the state of Oregon. Biden previously announced $5 billion in federally issued loan guarantees to boost offshore wind development.

Although Schellstede and his company, Wind Energy Systems Technology (WEST), failed to get interest for the project in Louisiana, Texas welcomed them. Texas saw offshore wind as a way to expand on its extensive energy resources, state officials said at the time.

Texas wasn't the only entity aiming to diversify. Big oil companies including Shell and BP and other international oil interests began adding wind to their own portfolios. In fact, the two oil giants were major sponsors of the offshore wind conference in New Orleans.

""It's not greenwashing,"" said Patterson of the oil majors investing in offshore wind. ""I'm much more concerned about oil and gas that aren't doing anything to diversify their portfolios.""

Since WEST tried to establish a wind farm off Galveston nearly 20 years ago, top Texas officials have become resistant to offshore wind energy. Last year, Texas Railroad Commissioner Wayne Christian told Gov. Greg Abbott that he opposes offshore wind, calling it a ""taxpayer boondoggle"" and repeating the false claims about offshore wind causing whale deaths.

The Texas land commissioner followed with her own opposition to the Biden Administration's plan to lease federal land off the state's coast for offshore wind. And the powerful Texas Public Policy Foundation, funded by conservative billionaires including oil baron Charles Koch, is leading offshore opposition along the East Coast.

Economically, it is also hard for more expensive offshore wind to compete with the abundance of renewable energy that Texas already has. Currently, Texas can supply 70% of its electricity demand through renewable power. The cost of offshore wind over the lifespan of the project, or levelized cost of energy, is up to double that of onshore wind -- but is cheaper than coal or nuclear power.

In Louisiana, even the most conservative Republicans have come to see things the way Schellstede did in the 2000s -- that Louisiana has the workforce, the industrial infrastructure and the knowledge to spur offshore wind, not only off the state's Gulf Coast, but around the country.

On May 11, the day before Trump said he would end offshore wind, House majority leader and Trump supporter U.S. Rep. Steve Scalise, R-Louisiana, watched as his wife Jennifer christened the nation's first offshore wind service vessel. Scalise has been a vocal supporter of the industry.

""I think in terms of contrast -- that really represented the opportunity that I see in Louisiana,"" said Jenny Netherton, Louisiana program manager for the nonprofit Southeastern Wind Coalition, who attended the christening in New Orleans.

""People think of us as an oil and gas state, and we are just an energy state,"" Netherton said. ""Because of offshore oil and gas, we have developed this huge vessel industry that is needed for offshore wind. We can build a lot -- and pretty quickly.""

The christened vessel, the Eco Edison, was commissioned by Danish wind developer Orsted and built by Louisiana's Edison Chouest Offshore. The vessel will service offshore wind in the Atlantic.

A recent report released at the conference by the Southeastern Wind Coalition, Greater New Orleans Inc., the Center for Planning Excellence and The Pew Charitable Trusts found there are 450 companies in Louisiana with the potential to shift toward offshore wind. Fifteen companies in the state already work on offshore wind, including Gulf Island Fabrication, which made the steel structures that support the turbines and other equipment for the Block Island wind farm.

""Louisiana can lead in wind power the same way it has led in oil and gas production,"" Lacy McManus, executive director of future energy for Greater New Orleans Inc., said in announcing the report.

Louisiana's former Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards set a goal of 5,000 MW of offshore wind by 2035. The state has leased its own land under nearshore waters to Vestas and Diamond Offshore Wind for potential development. And in last year's federal sale, RWE leased an offshore parcel in southwest Louisiana. Both projects are still in early stages of development.

It's unclear whether Republican Gov. Jeff Landry supports Edwards' goals; so far the governor, who took office in January, has said nothing publicly about offshore wind. His office did not return a request asking for the governor's position.

""While I have not spoken with Gov. Landry personally, we have heard that he favors the 'all of the above' energy approach,"" Camille Manning-Broome, CEO and president for the nonprofit Center for Planning Excellence in Baton Rouge, told Floodlight. ""Our work with state agency partners does lend itself to continuing this approach of bringing additional sources of energy to the gulf and diversifying our energy portfolio.""

Joshua Basseches is an assistant professor at Tulane University in New Orleans whose work focuses on energy and climate policy and politics. Basseches said he expects disinformation campaigns, like those on the East Coast around whales, along with opposition from the regional fishing industry, might make offshore wind in the Gulf of Mexico difficult.

Others are skeptical of the economics. It will be harder for offshore wind power to compete against the region's favored natural gas power plants, which produce lower cost energy. And building offshore wind farms in the Gulf of Mexico might be more expensive and less efficient than those being built elsewhere because of the risks of hurricanes and its relatively lower wind speeds.

""It doesn't really make a lot of sense,"" BloombergNEF analyst Chelsea Jean-Michel told Heatmap last year. The company, which researches the technologies driving the transition to a lower-carbon economy, confirmed in an email to Floodlight its opinion about the feasibility of offshore wind in the Gulf of Mexico has not changed.

""It's got to be economic. It has to produce the power at a low cost,"" Schellstede agreed. ""It will be interesting to see how this all settles out.""",insideclimatenews.org,news,InsideClimate News,Derek Harrison,0.05882352941176472,454843877,4,https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/eco_edison-1024x683.jpg,eng-9603774

Delivery is scheduled for 2026.

Torghatten has placed its order with Myklebust Verft at Gursken south of Ålesund. This yard is especially well known in the North European commercial fishing industry for building among the finest pelagic super-trawlers in the world.

These are not modest roll-on roll-off ferries; they have been designed by the Norwegian Ship Design Company and will measure 117m in length overall, operate at 17 knots and be capable of carrying up to 120 cars.

They will, when completed, ply Norway's longest ferry and arguably most challenging route of all. Namely between Bodø and the fabled Lofoten Islands north of the Arctic Circle.

Marius Hansen, CEO of Torghatten Nord said in a statement: ""Together with the authorities, we are in the process of setting the standard for a completely new class of ships, with a world-class innovation and climate project.

""At Myklebust, we found an environment with high competence at a sustainable price. I am proud that we have achieved this in Norway, because this is a major boost for the Norwegian technology and shipbuilding community.""

Leiv Sindre Muren, CEO of Myklebust Verft replied: ""We are very pleased to have reached an agreement to build the world's largest hydrogen ships.

""Together with the maritime cluster in Norway, we will develop new knowledge, secure jobs and be able to take on more apprentices with this assignment.

""It will be exciting to deliver something no one has done before us.""

Quite simply, there are no other maritime hydrogen projects internationally that come close to the scale and ambitions of this project.

The suppliers of design, technology, equipment and hydrogen in the project are Norwegian, and the project is also working closely with the Norwegian Maritime Authority and the classification society Lloyd's Register to develop procedures and safety standards for a completely new type of ferries.

A hydrogen storage unit on board the vessel will feed gas to the fuel cells, creating electricity to propel the vessels and power their auxiliary systems, reducing CO2 emissions on the route by around 26,500 tonnes annually. There will be a bio-fuelled diesel-electric backup.

The hydrogen plant will be located at Bodø and operated by GreenH. The port is a key strategic hub in the Salten region of Norway and, according to the firm, the diversity of industrial consumers makes the town a natural hydrogen production centre.

Bodø has ferries and shipping companies, big land-based transport companies with regional warehouses, the most central airport in Nordland, and the terminus of the Nordland railway.

This is not the only innovation by Torghatten Nord. On December 6, the company's brand new 117m electric ferry, MF Hinnøy, was launched from the Cemre shipyard in Turkey.

Hinnøy will join Northern Norway's busiest connection, Bognes-Lødingen. It too has a 120 car capacity while passenger capacity is 399.

Also developed by the Norwegian Ship Design, the double-ender - it has the design designation NSD120CFc, - will normally operate as a zero emissions vessel in exposed waters on the entire one hour transit of the Bognes - Lødingen route at a speed of 13-14 knots.

The transit time (and speed) sets a new record among the growing fleet of Norwegian battery/hybrid ferries of which there are some 80 now operating.

In addition to significant savings in CO2 emissions, Hinnøy is expected to offer greater comfort, more space and universal design.

The connection will also be a milestone for electric ferries, with a charging power of 9,200,000 watts which, as far as is known, sets a new world record in charging power on ferries.

The vessel will normally operate battery-electric with all power originating from the grid onshore through high-capacity automated charging connections.

Cemre has built a number of ferries and energy support ships to Norwegian account. The yard is also building four conventional diesel-fuelled ferries for Scottish company CMAL whose operating arm is CalMac. All are currently ahead of or on schedule for delivery.

To round off, Cemre is also constructing another ground-breaking ferry to Nordic account, this time for Scandlines' new Futura, billed as the ""world's largest zero-emission freight ferry"" and another demonstration of how the shipping industry is seeking to break free of reliance on Big Oil for fuelling.

The 147m shuttle will service the busy Puttgarden in Germany and Rødby in Denmark route and has a designed capacity of 66 freight units, which is 23% higher than current vessels serving the route.

Thanks to its novel design, it will be possible to transport lorries on both the upper and lower decks. Moreover, the modular construction of the vessel means it will be possible to later reconfigure its layout to carry cars as well.

Thanks to the hybrid diesel/battery (10MWh) electric propulsion, Futural will have the capability to feature in two different modes as fully electrical relying on plug-in battery power at 10 knots or plug-in hybrid mode at 16 knots.

The design is also prepared for future upgrades to methanol-fuelled ICE (diesel engine) propulsion.",energyvoice.com,news,Energy Voice,Amy Smith,0.1764705882352942,454841838,1,https://www.energyvoice.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/04/8C19D0C089484E54B4D2E9121F8E6381-1zqkvn6mk.jpg,

The ferries operate on the Puttgarden, Germany - Rödby, Denmark, route, and the conversion represents a key element in Scandlines' target to achieve emission-free operations on the route by 2030.

The company's overall vision is to realise zero emissions on all operations by 2040. The two Scandlines RoRo ferries selected for conversion to plug-in hybrid operation are the 142-metre-long Deutschland and Schleswig-Holstein.

The project involves replacing an engine and existing systems with a new shore-charged electrical system, including a large energy storage system. This will allow electricity to contribute approximately eighty percent of the energy needed for each crossing.

Wärtsilä will engineer and deliver the hybrid converters, the energy storage system (ESS) and the energy management system (EMS), as well as the switchgears, transformers, the onboard port charger, and replacement components in the existing switchboard equipment. In addition, the company will supervise the installations, carry out the commissioning, and provide preventive maintenance support services. The equipment is scheduled for delivery in summer 2025.

'We are excited to support Scandlines with their vision towards delivering environmentally sustainable transport options for the region.

Or will the lights go out?,"A gargantuan shift lies ahead in Scotland's electricity demand. Hundreds of thousands of homes connecting up heat pumps, just at the same time as increasing numbers of drivers are switching to EVs and looking to charge up.

Already it is straining. In many parts of Scotand and the rest of the UK, the grid has limited capacity and constrained, where a heat pump might represent a connection too many.

As Andrew Ward, CEO UK Retail at Scottish Power has put it: ""Grid capacity is an issue already in places across the UK. There are streets, for instance, where the grid can't take the addition of heat pumps because already homes have had fast chargers installed. There are areas in Glasgow where capacity is an issue. In St Andrews there is limited capacity.

""The need,"" he said, ""for greater local grid capacity is why you will soon see us digging up roads, in for instance, Edinburgh this summer, as we invest billions to make sure the grid is ready for people when they want to make the change.""

The impact of grid capacity on heat pump roll-out is mentioned in some of the Local Heat and Energy Efficiency Strategies that local authorities have created as the beginnings of an effort to define where there will be heat pump homes, and where heat networks.

The Perth and Kinross LHEES, for instance, notes that while ""Kinross and Milnathort and Coupar Angus have high concertations of ""properties that are heat pump ready"", they have ""limited spare grid capacity"".

Edinburgh's delivery plan lists 10 target areas with the greatest potential to migrate to heat pumps, but notes that other factors are ""pressures on the electricity grid"" and the ""existing electricity price regime"".

A massive programme of grid reinforcement and expansion has already begun, with the National Grid unveiling plans to invest over £60 billion. Yet there are still doubts over whether it will be able to take the mass shift to electrification.

A 2022 Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy report estimated that UK demand for electricity is expected to increase by 2035 and double by 2050.

That increase in peak demand, it said, would be largely driven by heat and transport sectors. ""An inability of the electricity distribution network to cope with such an increase could delay the decarbonisation of domestic heating and other key sectors of the economy.""

It also noted: ""Transmission network constraints are expected to become more significant over the next decade.""

In Scotland, and the rest of the UK, domestic electricity demand is at its highest in winter, with daily peaks in the morning before people leave for work, and in the evening when they return and switch on the oven, television and other appliances.

The grid therefore needs to cope with a number of things. It needs to handle the winter when the sun doesn't shine so much, as well as long lulls in the wind. But it also needs to handle the daily peaks and troughs of demand. For the former, large scale storage solutions are needed, from pump storage hydro to solutions involving hydrogen, but for the latter some of the solutions lie in the home.

The way that may work is something Pat Hackett, one of the heat pump owners we visited, is interested in. He has been experimenting for himself with how he, through battery storage and shifting his own demand can help the grid - particularly around the 4-7pm evening peak.

""I want to see if, as an individual home, I can do it,"" he said. ""Can it be solved for a house like this? If it was scaled up, would we need to dig all those roads up? And the answer, I've concluded, is no. The grid system we've got now can deal with that fluctuation.""

""I want,"" he described, ""to work with the grid. I want to interact with it - so the grid can borrow from me, and I can borrow from the grid. That 4-7pm energy demand is huge. It wouldn't matter if you have all the solar, all the wind, all these storage problems, we've still got to supply that. So we have to switch the load.""

Pat Hackett with his battery and energy app

Part of the answer, he said, lies in the heat pump, battery and solar combination he has installed. The heat pump allows him to distribute heating in a different way throughout the day, with solar he can charge the battery and store energy that might be used in his home or delivered to the grid.

Mr Hackett's experiment obviously revolves around just one house, but it does give an insight into the way the technology inside homes may provide some of the solutions to grid issues.

The kind of storage and smart manipulation of demand that is achievable in homes is also something that a study by a team at the Energy and Power Group at the university of Oxford, has looked into.

The carbon footprint of heating, from heat pumps to networks

It found that if just 10% of British households switched to heat pumps it could increase peak electricity demand by 4 to 5%. Other studies has predicted as much as 7%. To cope with this, it proposed a ""flexible heating system"".

In this kind of system, explained researcher Jesus Lizana, ""new heating systems are integrated with heat storage, smart controls, and programs (or tariffs) that fairly reward and incentivize households to shift energy consumed for heating."" A key element in the system, it proposed, were heat batteries.

This kind of approach is also one that Robin Parker, mission manager for Scotland at the innovation think tank, Nesta, could have a significant impact on grid peak demand.

Nesta recently conducted a pilot project with the Centre for Net Zero to investigate how heat pumps can be used more flexibly - shifting use away from peak times - using automation to control usage in order to better support a low-carbon electricity grid.

""The provision findings from this,"" he said, ""suggested that it was possible to shift electricity usage to different times in the day and that most households in the trial were happy to have their heating automated to manage demand. We are currently in the middle of a larger scale trial to follow up on and validate the findings.

""Another option,"" he said, ""for households is to have more and better storage - of electricity and of hot water - through storage batteries and bigger water storage tanks.

But some of this will be on a larger scale. Mr Parker said: ""Storage capacity at the moment in the grid is for short term spikes at peak times. In the longer term, we will need long-duration storage, for example generating power in the summer and storing it to use in the winter - countries such as Denmark are already storing hot water over summer in huge quantities.""",heraldscotland.com,news,The Herald,,0.003921568627450966,454830410,28,https://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/18141512/,eng-9610996

Electrolysis cells play a key role in converting green electricity from wind turbines and solar cells into fuels such as hydrogen, methanol and ammonia that can help reduce CO emissions and promote sustainable transportation and industry.

Researchers at DTU have fabricated and tested a new type of ceramic electrolysis cells with Ni-GDC fuel electrodes and demonstrated that instead of wearing out, the electrodes maintain their performance. Professor at DTU Henrik Lund Frandsen estimates that the increased lifetime of Ni-GDC electrolysis cells can lead to significant savings in material consumption in future power-to-x plants and reduce the price of green hydrogen by up to 5%.

""If we can get ceramic electrolysis cells into power-to-x technology in enough places around the world, their efficiency means that you can save 25% of all the electricity needed to produce the same amount of green fuel and save up to about 20% of the price of hydrogen. And if we also improve the lifespan of the technology, it will result in material savings, which will mean a further price reduction of 5%,"" says Frandsen.

A thousand hours of testing

The experiments to evaluate the stability of the Ni-GDC electrodes were conducted by postdoc Morten Phan Klitkou and others at DTU. The tests were performed at different currents for 1,000 hours. The results showed that the resistance in the fuel electrode only degraded slightly at very high current draws. The experiments showed that the primary degradation mechanism of conventional ceramic electrolysis cells could be avoided as the nickel in the electrode did not move even under the high current draw. Current cell technology would not have been able to tolerate the same strain.

However, the researchers found that there are still some challenges with the new electrolysis cells, where the new materials have caused another problem in the electrolyte. Despite this new complication, the researchers believe that the test results with the Ni-GDC electrolysis cells are very positive and show a scalable path to manufacturing highly efficient and long-lasting electrolysis cells.

The production of hydrogen by electrolysis is a key part of the green transition, where the first step in any power-to-x (PtX) process is always the production of hydrogen by electrolysis. In the future, we will have large amounts of power available from wind turbines and solar cells, including from the two energy islands to be built in the North Sea and on Bornholm. Much of the green electricity from the islands will be used to produce fuels for applications that are difficult to electrify, such as heavy road transportation, aviation, shipping, and a number of industrial processes.

In Denmark, a lot of research and development of ceramic electrolysis cells has been carried out in a collaboration between the company Topsoe and researchers at DTU. In 2014, the parties entered into a non-exclusive license agreement that made it possible to manufacture and develop ceramic electrolysis cells (SOEC) in collaboration with DTU Energy. In 2023, this development led Topsoe to start construction of the world's first large scale factory to produce high-temperature electrolysis cells assembled in large numbers in so-called stacks in Herning. When the factory is completed in 2025, it will be able to produce 500 MW of electrolysis units annually, and by 2030, production will be expanded to 5 GW annually.

Frandsen estimates that it will take up to ten years before the Ni-GDC electrolysis cells are fully scaled up and utilized in power-to-X plants internationally.",techxplore.com,news,Tech Xplore,,0.2941176470588236,454799802,7,https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/new-electrolysis-cells.jpg,

The degree of modularity may vary between designs, and it may have a better possibility to integrate additional modularity in the early stages of design.

The global small modular reactor market size is estimated to be USD 5.8 billion in 2023 and is projected to reach USD 6.8 billion by 2030, at a CAGR of 2.3% during the forecast period. Factors such as the versatile nature of nuclear power and the relative advantages of SMRs such as modularization and factory construction are enabling the growth of the market.

""Small modular reactors (SMRS) are defined as nuclear reactors generally 300 MWe equivalent or less, designed with modular technology using module factory fabrication, pursuing economies of series production and short construction times,"" according to the World Nuclear Association. The ability of SMRS to meet the requirements of flexible power generation for a wide range of applications, such as power generation, process heating, desalination, hydrogen production, industrial applications, and replacing ageing fossil fuel fired power plants, has increased demand for them.

In 2022, the Asia Pacific dominated the global small modular reactor market, followed by Europe and Americas. The region, by country, has been segmented into the China, Japan, India, South Korea, and the Rest of Asia Pacific. Due to the enormous number of SMR projects in China, Asia Pacific is a big contributor to the small modular reactor industry in the current environment. SMRs have the potential to replace coal- and other fossil-fuel-fired power stations in the region for power production and process heat applications, which will likely promote the expansion of the regional small modular reactor market.

The upto 100 MW segment by power rating is expected to be the third-largest growing segment of the small modular reactor market. The reactor unit can be built in a factory and delivered to the site of installation. Because of the modular construction, many SMR units can be deployed together to satisfy varied energy demands. A 100 MW SMR's major use is electricity generating. It may function as a stand-alone power plant, supplying clean and dependable electricity to cities, industries, and isolated regions. The excess heat generated by a 100 MW SMR can be used for district heating, which involves distributing thermal energy to surrounding residential, commercial, and institutional buildings for space heating and water heating.

The gases segment by coolant is projected to be the fastest growing segment of the small modular reactor market. During operation, the gas-cooled reactor uses helium as a coolant medium, allowing it to be easily pressurized and maintain a stable high temperature, allowing for greater operational efficiency. Using gas as a medium in the reactor can prevent corrosion on the reactor's surfaces, reducing the need for maintenance. These operational advantages are propelling the gases segment forward. Graphite is used as a neutron moderator in gas-cooled reactors, and carbon dioxide gas is used as a coolant.

The light-water reactors segment by type is projected to be the fastest growing segment of the small modular reactor market. In 2022, the light water reactor category accounted for 40.6% of the small modular reactor market. These reactors, which use common water as a coolant, are the most widely used since they pose the fewest technological dangers. SMR designs based on LWR technology are similar to large-scale LWRs in use today. Such SMRS employ well-tested technologies and products with small and integrated components and higher passive safety measures over current big scale LWRS. Light-water SMRS have a better level of technological readiness than other SMB designs. Because traditional LWR technology is well-developed, these reactors provide fewer hurdles to present licencing processes. Most regulators are familiar with the technology, resulting in a relatively short learning curve for both regulatory bodies and designers in light water reactors. In the case of a Pressurised Water Reactor (PWR), this is done after the safety rods have been lowered and unlatched.

The hydrogen generation segment by application is projected to be the forth-largest growing segment of the small modular reactor market. Hydrogen is essential in a variety of industrial applications. It can help with the decarbonization of electricity and transportation by being used for energy storage or as a fuel for hydrogen fuel-cell cars, trains, ships, and aeroplanes. Hydrogen can be produced using the fast neutron reactor, molten salt reactor, and high-temperature reactor technologies. The type of reactor technology influences the choice of hydrogen technologies to be combined with the SMRS. Only electricity is required for a few hydrogen manufacturing systems, such as traditional electrolysis. In contrast, methods such as thermochemical cycles may just require process heat, whereas hybrid technologies, such as high-temperature steam electrolysis (HTSE) and hybrid thermochemical cycles, require both heat and electricity.

Europe is expected to grow at the second-highest CAGR during the forecast period. Russia, the United Kingdom, France, and the rest of Europe are all considered in the European small modular reactor market. Italy, Luxembourg, Denmark, the Czech Republic, Sweden, Ukraine, Finland, Estonia, Poland, and Romania are included in the rest of Europe. Nuclear energy accounts for around 28.4% of the region's electricity generation mix, according to the BP Statistical Review of World Energy 2022. The region was responsible for 30.2% of global nuclear power usage. Investments in SMRS development, as well as a trend towards the usage of clean energy to address climate change, are expanding the potential for SMRS deployment in this region. For instance, the government dedicated USD 298 million to SMRS in 2021 as part of the UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) Low-Cost Nuclear (LCN) programme in November 2020. UKRI offered an initial match financing of USD 23 million to the UK SMR consortium lead by Rolls-Royce in November 2019 for the development of a conceptual SMR design. Rosatom (Russia) announced intentions to invest USD 7 billion in new nuclear technology by 2030 in June 2021.

By Pam Radtke/Floodlight | This story was originally published by Floodlight.

In the early 2000s, a long-time Louisiana engineer and entrepreneur thought it would be natural for the oil and gas industry in the Gulf of Mexico to expand into offshore wind. The industry could use the same workforce, the same shipyards and possibly even the same platforms to generate renewable power.

With designs, data and offshore leases from Texas, Herman Schellstede and his team planned to build a 62-turbine wind farm off Galveston's coast -- one of the first such proposals in the United States and the first in the Gulf of Mexico.

The team approached banks and even Koch Industries seeking financing for the $300 million wind farm, he said. But financing nascent offshore wind was apparently too risky a proposition in the wake of the 2008 financial meltdown. The wind farm was eventually scuttled.

""We were still too early,"" said Schellstede, the Louisiana oil and gas entrepreneur who is still designing offshore wind turbines for proposed projects in the gulf.

Now, 33 years after the first offshore wind farm was built in waters off Denmark, it's still unclear if the time is right -- or will ever be right -- for the United States. In those years, only four wind farms generating 242 megawatts of power have been built off the U.S. coast; the largest just went into service in 2024.

Last year, inflation, supply chain problems and other macroeconomic issues led to the cancellation or renegotiation of about half of all proposed offshore wind projects. And while the Biden Administration is moving as quickly as possible to approve new lease sales and projects -- expanding the amount of power generated by 10-fold -- former President Donald Trump has promised to end offshore wind if elected.

The industry and advocates, however, do not seem daunted. Studies show offshore wind could meet 5% of the nation's energy needs by 2035, and up to 25% by 2050.

""We're all in this room today, not because we just see offshore wind as a massive opportunity -- which it is to build you clean energy -- but also we see the necessity of offshore wind,"" said Amanda Lefton, vice president of offshore development for the renewable energy company RWE.

Lefton, speaking at an April conference of the offshore wind industry in New Orleans, said the technology is needed to meet national and state decarbonization goals. RWE is developing projects off the East Coast and California and working to create a supply chain for offshore wind in the Gulf of Mexico with a large Louisiana-based coalition.

""We know the fundamentals exist in these markets,"" said Lefton, the former head of the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management who leads RWE's East Coast operations. ""We know that it's not an if, it's a when.""

Offshore wind's rocky history

In the years since Schellestede's wind project proposal, the industry has moved forward in fits and starts. In 2016, the small scale 30-megawatt Block Island Wind Farm off the coast of Rhode Island became the first U.S. offshore wind project to be completed.

Cape Wind, the first large-scale offshore wind project in the United States off the shores of Massachusetts, was canceled the following year after 16 years of controversy.

In 2020, a 12-MW pilot project -- the first in federally controlled waters -- came online off Virginia's coast.

So far this year, the industry has made historic progress as South Fork Wind Farm off New York began producing 132 MW of electricity, and Massachusetts' Vineyard Wind started spinning the first five of 62 turbines, sending 68 MW of power to the grid. At full operation, the wind farm is designed to generate 805 MW.

By contrast, worldwide there are almost 73,000 MW, or 73 gigawatts, of offshore wind operating, with half of that amount off China's coast.

Some of the delay in the U.S. industry occurred during Donald Trump's presidency. His administration held no offshore lease sales for federally owned waters. Trump ordered an environmental review for the Atlantic Coast, killing or delaying projects in various states of development.

As he did in his May 12 speech in New Jersey, Trump often repeats the falsehood that offshore wind is killing whales -- a claim dismissed by the federal government's own scientists. But groups funded by or tied to oil and gas interests including the American Petroleum Institute continue to perpetuate it, insisting offshore wind also harms fisheries and tourism.

""There is zero evidence for offshore wind activities causing whale deaths,"" said Helen Rose Patterson, senior campaign manager with National Wildlife Federation's offshore wind energy program. Patterson calls the claims ""disinformation,"" or false information that is intentionally spread.

She said the greatest threat to the whales is climate change, which offshore wind could help mitigate. North American right whales now must travel farther north to hunt their cold water prey, Patterson said, putting them closer to ships and fishing that put them at risk. ""The North Atlantic right whales are in different places because of climate change.""

Biden pushes to revive industry

When Joe Biden took office in 2021, he ordered a 180-degree turn on federal offshore wind policy.

During his first year in office, the Democrat established a target to deploy 30 GW of offshore wind -- the equivalent of about 30 new nuclear plants -- by 2030 to help reach his national climate goal of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.

So far, the administration has approved 10 GW of offshore projects and is expected to approve more by the end of the year in what some observers see as a rush to get more wind farms started in the event Trump wins the November election.

At the Oceantic Network conference in New Orleans, Interior Secretary Deb Haaland announced 12 offshore wind leasing sales over the next five years, ranging from New York to Hawaii and the Gulf of Mexico to the state of Oregon. Biden previously announced $5 billion in federally issued loan guarantees to boost offshore wind development.

Offshore political winds shift in Texas

Although Schellstede and his company, Wind Energy Systems Technology (WEST), failed to get interest for the project in Louisiana, Texas welcomed them. Texas saw offshore wind as a way to expand on its extensive energy resources, state officials said at the time.

Texas wasn't the only entity aiming to diversify. Big oil companies including Shell and BP and other international oil interests began adding wind to their own portfolios. In fact, the two oil giants were major sponsors of the offshore wind conference in New Orleans.

""It's not greenwashing,"" said Patterson of the oil majors investing in offshore wind. ""I'm much more concerned about oil and gas that aren't doing anything to diversify their portfolios.""

Since WEST tried to establish a wind farm off Galveston nearly 20 years ago, top Texas officials have become resistant to offshore wind energy. Last year, Texas Railroad Commissioner Wayne Christian told Gov. Greg Abbott that he opposes offshore wind, calling it a ""taxpayer boondoggle"" and repeating the false claims about offshore wind causing whale deaths.

The Texas land commissioner followed with her own opposition to the Biden Administration's plan to lease federal land off the state's coast for offshore wind. And the powerful Texas Public Policy Foundation, funded by conservative billionaires including oil baron Charles Koch, is leading offshore opposition along the East Coast.

Economically, it is also hard for more expensive offshore wind to compete with the abundance of renewable energy that Texas already has. Currently, Texas can supply 70% of its electricity demand through renewable power. The cost of offshore wind over the lifespan of the project, or levelized cost of energy, is up to double that of onshore wind -- but is cheaper than coal or nuclear power.

'Energy state' Louisiana eyes offshore

In Louisiana, even the most conservative Republicans have come to see things the way Schellstede did in the 2000s -- that Louisiana has the workforce, the industrial infrastructure and the knowledge to spur offshore wind, not only off the state's Gulf Coast, but around the country.

On May 11, the day before Trump said he would end offshore wind, House majority leader and Trump supporter U.S. Rep. Steve Scalise, R-Louisiana, watched as his wife Jennifer christened the nation's first offshore wind service vessel. Scalise has been a vocal supporter of the industry.

""I think in terms of contrast -- that really represented the opportunity that I see in Louisiana,"" said Jenny Netherton, Louisiana program manager for the nonprofit Southeastern Wind Coalition, who attended the christening in New Orleans.

""People think of us as an oil and gas state, and we are just an energy state,"" Netherton said. ""Because of offshore oil and gas, we have developed this huge vessel industry that is needed for offshore wind. We can build a lot -- and pretty quickly.""

The christened vessel, the Eco Edison, was commissioned by Danish wind developer Orsted and built by Louisiana's Edison Chouest Offshore. The vessel will service offshore wind in the Atlantic.

A recent report released at the conference by the Southeastern Wind Coalition, Greater New Orleans Inc., the Center for Planning Excellence and The Pew Charitable Trusts found there are 450 companies in Louisiana with the potential to shift toward offshore wind. Fifteen companies in the state already work on offshore wind, including Gulf Island Fabrication, which made the steel structures that support the turbines and other equipment for the Block Island wind farm.

""Louisiana can lead in wind power the same way it has led in oil and gas production,"" Lacy McManus, executive director of future energy for Greater New Orleans Inc., said in announcing the report.

Louisiana's former Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards set a goal of 5,000 MW of offshore wind by 2035. The state has leased its own land under nearshore waters to Vestas and Diamond Offshore Wind for potential development. And in last year's federal sale, RWE leased an offshore parcel in southwest Louisiana. Both projects are still in early stages of development.

It's unclear whether Republican Gov. Jeff Landry supports Edwards' goals; so far the governor, who took office in January, has said nothing publicly about offshore wind. His office did not return a request asking for the governor's position.

""While I have not spoken with Gov. Landry personally, we have heard that he favors the 'all of the above' energy approach,"" Camille Manning-Broome, CEO and president for the nonprofit Center for Planning Excellence in Baton Rouge, told Floodlight. ""Our work with state agency partners does lend itself to continuing this approach of bringing additional sources of energy to the gulf and diversifying our energy portfolio.""

Headwinds to offshore remain

Joshua Basseches is an assistant professor at Tulane University in New Orleans whose work focuses on energy and climate policy and politics. Basseches said he expects disinformation campaigns, like those on the East Coast around whales, along with opposition from the regional fishing industry, might make offshore wind in the Gulf of Mexico difficult.

Others are skeptical of the economics. It will be harder for offshore wind power to compete against the region's favored natural gas power plants, which produce lower cost energy. And building offshore wind farms in the Gulf of Mexico might be more expensive and less efficient than those being built elsewhere because of the risks of hurricanes and its relatively lower wind speeds.

""It doesn't really make a lot of sense,"" BloombergNEF analyst Chelsea Jean-Michel told Heatmap last year. The company, which researches the technologies driving the transition to a lower-carbon economy, confirmed in an email to Floodlight its opinion about the feasibility of offshore wind in the Gulf of Mexico has not changed.

""It's got to be economic. It has to produce the power at a low cost,"" Schellstede agreed. ""It will be interesting to see how this all settles out.""",renewableenergyworld.com,news,Renewable Energy World,,0.05882352941176472,454788467,4,https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/eco_edison.jpg,eng-9603774

It will give users hands-on experience with producing sustainable fuels for ocean-going cargo ships, aircraft, trucks, and heavy industry.

The education and research facility will be located in GreenLab, which houses the world's first green and circular industrial park. Here, DTU and other Danish universities are engaged in developing and demonstrating methods for solving some of the climate challenges faced by Denmark and the rest of the world.

""Getting access to a physical training and research facility in Power-to-X is s a game-changer for both our students and researchers. The facility enables us to create an attractive education and research environment in Skive, where we can equip the engineers of tomorrow to meet global challenges in the green transition. It means that we can help educate more engineers for the whole of Denmark,"" says DTU Senior Vice President Carsten Orth Gaarn-Larsen.

From black to green transport

The education and research facility consists of an advanced electrolysis module from Green Hydrogen Systems, which develops and manufactures electrolysis facilities (electrolysers).

In GreenLab, the electrolysis facility will function in an interaction between electricity generated by wind and solar energy as well as batteries and be a mini version of the future facilities located in Denmark and the rest of the world.

Green fuels like Power-to-X will, in fact, play a significant role in constructing a 100 per cent renewable energy system in the future. The technology can be used to convert electricity from sun and wind into hydrogen or hydrogen-based substances such as ammonia, methanol, and methane.

""Our new Power-to-X facility for testing and training gives DTU's researchers and students a unique opportunity to gain practical hydrogen production experience. Green hydrogen is a key prerequisite for converting heavy transport from black to green, and, at GreenLab, we're proud to be the place where you can gain hands-on experience in new green technologies by testing them in practice,"" says Ebbe Kruse Vestergaard, Research Director at GreenLab.

An important piece in understanding energy systems

Although Power-to-X technology is not new, it is an innovation to integrate the technology in an energy system in a smart approach to up-scaling and cost-effectiveness. With the electrolysis facility in GreenLab, students and researchers can collect data and, among other activities, test how flexible the electrolysis facility is and what the relationship is between electricity, heat, and hydrogen production. This knowledge can be used to find answers to a number of questions, including how best to design and control an electrolysis facility, and how the interaction is between the individual energy system elements.

It is an important piece of the puzzle in understanding our overall energy system. The plant in GreenLab will also supplement DTU's energy laboratory PowerLabDK. Here, students and researchers can use Power-to-X facilities to test how best to link the different parts of the energy system. Jacob Østergaard, Professor at DTU Wind, explains:

""We don't have a sufficient understanding of the Power-to-X technology and its properties. It's therefore essential that we learn more about how an electrolysis facility works as an integrated part of an energy system. Today, we analyse the future energy system based on models of different types of facilities. These models are completely dependent on the data you feed into them. And there are actually only a few of them which are based on realistic facilities with real verified data, making in crucial to have access to a facility like the one in GreenLab.""

Great potential for DTU's students

Søren Linderoth, Head of Department at DTU Energy, also sees great potential in the education and research facility. For example, he envisions that it can be included in the digital education Bachelor of Technology programme, where students work with Power-to-X as a recurring theme.

Another obvious option is a continuing education programme, a so-called flexible Master's programme with focus on Power-to-X. This study programme originates from a wish from the industry and has been composed and prepared by an advisory committee under Danish Center for Energy Storage (DaCES), where DTU collaborates with Aalborg University, Aarhus University, the University of Southern Denmark and companies like Topsoe and Vestas, says Søren Linderoth:

""It will be very exciting if DTU's students are given the opportunity to see, measure, and analyse data, and perhaps even be allowed to change parameters for the functioning facility. Finally, in the short term, we will also have a much higher proportion of part-time MSc graduates who may be able to benefit from using the facility. This could, for example, be in connection with the Master of Science (MSc) programme Sustainable Energy Technology, where it will be both useful and rewarding for the MSc students to test theories and experiments in practice.""",indiaeducationdiary.in,news,"India Education,Education News India,Education News  | India Education Diary",,0.3568627450980393,454782402,16,https://indiaeducationdiary.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/denmark.jpg?w=640,

According to data from the Energy Institute (2023), almost half of the energy consumed in the country (49%) comes from renewable sources. In terms of electricity generation, Brasil's electricity matrix is dominated by hydroelectricity, solar energy, wind power, biofuels, biomass and geothermal energy. In an exclusive article for the G20 Brasil website, André Leão, a researcher at the Institute for Strategic Studies in Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels (Instituto de Estudos Estratégicos de Petróleo, Gás Natural e Biocombustíveis - INEEP) and PhD in Political Science from the Institute of Social and Political Studies at Rio de Janeiro State University (IESP-UERJ), assesses the opportunities that Brazilian leadership in important global forums can bring so that funding for energy transitions can reach countries in the Global South.

The status of Brasil as the current president of the G20 gives the country the challenge of leading discussions on a series of crucial issues for the future of global society: trade and investment, digital transformations, finance and infrastructure, food and nutritional security and, above all, climate change and the energy transition.

These last two issues have been particularly relevant to the foreign policy of President Lula's government, which has spared no effort to host COP 30, to be held in 2025 in the city of Belém. Encouraging other countries to transform the world's energy matrix to make it ever cleaner is an important challenge for Brasil. However, playing this role will allow the country to make a significant contribution to decarbonizing national economies and combating ongoing climate change.

Brazilian capacity to lead energy transition efforts is based on government programs and incentives, legal drafts, engagement in international arrangements involving clean energy production and on data about the country's energy matrix. The New Growth Acceleration Program (Novo Programa de Aceleração do Crescimento - PAC) - an investment program coordinated by the Brazilian government, with the support of states, municipalities, social movements and the private sector - for example, stipulated an investment of BRL 417.5 billion (around USD 82 billion) in energy transition actions from 2023 to 2026, a period in which BRL 20.9 billion (around USD 4.1 billion) is also expected to be spent on the development of low-carbon fuels.

The Brazilian government has also forwarded to the National Congress a series of measures for the energy sector. ""E30"", for example, changes the maximum percentage of ethanol in gasoline from 27% to 30% and also includes regulations on carbon capture and storage. Also noteworthy is the Inova Energia Plan, which consists of an initiative by the Brazilian National Bank for Economic and Social Development (Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento Econômico e Social brasileiro - BNDES) to foster the technological development of renewable energy production chains such as solar and wind power.

Internationally, Brasil, together with India and the United States, has built the Global Biofuels Alliance, with the aim of expanding consumption of this energy source by consolidating a global market. During the United Nations Climate Change Conference in 2023, COP 28, Brasil joined the Global Offshore Wind Alliance - launched by Denmark, by the International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena) and by the Global Wind Energy Council - with the aim of exchanging good practices and policies and expanding installed capacity in the sector.

The Brazilian energy matrix is already one of the cleanest in the world. According to data from the Energy Institute (2023), although oil consumption still exceeds 30% of the total, the country consumes 49% renewable energy, compared to 51% non-renewable. As far as electricity generation is concerned, the figures show Brasil's leadership in the use of renewable sources. Currently, the electricity matrix is dominated by hydroelectricity, solar, wind, biofuels, biomass, geothermal and others, which account for approximately 87% of the total, as can be seen in Graph 1 below:

The emphasis on biofuels is justified by Brasil's great expertise in the sector. According to information from the Energy Institute (2023), the country is currently the second largest producer of biofuels in the world, with a share of more than 21% of the total, behind only the United States, which has around 38%. According to the Ten-Year Energy Expansion Plan 2032 (Plano Decenal de Expansão de Energia 2032), an informative document from the Brazilian government, long-term expectations for the sector are positive. Projections indicate a growth of 4.1% in the offer of biofuels and 6.6% in demand over a ten-year period (2022-2032), which could boost the international market and be a benefit to Brasil.

In the run up to its presidency of the G20, Brasil signed the Work Plan for Energy Acceleration with the International Energy Agency (IEA). Within the framework of the group of the world's largest economies, the country, through the Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME), has the mission of coordinating the Energy Transitions Working Group, which is structured on the basis of three main themes:

i) accelerating efforts to finance the energy transition;

ii) emphasizing the social dimension in order to promote a fair and inclusive transition;

iii) developing sustainable fuel markets.

These issues represent important challenges for Brazilian diplomacy, particularly the need to allocate a greater volume of resources to finance the transition of countries in the Global South, whose energy matrices are still largely dominated by fossil sources. Although investments in clean energy have increased by 17% in 2023, reaching USD 1.8 trillion - according to data from the Bloomberg NEF Report ""Energy Transition Investment Trends 2024"" - this amount needs to increase annually to USD 4.8 trillion from 2024 to 2030, in order to adopt a trajectory that guarantees net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050.

In other words, one of the central missions of Brasil will be to come up with solutions on how to deconcentrate investments. After all, a fair and inclusive energy transition must take into account the heterogeneity of the energy systems in the various regions of the world. The transformation of the energy matrixes of developing and less relatively developed countries depends on the support from developed countries and requires a diversification of funding sources.

The Brazilian experience in the biofuels sector can contribute to increasing the use of ethanol globally and lead to its transformation into sustainable hydrogen, which could also be created from wind and solar energy, generating yet another source of clean energy. Finally, through its government, Brasil has the capacity to lead the energy transition, using its great potential in new technological routes and its diplomatic experience to foster multilateral cooperation, promoting sustainable fuel markets and ensuring energy security.

Financing hydrogen production in Emerging Markets and Developing Countries (EMDC) is an even bigger one, yet vitally important for supplying richer nations with hydrogen while creating new industries in the EMDC. This month, the World Bank Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP) together with the Government of the Netherlands and Invest International organised a Financing Forum during the World Hydrogen summit in Rotterdam. The Forum brought together a diverse group of stakeholders, including project developers, development financing institutions, commercial banks, and investors. Carolina Lopez Rocha, Dolf Gielen and Chandrasekar Govindarajalu at the World Bank Group summarise the insights and conclusions of the discussions. They look at the risks and risk mitigation strategies essential for financing hydrogen projects. Governments, investors, banks and insurers all have a role to play, as do the wide range of tools available to them from incentives and subsidies through to concessionary financing. Some lessons can be learned from the European and H2Global auction schemes, but risks are much higher for EMDC. And unanswered questions still remain (e.g. will genuine demand going forward match hydrogen production ambitions), adding to the risks. It's why the World Bank has created the ""10 GW Lighthouse Initiative"" to drive progress in renewable hydrogen project development in EMDC, say the authors.

World Bank, OECD, Hydrogen Council and Global Infrastructure Facility highlighted in their joint report Scaling Hydrogen Financing for Development a pressing issue: Emerging Markets and Developing Countries (EMDC) need approximately US$ 100 billion annually for hydrogen investments between now and 2030. Around half of that amount is for renewable power generation. Electrolysers, downstream processing and enabling infrastructure account for the remainder.

Despite the growing recognition of the clean hydrogen potential to help achieve Paris targets, the current investment levels are far below what is required. BNEF has calculated that out of total global energy transition investments of US$ 1,769 billion, clean hydrogen investments amounted to US$10.4 billion in 2023, primarily in USA, Europe and China. Inclusion of the renewable energy component for hydrogen production could triple this figure but it is still a small share of total energy transition investments and an order of magnitude below EMDC investment needs. Thus, investment volumes fall short.

Clean hydrogen can be categorised into two main types: low-carbon hydrogen and renewable hydrogen. Low-carbon hydrogen is produced from natural gas with carbon capture and storage (CCS), whereas renewable hydrogen is produced from water electrolysis using renewable power sources like wind or solar energy. It is expected that renewable hydrogen will account for the major share. However, despite its environmental benefits, renewable hydrogen remains more expensive to produce than conventional hydrogen. This cost disparity poses a significant challenge for its widespread adoption and underscores the need for innovative financing solutions.

The production costs are determined by the capital intensity of the projects and the cost of financing. Our rule-of-thumb is 1-10-20-30: a million tonne per year of renewable hydrogen production capacity requires 10 GW electrolysers capacity, 20 GW renewable power and US$ 30 billion of investments.

Developing quality projects takes time. This was discussed in the forum. For example, the selected bidders participating in the H2Global's pilot tender asked for more time than originally anticipated to submit their final bids. The quality and maturity of today's projects varies widely, and this impacts the speed at which renewable hydrogen can be rolled out.

The production cost of renewable hydrogen is a critical factor in its economic viability. Currently, the production cost stands at around US$3 per kilogram in the very best locations, which is three times the cost of conventional hydrogen production in good locations.

Average cost are considerably higher, as witnessed by the recent European auction results with LCOH of 5.3 to 5.8 EUR/kg (6 US$/kg) in Greece, Sweden and Spain and 11 to 13.5 EUR/kg (12 US$/kg) in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany and Poland. The competitiveness of renewable hydrogen varies widely by country and even by location and it is influenced by factors such as natural gas prices and the availability of subsidies.

Conventional hydrogen production costs are determined by the natural gas price. Whereas natural gas feedstock costs 2 USD/GJ in the USA, the price is 8-15 USD/GJ in Europe or Japan. The geographical spread of successful European offers in the recent Hydrogen Bank auction reflects the importance of renewable resource quality for the production cost.

Also, subsidies and tax breaks can impact the project economics and production cost of renewable hydrogen substantially. In the US up to 3 US$/kg tax breaks will be provided for renewable hydrogen production, though the specific rules that apply are still debated. Globally around US$ 350 billion in hydrogen subsidies have been announced, according to BNEF. These subsidies are dominated by OECD countries and China.

Other EMDC do not have the same budgetary space. It is therefore no surprise that EMDC projects with Final Investment Decision (FID) account for less than 1 Mt annual production (Figure 1). According to the Hydrogen Council and McKinsey, 234 projects are in preparation in EMDCs, with LAC leading, followed by MENA, China, Africa and India. The size and the project types vary widely.

Policies and regulations can impact the project investment needs. For example, hourly matching of renewable power supply and electrolysers operation requires the deployment of a mix of renewables including more costly supply options and possibly investments in electricity storage, or it can impact the number of operating hours of the electrolysers. Spatial matching of renewable power generation and electrolysis may require investments into more costly supply options. For example, offshore wind is twice as expensive as onshore wind, and onshore wind in good locations is again twice as expensive as solar PV per kWh of electricity produced. Further amendments and clarifications to the rules and regulations could improve uptake.

Technology cost reduction will be critical to reduce hydrogen production cost. Chinese alkaline electrolysers sell at 962-1113 USD/1000 m3 (around 200 US/kW), PEM at roughly three times that price. Comparable uninstalled US PEM price is currently US$ 1000/kW, twice as much for installed systems. In the current geopolitical climate such differences may give rise to protectionism as countries vie for manufacturing market share. However innovation is another way to close the cost cap and accelerate renewable hydrogen deployment. The US government plans to drive the cost of PEM electrolysers to a quarter of their current cost within two years, targeting an uninstalled capital cost of US$250/kW for PEM by 2026 and US$100/kW by 2029-2036.

Renewable power costs determine renewable hydrogen costs. The capital intensity of wind and solar in combination with increasing financing costs have increased Power Purchasing Agreement prices in recent years. Whereas wind has seen significant cost increases as basic materials such as steel have increased in price, the cost of solar PV panels has continued to fall. In quarter one of 2024, PPA prices in Europe declined again by 5%. Further cost reductions will be critical. Falling electrolyser cost may allow in the future a daytime only operation mode so low-cost solar PV can become the main energy source. Limited opportunities exist elsewhere to deploy low-cost surplus hydropower, for example in the case of Paraguay.

In conclusion a wait-and-see approach will not get us the hydrogen deployment that we need. We also need learning-by-doing, which requires active support for initial projects and upscaling. And we need continued innovation to drive down technology costs.

Renewable hydrogen projects are very capital intensive and have limited operating costs (if the renewable power supply is included in the project scope). The high CAPEX results in large upfront financing needs. As a consequence, the cost of financing is a critical factor that has a large impact on the production cost. The following discussion will focus on this specific factor.

Two types of projects can be identified: those that are on the books of large companies (corporate financing) and those that deploy a special purpose vehicle (SPV). An SPV is a subsidiary created by a parent company to isolate financial risk. This structure is widely used for energy projects and is considered the preferred approach for hydrogen projects. SPV's economic and financial viability depends on the revenue stream and the offtake contract is therefore critical. However, SPVs require higher returns due to the perceived risks including those associated with new technologies and the nascent hydrogen sector.

Any new technology is considered risky and therefore faces elevated cost of financing. This is reflected in the debt-equity ratio that tends to be lower for new technologies. Whereas a solar PV project may be financed with 90% debt and 10% equity, a hydrogen project may require a 60% debt and 40% equity ratio. Equity is considerably more expensive than debt because of the elevated risk in terms of variable returns and the potential loss of the invested funds in case of default. Yet a minimum share of equity is determined by the project capability to meet debt servicing requirements from the revenue stream. In a developing country context debt may be priced at 8-10% while equity is priced at twice the price at 15-20%. A much higher cost of debt can occur in case of economic or political instability: the yield on sovereign bonds - generally seen as a lower bound for the cost of debt - can rise to 50% in countries that face a financial crisis.

Risks can be split into country specific risks common to all large infrastructure projects in EMDC and unique hydrogen specific risks. A renewable hydrogen project is especially sensitive to country risk because of its capital intensity. Once a hydrogen project is established, it is very costly to walk away or stop operating. The sensitivity to country specific risk factors is thus high. Guarantees can be deployed to reduce country risks. This is a well-established practice in other sectors.

Most early hydrogen projects have some kind of government involvement. EMDC government loan default rates have mostly been in the range of 2-4%, indicating the risks of lending to emerging markets are low. Moreover, recovery rates for private lenders in case of default were 74.7% between 1994 and 2022.

Most of the residual risks beyond the overall country risk are policy derived. Governments can mitigate such risks, using concessional financing or budget resources, through offtake agreements, demand guarantees, regulatory policy guarantees etc. But the prevalence of such structures is rare. A key explanation is that the guarantee needed to leverage the private sector is expensive.

Several risks influence the cost of capital for clean hydrogen projects. These specific risks centre on engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) overruns, offtake default, technology nonperformance, withdrawal of regulatory incentives, and exchange rates. Implementing cost-effective and efficient de-risking mechanisms could substantially decrease the weighted average cost of capital, making projects economically viable, which will accelerate their deployment and reduce the financing gap.

During the Finance Forum, commercial banks reported their participation in the syndicated loans for NEOM in Saudi Arabia an H2GreenSteel in Sweden, two large renewable hydrogen projects that have reached FID. The syndication spreads out risks allowing a large number of financing institutions to get comfortable with hydrogen projects. The World Bank and OECD have performed a robust market sounding among financiers and developers around the world to map the main risks hindering the financing for clean hydrogen projects in EMDCs. The results show the prevalence of six subcategories of risks. In order of priority: offtake risks stand out, followed by equally weighted political and regulatory risks; infrastructure risks; permitting risks; technology risks; and finally macroeconomic risks. The lower sub-categories of risks are: design, construction and completion risks; operational and maintenance risks; and supply risks. In today's nascent clean hydrogen industry, the degree of a particular project's risk largely depends on the actors involved. Evaluating the credit rating, experience, and credibility of project sponsors, engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contractors, primary technology providers, and offtakers must feature prominently in any risk assessment. As such, it is critical that EMDC governments select reputable partners.

How risks translate into cost of financing is not entirely clear. Data for individual projects and the risk calculation behind such projects are usually confidential and there is no uniform methodology to assess risk. Financial ratings of companies and countries provide some guidance but are not always available or directly applicable. More transparency regarding financing costs can help to drive costs down.

Risk mitigation mechanisms can help large-scale clean hydrogen projects in EMDC achieve financial viability. Policy de-risking mechanisms aim at removing the root causes of risks through policy measures. They include instruments to support institutional capacity building, local skills development, the implementation of relevant laws, and the management of infrastructure assets. Financial de-risking mechanisms deploy financial measures to avoid or reduce project risk.

Governments of EMDC can collaborate with development finance institutions to devise and implement a wide spectrum of financial de-risking instruments for clean hydrogen projects, tailored to the needs and characteristics of each country. Such instruments include partial credit guarantees, partial risk guarantees, political risk insurance, liquidity reserve accounts, and local currency support.

Export credit agencies have traditionally guaranteed investments abroad and have already played a role in first projects such as NEOM in Saudi Arabia. The Dutch government commented during the Finance Forum that there is an intent to change the Dutch Export Credit Agency (ECA, Atradius) rule so having Netherlands as a target market for exports will be sufficient for the Dutch ECA to cover non-OECD risks.

Also, insurers can provide technology performance insurances and have already done so for electrolysers. They can also insure against natural disasters.

Whereas such guarantees and insurances can help to reduce the financing needs, this is not a panacea. For example, a balance needs to be struck between financing cost reductions and the cost of the risk mitigation instruments. For example, MIGA political risk insurance and credit enhancement for cross-border private sector investors and lenders is particularly relevant for investments in countries with specific credit rating.

Finally, there is a need to consider proper risk allocation. Project partners and stakeholders may play a specific role, for example in terms of offtake risk guarantee, technology performance risk and EPC wrap.

A key insight from the Rotterdam World Hydrogen Summit was that demand falls short. The Hydrogen Council presented that implementation of today's announced incentives will yield 3-7 Mt hydrogen demand while demand side policy targets add up to 27 Mt hydrogen demand. Private sector players commented during the Summit that the realisation of 20 Mt hydrogen demand in Europe seems unlikely. This puts the European 10 Mt import target into jeopardy. Given the preference for low-cost and low-carbon hydrogen in Korea and Japan - ideally from subsidised US production - this raises the question who will buy EMDC renewable hydrogen from projects that target exports.

Whereas focus is on the cost side, the revenue generated is also key for economic performance. This revenue stream depends on the offtake contract. The first European Hydrogen Bank auction has shown impressively that favorable offtake opportunities exist where even today less than 0.5 EUR/kg subsidies are needed for an economically viable project, with total production cost in the 5-6 Euro range. Some parties are thus willing to pay such an elevated price, which may help to get the market going. A recent announcement of an 'ammonia for shipping' project in Namibia illustrates the key importance of this demand sector for EMDC hydrogen development in the coming years.

H2Global has recently received 3.8 billion euros in additional funding from the German and Dutch governments and will soon launch the first results of its pilot auction. The European Hydrogen Bank relies on the member countries to shape and operationalise imports, using instruments such as H2Global.

In conclusion demand policies need to be strengthened in order to realise the desired hydrogen uptake and foster EMDC production.

One solution that is often touted is blended financing. This comes in four blending archetypes:

Concessional financing is anything below market rates. It is often viewed in Overseas Development Assistance (ODA) terms, although IBRD (World Bank financing), which is often labeled non-concessional, is also below market rates.

Yet the Independent Expert Group on Climate Finance concluded that the use of ""blended finance,"" deployed transaction-by-transaction in a bespoke fashion, has not proven scalable so far. Convergence reports that blended financing totals grew to US$15 billion in 2023, reaching a 5-year high. Commercial financing from DFIs/MDBs grew by 140% to US$4.9 billion in 2023. This is complemented with nearly US$1 billion in ODA, including funds channeled through DFI/MDBs. The use of concessional guarantees and risk insurance is on the rise -- the dollar value of concessional guarantees accounted for 43% of all concessional funding in 2023. The energy sector accounts for nearly one third of deal activity and 47% of total blended capital flows. Much of this investment targets renewable energy development.

The OECD applies a broader blended financing definition and reports thus larger sums. According to the OECD, the two leveraging mechanisms (or archetypes) that mobilised the largest volumes of private capital were direct investment in companies and project finance special purpose vehicles (SPVs) (US$13.8 billion) and guarantees (US$9.8 billion). OECD estimated a total of US$61 billion of blended finance as of 2022.

The World Bank has calculated that private sector investments in infrastructure, or private participation in infrastructure (PPI) in EMDC amounted to US$86 billion in 2023. Energy projects represent a large chunk and energy saw a threefold increase in investment levels in 2023. A fifth of the funding came from DFIs (MBDs, bilateral development agencies, ECAs), and 13 percent from public sources.

According to the Independent Expert Group the non-sovereign arms of MDBs, even with the sweeteners of donor-funded concessional finance, only mobilised 64 cents in private finance per dollar of MDB plus concessional commitments. Historically the leverage ratio of transactions is higher (2.5-5.1) when there is market-rate participation from a DFI or MDB. It is therefore evident that DFIs and MDBs, with their limited asset bases, can only drive blended finance growth so much.

Concessional resources should be used only when they create the virtuous cycle, not to ""compensate"" for bad policies. Also the level of concessionality matters. For example, the World Bank Group follows a rigorous model to ensure minimal concessionality, reducing the likelihood of market distortions.

Official non-concessional finance is the engine for scaling up sustainable development investments in middle-income countries. MDBs are the backbone of the non-concessional official financing architecture, accounting for over 60 percent of the system (around US$100 billion per year). Bilateral agencies are also important but in aggregate account for only one quarter of official non-concessional commitments.

The independent expert group called last year for a larger fraction of concessional assistance to be channeled through MDBs. MDBs should provide an incremental US$260 billion of the additional annual official financing, of which $200 billion is non-concessional lending, and help mobilise and catalyse most of the associated private finance. MDB concessional financing should grow from US$30 billion in 2019 to US$90 billion in 2030.

These numbers illustrate that US$ 100 billion annual hydrogen investments require a judicious use of scarce concessional financing, and a well-coordinated approach is needed.

It is clear that there is a need for additional concerted action to enable the proper hydrogen role for EMDC. There was a consensus during the Finance Forum that stakeholders need to cooperate more closely in order to get projects faster to FID. DFIs need to cooperate more closely to mobilise the necessary financing.

Given the finance scarcity and the number of projects in the pipeline, a careful evaluation is needed to identify projects that can reach FID in the coming years, and to design and implement the enabling measures to get them there. This will include the use of various innovative financing instruments. It is critical to learn from best practice, and identify blueprints on how to get there.

The 10 GW Lighthouse initiative, led by the World Bank Group in close cooperation with other Development Financing Institutions, was introduced and discussed during the forum. The goal is to get a significant number of mid-size hydrogen projects in EMDC to FID in the coming years. The proposed steps are illustrated in Figure 2. A similar virtuous cycle has been successfully deployed in the context of the World Bank work in scaling up clean energy to phase down coal.

The journey towards financing hydrogen projects in EMDC is fraught with challenges but also presents significant opportunities. By leveraging innovative financing solutions, de-risking strategies, and international collaboration, it is possible to bridge the financing gap and accelerate the development of clean hydrogen projects.

Fostering mutually beneficial collaboration with local and international partners and promoting knowledge transfer is critical. Better cooperation among MDBs and DFIs can maximise impact, avoid duplication of efforts and ensure complementarity of financial and technical support tools. Establishing partnerships across the entire Power-to-X value chain will accelerate deployment. The 10 GW Lighthouse initiative, along with supportive policies and technological advancements, can play a crucial role in driving the hydrogen economy forward, ensuring that EMDC can participate fully in the global energy transition.",energypost.eu,news,Energy Post,Dolf Gielen,0.05098039215686279,454748637,4,https://energypost.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Energy-Post-180524v6.jpg,eng-9602846

From Aidoghie Paulinus, Abuja

Fiery public speaker and Director, Kenyan School of Law, Professor Patrick Loch Otieno Lumumba, has said Africa cannot be great if Nigeria is not great.

According t him, the democracy of Nigeria will only begin to have meaning when Nigeria provides leadership.

Lumumba made the submission while delivering a lecture titled 'Democracy in Africa: The Legacy of Abdulsalami Abubakar,' organised by The Leadership Scorecard Integrated in Abuja in honour of former Head of State, General Abdulsalami Abubakar, who returned Nigeria to democratic rule in 1999.

Lumumba, former Director of the Kenyan Anti-Corruption Commission, also said in true democracy, those who have the honour and privilege to serve their country must be servants of their people.

He stated that those who have the honour and privilege of serving their country must only have one agenda which is that they must be trustees of the things that they are entrusted with.

He added that those who have the honour and privilege of serving their people will go out there and will be prepared to say that they are prepared to lay down their lives for the benefit of the people.

Lumumba stated that in true democracy, the people want to be told that if there is agriculture, it will be supported and they be able to deliver that they can feed themselves.

He explained that the in true democracy, the people want to be told that they will have good health system so that when they are sick, they will go to hospitals that are hospitals in the true sense of the word and not hospitals built for them and their leaders running away to different parts of the world to seek better medical care.

Lumumba also said the people would not want to see their education system being an education system prepared for them and then the children of those whom they have elected going to different parts of the world.

He disclosed that the people would want to ensure that they have power, particularly the younger generation, they want to ensure that they are enjoying the dividends of artificial intelligence, that governance facilitates them and makes them inventors and innovators and create for them, an environment where they can thrive.

Lumumba asserted that if the aforementioned were not done, young men and women of the continent will be dying in the Mediterranean Sea; they will be humiliated at embassies of foreign countries and those who have the opportunity will run away to go and be engineers in different parts of the world.

He added that if true democracy is not practiced in Nigeria, the young men and women will not have faith in their country and would want to acquire the passports of different countries and will not be proud of democracy.

Lumumba told Abubakar that the democracy he cherished, the democracy he keeps talking about and walking around Africa for, is the democracy that promises Africans that Africa can be great again.

""And Africa must be great again. And Africa will never, ever be great, I submit to you Nigerians, if Nigeria is not great,"" Lumumba said.

Explaining the rationale behind his submission, Lumumba said he arrived at the conclusion because with the population of over 300 million, if Nigeria can be made into a market, who can confront the continent of Africa.

""Who can ignore the continent of Africa? Tell me, where in the world do you not find a Nigerian? Somebody once told me that if you go to any place in the world and you do not find a Nigerian, run away from there because there is nothing to be done in that place.

""I am suggesting that the democracy of Nigeria will only begin to have meaning when Nigeria provides leadership.

""The time is now. As we celebrate democracy in Africa today, I am calling upon Nigeria and Nigerians to rise to the occasion, rise up so that your politics will be a point of reference so that when we watch men and women in the Senate in Nigeria and in the House of Representatives in Nigeria and we watch them debate, they will be debating about the things that relate to Africa; they will be debating about Africa Agenda 2063, they will be debating about Africa Continental Free Trade Area, they will not demand of anybody that wants to come to Nigeria who is an Africa must have a visa. No! Nigeria being as big as it is, should be the welcoming big brother because when you do that, we follow your leadership.

""We want to see a Nigeria that is economically dominant because if Nigeria is strong, then the test of Africa is strong,"" Lumumba also said.

Lumumba further said when he hears occasionally Nigeria saying that it is the second largest and first largest economy in Africa sometimes, he wasn't impressed because when Nigeria had a GDP of 500 billion, he is not impressed.

According to Lumumba, Nigeria ""should have a GDP of $10 trillion then I will be impressed.""

He asserted that this is possible because Nigeria has the human resources and the intellectual wherewithal to ensure that it happens.

""When I hear Nigeria saying that they generate anything between 5,000 and 10,000 megawatts of electricity, I am not impressed. I am not impressed because little Denmark generates 35,000 megawatts of electricity and if Nigeria is to earn the dividends of democracy through industrialisation, Nigeria must now get and embark in the serious business of ensuring that Nigeria has energy to propel not only her and her neighbour, but the continent of Africa into the fourth industrial revolution. Those are the dividends of democracy,"" Lumumba stated.

Lumumba added that he wants to hear that Nigeria is successful because Nigeria can be the defender of democracy in Africa and he wants to hear that when the leaders of Nigeria go to different parts of the world, they are treated with respect because Nigeria has demonstrated economically, politically and diplomatically that they are the dividends of democracy.

""I want to see that when one carries a Nigerian passport, but I hope that there will be an African passport, that our passport will be respected throughout the world. I look forward to those days,"" Lumumba hoped.

In his remarks, Abubakar expressed profound gratitude to the management of Leadership Scorecard Integrated for organizing the important public lecture.

Abubakar said their dedication to promoting dialogue on leadership and democracy is commendable and essential for the nation's continued progress.

He thanked Professor Lumumba, whom he said his work and passion for the advancement of democracy in Africa are truly inspiring, saying that Lumumba's presence underscored the importance of Africans' shared commitment to building a better future for the continent.

Abubakar also said he was deeply humbled by the recognition of his contributions and remained steadfast in his belief that ""Africa's best days are ahead of us.""

""Together, let us forge a legacy of democratic excellence that will inspire generations to come. to come,"" Abubakar said.

Reflecting on the journey towards 25 years unbroken democracy in Nigeria, Abubakar said when he assumed office as the Head of State of Nigeria in June 1998, the nation was at a critical juncture in its chequered history.

Abubakar also said the preceding years had been marked by political turbulence and a yearning for democratic restoration.

He added that the path ahead required not only a vision, but also decisive and principled leadership to navigate the complexities of our national landscape.

""Throughout history, the smooth transfer of power is often celebrated as a significant achievement, yet it marks only the start of a more extensive journey. Personally, I found it crucial to establish a foundation for enduring democratic governance. This entailed nurturing an atmosphere of trust, inclusivity, and adherence to the rule of law. Our administration promptly undertook measures such as releasing political prisoners, lifting restrictions on political activities, and developing an electoral system designed to guarantee free, fair, and transparent elections.

""Our efforts culminated in the successful conduct of the 1999 general elections, which saw the peaceful transfer of power to a democratically elected government. This moment was not merely a milestone for Nigeria, but a beacon of hope for the entire African continent. It demonstrated that with the right leadership, even the most challenging political landscapes could be transformed,"" Abubakar also said.

The former Head of State further said he was deeply honoured to be recognized in this manner, but must emphasize that the work of sustaining peace and promoting democracy is a collective effort that requires the commitment and collaboration of all stakeholders.

""Throughout my tenure as the Military Head of State of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, and in the years that have followed, I have strived to uphold the principles of peace, stability, and democratic governance.

""However, the journey towards democratic consolidation does not end with elections. It requires continuous nurturing and unwavering commitment to the principles of good governance, rule of law, and respect for human rights. As leaders, we must remain vigilant against the encroachment of autocracy and corruption, which threaten the very foundations of our democracies.

""Astute leadership is characterised by the ability to inspire trust, foster unity, and drive development through accountable governance. It demands that we listen to the voices of our citizens, embrace transparency, and uphold justice. In this regard, I have always believed that leadership is not about wielding power, but about serving the people with integrity and dedication. Leaders must fulfil promises they made. Unfulfilled promises bring mistrust and contempt.

""In line with these ideals, I established the Abdulsalami Abubakar Institute for Peace and Sustainable Development Studies in 2002, shortly after transitioning to a democratic government. The Institute addresses the need for innovative, Afro-centric approaches to conflict transformation and development. Its mission is to provide a platform for local, national, and global actors towards promoting peace, security, and development in Africa. The Institute is dedicated to advanced research, dialogue, education, and training in conflict resolution, peacebuilding, environmental sustainability, good governance, and sustainable development.

""Reflecting on the broader African context, we have witnessed remarkable strides in democratic 80vernance across the continent. Countries that once grappled with authoritarian regimes are now flourishing democracies, contributing to regional stability and prosperity, This progress is a testament to the resilience and determination of our people, as well as the transformative impact of visionary leadership.

""Yet, challenges remain. We continue to confront issues such as poverty, inequality, and insecurity, which can undermine our democratic gains. Addressing these challenges requires collaborative efforts and innovative solutions. It is imperative that we strengthen our institutions, invest in education and healthcare and create opportunities for our youths,"" Abubakar further said.

Abubakar added that the legacy of astute leadership and the sustenance of democracy in Africa is a collective endeavour.

""It is a journey that requires the dedication of not only our leader, but also every citizen. As we look to the future, let us reaffirm our commitment to building a continent where democracy thrives, and every individual can achieve their full potential.

""Furthermore, we must recognize the critical role of education and economic empowerment in sustaining democracy. A well-informed and economically stable populace is less susceptible to manipulation and more likely to engage constructively in the democratic process,"" Abubakar stated.",sunnewsonline.com,news,The Sun Nigeria,,0.0980392156862746,454732462,4,https://assets.sunnewsonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/images-3-17.jpg,

The announcement is also not new as parliament endorsed the life extension of coal power plants, which was proposed by the country's Electricity Minister, Dr Kgosientsho Ramokgopa, last year in April. At the time, the country faced its biggest energy crisis where households and businesses faced up to 16 hours of load shedding (blackouts) daily. However, things have improved since then with no load-shedding events in the past two months. This is largely due to a drop in demand for power generated by Eskom as the private sector has started to self-generate and trade electricity at scale since the amendment of Section 2 of the Electricity Regulation Act by the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy (DMRE) in August 2021, which allows the operation of a generation facility with a capacity of up to 100MW without obtaining a licence from the National Energy Regulator of South Africa. It is also due to improved generation performance at Eskom coal power stations.

A 2023 grid survey study carried out by the South African Photovoltaic Industry Association (SAPVIA) and their partners reveals that 13305MW of solar PV and 19572MW of solar PV with battery storage plus 21000MW of wind and 7500MW of wind and storage are 'shovel ready' (construction ready) or close to it.

Specifically, the Eskom board has approved a plan to keep Hendrina, Camden and Grootvlei in use. The ageing plants were scheduled to close leading up to 2030. But the demand for Eskom power is expected to continue to drop leading up to 2030 which should accelerate the closure of ageing coal plants.

""We'll continue some of our coal operations that were earmarked for shutting down. We will review that process on shorter time intervals going to 2030, but we'll place ourselves in a position where we are not made vulnerable by early shutting down of those stations,"" said Marokane.

Also speaking at the event, Eskom's head of generation, Bheki Nxumalo, said that it's critical to run some stations beyond their original shutdown date citing that workers lose focus if the imminent closure of the plant they work in is looming.

New JET plan?

Earlier this month South Africa said that it would provide a new timeline for the shutdown of coal-fired power plants in a bid to ensure the country remains on track to obtain funding under the so-called Just Energy Transition Partnership -- a US$9.3-billion pact with some of the world's richest nations. The new timeline is expected to be presented in next month but a national election held yesterday may usher in a new coalition government which may change things.

""What we are presenting to the CIF is an adjustment to the decommissioning plan linked to an emissions target that we have to achieve,"" said Neil Cole, a finance manager at the Project Management Unit, which is overseeing the JETP for South Africa, within the presidency.

If the proposal is accepted, South Africa will secure $500 million of 10- to 30-year loans with an interest rate of less than 1% and a grace period of eight years from the World Bank-affiliated CIF, Cole said in an interview with Bloomberg.

At COP 26 in November 2021, the governments of South Africa, France, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States of America, along with the European Union, issued a Political Declaration announcing a new ambitious, long-term Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP) with a combined pledge of US$ 8,5 billion in funding. The International Partners Group (IPG) as it is called, aims to accelerate the decarbonisation of South Africa's economy to help it achieve the ambitious goals set out in South Africa's updated Nationally Determined Contribution emissions goals.

Late last year, South Africa's Cabinet approved the Just Energy Transition Implementation Plan, but there has been a pushback from factions within the ruling party. The Secretary General of the ruling ANC party in South Africa, Fikile Mbalula, has slammed the investment partnership offer saying that the pact is responsible for the country's blackouts. South Africa's energy minister, Gwede Mantashe, snubbed a US1 billion green energy MOU announcement with Denmark and The Netherlands. Read more

South Africa's failed decommissioning and repurposing of the Komati coal fired power station which was conducted from the top down instead of the bottom up, does not help matters. The shortcomings has left a bad mark on the country's energy transition. Read more

A 'Just' approach

A 'Just' approach underpins the Plan, aiming to ensure that those most directly affected by a transition from coal - workers and communities including women and girls - are not left behind. It identifies $98 billion in financial requirements over five years to begin South Africa's 20-year energy transition. Investment will be required from both the public and private sectors.

The funding package will be disbursed through various mechanisms over five years including grants, concessional loan investments and risk-sharing instruments. The IPG's funding will align with the Investment Plan and be geared towards coal plant de-commissioning; funding alternative employment in coal mining areas; investments which will facilitate accelerated deployment of renewable energy and investments in new sectors of the green economy.

In November last year, a joint 12-month update to leaders by South Africa and the IPG summarises key technical progress that has contributed to the development of the JETP Investment Plan. It, and the preceding six-month update to leaders, also outline measures undertaken by the government of South Africa to strengthen the enabling environment for South Africa's long-term energy transition.

The IPG's initial $8.5 billion funding package includes:

Some of this funding is already programmed while other parts of it have still to be finalised and programmed in line with the final Investment Plan. Work to programme the full $8.5 billion will continue in the coming months.

In addition to the $8.5 billion, the World Bank Board has recently approved the Eskom Just Energy Transition project which is providing $0.5 billion of financing in support of South Africa's Just Energy Transition.

A real opportunity now exists to for South Africa to take a significant step in its energy transition to cleaner power generation technologies but will the election outcome and political interplay again, delay the implementation?

The French energy giant reckons the 20-turbine development between New Luce and Barrhill will make an important contribution to the supply of low-carbon electricity in Scotland while helping to boost the economy.

The company said its EDF Renewables-UK arm has struck a deal with Tesco under which the retailer will buy a proportion of the windfarm's electricity generation. EDF reckons this would be sufficient to power the equivalent of more than 80 average sized supermarkets for a year.

Glasgow shipyard owner BAE Systems has also signed a power purchase agreement in respect of the output from the windfarm. EDF said this would provide clean energy to power around 40 per cent of BAE Systems' current UK energy demand.

EDF said it is prioritising working with Scottish and local businesses where possible in the development of the windfarm.

It expects to contribute more than £500,000 a year to support local initiatives through a community benefit fund. This could be worth £15m plus over the expected 30-year minimum lifespan of the site.

Plans for a windfarm on the Stranoch site have provoked opposition amid concern about the impact on the area.

Dumfries and Galloway council objected to a previous proposal on the grounds of the cumulative impact of the development. The Scottish Government approved the scheme concerned in 2016. A study completed by the council the same year highlighted the ""considerable amount of windfarm development in Dumfries and Galloway and the continuing demand for larger turbines"".

A spokesperson for EDF said: ""To improve renewable energy generation and the viability of the site, the original layout was revised and a new planning application submitted in October 2018 to the current design."" This won planning consent in 2021.

While Scottish building firms RJ McLeod and I&H Brown will work on the Stranoch site, a significant share of the value of work on the development looks set to go to firms based outside Scotland.

Vestas of Denmark will supply and instal the turbines.

Asked about the potential jobs impact of the windfarm the EDF spokesperson said: ""The site once operational will be managed by our current asset operations team in Scotland.""

EDF will be guaranteed a minimum price for the plant's output under the UK Government's Contracts for Difference programme. The costs of this are added to household energy bills.

EDF said corporate Power Purchase Agreements like those struck with Tesco and BAE Systems allow businesses to buy electricity directly from an energy developer and from a specific site.

Taking place between 21-25 May, the annual flower show saw the 3D printing-enabled garden take center stage alongside a variety of themed outdoor spaces. Called the ""World Child Cancer's Nurturing Garden,"" Giorgi and WASP's entrance was produced in collaboration with the charity World Child Cancer UK and was funded by Project Giving Back.

The team's use of ceramic 3D printing led to the garden receiving the inaugural RHS Environmental Innovation Award. WASP technology was used to replace concrete structures with 3D printed clay blocks which supported circular raised beds. The remainder of the garden was also constructed with low-carbon materials and without power tools.

""It was a really difficult decision to make but we felt the World Child Cancer Nurturing Garden stood out as a beautifully simple example of merging old techniques with new, where Giulio has used 3D printing to create traditional keyhole gardens,"" stated Malcolm Anderson, RHS Head of Sustainability.

""The garden has been created using products made entirely from soil and timber and in its construction no power tools have been used, only hand tools, so it is a fine example of how we can design and build gardens more sustainably in the future.""

RHS Chelsea Flower Show showcases 3D printing

The World Child Cancer UK team sought to create a garden concept that could be adapted and replicated in different environments and climates. This would allow sensory outdoor spaces to be produced at hospitals where not-for-profit organizations operate, supporting the emotional well-being of children undergoing cancer treatment.

""What is a sensory garden? It's a garden that lets children live in the moment and connect with nature while being treated at the hospital,"" explained Giorgi. ""Touching, smelling, tasting... those sensory experiences let them forget for a little while the hard time they're living through.""

To achieve this goal, Giorgi worked with Giuseppe Fallacara of the Polytechnic University of Bari to design 3D printed terracotta modules which can be transported and rearranged to create customizable garden spaces. The ceramic blocks are stackable and can be used as planters or to form wall structures.

The environmentally friendly garden also included sustainable and peat-free soils, drought-resistant plants sourced from the UK, and a watering system which minimizes waste and doesn't require electricity or water pressure.

According to Giorgi, the 3D printed ceramic units support plant roots by absorbing humidity and releasing moisture in dry conditions. Leftover material can also be crushed and recycled to form part of a garden path.

These 3D printed modules were produced by WASP. The company leveraged its clay 3D printing farm to fabricate over 600 units in under two months. WASP 40100 LDM ceramic 3D printers were utilized in this production effort.

According to the 3D printer manufacturer, the 40100's automation features allow it to achieve 24/7 production, enabling large series production of ceramic parts with personalized designs.

WASP plans to make its 3D printed ceramic garden modules available to purchase from its official online shop.

3D printing sustainable structures

The architecture industry has witnessed increased adoption of additive manufacturing, particularly for the construction of eco-friendly structures.

Last year, 3D Printing Industry attended AM Summit Denmark 2023, Scandinavia's largest annual 3D printing conference. This conference, which focused on the sustainability of 3D printing, introduced the I AM MSHRM project.

A collaboration between Danish AM Hub and Bjarke Ingels Group, this project has designed and 3D printed a donut-shaped, sustainable temporary structure. The structure's frames were 3D printed using plastic waste, locally sourced sugarcane and cornstarch. These were then filled with mycelium, a naturally occurring fungi, to create the structure's walls.

Designed to be built in sections, the 3D printed structure can be used as a rapidly deployable emergency shelter. According to Danish AM Hub's CO2e calculator tool, I AM MSHRM reduced CO2 emissions by 80%, compared to conventional construction methods.

Elsewhere, Hassell, an international design studio, and venture capital, philanthropy, and creative space platform to.org announced plans for a 3D printed pavilion made of recycled plastic.

The prototype of the 3D printed building can be modified to suit various extreme climates and settings. Designed to serve as a space for meditation and education, the structure is the first in a broader scheme to 3D print several pavilions that encourage material waste conversations.",3dprintingindustry.com,news,3D Printing Industry,Alex Tyrer-Jones,0.2156862745098038,454674792,1,https://3dprintingindustry.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/The-World-Child-Cancers-Nurthering-Garden-at-the-RHS-Chelsea-Flower-Show-2024.-Photo-via-Guy-BellAlamy.jpg,

Corre Energy, the storage developer for renewable energy, has raised a total of €2.76 million in share sales in the past week as it sought to raise cash to keep it going for the near term as it continues talks with investors looking at taking a large stake in the business.

The company said on Wednesday it raised €640,000 selling shares the previous day to existing shareholders, having last week placed €2.12 million with founders and a large long-standing investor.

The cash call has been designed to tide the company over as it continues talks to third parties interested in making a significant ""strategic investment"" in a business that was down to just €1.08 million of cash at the end of last year.

The company's founding shareholders include former director Darren Patrick Green, who stepped down in February, chief executive Keith McGrane and businessman Brendan Boyd.

Shares in the company have fallen by more than 85 per cent over the past 12 months. This has been partly down to a slump across the wider green energy sector amid a decline in energy prices and the weight of higher interest rates on this capital-intensive sector.

However, according to observers, it is also down to concerns about Corre having failed to sufficiently spell out the financial details of its various projects to allow investors assess their potential for profit.

Corre's most advanced development is its Zuidwending (ZW1) project in the province of Groningen in the Netherlands. ZW1 will be capable of supplying up to 320MW of electricity to the grid and is due to come on stream around the end of 2026.

Other key projects include Corre's 320MW Green Hydrogen Hub project in Denmark, another facility in the Netherlands (ZW2) and a plan to develop three compressed air energy storage plants in caverns secured last year in Germany.",irishtimes.com,news,The Irish Times,,0.3725490196078431,454661846,1,https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/_guoNBTURg0nMZ20oeRLOBkXgw8=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/irishtimes/B337UNETIXTQMZZPZVKBRN7RTY.jpg,

""

an explosive leak that purports to show thousands of pages of internal documents appears to offer an unprecedented look under the hood of how Search works -- and suggests that Google hasn't been entirely truthful about it for years. So far, Google hasn't responded to multiple requests for comment on the legitimacy of the documents.

Rand Fishkin, who worked in SEO for more than a decade, says a source shared 2,500 pages of documents with him with the hopes that reporting on the leak would counter the ""lies"" that Google employees had shared about how the search algorithm works. The documents outline Google's search API and break down what information is available to employees, according to Fishkin.

The details shared by Fishkin are dense and technical, likely more legible to developers and SEO experts than the layperson. The contents of the leak are also not necessarily proof that Google uses the specific data and signals it mentions for search rankings. Rather, the leak outlines what data Google collects from webpages, sites, and searchers and offers indirect hints to SEO experts about what Google seems to care about, as SEO expert Mike King wrote in his overview of the documents.

The leaked documents touch on topics like what kind of data Google collects and uses, which sites Google elevates for sensitive topics like elections, how Google handles small websites, and more. Some information in the documents appears to be in conflict with public statements by Google representatives, according to Fishkin and King.

""'Lied' is harsh, but it's the only accurate word to use here,"" King writes. ""While I don't necessarily fault Google's public representatives for protecting their proprietary information, I do take issue with their efforts to actively discredit people in the marketing, tech, and journalism worlds who have presented reproducible discoveries.""

""

Seems to have been exposed accidentally by Google when it was posted to Github and made public for a couple of months. It seems to be the biggest leak of documents ever from inside Google search. Hell of a thing: for all that the search algorithm has been kept incredibly secret for 30 years, the hacking was done by.. Google itself.

As an endless stream of entirely wrong and sometimes dangerous AI-generated answers from Google are going viral on social media, new research from Google researchers and several fact checking organizations have found that most image-based disinformation is now AI-generated, but the way researchers collected their data suggests that the problem is even worse than they claim.

The paper, first spotted by the Faked Up newsletter, measures the rise of AI-generated image-based disinformation by looking at what fact checkers at Snopes, Politifact, and other sites have claimed were image-based disinformation. Overall, the study looks at a total of 135,838 fact checks which date back to 1995, but the majority of the claims were created after 2016 and the introduction of ClaimReview, a tagging system that allows fact checkers and publishers to flag disinformation for platforms like Google, Facebook, Bing, and others.

The most telling chart in the study shows the ""prevalence of content manipulation types as a function of overall content manipulations."" In other words, it shows the different types of image-based disinformation and how common they are over time.

As you can see from the chart, AI-generated image-based disinformation was just not a thing until late 2023, when AI image generators became widely available and popular, at which point they basically almost replaced all other forms of image-based disinformation. The chart also shows that there's a slight increase in the total samples of image-based disinformation that corresponds with the rise of AI images, but only slightly.

""Interestingly, the rise of AI images did not produce a bump in the overall proportion of misinformation claims that depend on images during this period, and image-based misinformation continued to decline on a relative basis as video-based misinformation grew,"" the paper says.

""

The problem is in reality worse, because fact-checked content is only a small part of it.

For nearly a decade, Israel has been surveilling senior International Criminal Court officials and Palestinian human rights workers as part of a secret operation to thwart the ICC's probe into alleged war crimes, a joint investigation by +972 Magazine, Local Call, and the Guardian can reveal.

The multi-agency operation, which dates back to 2015, has seen Israel's intelligence community routinely surveil the court's current chief prosecutor Karim Khan, his predecessor Fatou Bensouda, and dozens of other ICC and UN officials. Israeli intelligence also monitored materials that the Palestinian Authority submitted to the prosecutor's office, and surveilled employees at four Palestinian human rights organizations whose submissions are central to the probe.

According to sources, the covert operation mobilized the highest branches of Israel's government, the intelligence community, and both the civilian and military legal systems in order to derail the probe.

The intelligence information obtained via surveillance was passed on to a secret team of top Israeli government lawyers and diplomats, who traveled to The Hague for confidential meetings with ICC officials in an attempt to ""feed [the chief prosecutor] information that would make her doubt the basis of her right to be dealing with this question."" The intelligence was also used by the Israeli military to retroactively open investigations into incidents that were of interest to the ICC, to try to prove that Israel's legal system is capable of holding its own to account.

Additionally, as the Guardian reported earlier today, the Mossad, Israel's foreign intelligence agency, ran its own parallel operation which sought out compromising information on Bensouda and her close family members in an apparent attempt to sabotage the ICC's investigation. The agency's former head, Yossi Cohen, personally attempted to ""enlist"" Bensouda and manipulate her into complying with Israel's wishes, according to sources familiar with his activities, causing the then-prosecutor to fear for her personal safety.

""

Hell of an operation for a court that Israel feigns not to be concerned about. Also, perhaps we should simply assume that all operations are being surveilled all the time.

Soon after OpenAI released GPT-4o on Monday, May 13, some Chinese speakers started to notice that something seemed off about this newest version of the chatbot: the tokens it uses to parse text were full of spam and porn phrases.

On May 14, Tianle Cai, a PhD student at Princeton University studying inference efficiency in large language models like those that power such chatbots, accessed GPT-4o's public token library and pulled a list of the 100 longest Chinese tokens the model uses to parse and compress Chinese prompts.

Humans read in words, but LLMs read in tokens, which are distinct units in a sentence that have consistent and significant meanings. Besides dictionary words, they also include suffixes, common expressions, names, and more. The more tokens a model encodes, the faster the model can ""read"" a sentence and the less computing power it consumes, thus making the response cheaper.

Of the 100 results, only three of them are common enough to be used in everyday conversations; everything else consisted of words and expressions used specifically in the contexts of either gambling or pornography. The longest token, lasting 10.5 Chinese characters, literally means ""_free Japanese porn video to watch."" Oops.

China's carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions fell by 3% in March 2024, ending a 14-month surge that began when the economy reopened after the nation's ""zero-Covid"" controls were lifted in December 2022.

The new analysis for Carbon Brief, based on official figures and commercial data, reinforces the view that China's emissions could have peaked in 2023.

The drivers of the CO2 drop in March 2024 were expanding solar and wind generation, which covered 90% of the growth in electricity demand, as well as declining construction activity.

Oil demand growth also ground to a halt, indicating that the post-Covid rebound may have run its course.

A 2023 peak in China's CO2 emissions is possible if the buildout of clean energy sources is kept at the record levels seen last year.

However, there are divergent views across the industry and government on the outlook for clean energy growth. How this gap gets resolved is the key determinant of when China's emissions will peak - if they have not done so already.

Other key findings from the analysis include:

* Wind and solar growth pushed fossil fuels' share of electricity generation in China down to 63.6% in March 2024, from 67.4% a year earlier, despite strong growth in demand

* The ongoing contraction of real-estate construction activity in China saw steel production fall by 8% and cement output by 22% in March 2024

* Electric vehicles (EVs) now make up around one-in-10 vehicles on China's roads, knocking around 3.5 percentage points off the growth in petrol demand

* Some 45% of last year's record solar additions were smaller-scale ""distributed"" systems, creating an illusory ""missing data problem"".

""

So fossil fuels are still a very, very big source of generation - lots of it coal - but the picture keeps improving. And the EV stat helps too.

Dr Richard Fletcher and Professor Rasmus Kleis Nielsen:

""

Based on an online survey focused on understanding if and how people use generative artificial intelligence (AI), and what they think about its application in journalism and other areas of work and life across six countries (Argentina, Denmark, France, Japan, the UK, and the USA), we present the following findings.

Findings on the public's use of generative AI: ChatGPT is by far the most widely recognised generative AI product - around 50% of the online population in the six countries surveyed have heard of it. It is also by far the most widely used generative AI tool in the six countries surveyed. That being said, frequent use of ChatGPT is rare, with just 1% using it on a daily basis in Japan, rising to 2% in France and the UK, and 7% in the USA. Many of those who say they have used generative AI have used it just once or twice, and it is yet to become part of people's routine internet use.

In more detail, we find:

* While there is widespread awareness of generative AI overall, a sizable minority of the public - between 20% and 30% of the online population in the six countries surveyed - have not heard of any of the most popular AI tools

* In terms of use, ChatGPT is by far the most widely used generative AI tool in the six countries surveyed, two or three times more widespread than the next most widely used products, Google Gemini and Microsoft Copilot

* Younger people are much more likely to use generative AI products on a regular basis. Averaging across all six countries, 56% of 18-24s say they have used ChatGPT at least once, compared to 16% of those aged 55 and over

* Roughly equal proportions across six countries say that they have used generative AI for getting information (24%) as creating various kinds of media, including text but also audio, code, images, and video (28%)

* Just 5% across the six countries covered say that they have used generative AI to get the latest news.

""

That last 5% worries me, since generative AI has no business offering news. Notable too how it doesn't seem to stick: people try it out and give it up.

IFixit and Samsung were once leading the charge in device repair, but iFixit says it's ending its repair partnership with Samsung because it feels Samsung just isn't participating in good faith. iFixit says the two companies ""have not been able to deliver"" on the promise of a viable repair ecosystem, so it would rather shut the project down than continue. The repair site says ""flashy press releases and ambitious initiatives don't mean much without follow-through.""

iFixit's Scott Head explains: ""As we tried to build this ecosystem we consistently faced obstacles that made us doubt Samsung's commitment to making repair more accessible. We couldn't get parts to local repair shops at prices and quantities that made business sense. The part prices were so costly that many consumers opted to replace their devices rather than repair them. And the design of Samsung's Galaxy devices remained frustratingly glued together, forcing us to sell batteries and screens in pre-glued bundles that increased the cost.""

...Samsung has also reportedly been on the attack against repair, even while it partners with iFixit. On the same day that iFixit announced it was dropping the partnership, 404 Media reported that Samsung requires independent repair shops to turn over customer data and ""immediately disassemble"" any device found to be using third-party parts. Imagine taking your phone to a shop for repair and finding out it was destroyed by the shop as a requirement from Samsung. The report also says Samsung's contracts require that independent companies ""daily"" upload to a Samsung database (called G-SPN) the details of each and every repair ""at the time of each repair.""

More than 77% of people who participated in a big Apple-sponsored study have experienced tinnitus at some point in their lives, according to preliminary data. Around 15% say they're affected daily by tinnitus, perceiving ringing or other sounds that other people can't hear.

In one of the largest surveys of its kind, researchers at the University of Michigan gathered data from more than 160,000 participants who responded to survey questions and completed hearing assessments on Apple's Research app since 2019. The goal is to study the effects of sound exposure through headphones, how tinnitus impacts people, and perhaps develop new methods for managing the symptoms.

""The trends that we're learning through the Apple Hearing Study about people's experience with tinnitus can help us better understand the groups most at risk, which can in turn help guide efforts to reduce the impacts associated with it,"" University of Michigan environmental health sciences professor Rick Neitzel said in a press release.

Most gig workers around the world are relatively young: Research published in 2021 by the International Labour Organization (ILO), a United Nations agency focused on improving working conditions, puts the average age for delivery workers at 29 and the average age for ride-hailing drivers at 36. But Rest of World reporting suggests that older individuals are turning to gig work, too -- and their numbers are expected to grow in the coming years.

Over the past three months, Rest of World spoke to 52 gig workers between the ages of 50 and 75 years in Latin America, Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. Some chose gig work to keep up with rising living costs or to make up for threadbare social security systems; others say it's impossible to find employment elsewhere once they near retirement age. Still others say that gig work is a second job, one they can transition into full-time once they retire or are no longer employed. Many reported low earnings, long hours, and health complications from their work. Without being able to put enough savings aside for retirement, others communicated the feeling that there was no alternative. But for all its challenges and pitfalls, gig work can represent an accessible, flexible, low-barrier activity that enables older workers to offset expenses and continue to be active.

... Older gig workers is a demographic that's expected to grow in the coming decades. The global population of people 65 or older is expected to double by 2050, surpassing 1.6 billion, according to the U.N. At the same time, family units around the world are transforming, often requiring older people to support themselves for longer.

Two years ago when ""Michael,"" an owner of cryptocurrency, contacted Joe Grand to help recover access to about $2m worth of bitcoin he stored in encrypted format on his computer, Grand turned him down.

Michael, who is based in Europe and asked to remain anonymous, stored the cryptocurrency in a password-protected digital wallet. He generated a password using the RoboForm password manager and stored that password in a file encrypted with a tool called TrueCrypt. At some point, that file got corrupted and Michael lost access to the 20-character password he had generated to secure his 43.6 BTC (worth a total of about €4,000, or $5,300, in 2013). Michael used the RoboForm password manager to generate the password but did not store it in his manager. He worried that someone would hack his computer and obtain the password.

""At [that] time, I was really paranoid with my security,"" he laughs.

...last June he approached Grand again, hoping to convince him to help, and this time Grand agreed to give it a try, working with a friend named Bruno in Germany who also hacks digital wallets.

Grand and Bruno spent months reverse engineering the version of the RoboForm program that they thought Michael had used in 2013 and found that the pseudo-random number generator used to generate passwords in that version -- and subsequent versions until 2015 -- did indeed have a significant flaw that made the random number generator not so random. The RoboForm program unwisely tied the random passwords it generated to the date and time on the user's computer -- it determined the computer's date and time, and then generated passwords that were predictable. If you knew the date and time and other parameters, you could compute any password that would have been generated on a certain date and time in the past.

If Michael knew the day or general time frame in 2013 when he generated it, as well as the parameters he used to generate the password (for example, the number of characters in the password, including lower- and upper-case letters, figures, and special characters), this would narrow the possible password guesses to a manageable number. Then they could hijack the RoboForm function responsible for checking the date and time on a computer and get it to travel back in time, believing the current date was a day in the 2013 time frame when Michael generated his password. RoboForm would then spit out the same passwords it generated on the days in 2013.

There was one problem: Michael couldn't remember when he created the password.

""We believe renewable gas has the potential to play a crucial role in the energy transition and reaching Australia's net zero commitments, while at the same time providing an additional reliable energy source that can complement wind and solar,"" says Jakobovits.

Renewable gas is particularly important for heavy industry and manufacturing - providing a pathway to lower emissions. Some industries just aren't able to electrify, either because it is too costly or they rely on gas for their operations and production processes.

""Industries like steel, fertiliser, tiles and brick manufacturers are all reliant on gas and will need a carbon neutral or low emission alternative now and into the future. Biomethane and renewable hydrogen can provide that alternative.""

The potential for biomethane on home soil is echoing the success stories from across Europe, specifically in Germany and Denmark.

""There are now more than 10,000 biogas facilities across Germany alone, and Denmark is on track to reach 100 per cent biomethane injection in its network by 2030-2034.""

And it seems the Australian government is also recognising the potential of biomethane. ARENA's Bioenergy Roadmap supports the development of a sustainable renewable gas sector and highlights that biomethane has the potential to reduce emissions by 9 per cent while complementing other low emission technologies. In addition, the federal government's Future of Gas Strategy recognises the role of renewable gases in Australia's future energy mix.

While renewable gas can be used in the home, it has its largest role to play in assisting industrial users to decarbonise their operations. ""Approximately 70 per cent of Australia's natural gas usage occurs in industry,"" Jakobovits says.

""To deliver the federal government's Future Made in Australia policy we need to ensure that the hard to electrify industries can still operate and manufacture in Australia.

""These companies make a significant direct and indirect contribution to the Australian economy. Through high temperature manufacturing, gas contributed nearly $6 billion in economic activity and supported just shy of 30,000 jobs in financial year 2021-2022. So the economic imperative is lining up with the environmental imperative,"" says Jakobovits.

Jemena, a key player in Australia's energy infrastructure, is actively facilitating the integration of renewable gas into the national energy matrix.

Jakobovits says projects such as the Western Sydney Hydrogen Hub and the Malabar Biomethane Injection Plant are not only already injecting into the NSW gas network but the latter is also clearly demonstrating the compatibility of biomethane with existing infrastructure.

While the potential of renewable gas is vast, there is yet to be significant private investment in renewable gas production.

""The government's Future Gas Strategy lays out a view of the future in which gas continues to be a part of our energy mix. This brings a level of certainty to the industry,"" Jakobovits says.

""The significant financial support for renewable energy included in this year's federal budget makes clear the critical role renewable gas - specifically hydrogen - has to play in decarbonising the energy sector both internationally and domestically,"" Jakobovits says.

However, Jakobovits also highlights there needs to be supportive policy frameworks, targets and government funding to stimulate the commencement of a biomethane market.

""There are a few policy levers the federal government could pull to help Australia adopt the same level of renewable gas integration as we are seeing in other parts of the world,"" she says.

""GreenPower's Renewable Gas Certification scheme is an important step to help commercial and industrial users to lower emissions from renewable gas.

""To unlock the true value, we need this certified renewable gas, that is transported through Australia's existing gas infrastructure, to be recognised by the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Scheme, which is the federal government's framework for reporting emissions. This would enable large gas users to recognise lower emissions and contribute towards their obligations under the Safeguard Mechanism.""

Mike Davis, CEO of Optimal Renewable Gas says it's a ""crying shame"" more is not being done to support renewable gas.

Flushed with the success of projects like the one at Malabar, Optimal Renewable Gas is aiming for an ambitious target of developing 10 biohubs across Australia by 2030.

These biohubs will harness the potential of anaerobic digestion facilities to convert organic waste and residue into biomethane.

Davis says biomethane has the potential to replace much of the nation's gas needs - which is vitally important considering capturing this methane and then burning it means energy is being produced, avoiding the carbon emissions simply escaping into the atmosphere.

""We plan to implement the best and proven technology of large-scale anaerobic digestion and biogas upgrading,"" says Davis.

At the heart of this movement lies the recognition of the pressing need to decarbonise Australia's energy systems.

""From our experience at Optimal there is rapidly growing demand for reliable renewable gas, especially biomethane, which can be delivered via existing infrastructure,"" says Davis.

Davis highlights the importance of biomethane as a decarbonisation solution for industry and hard to abate communities, noting its ability to allow users to continue their gas usage practices while reducing emissions and maintaining operational reliability.

""Biomethane will be an essential part of the energy transition for thousands of businesses,"" says Davis

Crucially, renewable gas like biomethane capitalises on existing infrastructure, minimising the need for costly upgrades.

By injecting biomethane into the existing gas network, Australia can capitalise on the inherent storage and transport capabilities of its infrastructure.

""Utilising existing gas infrastructure for renewable gas distribution ensures cost-effectiveness and scalability.""

Further, the nation's 37,000km of gas pipelines spanning the country, offer a massive storage resource for renewable energy.

For instance, the Tasmanian Gas Pipeline showcased the potential by offering storage of over 150 terajoules of gas on its website, available for sale into the Victorian market during peak demand periods.

Technological advancements also play a pivotal role in driving the efficiency and scalability of renewable gas production, says Davis.

Optimal Renewable Gas collaborates with leading technology suppliers to implement state-of-the-art anaerobic digestion and biogas upgrading systems.

""We work with our European technology supplier that has developed over 450 plants around the world.""

He called on the government and sector as a whole to acknowledge all options should be on the table when working to decarbonise networks. ""Biomethane is 100 per cent compatible with our existing pipeline infrastructure providing a ready option while we wait for other fuels, like hydrogen to come online.""

""We are laggards against our international peers - Europe, China, US, India, Brazil and others. We're falling behind and it's crying shame you when you look at the available resources here in Australia.""",afr.com,news,Australian Financial Review,,0.2313725490196079,454648127,4,https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3531%2C$multiply_3%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_110/t_crop_custom/c_scale%2Cw_800%2Cq_88%2Cf_jpg/t_afr_no_label_no_age_social_wm/b9f72831cdbda0e2f15cac5f1dbc47e443e0ef12,eng-9603463

The application is for the Erik Segersäll floating wind farm in the Baltic Sea.

The Erik Segersäll project is planned around 74km east of Nynäshamn and can reach electricity consumers on the mainland and Gotland.

The wind farm will have a potential total installed output of 4.5GW, to be achieved through several phases of development, which will give a total annual production of up to 19.5TWh.

Elad Simchayoff, Channel 12 European correspondent, filmed while he covered a massive pro-Palestinian anti-Israel demonstration, exhibited great courage in a frightening situation.

In his speech, he noted that ""history doesn't repeat itself, but there are people who choose to repeat history."" October 7 is an example and a date on which Israel and all Jews were forced to choose as they encountered verbal and physical violence ""such as we have never known before,"" he continued.

Relating to what he had witnessed abroad, Simchayoff said that Jews in the Diaspora have to choose every day to stay where they are and face hatred.

Without being judgmental, Simchayoff nevertheless implied that they would be better off in Israel. Yet for all that, he obviously understood that most of them will choose to remain in the countries in which they live. ""Because of them, we're not alone,"" he said, ""and because of us, they're not alone.""

Even though they choose to live elsewhere, Simchayoff paid tribute to Diaspora Jews as being ""tremendous patriots for Israel.""

Canaan Lidor, the Jewish World reporter for The Times of Israel, spent several years in Amsterdam, which he and his wife found to be a wonderful place, but after a decade they missed Israel, and they realized that Jewish communities in the Diaspora are living in a perilous moment, unwanted by the surrounding society.

So they came home to Israel, where the cost of living is expensive, and the quality of life is on a different level. But this does not bother them.

""We need money,"" Lidor said, speaking from a national perspective, ""but most of all we need humans, and to work creatively across the aisle."" Acknowledging that he's a Zionist, Lidor called on Diaspora Jews to come to Israel.

Veteran singer Ilanit, who sang two popular songs from her vast repertoire, was the recipient of the Naomi Shemer memorial citation for fostering Israel-Diaspora Relations through the Arts.

Her parents arrived in pre-state Israel in 1939, having left Poland just in time. The family later moved to Brazil, but after a few years returned to Israel.

Ilanit, who in 1973 was Israel's first-ever Eurovision Song Contest contestant, and later traveled widely to give performances, said that she had many opportunities to build her career in Europe, but as far as she was concerned, the only place in which she wanted to live permanently was Israel.

Among the speakers were Diaspora Affairs Minister Amichai Chikli, who gave a Zionist lesson on ancient history which to some extent is paralleled by current events; and former government spokesman Eylon Levy, who urged all present to speak up for Israel and to speak out against antisemitism.

Graduation ceremonies tinged with sadness

■ COMMENCEMENT AND graduation ceremonies at institutes of higher learning are supposed to be happy affairs, but in too many cases in Israel, they are tinged with sorrow by the fact that some of the new students lost a sibling or a parent in the October 7 massacre; or a student due to graduate fell in the war against Hamas.

Cases of the latter last week cast a pall on the annual honors ceremonies at Reichman University, where the families of the late Maj. (res.) Dor Zimel and Sgt.-Maj. (res.) Joseph Gitarts were awarded the Dean's Certificate of Excellence for the academic achievements of the two fallen soldiers.

Zimel, who was 27 years old when he fell, served as a deputy company commander in the 8103rd Battalion of the IDF's Etzioni Brigade, and was a third-year law and government student at RU's Harry Radzyner Law School.

On April 17, a month before his planned wedding to his fiancée, Shir - to whom he had proposed during the war - Zimel was critically wounded in a Hezbollah drone attack on the community of Arab el-Aramshe on the Lebanese border. He succumbed to his wounds a few days later, and his family, in a noble gesture, donated his organs to save the lives of seven people whom they did not know.

Gitarts, who was 25 years old at the time of his death, immigrated to Israel from Russia at the age of 13. He was a soldier in the IDF's 179th Reserve Armored Brigade's 7029th Battalion, and a second-year computer science student at RU's Raphael Recanati International School.

On December 25 Gitarts was killed by an anti-tank missile during a battle in the southern Gaza Strip. Before entering Gaza, he had written a letter to his parents that was published after his death and moved many people with its poignant words: ""I would do the same thing if I could choose again. I came to this decision by myself and stuck with it until the end. I fell proudly for the sake of my people. I have no regrets.""

In his remarks RU President Prof. Boaz Ganor said: ""Reichman University is proud of its sons and daughters, who in one moment put everything aside and set out to fight for the defense of our homeland. Tragically, nine of our students did not return from the battlefield, and we continue to await the return of Idan Shtivi, who is being held hostage in Gaza.

""Dor and Joseph epitomize excellence and the values of Zionism, leadership, freedom, and responsibility, which are at the core of our university's ethos. There is no greater pain than knowing that they are not here to enjoy the fruits of their labor. We share in the sorrow of their families, and are grateful to them for honoring us with their presence.""

National Library of Israel holds small events

■ THE NATIONAL Library of Israel (NLI), whose official opening was postponed time and again because construction had not been completed, was finally ready for its gala series of events, with invitations sent out for the week of October 22, 2023.

But then came October 7, and the gala opening, with all that it entailed, was not just postponed but canceled.

Nonetheless, smaller events have been held to honor the many donors for whom (or in memory of their family members) various areas of the library have been named.

In mid-May, Australian-Israeli millionaire Sir Frank Lowy and sons David and Steven were joined by President Isaac Herzog and his wife, Michal, NLI chairman of the board of directors Sallai Meridor and CEO Oren Weiberg, Alrov Group founder Alfred Akirov and his wife, Chava; Ray Shipping owners Rami and Yael Unger; former prime minister Ehud Olmert and his wife, Aliza; Sir Ronald Cohen; former president and CEO of Bank Leumi Rakefet Russak-Aminoach and Reem Aminoach; economist Prof. Manuel Trajtenberg; Executive Director of the Institute for National Security Studies and former head of Military Intelligence Tamir Hayman; KPMG Somekh Chaikin chairman Gad Somekh and his wife, Nitzan; and multidisciplinary artist Sigalit Landau in dedicating the library's centerpiece - the Hugo and Ilona Lowy main reading halls.

A second space, the Hugo and Ilona Lowy Special Collections Reading Room, enables the presentation and study of archival and rare materials. This magnificent room, with its old-world feel, was designed to display the renowned Valmadonna Trust Library, a collection of 13,000 rare printed Hebrew books and manuscripts, considered the finest of its kind in the world.

The dedication ceremony also included the unveiling of a statue, Hugo, sculpted by Landau, which was commissioned by Frank Lowy, in memory of his father. Hugo Lowy was clubbed to death on the Auschwitz railway platform by an SS soldier for refusing to leave his prayer shawl and phylacteries behind. The NLI in Jerusalem is probably the most suitable place in which to honor his memory in perpetuity.

The National Library's educational programs

■ THE NATIONAL Library also conducts a variety of educational programs in conjunction with the Education Ministry and with the support of generous individuals and philanthropic foundations.

The 2024 National Library of Israel Prize for Pedagogic Excellence in memory of Canadian-Israeli architect David Azrieli was awarded earlier last month at a festive ceremony, in the presence of ministry officials, library senior executives, and distinguished representatives of the Azrieli Foundation.

Now in its third year, this prestigious award is given to teachers who have initiated significant processes to strengthen humanities education in their schools; teachers who have cultivated in their students a desire to expand knowledge and academic horizons, while emphasizing research, reading and writing skills.

Dozens of teachers across the country were nominated by students, teachers, parents and principals, and the winners were selected by a committee comprised of public and education network officials, as well as representatives from the library and the foundation.

The three prizewinners will share a NIS 115,000 monetary award made possible as part of a five-year NIS 3.75 million gift from the Azrieli Foundation for the Israel National Center for Humanities Education, Israel's training center for humanities educators, which the NLI runs in collaboration with the ministry.

This year's prizewinners are:

Efrat Amit Leibovitz - pedagogical coordinator and teacher of literature and student affairs at Tichon Hadash Tel Aviv Yitzhak Rabin, who developed a three-year program for teaching the humanities to middle school; a program about civics and Judaism; and a course for educators on the teaching of the Oral Torah.

Shay Gillis - Jewish thought studies coordinator and Oral Torah teacher at the Shalom Hartman Institute's Charles E. Smith High School for Boys in Jerusalem, for creating lesson plans, for remote and on-site teaching, self-learning tasks, and a wide selection of cultural and art sources. These lesson plans led to a profound change in the school's teaching methods.

Anat Sade-Amit - literature studies coordinator at ORT Melton, Bat Yam, a school on the social periphery with a diverse student population.

Sade-Amit believes that enjoyment and love of literature is essential, and has developed unique teaching methods and tools to enable each student to improve their skills of expression, leading to the publication of a book of poetry by her students.

Sade-Amit also initiated a learning community for students to teach other students, and formed a group of 11th graders who go once a week to study philosophy and literature at Tel Aviv University.

Honorable mentions were awarded to: Anat Mor-Eilat of Beit Yerach High School and Ruth Ash-Argyle of the Leo Baeck Education Center.

Neta Shapira, director of the NLI Education Department, notes that at complex periods of national crisis and war, the role of teachers becomes ever more important. ""Even in difficult times we know that, to endure and survive each crisis, we must continue to learn and teach.

""We are proud to honor these teachers who have accompanied thousands of teenagers through the difficult years of pandemic, crises, and war, and help them give meaning to their lives and our lives as well.""

Danna Azrieli, chairwoman of the Azrieli Foundation Israel and chairwoman of the Azrieli Group, stated that ""teachers are at the forefront of sparking curiosity in the younger generation to ask questions, be inquisitive, experience reading, and explore different worlds, both near and far. These experiences will help them grow into better people as part of a healthier and more inclusive society.""

MKs active in support of hostages families

■ TWO FORMER Labor Party MKs, Emilie Moatti and Stav Shaffir, have been extremely active in their support of the families of the hostages still in captivity in Gaza. Moatti even suggested to German Ambassador Steffen Seibert that he host a morning meeting between representatives of the hostage families and ambassadors and other senior diplomats of countries whose nationals were or are among the hostages.

Seibert, who has been a constant presence with the hostage families, readily agreed.

The meeting, which took place at the German Embassy last Friday, included ambassadors and other high-ranking diplomats from Austria, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Portugal, Serbia, Romania, Thailand, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

People from the embassies represented have been in frequent contact with the families of the hostages. At the meeting they all reiterated their call for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages, including the bodies of the dead, some of whom were murdered in the October 7 massacre and taken to Gaza.

Seibert tweeted afterward: ""These days have been particularly devastating for the hostages' families. I thank their representatives for their time to meet today over a dozen ambassadors and diplomats in our embassy and share their stories and demands. Our common goal, ever more important: Bring them Home.""

US Ambassador Jack Lew tweeted that he had attended a meeting with hostage families, fellow ambassadors, and representatives of 14 countries whose citizens were taken captive on October 7.

""Standing together reinforces our common efforts to free the hostages and underscores our solidarity as we work to bring them home,"" he wrote.

Moatti, in a message of appreciation that she tweeted, noted that Seibert had been involved not only with families who hold German citizenship but also with those who don't.

Ireland's recognition of a Palestinian state is no surprise

■ ISRAEL, PARTICULARLY the Foreign Ministry, should not have been the least bit surprised at Ireland's recognition of a Palestinian state. It was bound to happen eventually, given Ireland's own history of bloodshed and reconciliation - but particularly at the present time. Though Ireland has repeatedly condemned Hamas, it has long advocated for a peaceful resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

At the present time, Ireland's representative to the Palestinian Authority is Feilim McLaughlin, who happens to be married to Ireland's Ambassador to Israel Sonya McGuinness. There must be some very interesting conversations in their household.

■ JOSH ARONSON, Maariv's UK-based correspondent, is a die-hard fan of Manchester United Football Club, as was the late Yonatan Rapoport, a dual national citizen of the UK and Israel who was murdered at his home in Kibbutz Be'eri on October 7 while protecting his two children, Yosef, nine, and Aluma, six, who survived the Hamas attack.

In a personal tribute to Rapoport, Aronson wore a T-shirt bearing Rapoport's image to the FA Cup. Aronson said that he was pleasantly surprised by the fans who saw him and sent a warm message to the families of the hostages and the State of Israel.

Great-grandson of Menachem Begin serves in Gaza

■ GRANDSON OF former minister Bennie Begin and great-grandson of the late prime minister Menachem Begin, Ariel Regev, is a paratrooper who participated in heavy fighting in Jabalya in Gaza, and he's not the only combat soldier who comes from a well-known family which could have sent him to some faraway island barely touched by civilization, but which instead supported him or her when they answered the call to duty.

Violence on Mount Meron

■ POLICE BRUTALITY is deplorable under any circumstances, but so is civilian violence and irresponsibility, especially when it comes from the ranks of the purportedly pious.

There was no excuse for police using a truncheon on a senior citizen, nor was there an excuse for the vulgar epithets hurled at police by those same pious souls who refused to accept the safety regulations that allowed limited access to Mount Meron in order to avoid repetition of the catastrophe of three years ago in which adults and children were trampled on and 45 people, including children, were killed in the crush.

Had the two chief rabbis, Rabbi David Lau and Rabbi Yitzhak Yosef, together with leaders of religious political parties, held a joint press conference urging people to consciously choose life rather than endanger it, the shameful, unholy Lag Ba'omer scenes might have been avoided.

The ferocity with which some of the ultra-Orthodox attacked police was indicative that, with a little discipline, they would be of far greater use to the army than to the yeshiva or the kollel.

Grief does not distinguish between faiths and nations

■ GRIEF AND pain do not distinguish between faiths and nations. The loss of a loved one is painful at any time, but more so in circumstances of violence known to survivors in both Israel and Gaza.

Someone has to convince Benjamin Netanyahu that the longer the war goes on, the less likelihood there is of any of the hostages surviving.

Antisemitism at University of Melbourne

■ AS SOMEONE born and raised in Melbourne, I found it somewhat painful to read the riveting article about antisemitism at the University of Melbourne that was written by Tammy Reznik and published in The Jerusalem Post earlier this month.

Some of the most distinguished Australians, including many Jews, are or were alumni of the university, including an impressive number now living in Israel, such as Mark Regev, a former media adviser to Netanyahu and later an Israel ambassador to the UK.

Among those who graduated long before the establishment of the State of Israel are two former governors-general, Sir Isaac Isaacs and Sir Zelman Cowen, who were each legal experts.

Isaacs, was also the first Australian-born governor-general and had previously held the post of chief justice.

Cowen, an internationally recognized expert on constitutional law, was a faculty member and a guest lecturer at many universities in Australia, England, and the United States. He also served as dean of the Law Faculty at the University of Melbourne.

Another highly distinguished Jewish alumnus was Gen. Sir John Monash. A brilliant student, he graduated from the university with bachelor's degrees in arts and law and a doctorate in engineering.

He worked as a civil engineer, and during the First World War was a brigade commander. After the war, he was put in charge of the repatriation of Australian troops from Europe.

After returning home himself, he was appointed or elected to several important posts, such as head of the State Electricity Commission of Victoria; president of the Rotary Club; and president of the Zionist Federation of Australia.

Kfar Monash, in the northern part of the Sharon, is named in his memory, as are streets, towns, and neighborhoods in Australia. But perhaps most important in today's toxic climate is Monash University, which was founded in 1958 in his native Melbourne, and which has a large Jewish student population as well as a multidisciplinary Center for Jewish Civilization.

If the university student situation in Melbourne continues to be a hotbed of fear and violence, what will happen to a university named for a Zionist Jew, with a large number of Jews among students and faculty staff, Jewish education programs, and philanthropic support from Jewish foundations and affluent Jewish individuals? Will the university change its name to Mabruk, Maheer, or Mahfuz?

More recently, the Melbourne Jewish community has been shocked by antisemitic vandalism, including death threats that were daubed on the wall of the largest campus of Mount Scopus College, the pioneer Jewish school, which this year is celebrating its 75th anniversary.

Many of its alumni, including some living in Israel, went straight through from kindergarten to high school graduation.

By Sofia Sanchez Manzanaro

In April 2024, the trial of nine people accused of plotting the violent overthrow of the German government began in Stuttgart. The case suggests what can happen when, in extreme circumstances, people feel politically alienated.

The suspects were, in the words of German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser, 'driven by hatred towards our democracy.'

Local voices

Participation by residents in local decision-making across Europe can bolster public trust in their systems of democratic rule and limit the risk that dissatisfaction with governance veers towards violence, according to James Scott, a professor of regional and border studies at the Karelian Institute of the University of Eastern Finland.

'The important thing in the process is that people are involved - that they have a sense that we are co-making a decision,' said Scott, who is also an expert on populist movements. 'Not only are we deciding on it, but we also see that these decisions lead to concrete results.'

He leads a research project that received EU funding to examine and help spur more inclusive forms of local governance in Europe. Called EUARENAS, the project began in January 2021 and is due to run through October 2024.

The project is entering its final five months as Europe gears up for EU legislative elections that take place twice a decade. On 6-9 June, voters in the 27 EU Member States will choose 720 members of the European Parliament.

Along with the Council of Ministers representing national governments, the Parliament decides on European laws covering everything from food safety and airline passenger rights to car emissions and electricity supplies.

The assembly also acts as the EU's budget authority and plays a key role in the formation of each European Commission leadership team following the legislative ballot.

Elections to the EU Parliament are in part a barometer of voter sentiment towards national governments and can trigger political changes within Member States.

In the last EU legislative ballot in 2019, voter turnout rose for the first time since the initial European Parliament elections in 1979. Europe's two main political families - the European People's Party and the Party of European Socialists - saw their seat totals drop by more than 30 each.

Mind the gap

Many people in Europe view their governance system as too distant to be influenced, leading to a polarisation of public debate and a rise in anti-democratic political forces, according to Scott.

To counter this trend, EUARENAS has studied examples of social movements and local government actions to expand political participation. It also encouraged grassroots initiatives such as neighbourhood assemblies, participatory budget communities and ""citizen panels"".

The project has brought together academics, local authorities, policy experts and social activists in seven European countries: Austria, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Italy, Poland and the UK.

'Many organisations are out there trying to promote a closer sense of citizen engagement, belonging and ownership of governance processes,' said Scott.

The EUARENAS team has analysed and enacted pilot programmes in Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Poland and the UK.

Opening up

One initiative by the project is a housing and urban development plan involving residents of the Polish coastal city of Gdansk.

'We didn't want to create the master plan from the top down but instead to involve the communities affected by it in the decision-making process,' said Scott.

In the Italian city of Reggio Emilia, residents represented in neighbourhood panels designed an agenda to address the main challenges people face. High among their concerns was the climate crisis.

In the Estonian town of Võru, which is grappling with an exodus of young people, EUARENAS identified ways to enhance their quality of life and employment prospects.

Residents of Võru addressed education on mental health and the well-being of youngsters, with one initiative placing stickers with QR codes in two schools. The codes linked to mental health websites.

A prominent role played by young people in the area was reflected in first-hand testimonies collected by EUARENAS.

Lasse Rihard Sissas, a ninth grader from Võru, cited his strong connection to the region and its natural beauty. He recommended more learning opportunities for people his age and called for the creation of a local university.

'It would be nice if there was a university here,' Sissas said in a project video. 'Young people would stay.'

Regardless of the particular local challenges, more inclusive decision-making at that level can limit the risks of social divisions and political exploitation of them by reactionary political forces, according to Scott.

'Decision-making has to be more democratic, more open,' said Scott.

Bridge-building

In the German trial in Stuttgart, prosecutors have charged the nine suspects with plotting a coup aimed at installing an aristocrat in power. German police reportedly foiled the alleged plot during raids in 2022.

The court proceedings are among three German trials this year involving a total of 26 defendants, all of whom are accused of plotting the violent overthrow of the federal government.

One challenge in nurturing grassroots involvement in public debates is that people who harbour extreme views are more reluctant to voice them, according to Pierangelo Isernia, a professor of political science at the University of Siena in Italy.

'They think they will be exposed and attacked because of their ideas,' he said.

Isernia led another EU-funded project into how liberal democracies can tackle political polarisation through more inclusive decision-making. Called EUCOMMEET, the project wrapped up in February 2024 after three years.

Language lessons

It featured an experiment involving a total of more than 400 people in five EU countries: France, Germany, Ireland, Italy and Poland.

The participants exchanged views on the climate crisis - a topic that Isernia said has had an increasingly polarising effect in Europe and beyond.

Initially, the exchanges took place locally by involving people from the same city. Then the conversations became national and, finally, European with a concluding plenary session in which people from at least three countries exchanged views.

The sessions each involved eight to 10 people. In a reflection of the experiment's cross-border nature, an open-source online platform allowed the participants to communicate in their native languages.

'People could discuss in their language and understand what others were saying,' said Isernia. 'We showed that this is possible.'

A main finding of EUCOMMEET is that exchanges of these kinds among people help reduce divisions over any given topic.

Isernia said he hopes that platforms like the one developed by the project will be integrated into future EU efforts to involve the general public in policy considerations.

For instance, he recommends that the next European Commission organise 'short-term consultations' to capture evolving public opinions.

'Surveys are not enough to understand what people really think,' said Isernia. 'You need to see how a person evolves in their thinking through a conversation and deliberative processes are the best way of understanding this.'",moderndiplomacy.eu,news,Modern Diplomacy,,-0.2862745098039216,454629905,1,https://moderndiplomacy.eu/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/european-union.jpg,

In the early 2000s, a long-time Louisiana engineer and entrepreneur thought it would be natural for the oil and gas industry in the Gulf of Mexico to expand into offshore wind. The industry could use the same workforce, the same shipyards and possibly even the same platforms to generate renewable power.

With designs, data and offshore leases from Texas, Herman Schellstede and his team planned to build a 62-turbine wind farm off Galveston's coast -- one of the first such proposals in the United States and the first in the Gulf of Mexico.

The team approached banks and even Koch Industries seeking financing for the $300 million wind farm, he said. But financing nascent offshore wind was apparently too risky a proposition in the wake of the 2008 financial meltdown. The wind farm was eventually scuttled.

""We were still too early,"" said Schellstede, the Louisiana oil and gas entrepreneur who is still designing offshore wind turbines for projects in the gulf.

Now, 33 years after the first offshore wind farm was built in waters off Denmark, it's still unclear if the time is right -- or will ever be right -- for the United States. In those years, only four wind farms generating 242 megawatts of power have been built off the U.S. coast; the largest just went into service in 2024.

Last year, inflation, supply chain problems and other macroeconomic issues led to the cancellation or renegotiation of about half of all proposed offshore wind projects. And while the Biden Administration is moving as quickly as possible to approve new lease sales and projects -- expanding the amount of power generated by tenfold -- former President Donald Trump has promised to end offshore wind if elected.

The industry and advocates, however, do not seem daunted. Studies show offshore wind could meet 5% of the nation's energy needs by 2035, and up to 25% by 2050.

""We're all in this room today, not because we just see offshore wind as a massive opportunity -- which it is to build you clean energy -- but also we see the necessity of offshore wind,"" said Amanda Lefton, vice president of offshore development for the renewable energy company RWE.

Lefton, speaking at an April conference of the offshore wind industry in New Orleans, said the technology is needed to meet national and state decarbonization goals. RWE is developing projects off the East Coast and California and working to create a supply chain for offshore wind in the Gulf of Mexico with a large Louisiana-based coalition.

""We know the fundamentals exist in these markets,"" said Lefton, the former head of the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management who leads RWE's East Coast operations. ""We know that it's not an if, it's a when.""

Offshore wind's rocky history

In the years since Schellestede's wind project proposal, the industry has moved forward in fits and starts. In 2016, the small scale 30-megawatt Block Island Wind Farm off the coast of Rhode Island became the first U.S. offshore wind project to be completed.

Cape Wind, the first large-scale offshore wind project in the United States off the shores of Massachusetts, was canceledthe following year after 16 years of controversy.

In 2020, a 12-MW pilot project -- the first in federally controlled waters -- came online off Virginia's coast.

So far this year, the industry has made historic progress as South Fork Wind Farm off New York began producing 132 MW of electricity, and Massachusetts' Vineyard Wind started spinning the first five of 62 turbines, sending 68 MW of power to the grid. At full operation, the wind farm is designed to generate 805 MW.

By contrast, worldwide there are almost 73,000 MW, or 73 gigawatts, of offshore wind operating, with half of that amount off China's coast.

Some of the delay in the U.S. industry occurred during Donald Trump's presidency. His administration held no offshore lease sales for federally owned waters. Trump ordered an environmental review for the Atlantic Coast, killing or delaying projects in various states of development.

As he did in his May 12 speech in New Jersey, Trump often repeats the falsehood that offshore wind is killing whales -- a claim dismissed by the federal government's own scientists. But groups funded by or tied to oil and gas interests including the American Petroleum Institute continue to perpetuate it, insisting offshore wind also harms fisheries and tourism.

""There is zero evidence for offshore wind activities causing whale deaths,"" said Helen Rose Patterson, senior campaign manager with National Wildlife Federation's offshore wind energy program. Patterson calls the claims ""disinformation,"" or false information that is intentionally spread.

She said the greatest threat to the whales is climate change, which offshore wind could help mitigate. North American right whales now must travel farther north to hunt their cold water prey, Patterson said, putting them closer to ships and fishing that put them at risk. ""The North Atlantic right whales are in different places because of climate change.""

Biden pushes to revive industry

When Joe Biden took office in 2021, he ordered a 180-degree turn on federal offshore wind policy.

During his first year in office, the Democrat established a target to deploy 30 GW of offshore wind -- the equivalent of about 30 new nuclear plants -- by 2030 to help reach his national climate goal of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.

So far, the administration has approved 10 GW of offshore projects and is expected to approve more by the end of the year in what some observers see as a rush to get more wind farms started in the event Trump wins the November election.

At the Oceantic Network conference in New Orleans, Interior Secretary Deb Haaland announced 12 offshore wind leasing sales over the next five years, ranging from New York to Hawaii and the Gulf of Mexico to the state of Oregon. Biden previously announced $5 billion in federally issued loan guarantees to boost offshore wind development.

Offshore political winds shift in Texas

Although Schellstede and his company, Wind Energy Systems Technology (WEST), failed to get interest for the project in Louisiana, Texas welcomed them. Texas saw offshore wind as a way to expand on its extensive energy resources, state officials said at the time.

Texas wasn't the only entity aiming to diversify. Big oil companies including Shell and BP and other international oil interests began adding wind to their own portfolios. In fact, the two oil giants were major sponsors of the offshore wind conference in New Orleans.

""It's not greenwashing,"" said Patterson of the oil majors investing in offshore wind. ""I'm much more concerned about oil and gas that aren't doing anything to diversify their portfolios.""

Since WEST tried to establish a wind farm off Galveston nearly 20 years ago, top Texas officials have become resistant to offshore wind energy. Last year, Texas Railroad Commissioner Wayne Christian told Gov. Greg Abbott that he opposes offshore wind, calling it a ""taxpayer boondoggle"" and repeating the false claims about offshore wind causing whale deaths.

The Texas land commissioner followed with her own opposition to the Biden Administration's plan to lease federal land off the state's coast for offshore wind. And the powerful Texas Public Policy Foundation, funded by conservative billionaires including oil baron Charles Koch, is leading offshore opposition along the East Coast.

Economically, it is also hard for more expensive offshore wind to compete with the abundance of renewable energy that Texas already has. Currently, Texas can supply 70% of its electricity demand through renewable power. The cost of offshore wind over the lifespan of the project, or levelized cost of energy, is up to double that of onshore wind -- but is cheaper than coal or nuclear power.

'Energy state' Louisiana eyes offshore

In Louisiana, even the most conservative Republicans have come to see things the way Schellstede did in the 2000s -- that Louisiana has the workforce, the industrial infrastructure and the knowledge to spur offshore wind, not only off the state's Gulf Coast, but around the country.

On May 11, the day before Trump said he would end offshore wind, House majority leader and Trump supporter U.S. Rep. Steve Scalise, R-Louisiana, watched as his wife Jennifer christened the nation's first offshore wind service vessel. Scalise has been a vocal supporter of the industry.

""I think in terms of contrast -- that really represented the opportunity that I see in Louisiana,"" said Jenny Netherton, Louisiana program manager for the nonprofit Southeastern Wind Coalition, who attended the christening in New Orleans.

""People think of us as an oil and gas state, and we are just an energy state,"" Netherton said. ""Because of offshore oil and gas, we have developed this huge vessel industry that is needed for offshore wind. We can build a lot -- and pretty quickly.""

The christened vessel, the Eco Edison, was commissioned by Danish wind developer Ørsted and built by Louisiana's Edison Chouest Offshore. The vessel will service offshore wind in the Atlantic.

A recent report released at the conference by the Southeastern Wind Coalition, Greater New Orleans Inc., the Center for Planning Excellence and The Pew Charitable Trusts found there are 450 companies in Louisiana with the potential to shift toward offshore wind. Fifteen companies in the state already work on offshore wind, including Gulf Island Fabrication, which made the steel structures that support the turbines and other equipment for the Block Island wind farm.

""Louisiana can lead in wind power the same way it has led in oil and gas production,"" Lacy McManus, executive director of future energy for Greater New Orleans Inc., said in announcing the report.

Louisiana's former Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards set a goal of 5,000 MW of offshore wind by 2035. The state has leased its own land under nearshore waters to Vestas and Diamond Offshore Wind for potential development. And in last year's federal sale, RWE leased an offshore parcel in southwest Louisiana. Both projects are still in early stages of development.

It's unclear whether Republican Gov. Jeff Landry supports Edwards' goals; so far the governor, who took office in January, has said nothing publicly about offshore wind. His office did not return a request asking for the governor's position.

""While I have not spoken with Gov. Landry personally, we have heard that he favors the 'all of the above' energy approach,"" Camille Manning-Broome, CEO and president for the nonprofit Center for Planning Excellence in Baton Rouge, told Floodlight. ""Our work with state agency partners does lend itself to continuing this approach of bringing additional sources of energy to the gulf and diversifying our energy portfolio.""

Headwinds to offshore remain

Joshua Basseches is an assistant professor at Tulane University in New Orleans whose work focuses on energy and climate policy and politics. Basseches said he expects disinformation campaigns, like those on the East Coast around whales, along with opposition from the regional fishing industry, might make offshore wind in the Gulf of Mexico difficult.

Others are skeptical of the economics. It will be harder for offshore wind power to compete against the region's favored natural gas power plants, which produce lower cost energy. And building offshore wind farms in the Gulf of Mexico might be more expensive and less efficient than those being built elsewhere because of the risks of hurricanes and its relatively lower wind speeds.

""It doesn't really make a lot of sense,"" BloombergNEF analyst Chelsea Jean-Michel told Heatmap last year. The company, which researches the technologies driving the transition to a lower-carbon economy, confirmed in an email to Floodlight its opinion about the feasibility of offshore wind in the Gulf of Mexico has not changed.

""It's got to be economic. It has to produce the power at a low cost,"" Schellstede agreed. ""It will be interesting to see how this all settles out.""

Ofgem said on Tuesday that the Beatrice wind farm, located off the Scottish coast, had agreed to make a payment of £33m after breaching part of its licence conditions.

The operator breached one of its licence rules by charging excessive prices to cut its power output when needed to prevent the national grid being overloaded. This, in turn, pushed up costs for consumers such as households and businesses, Ofgem said.

Beatrice is one of Scotland's largest offshore wind farms, with 84 turbines located around 8 miles off the Caithness coast. Its turbines are capable of producing energy for up to 450,000 homes.

The wind farm is operated by SSE on behalf of a consortium, Beatrice Offshore Windfarm Limited (Bowl), of which SSE owns 40pc.

Bowl admitted to the breach, describing the issue as ""wholly unintentional"".

Ofgem has been investigating power generators for alleged market manipulation after they were accused of overcharging consumers.

Wind farms are paid to switch off during times of low demand and high output to stop the electricity grid being overwhelmed.

Ofgem was handed a dossier gathered by analysts at the Renewable Energy Foundation (REF), which suggested wind farm companies could be boosting the price of ""virtual energy"" they never actually generated.

The fine for Bowl is the fifth, and largest, handed out by Ofgem for this kind of abuse. The previous record was £23m, which was levied against a power company owned by Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky last October.

Ofgem said in a statement: ""Ofgem has been clear that electricity generators must put in place controls to ensure that their prices are set in a way that ensures that they do not obtain excessive benefits during the periods where they are required to reduce output due to the limitations of the transmission network.

""If they fail to do so, they should expect to face large penalties.""

Bowl has agreed to make the £33.14m payment to Ofgem's redress fund, which supports vulnerable people with their energy needs.

A spokesman for Bowl said: ""Beatrice Offshore Windfarm Limited accepts that it breached one of its electricity generation licence conditions. The breach was in Bowl's view wholly unintentional.

""Bowl will make a payment to the Ofgem consumer redress fund, has reviewed its bid pricing policy and fully cooperated with Ofgem throughout to conclude this process.

""With other industry participants, Bowl is engaging on proposed modifications to the relevant industry code and Ofgem's ongoing consultation on its approach to interpreting and enforcing the transmission constraint licence condition.""

A key lieutenant to Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX, was sentenced to seven and a half years in jail on Tuesday.

Ryan Salame, a former chief executive of FTX's Bahamian subsidiary, pleaded guilty to making tens of millions of dollars in unlawful political campaign donations to boost causes supported by his boss. His prison sentence was longer than the five to seven years sought by prosecutors.

Salame's lawyers had tried to distance him from the FTX fraud. ""He was duped, as was everyone else, into believing that the companies were legitimate, solvent and wildly profitable,"" they said in a filing before the sentencing.

In addition to the prison term, Salame, 30, was sentenced to three years of supervised release and ordered to pay more than $11m (£8.6m).

The Nasdaq hit an all-time record on Tuesday afternoon, after breaching the symbolically important 17,000 level for the first time, buoyed as AI darling Nvidia also jumped to a record high.

Nvidia's gains - of nearly 6pc today - lifted its fellow chip stocks. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index of 30 leading US chip companies rose 1.8pc after traders returned from a holiday weekend.

The rise in AI stocks came even as focus shifted to key inflation data later in the week that could sway expectations for the Federal Reserve's plans for interest rates.

The possibility that the world's most influential central bank could kick off rate cuts this year has sent Wall Street on a record-breaking rally since late 2023, with the Nasdaq and S&P 500 marking their fifth straight week of gains on Friday.

However, expectations for the timing of rate cuts have see-sawed, with policymakers wary as the data still reflects sticky inflation.

Market attention is on the US core Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index report for April, which will be released later in the week. The Fed's preferred inflation barometer is expected to hold steady on a monthly basis.

Peter Andersen, founder of Andersen Capital Management, said:

The FTSE 100 closed down 0.7pc. The top riser was OCado, up 9.8pc, followed by JD Sports, up 5.4pc. The biggest faller was betting group Flutter, down 7.4pc, followed by rival Entain, down 4.7pc.

Meanwhile, the FTSE 250 fell 0.2pc. The top riser was Octopus Renewables Infrastructure Trust, up 6.5pc, followed by Carex owner PZ Cussons, up 5.6pc. The biggest faller was railway food retailer SSP, down 5pc, followed by miner Ferrexpo, down 5pc.

Adam Neumann has abandoned his attempt to regain control of WeWork, the bankrupt office company he founded, five years after he was ousted.

Fund manager Nick Train apologises for ""sustained poor performance""

Stock picker Nick Train has apologised to investors and acknowledged their ""impatience"" over increasingly lacklustre returns in recent years.

Revolution Bars says bid offer from rival is 'incapable of being delivered'

Revolution Bars, the struggling bar group, has shot down a potential takeover offer from rival group Nightcap, as ""incapable of being delivered"".

In a stock market update this morning, Revolution said it had held a series of discussions with Nightcap, which owns brands such as Barrio and Dirty Martini, but that there were a ""number of challenges"" meaning the takeover is ""incapable of being delivered"".

It would require Nightcap to carry out two separate equity fundings, meaning that Revolution would have to raise existing funds to bridge the gap until the deal could be complete. Revolution said it had received an offer on May 17 but it was turned down.

It has asked shareholders to approve a £12.5m fundraising which it says will allow it to see through a restructuring plan.

The biggest drivers of change in the maritime industry are the global and regional environmental regulations that seek to address climate change in shipping. These go far beyond the targets set by the International Maritime Organization; they extend to the European Union and to local rules applied by major maritime nations.

In addition to addressing environmental regulations, the rapid development of technology is also driving evolutions in vessel design operational strategy and is a crucial component of the skillsets required ashore and on board.

The other significant driver to change is geopolitics and the impact of international trade dynamics on shipping. These include both energy independence and energy security, particularly in the context of global security and fluctuating energy prices, which together play a crucial role in accelerating the shift towards the focus on alternative fuels and energy-efficient technologies.

The maritime industry is already in this period of transformation, the first decade of major change and that means class is preparing and evolving too. ABS has established a strong focus on sustainability and digitalisation and the challenges that come with new maritime technologies, providing guidance and practical support to the industry.

The rapid advance of new technology has prompted development of enhanced vessel rules, new standards and certifications for green technologies, advanced digital services for ship performance and analysis and is working on guidelines for alternative fuels and energy-efficient designs.

The energy transition

Support for decarbonisation comes through participation in hundreds of Joint Development Projects, many of them pioneering in the fields of very large ammonia and liquefied CO2 carriers, LNG vessels and carbon-capture technology.

It also requires development of the rules, the guides and the related documents and Approvals in Principle that encourage innovation. These programmes also mean that class must continue to develop in-house talent relative to new technologies and add to our skills base when needed.

ABS operates the Sustainability Group, which has centres with a global reach - in Houston, Denmark, Athens, Singapore and Shanghai - that are assisting our clients on new fronts, to address new challenges with sustainability.

The process of decarbonisation creates safety issues that need to be addressed. One of the most important safety issues is the familiarisation of the crew with new and emerging fuels and technology. For example, the industry has well-established experience in handling ammonia as cargo, but not as fuel, so there is a need for training, education and guidance that enables this to be done safely.

We have begun to address this challenge through the utilisation of simulation technology, which we developed in our global centre in Singapore. Simulation technologies are helping to create scenarios and conditions that mirror the realities of the onboard ship experience. This allows us to offer exceptional training experiences, using multiple simulations to replicate real onboard conditions.

ABS MetaSHIPs, powered by Orka, are one-of-a-kind highly realistic virtual assets. Built to scale from vessel drawings, they take users on virtual field trips - providing a powerful, immersive learning experience in a simulated training environment. Before boarding an ABS MetaSHIP, users will select their vessel and survey type.

Users may also select the vessel age to represent vessel conditions more accurately, such as the level of corrosion of a vessel. Once on board, virtual users put their theoretical and practical training to the test. The MetaSHIP experience is highly engaging, so users interact with the vessel throughout the training - inspecting equipment, taking photographs, viewing certificates, documenting survey notes, and much more.

MetaSHIPs make it possible for seafarers to spend several hours on the deck plate of a vessel before even so much as setting foot on the gangway.

How are skillsets going to change?

When we think of the new skills and competencies required for safety on board the next generation of vessels, it is clear that tomorrow's seafarer is going to have to be more technology-savvy than in previous years.

Quite apart from the array of challenges associated with handling and bunkering the new fuels, they will need literacy in the emerging digital and autonomous ecosystems, as well as an entirely new safety mindset understanding cyber threats, in addition to the traditional physical dangers.

The industry will need to invest in training and development to ensure that these skills are effectively developed. This requires a co-ordinated approach, involving industry, regulators, and training providers, to ensure that seafarers are adequately prepared for the challenges ahead.

ABS is playing its part, pioneering new immersive learning techniques for the benefit of our employees and our clients. Today that means including virtual and augmented reality in our programs. Simulated environments and VR equipment make it possible for users to immerse themselves in whatever world we design for them, such as walking around a ship and interacting with the spaces on board.

In addition to incorporating new technology in training offerings, we continue to focus on rule development to address emerging design challenges. ABS has introduced new marine vessel rules designed to support the development of the next generation of vessel designs and equipment employing the latest technology driven by decarbonisation and digitalisation.

The rule enhancements are a result of a multi-year collaboration with industry, shipyards, shipowners, equipment manufacturers, designers and regulators. They follow the launch by ABS in 2023 the of industry's only Custom Rule Book application. The updated ABS Rules enable shipowners to integrate new technology into their designs with confidence.

How does fuel availability impact the process?

Another issue facing the maritime industry is the speed and scale of the transition to new, alternative marine fuels. There are already many ships on the water that are capable of using alternative fuels, but how many are actually using them? Very few. What that tells us is that the technology is there, but the fuel supply is not.

Even where alternatives are available, they are expensive in comparison to current fuel sources, so economics and availability are going to be the decisive factors in the adoption of these fuels. For example, to create green fuels at scale, you need green electricity, which also needs to be priced realistically. The industry is not there yet and, as a result, the supply of green fuels at competitive price is currently constrained.

It is most likely that by 2050, methanol and ammonia will be the major fuels in use, together with LNG. Issues to be considered include how the availability of these fuels is evolving and their limits and capabilities. The technology for LNG and methanol has been developed and the technology for ammonia is developing, while biofuels present the lowest barrier to adoption from a technology perspective.

The contribution of batteries and hybrid technology should not be underestimated. The quality and capacity of battery storage is evolving, though large ships are not ready to be powered with batteries alone, but there are many ships already in fully electric operation. The use of fuel cells fed by methanol converted from hydrogen also offers a sustainable energy option that has application on a growing number of ships.

Nuclear power is another technology that is developing and creating interest, largely because the new approaches are considered much safer than traditional reactors. Full-scale tests are happening and, while availability and regulation is not yet on the horizon, there is promise in this space.

What is the importance of retrofits?

It is clear that with the alternative fuels available today, there is no way we can reach the IMO 2050 targets without retrofitting a large proportion of the existing fleet with energy-efficiency technologies and carbon capture.

Achieving the reduction targets that have been set for shipping requires the existing fleet to become much more efficient. It will not be possible to completely renew the existing fleet to use alternative fuels by 2050, which means the need to retrofit a large percentage of the existing fleet is essential.

It is possible to achieve much greater efficiency and the increase in the number of available energy-efficiency technologies is proof that owners are responding to this challenge.

There is a significant amount of work to be done between now and 2050 if we hope to hit net zero. Our research also shows that this can be achieved, mapping out a pathway for the industry to get there. We will need to harness the potential of energy-efficiency improvement technologies to reduce aggregate fuel consumption by 15% on the existing fleet and newbuild vessels.

At the same time, we will need carbon capture rolled out across much of the oil burning fleet, reducing onboard CO2 emissions by 70%. Those that do not or cannot adopt carbon capture may need to switch to e-diesel or zero-carbon biofuels.

Carbon capture is a technology that will play a significant role in the transition until 2050. Leaders in the industry have already begun to plan for millions of tons of carbon capture for their onboard emissions, and the technology is scaling up to provide that capability. These initiatives create new demand for handling, transport and storage of carbon, which creates the new opportunity of liquefied CO2 carriers that will feed storage sites or deliver it for use in production of efuels.

This work requires collaboration with vendors and shipowners to understand how this emerging technology can be adapted and absorbed into the maritime industry, its implications for vessel design and operations and its likely impact on carbon emission reduction.

By now, it should be obvious that the energy transition is going to create a completely new generation of ships, particularly new tankers that carry ammonia on a much bigger scale. There may be new types of LNG/ammonia combination carriers and very large ammonia/ethane carriers, as well as LCO2 carriers.

By some estimates, the market will need to develop to about 600 ships - similar to the LNG market - to meet the demand for industrial carbon capture and storage. The development of hydrogen carriers has begun - there are projects underway - and we are working with larger designs that reflect much bigger carrying capacities.

What are the big issues for net zero?

The pathway to net-zero emissions from shipping is a long and complex one. The improvements required all new ships being built to be capable of using dual fuel - or at least be ready to do so. At the same time, there needs to be dramatic improvements to the efficiency of the existing fleet.

The industry is in a continuous process of change. The evolution we are experiencing is large and dramatic and it will happen increasingly quickly. We have not experienced anything like this in the previous 40 years. The change in fuel types, new technology and operating processes - as well as the regulation that governs us - is all, to some extent, new.

There are very challenging times ahead, but it's a great opportunity for all of us to deliver a better world for the next generation.

Minister for the Environment, Eamon Ryan, today launched new reports from the Irish District Energy Association (IrDEA). The reports show that district energy is the most economically viable low carbon heating option for 64% of the Irish population.

The reports also compare the rollout of the technology in six European countries, using this as the basis for recommendations on policies needed to deliver district energy to Irish consumers quickly and at scale. Recommendations include consumer protection measures, and rules on planning and licensing, among others.

District energy networks distribute water, which has been heated at a local energy centre, to buildings through a network of insulated underground pipes eliminating the need for fossil fuels and individual boilers. The benefits include improved energy security, efficiency savings, affordability, better air quality and employment opportunities.

According to IrDEA, the reports make the case for significant state investment to kick-start the sector, which has been tasked with delivering enough heat for 200,000 homes and 2,500 public buildings by 2030, which equates to 10% of building heat demand.

Though well proven in other countries, district energy is not yet common in Ireland. Less than 1% of building heat demand is currently met this way, most commonly through communal schemes. According to the reports launched by Minister Ryan today, this is the most economical way of meeting the heat demand of 67% of buildings across Ireland.

Speaking at the launch, Minister Eamon Ryan said, ""The government is committed to accelerating building heat decarbonisation. District energy is a proven technology, with millions of customers across Europe and beyond, and it can play a key role in improving energy efficiency and reducing emissions in Ireland. That is why we have committed to clear Climate Action Plan targets to deliver up to 2.7 terawatt hours (TWh) of district energy capacity by 2030. I am encouraged to note that this research from IrDEA aligns with the broader policy direction for district heating and I welcome the support of the industry for the Government's decarbonisation programme.""

Irish District Energy Association CEO, Yvonne Murphy said, ""Around 70% of heat demand in countries like Denmark and Sweden is met with district energy right now; Europe-wide, 30 million households and 70 million people rely on district energy. It is a well proven technology that is available right now for deployment in Ireland. There has been a growing commitment by government to using district energy as a key part of its heat dearbonisation strategy, which has been incredibly encouraging for the sector. But we need solid action now to get moving in time to reach our 2030 targets.

""IrDEA is launching this research to set out a roadmap for delivering district energy to the almost two thirds of Ireland's population for whom it would be the most affordable low-carbon heating option. Our key ask today is upfront investment of €1billion in state subsidies to help make that happen.""

David Connolly, Chairperson, and founder of IrDEA added, ""Two decades ago, widespread generation of wind-powered electricity seemed far-fetched to many. Now, after a concerted effort, it's a natural part of our energy supply chain. The same can happen with district heating. The system can use any source of energy including renewable electricity or surplus heat from industry or cooling processes, which is a real game changer as we reduce our reliance on imported oil and gas.

""The key barrier we face as a sector now is the lack of a mechanism to draw down government funding to help finance the rollout of projects. We're optimistic that if the financing barrier is addressed quickly, we could start to see projects materialise in the next 12 to 24 months. According to our research, an investment of around €1billion in the next couple of years could unlock the potential of the sector to deliver affordable, low-carbon heat to consumers across Ireland.""

The Irish District Energy Association is a trade organisation that supports and promotes the growth of the district heating and cooling sector in Ireland. The not-for-profit company has members from across the public, private and academic sectors.

Corre Energy, the storage developer for renewable energy, said on Tuesday it has started a share sale to existing investors to give them a chance to avoid their stakes being diluted by a placing of €2.12 million of stock with founders and a long-term shareholder.

The cash call has been designed to tide the company over as it continues talks to third parties interested in making a significant ""strategic investment"" in a business that was down to just €1.08 million of cash at the end of last year.

Corre said that the amount that will be raised from top-up share sale on Tuesday - being carried out by accelerated bookbuild by Davy - would be decided once all bids for new stock from eligible shareholders are in.

The shares are being offered at 46 cents, in line with the placing last week with founders and the unnamed long-term investor. The company's founding shareholders include former director Darren Patrick Green, who stepped down in February, chief executive Keith McGrane and businessman Brendan Boyd.

[ Corre raises €2.1m of short-term cash from founders and long-term investor ]

Shares in the company have fallen by more than 85 per cent over the past 12 months. This has been partly down to a slump across the wider green energy sector amid a decline in energy prices and the weight of higher interest rates on this capital-intensive sector.

However, according to observers, it is also down to concerns about Corre having failed to sufficiently spell out the financial details of its various projects to allow investors assess their potential for profit.

Corre's most advanced development is its Zuidwending (ZW1) project in the province of Groningen in the Netherlands. ZW1 will be capable of supplying up to 320MW of electricity to the grid and is due to come on stream around the end of 2026.

Other key projects include Corre's 320MW Green Hydrogen Hub project in Denmark, another facility in the Netherlands (ZW2) and a plan to develop three compressed air energy storage plants in caverns secured last year in Germany.",irishtimes.com,news,The Irish Times,,0.3254901960784313,454575123,1,https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/_guoNBTURg0nMZ20oeRLOBkXgw8=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/irishtimes/B337UNETIXTQMZZPZVKBRN7RTY.jpg,

Eskom confirmed recently that Cabinet and board permission had been granted for the continued operation of the three power stations beyond their original decommissioning dates, owing to the ongoing shortage of supply and delays in adding new generation.

Under the original plan, the power stations were scheduled to be retired between 2023 and 2027, following Komati's retirement in October 2022.

PCC executive director Dr Crispian Olver told delegates to a sustainable finance gathering in Sandton, being co-hosted by the International Finance Corporation and Banking Association South Africa, that the initial indications were that the delayed decommissioning would not result in an NDC breach, but that meeting the target in 2030 could be a ""bit of a push"".

However, he did not provide details, saying only that a report would be published soon.Ahead of COP26 in Glasgow in 2021, South Africa lodged an NDC outlining its goal of reducing carbon dioxide-equivalent (CO2-eq) emissions to between 420-million and 350-million CO2-eq tons in 2030.

It subsequently entered into a Just Energy Transition Partnership with France, Germany, the UK, the US and the European Union under which $8.5-billion in concessional and grant finance was pledged in support of South Africa's Just Energy Transition Investment Plan (JET-IP).

The plan, the slow implementation of which has been criticised, outlines the $100-billion in investment needed in electricity, electric vehicles and green hydrogen by 2030 to meet the lower end of the NDC range.

Pledges to the JET-IP have since increased to $11.5-billion, with the Netherlands, Denmark, Canada, Spain and Switzerland also making commitments.

""As the climate commission we are looking long and hard at what [the delayed decommissioning] means in terms of our NDC commitments . . . [and] we will be putting a report out in the next month or so,"" Olver said.

He added that it was ""impossible"" for South Africa to retire coal capacity ""in the middle of a power crisis"".

In addition, having studied the decommissioning of Komati, the PCC felt that the schedule for the subsequent retirements would have to have been delayed regardless of whether Eskom and government were to complete the consultations and planning required to cushion affected workers and communities.

""We think that sequencing around Komati was completely back to front: they took a decision to decommission, then they started some half-hearted consultation, and then they did the economic diversification.

""We want to reverse that: so we want to start with consultations, then do the repurposing and diversification and only then pull the power plants off.

""That in itself is already going to push decommissioning deadlines up by four or five years.

""So, for us, this decision [to delay decommissioning] is not the make or break, it's not going to collapse our climate commitments as a country,"" Olver argued.

He also urged the finance community to acknowledge the ""major reforms"" under way in parallel, which were already having an impact on the real economy and which would require public and private funding support to be advanced and sustained.

These changes were listed as the accelerated investment in private renewables generation that had followed a reforms exempting distributed projects of any size from licensing, including those that were connected to the grid.

Besides the more than 1 400 projects that had been registered since the reform, with a combined capacity of more than 7 100 MW, Olver highlighted that there was also a pipeline of projects with a combined capacity of 22.5 GW at various stages of development. There was also a 10 GW pipeline of renewables, gas-to-power and battery storage projects scheduled to be procured as part of public programmes operated by government.

He also highlighted strong imports of solar panels and batteries over the past two years, underpinned largely by businesses and households that had invested in rooftop solar and storage capacity to mitigate loadshedding.

On the legislative front, the Electricity Regulation Amendment and the Climate Change Bills had been sent to the President for his signature, with the former passed with the aim of facilitating the introduction of a competitive wholesale electricity market.

Olver acknowledged that renewables-enabling grid investment had lagged, but said the new curtailment framework had unlocked about 3.4 GW of connection capacity for wind and that there were strong indications that South Africa would move to integrate independent transmission projects to support the unbundled National Transmission Company South Africa, which would be operationalised in July, to accelerate grid deployments.

""All of this is going to take considerable investment . . . and we estimate that we need about $100-billion by 2030 in the three JET-IP sectors alone.

""And we are probably going to need the equivalent amount of investment into climate resilience and into just transition measures as well.""

Olver said it was, thus, vital for private finance to be upscaled in parallel with the international development finance already pledged and any public finance that could be released without placing additional strains on the fiscus.

He also urged private financiers to increase their ""appetite for risk"", questioning why banks continue to expect State guarantees before funding independent power producers participating in public bidding rounds.

""We've got to wean ourselves off that.

""If we're going to make the entire transmission roll-out contingent upon the same sort of vanilla State guarantee mechanism, we are never going to be able to afford it as a country, and we are never going to get out of the starting blocks.""",mqworld.com,news,Tradelink Publications,Gordon Barratt,0.1372549019607843,454574175,7,https://mqworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/0001134351_resized_crispianolveradamhoughton0524.jpg,

Or follow us on Google News!

A few days ago I published a reaction to a set of reactions to an article on the plummeting cost of batteries and how they enable megawatt scale charging. What were the reactions about? Battery swapping, which many people seem to think is the bees knees and should be everywhere. I disagreed, and people willingly shared data which challenged my argument, for which I thank them. It doesn't, however, change my opinion much, at least not yet.

What is my position on battery swapping? It's four-fold. First, if a battery can be swapped by hand by a person with poor upper body strength, think two- and three-wheelers batteries, there's potential for battery swapping, but it's far from a slam dunk. Second, if batteries are in standard shipping containers and can be moved with standard transshipment terminal equipment like cranes, reach stackers and straddle carriers, then there's a strong opportunity.

Third, the for vehicles in between, a bunch of conditions have to exist for battery swapping to make sense. It has to be a fleet. The fleet has to be homogenous, with a set of close to identical vehicles from the same manufacturers. The fleet has to have very heavy operational requirements. The fleet has to work within a reasonably tight geographical boundary or have very well known routes. The fleet has to be able to be de-risked from vendor lock-in. The volumes have to be very high so that the cost of an automated battery swapping and charging facility, often over a million USD, as well as all of the extra batteries can be amortized across a very large set of swaps per year.

Finally, the market for vehicles with swappable batteries has to be very big and dominated by a few major vehicle manufacturers to accommodate the engineering of swappable batteries and automated swapping systems.

An example are cement trucks in a large urban area, where a set of identical electric trucks are running from the concrete batching plant to work sites in the city, driving to the sites, pouring their concrete and returning for a fresh batch multiple times per day, with multiple shifts per day. This is mostly for Asian construction, which I know from personal experience is a 24/7/365 operation having watched an old sports stadium disappear and then a new, much bigger facility appear from my condo windows in Singapore over a year or so.

Beijing, for example, has roughly 9,000 cement trucks operating out of what I estimate are 30 to 40 concrete batching plants. Beiben is one of biggest suppliers of cement trucks, including electric cement trucks and battery swapping systems for them.

Another example is forklifts, where major 24/7 distribution centers like many of Amazon's might have up to 200 forklifts in the facility, all in fairly constant use.

There is potential for this with drayage trucks in the biggest container ports, the ones that run 24/7, with containers constantly moving from distribution centers to the port and vice versa. As noted in the article on swapping, US ports don't run 24/7, but 21/5 for the most part, unlike most of the rest of the world. There is more potential for drayage swapping globally.

However, there isn't much potential for port ground vehicles because there are only about 120,000 of them in the 900 or so big container ports in the world, there are three or four very differently shaped and sized vehicles, and there are a bunch of different manufacturers.

This is part of one of the data points people who love swapping brought to my attention, that almost 50% of China's electric truck sales in 2022 were swap capable. Most of them referenced an article which extolled this as the future of all electric vehicles, but nobody looked at the ICCT report which the article was based on. That report by China-based ICCT staff visited a number of swapping stations, compiled the statistics and reported on governmental efforts in the space. It is clear that while almost half of vehicles were sold with the capability of swapping their batteries, the number that were actually swapping batteries was much smaller.

In other words, the types of usage patterns I have outlined where it makes sense.

This is a Chinese governmental initiative in certain heavy vehicle segments where it's advantageous, likely following the conditions above, but it's hindered by the complete lack of standardization across manufacturers, one of the conditions of success noted, and by the high cost of automated swapping stations. Once again, this speaks to fleet homogeneity across vehicle manufacturer and vehicle type.

Meanwhile, in Australia a company has a terrible system that involves a human forklift operator swapping batteries on a few trucks. That's not scalable or even remotely interesting except as an example that some people will try anything. It won't end well, and won't spread.

At the other end of the scale, there are two- and three-wheelers. Gogoro was pointed out to me again (and again and again) as if I might be unaware of it. The thing is, Gogoro is a pump and dump SPAC play whose stock is off 85% from the pumped peak and which lost US$70 million last year. The only thing most SPAC plays are good at is the hype part of it, so a lot of people have heard of it and think it's winning. Not so much.

However, at a recent seminar in my India series where I was speaking with assembled electrical utilities resources about storage, I spoke about the lower merit of vehicle to grid vs demand management of charged batteries, and referenced the significant opportunities provided by dirt cheap batteries in terms of buffering electricity at truck stops. This triggered a discussion of battery swapping in India, where the Indian Smart Grid Forum under whose auspices the seminar series is proceeding had done a study of the subject for two- and three-wheelers and recommended that the government require that electric ones be sold without batteries to make the purchase price a lot cheaper.

This worked out fairly well and every village now has two or three swapping stations per the discussion. It's hindered by a lack of standardization across vendors, one of the big challenges of swapping solutions, but it muddles through. However, innumerable non-swapping two- and three-wheelers have been hand built or built in small batches by work shops because it's so cheap and easy to do, and these are also a constant presence on the streets of India. Only about 10% to 15% of two-wheelers have swappable batteries, with a higher percentage among three-wheelers, the combined pickup truck, delivery truck and taxicab of a lot of Indian cities.

At this scale, frail human arms can pull a simple battery with no thermal management systems out of a scooter and drop it into a charging rack, and then reverse the process with a charged battery. Once again, numbers and zero automation make this viable.

Then there's the outlier in the middle, NIO. It sells eight models of cars and SUVs, all with battery swapping as well as the ability to plug in to charge. They've sold almost 500,000 vehicles. According to reports, about 60% of owners use swapping at least occasionally, although actual usage statistics are pretty scant. The public data is a factoid released by the company, not a set of usage statistics, which is quite reasonable. They have around 2,400 swapping stations, almost entirely in China.

They do sell their cars in 13 other countries, and in Europe have some swapping stations, in Norway (10), Germany (9), the Netherlands (9), Sweden (8), and Denmark (1). NIO also operates around 2,179 supercharging stations in China, offering 10,028 chargers. Meanwhile there are about 470,000 high-speed chargers among the roughly 2.1 million public chargers in the country. There are 100,000 gas stations in the country as well.

In other words, in every market that NIO is in, high-speed charging and other charging approaches dominate, including chargers it operates itself in China. The ratios make it clear that battery swapping does not remotely dominate NIO owner patterns and is a convenience that just over half of owners take advantage of when it's convenient and on their way someplace.

For NIO owners in China, the cost of battery swapping is included in some subscription packages. Typically, a subscription that includes six swaps per month for a 70.0-kWh battery pack costs about $142 per month. In Europe, the cost structure includes a flat fee plus a per-kWh charge. As of the latest available information, NIO charges a flat fee of €10 per swap, plus €0.20 per kWh. For example, a 100 kWh battery swap would cost approximately €30 in total. This is actually cheaper than high-speed charging in Europe it turns out, so clearly NIO is pricing the cost of swapping significantly into the price of purchasing the vehicle, including the risk of batteries just going walk about.

As with anything like this, there have been technical glitches, mismatches of available charged batteries to cars wanting them and queues, in part because the space they occupy could house from 6 to 20 fast chargers instead. They also require a lot more maintenance than a fast charger which typically has no moving parts, so regular and unscheduled maintenance is higher, although probably still lower than for hydrogen refueling stations. Reports appear to indicate NIO owner satisfaction and relatively good service, and it's not like electric vehicle charging that's not from Tesla, a couple of European vendors and many Chinese vendors has been highly reliable so far.

Personally, I think NIO is going to give up on this eventually, but perhaps they'll maintain it as a differentiator. They sell high-end cars to well-heeled individuals who undoubtedly consider their time valuable, whether it is or not. But it's not like they are making money doing it. Over the past four years, NIO has reported net losses of $2.98 billion in 2023, $2.07 billion in 2022, $813 million in 2021, and $1.61 billion in 2020, about 75% of their current market capitalization. NIO is ten years old, and Tesla started turning a profit in its tenth year, by comparison. NIO's losses are increasing not decreasing. Here are the losses per vehicle of the equivalent four years in NIO and Tesla over the four equivalent years of their lifespan.

Interestingly, Tesla's losses per vehicle were much higher but radically diminishing. NIO's dropped and were increasingly substantially. Not remotely a firm indicator, but I suspect it's indicative.

Sharp eyes will have noticed I promised four conditions of success and only stated three. Some of them will leave comments, not having the patience to read this far. The fourth pre-condition, at least so far outside of the huge distribution center forklift space, is a governmental initiative to drive battery swapping. That's true in India and true in China. Will it remain true? It's hard to say. China famously crosses the river by feeling for stones with its feet with each step, the extension being that they have an awful lot of feet trying to cross an awful lot of rivers, so the successes are much more obvious than the failures (such as hydrogen for ground transportation). It's very hard for private companies to make battery swapping make economic sense.

As for truck stops on highways? Not a chance they'll be seeing battery swapping systems in my opinion. There's zero consistency of vehicle types, no business model for sharing batteries and a host of other problems. Delivering electricity through chargers is completely reasonable given usage patterns.

Does this mean that battery swapping won't spread more than I consider likely? Of course not. As I frequently say, anything China does at scale is quite likely to be the answer in a lot of other countries as well. That almost half of electric trucks in China were sold with swap-capable batteries, even if they aren't using that capability, makes me sit up and take notice. If data shows that my perspective is wrong, I change my mind. At present I think my take on swapping -- which hasn't changed since the first swapping article -- is more likely correct, but if moving big hunks of metal containing electrons dominates a lot more markets than just moving electrons, I'll be surprised, but lean into it.",cleantechnica.com,news,CleanTechnica,Michael Barnard,-0.03529411764705881,454560839,4,https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DALL·E-2024-05-27-16.48.45-A-panoramic-image-of-a-robotic-arm-taking-a-battery-off-the-back-of-a-truck.-The-scene-is-set-in-a-modern-industrial-environment-with-various-machiner-copy-800x457.png,eng-9609396

In a landmark deal, Ørsted will sell a further one million tonnes of carbon removal over a ten-year period to Microsoft from Avedøre Power Station, which is part of the bioenergy carbon capture and storage (BECCS) project 'Ørsted Kalundborg CO Hub'. This new agreement builds on an existing commitment by Microsoft to buy 2.67 million tonnes from Asnæs Power Station, bringing the total purchase under contract to 3.67 million tonnes of CO.

As part of the 'Ørsted Kalundborg CO Hub', Ørsted will establish carbon capture at its wood chip-fired Asnæs Power Station in Kalundborg in western Zealand and at the Avedøre Power Station's straw-fired boiler in the Greater Copenhagen area. The 430,000 tonnes per year of biogenic CO from the combined heat and power plants will be shipped to a storage reservoir in the Norwegian part of the North Sea and stored permanently. The 'Ørsted Kalundborg COHub' is set to become operational by the beginning of 2026.

The new agreement between Ørsted and Microsoft entails that Microsoft will take one million tonnes of carbon removal from the straw-fired unit at Avedøre Power Station starting in 2026. The combined heat and power plant converts locally sourced straw, which is a by-product of agriculture, into electricity and district heating. By capturing the biogenic carbon from biomass-fired combined heat and power plants and storing it underground, it is possible to not only reduce, but also remove CO from the atmosphere, as biogenic carbon from sustainable biomass is part of a natural biogenic carbon cycle. Thereby, you create negative emissions.

The collaboration between Ørsted and Microsoft will play a vital role in developing the 'Ørsted Kalundborg CO Hub', as bioenergy-based carbon capture and storage is still in its early stages. Even though the project was awarded a subsidy from the Danish Energy Agency, the revenue from the sale of carbon removal certificates was included before the investment decision and then in the offer submitted through the Danish subsidy scheme, which put great emphasis on competitive offers with the lowest amount of subsidy per tonne.

According to the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) latest report, carbon removal technologies such as BECCS are crucial for limiting global warming. This underscores the importance of projects such as the 'Ørsted Kalundborg CO Hub', which can support companies like Microsoft in achieving their sustainability goals and contribute to achieving the global climate targets.

""This expanded collaboration with Microsoft is a testament to our shared vision for a sustainable future. By combining Ørsted's expertise in bioenergy carbon capture and storage with Microsoft's commitment to reducing its carbon footprint, we're showcasing how strategic relations can accelerate the transition to a greener economy.""  Ole Thomsen, Senior Vice President and Head of Ørsted's Bioenergy business

For Microsoft, the agreement represents another large-scale carbon removal deal towards the company's aspiration to be carbon-negative in 2030.

""We're proud once again to announce a landmark offtake agreement with Ørsted, which is pioneering responsible carbon removal development in Denmark while also meeting the needs of a decarbonised energy system. The urgency around climate goals means translating great planning into rapid action - and Ørsted remains a valuable collaborator in bringing big ideas to life. Today's announcement is yet another tangible step towards building the technologies and commercial capabilities towards becoming carbon-negative by 2030.""

Eskom confirmed recently that Cabinet and board permission had been granted for the continued operation of the three power stations beyond their original decommissioning dates, owing to the ongoing shortage of supply and delays in adding new generation.

Under the original plan, the power stations were scheduled to be retired between 2023 and 2027, following Komati's retirement in October 2022.

PCC executive director Dr Crispian Olver told delegates to a sustainable finance gathering in Sandton, being co-hosted by the International Finance Corporation and Banking Association South Africa, that the initial indications were that the delayed decommissioning would not result in an NDC breach, but that meeting the target in 2030 could be a ""bit of a push"".

However, he did not provide details, saying only that a report would be published soon.

Ahead of COP26 in Glasgow in 2021, South Africa lodged an NDC outlining its goal of reducing carbon dioxide-equivalent (CO2-eq) emissions to between 420-million and 350-million CO2-eq tons in 2030.

It subsequently entered into a Just Energy Transition Partnership with France, Germany, the UK, the US and the European Union under which $8.5-billion in concessional and grant finance was pledged in support of South Africa's Just Energy Transition Investment Plan (JET-IP).

The plan, the slow implementation of which has been criticised, outlines the $100-billion in investment needed in electricity, electric vehicles and green hydrogen by 2030 to meet the lower end of the NDC range.

Pledges to the JET-IP have since increased to $11.5-billion, with the Netherlands, Denmark, Canada, Spain and Switzerland also making commitments.

""As the climate commission we are looking long and hard at what [the delayed decommissioning] means in terms of our NDC commitments . . . [and] we will be putting a report out in the next month or so,"" Olver said.

He added that it was ""impossible"" for South Africa to retire coal capacity ""in the middle of a power crisis"".

In addition, having studied the decommissioning of Komati, the PCC felt that the schedule for the subsequent retirements would have to have been delayed regardless of whether Eskom and government were to complete the consultations and planning required to cushion affected workers and communities.

""We think that sequencing around Komati was completely back to front: they took a decision to decommission, then they started some half-hearted consultation, and then they did the economic diversification.

""We want to reverse that: so we want to start with consultations, then do the repurposing and diversification and only then pull the power plants off.

""That in itself is already going to push decommissioning deadlines up by four or five years.

""So, for us, this decision [to delay decommissioning] is not the make or break, it's not going to collapse our climate commitments as a country,"" Olver argued.

He also urged the finance community to acknowledge the ""major reforms"" under way in parallel, which were already having an impact on the real economy and which would require public and private funding support to be advanced and sustained.

These changes were listed as the accelerated investment in private renewables generation that had followed a reforms exempting distributed projects of any size from licensing, including those that were connected to the grid.

Besides the more than 1 400 projects that had been registered since the reform, with a combined capacity of more than 7 100 MW, Olver highlighted that there was also a pipeline of projects with a combined capacity of 22.5 GW at various stages of development. There was also a 10 GW pipeline of renewables, gas-to-power and battery storage projects scheduled to be procured as part of public programmes operated by government.

He also highlighted strong imports of solar panels and batteries over the past two years, underpinned largely by businesses and households that had invested in rooftop solar and storage capacity to mitigate loadshedding.

On the legislative front, the Electricity Regulation Amendment and the Climate Change Bills had been sent to the President for his signature, with the former passed with the aim of facilitating the introduction of a competitive wholesale electricity market.

Olver acknowledged that renewables-enabling grid investment had lagged, but said the new curtailment framework had unlocked about 3.4 GW of connection capacity for wind and that there were strong indications that South Africa would move to integrate independent transmission projects to support the unbundled National Transmission Company South Africa, which would be operationalised in July, to accelerate grid deployments.

""All of this is going to take considerable investment . . . and we estimate that we need about $100-billion by 2030 in the three JET-IP sectors alone.

""And we are probably going to need the equivalent amount of investment into climate resilience and into just transition measures as well.""

Olver said it was, thus, vital for private finance to be upscaled in parallel with the international development finance already pledged and any public finance that could be released without placing additional strains on the fiscus.

He also urged private financiers to increase their ""appetite for risk"", questioning why banks continue to expect State guarantees before funding independent power producers participating in public bidding rounds.

""We've got to wean ourselves off that.

""If we're going to make the entire transmission roll-out contingent upon the same sort of vanilla State guarantee mechanism, we are never going to be able to afford it as a country, and we are never going to get out of the starting blocks.""",engineeringnews.co.za,news,Engineering News,Terence Creamer,0.1137254901960785,454519135,7,https://cdn.creamermedia.com/assets/articles/images/resized/0001134351_resized_crispianolveradamhoughton0524.jpeg,

Miloš Bogdanović from Kotor, Montenegro, and Špiro Ivošević, professor at the Faculty of Maritime Studies in Kotor, authored the study. The basis for its preparation is Bogdanović's master's thesis on the potential of offshore wind in Montenegro, which he recently defended. The study was published in international scientific journal MDPI Energies.

Bogdanović told Balkan Green Energy News that Montenegro is significantly lagging in offshore wind farm development, especially considering the fact that the first such facility was built in Denmark already in 1991.

The area suitable for wind farms is estimated at 766 square kilometers

He stressed that the results of researching average annual wind speeds have enabled the precise determination of an area estimated to be suitable for the construction of offshore wind farms. An analysis of bathymetry databases for the defined area led to the idendification of the necessary technical solutions for the supporting structures of wind turbines.

The authors concluded that a wind farm could be built on a single lot with a surface of 767 square kilometers. It is located south of the municipality of Ulcinj, along the maritime border with Albania, Bogdanović explained.

The shortest distance between the specified area and the coastline (Cape Đeran or Rt Đeran) is approximately 1.4 kilometers, while the furthest point is 47.8 kilometers away.

The estimated technical potential of the identified area is 2,300 MW. According to the study, most of it, 2,030 MW, could be utilized with floating structures, because the sea depths are greater than 60 meters. At less than 50 meters, bottom-fixed towers, monopiles, can hold 127 MW. Jacket structures, also fixed at the seabed, are suitable for the remaining 139 MW, the document reads.

Bogdanović pointed out that unlike fixed structures, which have been successfully applied worldwide for over three decades, floating solutions are innovative technologies, commercially implemented for the first time in 2017.

Although the current installation costs of offshore wind farms using floating structures are significantly higher than for bottom-fixed turbines, they are expected to decrease a lot by 2028 and become competitive, he stressed.

The study notes the identified maritime area suitable for wind farms is state-controlled, so that there would be no expropriation issue like it is often the case with onshore wind farms.

The current legal framework doesn't recognize offshore wind farms generating electricity, thus the first condition is to introduce the activity, the authors said.

The study suggests that the government needs to declare an exclusive economic zone in line with the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), following the example of Croatia.

The identified sea area extends across seven offshore blocks that the government designated for hydrocarbon exploration and production.

The technical wind potential of the area is defined as the product of the sea surface of the area with average annual wind speeds from seven to eight meters per second and a value of 3 MW per square kilometer.",balkangreenenergynews.com,news,Balkan Green Energy News,Vladimir Spasić,0.1137254901960785,454517287,1,https://balkangreenenergynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/montenegro-offshore-wind-farms-study.jpg,

Climate change made last winter the second wettest on record, quite an achievement for British weather, causing flooding and damaging farmland.

Now, after 14 years of at best soggy progress on climate and energy, it's up to the likely winners, the Labour Party, and other contenders to show they can do better.

What have the Conservatives got right? The signature achievement is that Britain has been the fastest-decarbonising major country. Between 2010, when the Conservative Party entered power in a coalition, and 2023, emissions dropped 37 per cent.

The government was tough on Russia following its invasion of Ukraine, after senior figures had previously flirted with Moscow. In September, it approved the development of Rosebank, the largest undeveloped oilfield on the UK's continental shelf. Positive for British energy security and tax revenue, this will make little net difference to greenhouse gas emissions.

The decarbonisation achievement is less than it appears at first sight. It was aided by some warm winter weather in 2022-23 and 2023-24, and also reflects a sluggish economy, the after-effects of the Covid pandemic and soaring energy bills in the 2022 crisis.

More importantly, it is mainly a result of eliminating coal from electricity generation in favour of gas and renewables - mostly onshore and offshore wind and bio-energy. This is a trick that only works once. After the recent flop of a badly planned offshore wind auction, it's not clear how the country will keep the lights on and bills in check while cutting down the remaining use of gas.

And much less progress has been made on decarbonising transport, heavy industry or the Conservative-leaning farming business.

The biggest failings lie in a lack of ambition, a readiness to be blown around by the winds of fortune, or newspaper headlines. There have been more energy ministers than prime ministers - 11 in 14 years - in an ever-shifting portfolio that sometimes included business, industry or climate. Not surprisingly, major long-term and expensive projects such as new nuclear reactors and carbon capture and storage have made achingly slow progress, with frequent U-turns.

Having promised ""the greenest government ever"" on entering coalition in 2010, the first of a run of five Conservative prime ministers, David Cameron, decided in 2013 to slash a swathe of environmental policies from bills, such as support for renewable energy, insulation and heat pumps. Political donors in the housing industry wanted to cut construction costs.

What were then record energy bills of £1,400 ($1,780) per year for an average household soared to £2,500 in 2023, even including a substantial subsidy. Russia's squeeze on European gas markets was not the British government's fault, but its failure to improve Britain's dismal home insulation and energy efficiency should be laid squarely at its door.

These rising concerns about the cost of living, and specifically energy, gave an opening to blame ""net-zero"" policies. This is not solely a British phenomenon, but a trend repeated across Europe. In November, the far-right PVV party came first in the Netherlands's elections after promising ""we will stop the hysterical reduction of CO2"".

In September, Mr Sunak put back a ban on the sales of new petrol and diesel cars by five years to 2035, and delayed the phase-out of gas boilers in favour of heat pumps in homes. The government theoretically reversed its long-standing effective ban on new onshore wind projects, but retained obstacles on local consultation that mean no new wind farms have been started.

The only one of 16 by-elections in the past two years won by the Conservatives was in suburban London where the party played on fears about mayor Sadiq Khan's ""ultra-low emission zone"" for vehicles.

The Labour Party has a much more pro-environmental agenda. So do most of the other opposition parties, other than the hard-right Reform insurgents - the Liberals, the Scottish and Welsh nationalists and, of course, the Greens, who may secure two seats.

Labour's challenges fall into four areas. First, to balance big ambitions with fiscal credibility, after February's decision to water down an annual £28 billion ($35.66 billion) low-carbon transformation to £4.7 billion. Retaining or increasing the ""windfall"" tax on offshore oil and gas production is financially tempting but would be foolish for deterring investment, now that prices are nowhere near windfall levels.

Second, to define the roles of state, nationalised and private business. Great British Energy, a new state-owned renewable company, will be capitalised with £8.3 billion. But what is it really going to do - invest in proven renewable deployment that the private sector already does perfectly well? Scale up emerging technology, with potentially big pay-offs, but also risks and competition from the US, EU and China? Or enable new infrastructure such as grids and offshore wind connections, that could cut overall costs and bureaucracy? Would it also invest abroad, as the national champions it seems to emulate do, such as Denmark's Ørsted, Norway's Equinor, France's EDF - or even the UAE's Masdar?

Third, to manage the tension between traditional support from trade unions and industrial areas, and concerns from the general public about living costs and lifestyles, with the need to cut emissions in areas beyond the power sector. Home energy efficiency improvements can be piecemeal and disruptive, but are essential and ultimately beneficial.

Fourth, to be pragmatic in the face of simplistic demands from climate campaigners. new oil and gas developments, even those that bring in jobs and tax revenue, are funded by private capital, and don't add to net emissions. There will be reflexive opposition to carbon capture and storage, crucial for decarbonising heavy industry but seen as aligned with fossil fuel interests. Yet Britain, with Norway, has by far Europe's best carbon dioxide storage potential.

Fifth, to rebuild the relationship with the EU. This goes far beyond energy and climate, of course, encompassing the whole Brexit debacle. The UK's carbon price is well below that in the EU, exposing its exporters to penalties. Integrating renewable-heavy grids and competing with global giants in new energy technology in China and the US will need much more co-operation with the European single market.

The environment ranks about fourth on Britons' top issues, well behind the economy, health and immigration. It may not change many voters' minds. But if the next prime minister doesn't want to appear a drip outside Downing Street, getting energy and climate right is essential.",thenationalnews.com,news,The National,Robin Mills,0.1607843137254903,454475313,1,https://thenational-the-national-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/LKASONRZJNAVTG4MC6VR33OBW4.jpg?smart=true&auth=917ce8dd33351042e44eec471fd6ad909538f0545e20bbd9c1cdb88da84dc5ac&width=1200&height=630,

The daily supply, however, is approximately 3,056mmcf, leading to a daily deficit of roughly 824mmcf.

The sector-wise deficit is as follows: Electricity: 452.65mmcf, industry: 197.52mmcf, households: 82.3mmcf, fertilizer: 57.61mmcf, compressed natural gas: 24.69mmcf and commercial: 8.23mmcf, resulting in a 21.21 per cent shortfall across sectors.

Two floating storage and regasification units, FSRU, are now used for receiving liquefied natural gas from imported ships and putting it into our gas supply system. Liquefied natural gas is unloaded from ships into these FSRUs, each with a capacity of 500mmcf.

Therefore, to import more liquefied natural gas, the number of FSRUs and their facilities would need to be increased. Additionally, the national grid's pipeline has not been equipped to handle more than 1,000mmcf. As a result, it is currently not feasible to import additional liquefied natural gas and supply it to the national grid. Moreover, establishing these facilities is time-consuming.

The average per year import cost for the four financial years from 2018-19 to 2021-22 amounts to Tk 21,416.75 crore. If the current deficit of 824mmcf were to be met through imports, the cost would nearly double the current expenditure on liquefied natural gas import, given that currently 1,041mmcf are imported.

However, it is evident that the government lacks the financial capacity to address this shortfall. Furthermore, even if additional liquefied natural gas were imported, technical constraints such as the lack of existing facilities would hinder its unloading and supply to the national grid.

Currently, the supply of natural gas to the national transmission line comes from two sources. First, extraction and supply from domestic gas fields, amounting to around 2,015mmcf, and second, supply through the purchase of liquefied natural gas from the international market, amounting to around 1,041mmcf,. Thus, domestically produced gas accounts for 66 per cent, or two-thirds, of the total supply, while imported liquefied natural gas accounts for 33 per cent, or one-third of the total supply.

The gas extracted from domestic fields is connected to the pipeline from two sources: 791mmcf through state-owned gas companies and the remaining 1,224mmcf through international oil companies.

Two international companies supply around 1,224mmcf of gas. Of this, Chevron supplies 1,191mmcf from three gas fields, with the Bibiyana field alone contributing 1,016mmcf. The other company supplies 33mmcf from one gas field.

Approximately 33 per cent of the country's current total gas supply, which amounts to 1,016mmcf out of 3056mmcf, is sourced from Chevron's Bibiyana gas field. Survey projections indicated that the recoverable gas reserves of this field, estimated at 5.755 trillion cubic feet, were to be depleted by November 2023.

Given this projection, the supply from the Bibiyana gas field, which constitutes one-third -- 1,016mmcf -- of the total supply, from November 2023 to April 2024, can be considered beyond the proven reserves or essentially a bonus. However, it is important to note that this supply could cease at any time.

If the Bibiyana gas field ceases operation, our domestic gas supply would reduce to 999mmcf, comprising 175mmcf from Chevron, 33mmcf from Tallu, and 791mmcf from state-owned companies. This would result in a shortfall of 2,881mmcf, accounting for about 75 per cent of our total demand of 3,880mmcf, considering the current deficit, liquefied natural gas import, and Bibiyana's contribution.

In other words, if the supply from the Bibiyana gas field ceases, which could happen at any time, approximately three-quarters, 74.25 per cent, of the total gas demand would need to be met by importing liquefied natural gas. In this scenario, only one-quarter of our current demand could be met by domestic natural gas production.

Currently, we import 1,041mmcf of liquefied natural gas. In the future, nearly three times this amount will need to be imported. This would require nearly three times the current expenditure on liquefied natural gas import. Moreover, it would not be feasible to import, unload, and supply such an amount of liquefied natural gas with the existing infrastructure.

Presently, the state-owned and international companies operating in the country have an estimated recoverable gas reserve of approximately 9.12 trillion cubic feet. Given our increasing demand, this reserve will be depleted within the next 5-6 years. If no new gas fields are discovered and production does not commence within this period, we will have to import the entire amount of our gas demand.

In other words, under the current circumstances, it is feared that almost the entire gas demand as an energy source will become import-dependent. Consequently, it can be said with certainty that the current situation poses a peril to energy security.

From 2018-19 to 2021-22, a total of Tk 1,10,703 crore was spent on gas purchases. It is noteworthy that state-owned gas production companies meet 26 per cent of our total gas demand but account for only 5.25 per cent -- Tk 5,828 crore -- of the total gas purchase cost. On the other hand, international produced gas companies supply 40 per cent of the total demand but account for 17.38 per cent -- Tk 19,208 crore -- of the total cost. Imported LNG meets 34 per cent of the demand but incurs the highest cost, accounting for 77.37 per cent -- Tk 85,667 crore -- of the total expenditure.

Simplifying the costs and supply amounts for gas purchases from various sources yields the following results: The cost of paying for one mmcf of gas from foreign companies operating in Bangladesh is 2.14 times higher than that of domestically produced gas by state-owned companies. The same for imported liquefied natural gas is 11.2 times higher.

The price of domestically produced gas per 1,000 cubic feet ranges from $1-3. The price of imported liquefied natural gas ranges from $12-40 -- 12 dollars for long-term purchase contracts and 35-40 dollars in the spot market. Thus, the cost of imported liquefied natural gas is 4-15 times higher than that of domestically produced gas.

We have a demand for gas. Despite supplying gas to the best of our ability, there are significant shortages in each sector, according to current demand. We continue to increase the demand for gas-based power plants, different gas-based industries, and assorted other uses of gas.

In this context, the obvious question arises: Why are we not focusing on domestic production to reduce import dependency? Is there no availability or production potential for natural gas in the country?

In 2001, a joint survey was conducted by the USGS and Petrobangla on the undiscovered natural gas reserves in the western and southern regions. According to their data, these areas have a potential gas reserve of 32tcf. Again, in 2018, Denmark's Ramboll consultancy company conducted a survey in the same areas and estimated a reserve of 34tcf of natural gas. Therefore, the western and southern regions have reserves of 32-34tcf of gas.

In a few years, production from the existing domestic gas fields will be nearing its end. According to reliable expert surveys, there are reserves of gas in new domestic gas fields. However, we are not focusing on exploration and production.

There is an allegation from various quarters that greater emphasis is being placed on imports to benefit vested interests, leading to a lack of interest in production from domestic gas fields. It is hard to find arguments to completely dismiss this claim.

Here is a summary of the gas exploration and production activities of domestic and international companies in Bangladesh: State-owned gas companies had a success rate of 50 per cent after drilling 18 exploration wells and spending Tk 6,832 crore in the last 23 years. In comparison, international gas companies had a success rate of 25 per cent after drilling 8 wells and spending Tk 56,545 crore in the same period.

Thus, the cost of gas exploration by state-owned companies is lower compared to that by foreign companies engaged in this sector. The success rate in exploration is higher for domestic companies. As mentioned earlier, the price of gas produced by state-owned companies is also the lowest. It can be said that it would have been desirable to make state-owned gas companies more active in gas exploration and production.

To bolster future energy security, it is crucial to focus on exploring, extracting and utilising gas from new domestic fields to ensure a reliable supply of natural gas amid uncertainties surrounding its availability in the energy mix. This would necessitate enhancing the capabilities and creating opportunities for domestic companies in the gas sector.",newagebd.net,news,New Age | The Most Popular Outspoken English Daily in Bangladesh,,0.1529411764705881,454443366,1,https://outspoken.newagebd.com/files/img/202405/d26406a444039c317f8fbda7b86cae50_og.jpg,

This transformative and bold effort aims to turn Africa's vast, sun-drenched Sahel region - one of the most vulnerable regions in the world - into a powerhouse of solar energy, targeting 11 countries: Burkina Faso, Chad, Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, and Sudan.

By harnessing the region's immense solar potential, Desert to Power seeks to generate 10 gigawatts of solar power by 2030, thereby facilitating access to electricity for 250 million people.

The Desert to Power project will produce up to 10 GW of solar energy to supply 250 million people in 11 Sahel countries with photovoltaic power.

The ground-breaking project is the brainchild of Bank President Dr Akinwumi Adesina who has termed it the Bank's ""baobab"".

""Desert to Power is what I call the baobab of projects. It will require all our efforts if we are to effect change,"" he told a COP meeting.

The president of the African Development Bank, Dr. Akinwumi Adesina, who is spearheading the initiative, considers Desert to Power to be the ""baobab"" of the Bank's projects because of its scale, its scope, the number of people who will benefit and its importance for the economy and people's lives.

Last December, the Bank approved the 225 kV Mauritania-Mali Power Interconnection and related Solar Power Plants Development Project (PIEMM) which is a priority operation under that Desert to Power Initiative. The project will help develop regional electricity trade in the Sahel, allow Mali to import about 600 GWh of electricity from renewable energy sources from Mauritania each year and enable both Mali and Mauritania to increase their national electricity access rate and to improve the performance of their electricity sub-sector by reducing fuel consumption, and shutting down several generators with exorbitant operating costs thus reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Ultimately, the project is expected to connect 100,000 new households (80,000 in Mauritania and 20,000 in Mali).

The initiative presents a major step along the way to solving Africa's critical energy access issues and reducing dependence on fossil fuels like heavy fuel oil. These are key drivers of environmental fragility in the region, worsening climate warming behind many of the dramatic weather events now regularly hitting the continent.

The Bank has also successfully leveraged climate finance from international sources like the Green Climate to blend with the Bank's own resources to support the Desert to Power initiative.

Additionally, the Bank's Sustainable Energy Fund for Africa (SEFA), the Bank's largest in-house blended finance facility with commitments of over US $500 million from 10 donors, including Denmark, the United States, the United Kingdom, Italy, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Germany, the Nordic Development Fund, and the Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet, is providing catalytic capital for private sector projects across the Desert to Power countries and beyond.

Today, the Desert to Power portfolio counts 10 investment projects and over 15 technical assistance operations across 7 of the 11 countries of operation.

The initiative has drawn plaudits from policy makers, diplomats, politicians and media commentators.

The authoritative British newspaper the Financial Times (FT) recently hailed it as a showcase example of imaginative development projects of the type Africa needs to engage its populations and prevent regional unrest exploited by anti-state actors.

In an article, endorsed by its editorial board, the FT called on Western governments to back the project along with similar initiatives directed at improving people's daily lives. Development brings stability, it argued.

The initiative is part of a broader effort to transition Africa towards more sustainable energy sources, helping mitigate deforestation and its associated impacts.

Desert to power will provide on-grid and off-grid electricity to the people of the Sahel.

In Africa, deforestation is a significant issue, with an area equivalent to the size of Switzerland being cleared of forest annually, largely for cooking and heating purposes. This loss of forest exacerbates dust storms, disrupts rain patterns, and accelerates desertification, posing severe threats to biodiversity and local climates.

The Bank's investment in solar energy is crucial for several reasons. Firstly, reliable and affordable energy is essential for reducing reliance on charcoal, which is not only a leading cause of deforestation, but also an expensive option for many households. The continent's rapid population growth has intensified energy demands, with the population doubling and doubling again to at least 1.2 billion, nearly half of whom lack access to electricity.

While there are ongoing reforestation projects in countries like Kenya, Congo, Madagascar, and Malawi, the rate of forest loss far outpaces these efforts. The immediate need is to electrify the continent quickly, choosing sustainable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydro over more harmful fossil fuels.

Africa's potential for renewable energy is vast but largely untapped. The continent has an almost unlimited solar capacity (11 TW), significant hydro resources (350 GW, with only between five and six percent currently harnessed), wind power (110 GW, with only two percent utilized), and geothermal energy sources (15 GW).

Despite this potential, 600 million people in Africa live without access to electricity. The continent accounts for just six percent of global energy demand and slightly over three percent of electricity demand. This underscores the importance of scaling up renewable energy investments to meet the continent's energy needs sustainably.

The Cellarhead BESS project will be connected to National Grid's Cellarhead sub-station and will provide the UK with additional energy security and reliability.

Construction is anticipated to commence on site this year with connection to the electricity grid anticipated at the end of 2026. With a maximum energy capacity of 624 megawatt hours, the Cellarhead BESS project will support the UK's ambition to achieve net zero, supporting the increased penetration of clean energy generation, decrease reliance on fossil fueled generation, and ultimately mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

Atlantic Green was established in 2021, as a joint venture between two entrepreneurial shareholders Nofar Energy, and Interland Group, as a UK-based platform to invest, develop, and operate grid-scale standalone battery energy storage systems across the UK. With a mission to develop a c.2 GW capacity of battery energy storage to fuel the UK's clean energy transition, the Cellarhead BESS represents a key milestone for both Atlantic Green's development journey and wider sustainability objectives. As part of the BESS project Ameresco entered into an EPC and O&M contract including battery supply, balance of plant, warranty, and availability guarantees. The EPC full wrap price is c. $249 million (196.5 million GBP). Tier 1 OEM Envision Energy will provide the BESS and associated services, as well as the equipment warranties.

Ameresco and Atlantic Green expect to finish the BESS and secure grid connection by the middle of 2026. Following completion, Atlantic Green will own and operate the BESS as an energy storage asset.

'We believe that a continuous development of battery energy storage is a vital step in the UK's journey to achieving net-zero carbon emissions, and we are excited to team up with Ameresco to bring this vision to life,' said Nick Bradford, Managing Director of Atlantic Green. 'Since our founding, Atlantic Green has consistently prioritized finding strategic ways to leverage our battery storage assets with the wider community and we are eager to answer the rising demand for battery storage with this new project with such a level of energy capacity, to really make the impact on the UK electricity system that is much needed.'

'We're excited to announce our collaboration with Atlantic Green to construct one of the largest battery energy storage projects in the United Kingdom,' said Mark Apsey, MBE, Senior Vice President of UK Operations at Ameresco. 'Energy storage is one of the key technologies required to achieve the UK's net zero targets. Atlantic Green's strong company leadership and robust track record of developing similar projects makes them an excellent partner in this endeavor. Together, Ameresco and Atlantic Green will help support the UK's progress towards increased power autonomy and achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.'

'This project exemplifies our commitment to pushing the boundaries of battery storage technology, a cornerstone of sustainable energy systems,' said Kane Xu, Global VP, Envision Energy. 'Partnering with Atlantic Green and Ameresco allows us to demonstrate the pivotal role that advanced battery solutions play in enhancing energy security and enabling a seamless transition to renewable energy sources. We are proud to contribute our cutting-edge technology to this landmark UK initiative.'

It added, however, that Moscow is now intensifying its assault on other parts of the front.

Kyiv has been battling a fresh Russian land assault in the northeastern Kharkiv region since May 10, when thousands of Moscow's troops stormed the border, making their biggest territorial advances in 18 months.

Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, visited the region's capital on Friday to discuss the battle for Vovchansk, a town that sits fewer than three miles from the Russian border.

The army said on Friday: ""The Ukrainian defence forces have stopped Russian troops in the Kharkiv sector.

""The situation is under control, counter-offensive actions are under way.""

Oleksandr Syrsky, Ukraine's commander-in-chief, said on social media that, despite Russia's initial success, ""the enemy has got completely bogged down in street battles for Vovchansk and suffered very high losses in assault units.""

In an attempt to seize the town, Russia ""is currently moving reserves from different sectors to support active assault operations, but to no avail"", Syrsky added.

He warned, however, that the situation was turbulent on the eastern front, where Moscow says its forces have made a string of gains in the past two weeks.

Fighting near the eastern towns of Chasiv Yar, Pokrovsk and Kurakhove has been particularly ""intense"", he said.

Russia said on Thursday it had made inroads near the city of Bakhmut in Ukraine's eastern region of Donetsk.

Just three days earlier it claimed to have seized the village of Bilohorivka, a key target for Moscow, which is seeking to wrest control of the entire Lugansk region from Kyiv.

Moscow said it launched the offensive in Ukraine's northeast to create a ""buffer zone"" along the border to prevent future Ukrainian attacks on its territory.

As Ukraine rushed troops to the northeast, Kyiv again accused Moscow of deliberately targeting civilians in strikes.

Ukrainian Railways, the state-owned train operator, reported a flurry of attacks on Kharkiv's railway system overnight that damaged tracks, train carriages and buildings.

""The enemy continues to make deliberate attempts to stop the railway in the Kharkiv region,"" it said on Telegram.

The company shared photos showing smoke rising from a wrecked carriage, twisted metal and debris beside tracks and a depot with some blown-out windows.

It said long-distance and suburban trains were running as scheduled despite repeated Russian strikes on the network, which is vital for both civilians and the military.

Strikes on Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, killed at least seven people on Thursday, local authorities said.

More than 11,000 people in the wider region have been evacuated since Russia began its new offensive two weeks ago, according to Oleg Synegubov, a local governor.

Separately, Ukraine fired missiles overnight at the Russian-occupied Crimean peninsula. Sergei Aksyonov, the Russian-installed head of the region, said the strikes killed two ""chance passers-by"".

Thank you for following today's live coverage of the war in Ukraine.

The day's key developments were:

Russia and Belarus will tighten their cooperation in industry and technology in the face of Western sanctions against both their economies, presidents Vladimir Putin and Alexander Lukashenko said on Friday.

We reported earlier that Putin arrived for a two-day visit in Belarus on Wednesday, where he will discuss nuclear weapons with his ally (see post at 12:06 pm).

Russian forces have become ""bogged down"" in attempts to seize the border-town Vovchansk, but have sharpened their offensive elsewhere along the eastern front, Ukraine's top general said on Friday.

Kyiv has been battling a fresh Russian land assault on its northeastern Kharkiv region since May 10, when thousands of Moscow's troops stormed the border, making their biggest territorial advances in 18 months.

Despite initial success , ""the enemy has got completely bogged down in street battles for Vovchansk and suffered very high losses in assault units', said Ukrainian commander-in-chief Oleksandr Syrsky on social media.

In an attempt to seize the town, Russia ""is currently moving reserves from different sectors to support active assault operations, but to no avail"", Mr Syrsky added.

Although he warned that the situation on the eastern front was unstable, where Russia claims its forces have made a series of gains in the past two weeks.

Fighting near the eastern towns of Chasiv Yar, Pokrovsk and Kurakhove has been particularly ""intense"", he added.

The fresh offensive on the region has seen more than 11,000 people evacuate.

World Bank President Ajay Banga said on Friday that he is ""absolutely"" open to the idea of managing a fund for Ukraine that would pay out a G7 loan to the war-ravaged country.

The sum would be based on the earnings from frozen Russian assets, at least for non-military purposes, Mr Banga said.

""All I know is that if they do decide to give it to us, would I be ready? Yeah,"" Mr Banga said at a meeting of G7 finance ministers called to tackle the concept of such a loan.

He added: ""I could manage a fund of that type. I would need safeguards, I would need to make sure our people understand how to use it.""

Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, held a meeting on the regional situation in Kharkiv on Friday.

""We paid special attention to the housing needs of our people who had been displaced from Kharkiv region territories targeted by enemy shelling,"" he wrote on X.

Ukraine has freed at least 50 convicts under a new law that allows them to serve in exchange for the possibility of parole, as part of a wider effort to replenish Ukraine's depleted forces.

It is unclear how many prisoners in total have been released since the law was enacted a week ago.

Denys Maliuska, Ukraine's justice minister, said that 10,000 to 20,000 prisoners could be recruited.

We reported earlier that the number of convicts in Russian prisons dropped by 58,000 last year, as prisoners are promised a pardon if they survive six months fighting on the front lines (see post at 9:55 am).

Russia has detained two more senior military figures - the deputy head of the army's General Staff and a senior procurement official at the defence ministry - as a bribery scandal intensifies, investigators said on Thursday.

The arrests of Lieutenant-General Vadim Shamarin and ministry official Vladimir Verteletsky bumped the number of arrested military officials to five in a single month.

The crackdown signals a major effort to crack down on corruption surrounding the awarding of lucrative military contracts at a time when Russian forces are fighting in Ukraine.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will travel to Spain on Sunday and will meet with Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez and King Felipe on Monday, said sources familiar with his movements.

It comes after Zelensky was forced to suspend all international visits last week amid tense fighting in the Kharkiv region.

Ukrainian forces have ""stopped"" Russia from advancing further into the northeastern Kharkiv region and are now counter-attacking, but Moscow is intensifying its assault on other parts of the front, Ukraine's army said Friday.

Kyiv has been battling a fresh Russian land assault on its northeastern Kharkiv region since May 10, when thousands of Moscow's troops stormed the border, making their biggest territorial advances in 18 months.

Vladimir Putin is ready to halt the war in Ukraine with a negotiated ceasefire that recognises the current battlefield lines, Russian sources have said.

The Russian leader had expressed frustration to a small group of advisers about Western attempts to stymie negotiations, three of the sources, who are familiar with discussions in Putin's inner circle, told Reuters.

They added that he was also vexed by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's decision to rule out further truce talks.

""Putin can fight for as long as it takes, but Putin is also ready for a ceasefire - to freeze the war,"" said one of the sources, a senior Russian figure who has worked with the Kremlin chief.

Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the Russian President had repeatedly made clear Russia was open to ceasefire discussions, saying the country did not want ""eternal war.""

Ukraine is seeking to maximise possible imports of electricity from European Union countries to compensate for the generation capacity destroyed by the Russian attacks, Ukrainian energy minister said on Friday.

Russian missile and drone attacks on Ukraine's energy sector have caused significant damage and blackouts in many regions.

The attacks have cost more than $1 billion (£786 million) of damage to the sector and drained of 8,000 MWh of generating capacity from the energy system, the government said.

Currently, Ukraine can import from the EU states no more than 1,700 Mwh of electricity simultaneously.

""We're negotiating. Our task is to maximise this figure,"" Energy Minister German Galushchenko told parliament.

We reported earlier that Alexander Bortnikov, the head of Russia's Federal Security Service, accused Ukraine of being ""directly involved"" in the attack on a concert hall near Moscow (see post at 7:47am).

Now, we are hearing that on Friday Russia arrested more than 20 people in connection with the attack.

Mr Bortnikov repeated Russia's assertion, for which it has not provided evidence, that Ukraine was behind the attack that killed more than 140 people in March.

Ukraine has dismissed the allegation as ""absurd"".

Vladimir Putin arrived for a two-day visit in Belarus on Wednesday, where he will discuss nuclear weapons with his ally Alexander Lukashenko.

Belarus started taking delivery of such Russian warheads - shorter-range less powerful nuclear weapons that could potentially be used on the battlefield - in June last year.

It marked the first movement of such warheads since the fall of the Soviet Union, some of which are three times more powerful than the atomic bombs the US dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945.

Vladimir Putin's call for a ceasefire in Ukraine, broadcast through Kremlin briefings to Reuters, should be treated with caution.

Its real aim may be to fragment European support for Ukraine ahead of a peace conference next month in Switzerland.

Ukraine's defence against Russia has lasted for more than two years and interest and patience is wearing thin in some European countries.

Putin is a master at spotting weakness and exploiting it. If he can sow more doubt into the minds of European leaders and populations, Putin knows that he will weaken Ukraine.

The Russian leader has regularly tried to pose as a peacenik since he launched his invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, accusing Volodymyr Zelensky and Nato of forcing war on him.

But he also knows that the conditions he lays out for peace negotiations are unacceptable to the US, Ukraine's main backer, and will be ignored.

Underpinning Putin's offers of peace talks are tactics designed to fragment European support for Kyiv.

Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, has visited the northeast region of Kharkiv amid Russia's renewed offensive in the region.

""The entire city and region of Kharkiv deserve our support, gratitude, and respect, as does every Ukrainian community and person who refuses to give in to the enemy,"" he wrote on X.

Sergey Viktorovich, the Russian foreign minister, has accused Ukraine of already using weapons supplied by the US to attack targets beyond its territory, in what he called ""the conflict zone and against civilian infrastructure"".

Russia has repeatedly said that Western arms shipment will only prolong the conflict and will not change the situation at the battlefield.

The Biden administration insists that US-supplied weapons should not be used beyond Ukrainian territories.

Romanian prosecutors have opened a criminal investigation against a Romanian citizen accused of treason and spying for Russia for more than two years, they said on Friday.

The country's anti-organised crime prosecuting unit, DIICOT, said in a statement the suspect ""collected military information and took photographs of military equipment and staff movements in the border area with Ukraine which he then sent to diplomats from the Russian embassy in Bucharest"".

The alleged surveillance occurred near Tulcea, the southeastern Romanian county - near the country's border with Ukraine - beginning in 2022.

A Romanian court has approved the suspect's arrest for 30 days pending the criminal investigation

The US has interrogated claims by Britain's defence secretary that China was providing Russia with ""lethal aid"" for its war in Ukraine.

Grant Shapps on Wednesday said he had ""evidence"" of China providing or preparing to provide Russia with ""lethal aid"" for the Kremlin to use in its war against Ukraine.

But US national security adviser Jake Sullivan refuted the allegation, saying Washington had not observed that China had directly provided weapons to Russia.

""We have not seen that to date. I look forward to speaking with the UK to make sure that we have a common operating picture,"" Sullivan said.

Beijing on Thursday condemned what it called ""baseless and irresponsible statements made by British politicians"".

Ukraine used Atacms missiles to destroy a space radar in a strike on Crime, sources on the occupied peninsula said.

The Crimean Wind channel said the large Soviet military antenna was struck near the city of Alushta on the eastern coast.

At least six US-supplied Atacms hit the facility, where ""high-ranking military personnel... were located at the moment"", the Telegram channel wrote.

Russia's defence ministry claimed that the missile attack was repelled with its air defence forces shooting down at least three Atacms.

""Explosions were heard in almost all regions of Crimea. Russian air defences were active in many, but they were not very effective,"" Crimean Wind said.

Atesh, a pro-Ukrainian partisan group, claimed that there were many casualties, but said it was too early to confirm the damage to the radar centre.

The number of people locked up in Russian prisons dropped by 58,000 last year, Russian independent media reported on Friday.

The report said that some 105,000 prisoners were released between 2022-2023, citing data published in the official journal of Russia's prison service.

Russia started to recruit convicts to fight in Ukraine in 2022, when Yevgeny Prigozhin, the late head of the Wagner mercenary group, began to offer prisoners a pardon if they survived six months at the front.

Mr Prigozhin, who was killed in a plane crash last year, said he had recruited 50,000 prisoners for Wagner.

The first batch of Ukrainian Armed Forces pilots have graduated from F-16 training at an Arizona military base, an Air National Guard spokesman has said.

Capt. Eric Hannigan would not confirm how many have graduated or the exact date of graduation ""out of abundance of caution for their safety"".

The pilots are now headed to Europe for additional training, according to a person with knowledge of their movements.

Ukraine is set to receive more than 60 F-16s from Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands and Belgium.

A Ukrainian missile attack has killed two people near Crimea's Simferopol, the head of the Russian-annexed territory has said

Sergei Aksyonov said the missile hit an empty building near Alushta on the peninsula's Black Sea coast.

It came as Russia's defence ministry claimed that their air defences had intercepted three US-donated long-range Atacms missiles over Crimea, reported TASS news agency. Three Ukrainian sea drones firing towards the peninsula were also struck by Moscow's forces, the ministry further claimed.

Ukraine has not issued an official statement.

Unofficial Ukrainian military bloggers reported a number of targets had been hit throughout the peninsula.

Russian bloggers on the peninsula wrote that not all incoming missiles had been intercepted.

We reported earlier than Russia has now seized more than half of the border town Vovchansk amid its renewed ground offensive (see post at 8:29 am).

Read the Telegraph's full frontline dispatch here.

The US should lift its ""absolutely unfair"" ban on the Ukrainian army using American-supplied weapons to strike targets inside Russia, Ukraine's top national security official has said.

Oleksandr Lytvynenko said that lifting the restriction ""would be beneficial"" for Ukraine and could help to thwart Moscow's renewed offensive.

Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, has said that any strikes in Russian territory would be strictly for ""defence"".

Washington has argued the ban was necessary to avoid further escalation with Moscow.

The United States is expected to announce an additional $275 million (£234 million) in military aid for Ukraine on Friday as Kyiv struggles to hold off Russian advances in the Kharkiv region, said two US officials.

This will be the fourth instalment of military aid for Ukraine after US Congress last month passed a $61 billion (£48 billion) major military aid package, following a six month delay during which Russia gained advantage on the battlefield.

It comes as the Biden administration promised to supply a regular flow of weapons and to ensure they reach the front lines as swiftly as possible.

Russian forces now control more than half the territory of border town Vovchansk in the Kharkiv region, a Russian MP has said.

Viktor Vodolatskiy added that the towns of Slavyansk, Kramatorsk and Pokrovsk would be Russia's next major targets once it takes over Vovchansk.

Fears that Russia would mount an attack on any Nato member are unfounded, the Hungarian prime minister has said.

Viktor Orban said on Friday that the war in Ukraine, now in its third year, highlights the limitations of Russia's military power.

""I do not consider it logical that Russia, which cannot even defeat Ukraine, would all of a sudden come and swallow the Western world whole,"" said Orban. ""The chances of this are extremely slim.""

Hungary, a member of the European Union and Nato, has refused to provide military assistance to Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.

We reported earlier that the head of Russia's Federal Security Service accused Ukraine of being ""directly involved"" in the attack on a concert hall near Moscow (see post at 7:47am).

Islamic State claimed responsibility for the massacre in March and US officials said they had intelligence showing it was carried out by the network's Afghan branch, Islamic State Khorasan.

Russian spy chief, Alexander Bortnikov, has now accused Nato of enabling the transfer of militants from terror groups in the Middle East, North Africa and Afghanistan to Ukraine to help push back against Russian forces.

The Kharkiv region is still recovering after being hit by multiple Russian attacks, said Ukraine's president.

Volodymyr Zelensky said that one of Ukraine's largest printing facilities was struck in the attack, killing and injuring a number of people.

""Book storage and equipment were destroyed by fire. Many Ukrainian publishers had their books printed there...Russia want to burn and destroy all aspects of life,"" Zelensky wrote on X.

Ukrainian military intelligence was instrumental in a fatal attack on a concert hall near Moscow, the head of Russia's Federal Security Service has said.

Alexander Bortnikov said an investigation was ongoing, but it was ""already safe to say that Ukrainian military intelligence is directly involved in this attack,"" he said.

The attack, which killed 144 people, was claimed by an offshoot of the Islamic State group.

Ukraine has repeatedly denied it had anything to do with the attack.

Simens Energy entered a strategic partnership last week with state-owned Energinet for comprehensive expansion and renovation of the electricity grid on Funen and in Jutland. In the course of the coming eight years, the electricity grid will be expanded with a large number of 150 kV high-voltage substations. MT Højgaard Danmark is one of several cooperation partners that will contribute to this assignment through the construction, building and renovation of the stations. The activities are estimated to generate revenue of at least DKK 650 million for MT Højgaard Denmark over the eight-year period.

""The partnership agreement with Energinet is aligned with several of our strategic goals. We want to be part of large Danish energy projects, and we want to enter into long-term cooperation agreements with likeminded companies and developers. We look forward to the close collaboration with the other parties, and we are excited to invite local subcontractors to contribute during this project,"" says Carsten Lund, CEO of MT Højgaard Danmark.

MT Højgaard Danmark and Siemens Energy have previously collaborated on critical energy infrastructure projects, most recently the construction of an onshore substation for the Thor wind park.

The agreement does not affect MT Højgaard Holding's 2024 outlook, which is unchanged with revenue expected at DKK 10-10.5 billion and an operating profit (EBIT) of DKK 400-425 million.

The attacks have cost more than $1 billion (£786 million) of damage to the sector and drained of 8,000 MWh of generating capacity from the energy system, the government said.

Currently, Ukraine can import from the EU states no more than 1,700 Mwh of electricity simultaneously.

""We're negotiating. Our task is to maximise this figure,"" Energy Minister German Galushchenko told parliament.

We reported earlier that Alexander Bortnikov, the head of Russia's Federal Security Service, accused Ukraine of being ""directly involved"" in the attack on a concert hall near Moscow (see post at 7:47am).

Now, we are hearing that on Friday Russia arrested more than 20 people in connection with the attack.

Mr Bortnikov repeated Russia's assertion, for which it has not provided evidence, that Ukraine was behind the attack that killed more than 140 people in March.

Ukraine has dismissed the allegation as ""absurd"".

Vladimir Putin arrived for a two-day visit in Belarus on Wednesday, where he will discuss nuclear weapons with his ally Alexander Lukashenko.

Belarus started taking delivery of such Russian warheads - shorter-range less powerful nuclear weapons that could potentially be used on the battlefield - in June last year.

It marked the first movement of such warheads since the fall of the Soviet Union, some of which are three times more powerful than the atomic bombs the US dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945.

Vladimir Putin's call for a ceasefire in Ukraine, broadcast through Kremlin briefings to Reuters, should be treated with caution.

Its real aim may be to fragment European support for Ukraine ahead of a peace conference next month in Switzerland.

Ukraine's defence against Russia has lasted for more than two years and interest and patience is wearing thin in some European countries.

Putin is a master at spotting weakness and exploiting it. If he can sow more doubt into the minds of European leaders and populations, Putin knows that he will weaken Ukraine.

The Russian leader has regularly tried to pose as a peacenik since he launched his invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, accusing Volodymyr Zelensky and Nato of forcing war on him.

But he also knows that the conditions he lays out for peace negotiations are unacceptable to the US, Ukraine's main backer, and will be ignored.

Underpinning Putin's offers of peace talks are tactics designed to fragment European support for Kyiv.

Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, has visited the northeast region of Kharkiv amid Russia's renewed offensive in the region.

""The entire city and region of Kharkiv deserve our support, gratitude, and respect, as does every Ukrainian community and person who refuses to give in to the enemy,"" he wrote on X.

Sergey Viktorovich, the Russian foreign minister, has accused Ukraine of already using weapons supplied by the US to attack targets beyond its territory, in what he called ""the conflict zone and against civilian infrastructure"".

Russia has repeatedly said that Western arms shipment will only prolong the conflict and will not change the situation at the battlefield.

The Biden administration insists that US-supplied weapons should not be used beyond Ukrainian territories.

Romanian prosecutors have opened a criminal investigation against a Romanian citizen accused of treason and spying for Russia for more than two years, they said on Friday.

The country's anti-organised crime prosecuting unit, DIICOT, said in a statement the suspect ""collected military information and took photographs of military equipment and staff movements in the border area with Ukraine which he then sent to diplomats from the Russian embassy in Bucharest"".

The alleged surveillance occurred near Tulcea, the southeastern Romanian county - near the country's border with Ukraine - beginning in 2022.

A Romanian court has approved the suspect's arrest for 30 days pending the criminal investigation

The US has interrogated claims by Britain's defence secretary that China was providing Russia with ""lethal aid"" for its war in Ukraine.

Grant Shapps on Wednesday said he had ""evidence"" of China providing or preparing to provide Russia with ""lethal aid"" for the Kremlin to use in its war against Ukraine.

But US national security adviser Jake Sullivan refuted the allegation, saying Washington had not observed that China had directly provided weapons to Russia.

""We have not seen that to date. I look forward to speaking with the UK to make sure that we have a common operating picture,"" Sullivan said.

Beijing on Thursday condemned what it called ""baseless and irresponsible statements made by British politicians"".

Ukraine used Atacms missiles to destroy a space radar in a strike on Crime, sources on the occupied peninsula said.

The Crimean Wind channel said the large Soviet military antenna was struck near the city of Alushta on the eastern coast.

At least six US-supplied Atacms hit the facility, where ""high-ranking military personnel... were located at the moment"", the Telegram channel wrote.

Russia's defence ministry claimed that the missile attack was repelled with its air defence forces shooting down at least three Atacms.

""Explosions were heard in almost all regions of Crimea. Russian air defences were active in many, but they were not very effective,"" Crimean Wind said.

Atesh, a pro-Ukrainian partisan group, claimed that there were many casualties, but said it was too early to confirm the damage to the radar centre.

The number of people locked up in Russian prisons dropped by 58,000 last year, Russian independent media reported on Friday.

The report said that some 105,000 prisoners were released between 2022-2023, citing data published in the official journal of Russia's prison service.

Russia started to recruit convicts to fight in Ukraine in 2022, when Yevgeny Prigozhin, the late head of the Wagner mercenary group, began to offer prisoners a pardon if they survived six months at the front.

Mr Prigozhin, who was killed in a plane crash last year, said he had recruited 50,000 prisoners for Wagner.

The first batch of Ukrainian Armed Forces pilots have graduated from F-16 training at an Arizona military base, an Air National Guard spokesman has said.

Capt. Eric Hannigan would not confirm how many have graduated or the exact date of graduation ""out of abundance of caution for their safety"".

The pilots are now headed to Europe for additional training, according to a person with knowledge of their movements.

Ukraine is set to receive more than 60 F-16s from Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands and Belgium.

A Ukrainian missile attack has killed two people near Crimea's Simferopol, the head of the Russian-annexed territory has said

Sergei Aksyonov said the missile hit an empty building near Alushta on the peninsula's Black Sea coast.

It came as Russia's defence ministry claimed that their air defences had intercepted three US-donated long-range Atacms missiles over Crimea, reported TASS news agency. Three Ukrainian sea drones firing towards the peninsula were also struck by Moscow's forces, the ministry further claimed.

Ukraine has not issued an official statement.

Unofficial Ukrainian military bloggers reported a number of targets had been hit throughout the peninsula.

Russian bloggers on the peninsula wrote that not all incoming missiles had been intercepted.

We reported earlier than Russia has now seized more than half of the border town Vovchansk amid its renewed ground offensive (see post at 8:29 am).

Read the Telegraph's full frontline dispatch here.

The US should lift its ""absolutely unfair"" ban on the Ukrainian army using American-supplied weapons to strike targets inside Russia, Ukraine's top national security official has said.

Oleksandr Lytvynenko said that lifting the restriction ""would be beneficial"" for Ukraine and could help to thwart Moscow's renewed offensive.

Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, has said that any strikes in Russian territory would be strictly for ""defence"".

Washington has argued the ban was necessary to avoid further escalation with Moscow.

The United States is expected to announce an additional $275 million (£234 million) in military aid for Ukraine on Friday as Kyiv struggles to hold off Russian advances in the Kharkiv region, said two US officials.

This will be the fourth instalment of military aid for Ukraine after US Congress last month passed a $61 billion (£48 billion) major military aid package, following a six month delay during which Russia gained advantage on the battlefield.

It comes as the Biden administration promised to supply a regular flow of weapons and to ensure they reach the front lines as swiftly as possible.

Russian forces now control more than half the territory of border town Vovchansk in the Kharkiv region, a Russian MP has said.

Viktor Vodolatskiy added that the towns of Slavyansk, Kramatorsk and Pokrovsk would be Russia's next major targets once it takes over Vovchansk.

Fears that Russia would mount an attack on any Nato member are unfounded, the Hungarian prime minister has said.

Viktor Orban said on Friday that the war in Ukraine, now in its third year, highlights the limitations of Russia's military power.

""I do not consider it logical that Russia, which cannot even defeat Ukraine, would all of a sudden come and swallow the Western world whole,"" said Orban. ""The chances of this are extremely slim.""

Hungary, a member of the European Union and Nato, has refused to provide military assistance to Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.

We reported earlier that the head of Russia's Federal Security Service accused Ukraine of being ""directly involved"" in the attack on a concert hall near Moscow (see post at 7:47am).

Islamic State claimed responsibility for the massacre in March and US officials said they had intelligence showing it was carried out by the network's Afghan branch, Islamic State Khorasan.

Russian spy chief, Alexander Bortnikov, has now accused Nato of enabling the transfer of militants from terror groups in the Middle East, North Africa and Afghanistan to Ukraine to help push back against Russian forces.

The Kharkiv region is still recovering after being hit by multiple Russian attacks, said Ukraine's president.

Volodymyr Zelensky said that one of Ukraine's largest printing facilities was struck in the attack, killing and injuring a number of people.

""Book storage and equipment were destroyed by fire. Many Ukrainian publishers had their books printed there...Russia want to burn and destroy all aspects of life,"" Zelensky wrote on X.

Ukrainian military intelligence was instrumental in a fatal attack on a concert hall near Moscow, the head of Russia's Federal Security Service has said.

Alexander Bortnikov said an investigation was ongoing, but it was ""already safe to say that Ukrainian military intelligence is directly involved in this attack,"" he said.

The attack, which killed 144 people, was claimed by an offshoot of the Islamic State group.

Ukraine has repeatedly denied it had anything to do with the attack.

As the joint initiative just turned two, the European Commission released country reports tracking progress.

Diversifying the EU's energy supplies, speeding up the green transition and improving the bloc's energy security are the goals of the REPowerEU plan which celebrated its two-year anniversary recently.

On Tuesday, EU ministers gave final approval to the electricity market reform - also geared towards improving the bloc's energy security. The reform further promotes the expansion of renewable energies and should better protect consumers from escalating electricity prices in the future.

Two years of REPowerEU

Faced with the difficulties and disruptions in the global energy market caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the European Commission launched the REPowerEU plan in May 2022. The plan foresees energy saving goals, the production of clean energy and the diversification of energy supplies - and ultimately ending the dependency on Russian fossil fuels.

Since the adoption of the REPowerEU plan, the EU has successfully reduced gas supplies from Russia. The share of gas from Russia - by pipeline and Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) - made up 45 percent of all imported gas in 2021, but only 15 percent in 2023. The Union replaced it with gas from other third countries. Norway and the USA have become the largest gas suppliers.

Seaborne imports of Russian crude oil, refined petroleum products and Russian coal imports have been banned through EU sanctions.

Natural gas consumption: How much did member states reduce?

In 27 country reports released for the two-year anniversary of REPowerEU, the European Commission compiled member states' performances between August 2022 and January 2024. Each country report includes a country-specific analysis on a range of points, for example on the key energy figures, diversification of energy supplies, energy price developments or the natural gas demand reduction.

The EU countries had agreed on a voluntary 15 percent reduction target of natural gas consumption and almost all countries have managed to lower their gas consumption. On EU level, the countries achieved a decrease of 18 percent.

21 countries lowered their gas consumption even further than the agreed-upon reduction target, including Denmark (-40%), Finland (-39%), Latvia (-30%), Sweden (-29%), Lithuania (-29%), Estonia (-28%), the Netherlands (-27%), Luxembourg (-26%), Portugal (-23%), Slovakia (-22%), France (-20%), Romania (-19%), Austria (-19%), Hungary (-18%) and Bulgaria (-18%), Italy (-17%), Croatia (-17%), Czechia (-17%), Greece (-16%), Germany (-16%) and Belgium (-16%).

According to the European Commission's data, only five countries did not meet the 15 percent reduction target. Among those are Spain (-12%), Slovenia (-10%), Poland (-8%), Ireland (-4%) and Malta, the only country which increased its gas consumption by ten percent. According to the report, Cyprus does not use natural gas.

Slovenia: Cutting down on consumption, but still reliant on Russian gas

In the case of Slovenia, the REPowerEU report pointed out that while the country 'has taken measures to strengthen alternative supplies of natural gas', it 'effectively remains reliant on Russian gas imported through Austria'.

Data by the Slovenian Energy Agency shows that in 2023 Slovenia imported 68.3 percent of gas from Austria and 28.3 percent from Algeria, through Italy. The agency cannot say with certainty how much of the gas imported from Austria is of Russian origin.

Even though gas importers have not had direct contracts for supply of gas from Russia for 2023 or 2024, the Energy Agency believes that the share of Russian gas was still predominant both in 2023 and in the first part of 2024.

Moving forward on renewables with room for improvement

The EU and its member states are continuously working towards becoming more sustainable and less reliant on fossil fuels. What have countries achieved so far?

In 2023, according to the European Commission, Portugal for example installed around 1.3 gigawatts of renewable electricity capacity, bringing the total to 18.4 gigawatts - in comparison to 5.1 gigawatts in 2021. Additionally, the annual growth rate of installed renewable energy capacity increased to 7.6 percent compared to 6.1 percent in 2021. However, the country's energy mix still included 69 percent fossil fuels in 2022.

Neighbouring Spain accelerated its transition towards a decarbonised energy system. According to Spanish grid operator Red Electrica, renewables accounted for 65.2 percent of the Spanish electricity mix in March - an all-time high. Still, the REPowerEU Spain report states that fossil fuels continue to play a central role in the country's energy system, representing 70.1 percent of primary energy imported in 2021.

Croatia quickly deduced its dependence on Russian gas imports by increasing its own production and intensifying the use of the existing LNG terminal. However, Croatia is still highly dependent on energy imports from countries outside the EU. Fossil fuels also continue to play an important role in Croatia's energy mix, as they accounted for 72 percent of gross available energy in 2022.

Moving into a greener direction, the country could soon start to produce green hydrogen: INA, the leading Croatian oil and gas company, recently signed two contracts related to renewable energy projects - one for the production of green hydrogen and the other for a bio-methane production facility. The completion of the construction of both plants is expected in 2026. The green hydrogen project, together with its solar plant and logistic capacity, will be co-financed via the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF).

The EU's RRF is a tool providing grants and loans to support reforms and investments in member states. It should, among other things, help member states become more sustainable, boost progress with the green and digital transition and achieve the EU target of climate neutrality by 2050.

...just hang on for a year

In Bulgaria, one of the major national energy reforms has been postponed by a year, which means the artificial maintenance of coal capacity will remain for at least another twelve months. This, in turn, could lead to the country not receiving the expected 1.3 billion BNG (around 665.15 million Euro) under the Bulgarian National Recovery and Resilience Plan which is funded under the EU's RFF. The energy reform is a mandatory requirement.

While Bulgarian MPs justified this citing a lack of readiness to switch from a regulated to a free electricity market or funds, several media outlets and experts attributed the decision mostly to pre-election populism.

A reformed energy market for security and a green future

This week, the electricity market reform took its final hurdle after representatives from EU member states and the European Parliament had signed off on the market reforms last December.

Belgium's Energy Minister Tinne Van der Straeten described the day as a 'milestone for the EU' on the path to a carbon-free and greener future. 'By adopting the electricity market reform, we are empowering consumers, ensuring security of supply and paving the way for a more stable, predictable and sustainable energy market.'

New long-term contracts between governments and electricity producers, under which the state would chip in if the market price drops below an agreed price, are central to the reform efforts.This is meant to incentivise domestic green and nuclear power production by ensuring a return on investments.

It also protects consumers who, in the future, have the right to both fixed-price contracts and contracts with dynamic prices. This would allow consumers to opt for both secure, long-term prices and contracts with changing prices if they want to take advantage of price fluctuations - for example, to use electricity when it is cheaper for charging electric cars or for heat pumps.

How does the electricity market work?

The electricity market in the EU works according to the merit-order principle, defining the order in which power plants connected to the electricity exchange are used to deliver energy and to determine the market price.

Those that can produce electricity at relatively low marginal cost, like wind farms, are used first to cover demand. But as demand rises beyond those initial sources' capabilities, higher marginal cost sources are used.

The final price therefore depends on which sources need to be used to meet demand, as well as fluctuations in the costs of using those sources. For example, a surge in natural gas prices raises the cost of using gas-fired power plants. (AGERPRES: RO - editors: Mariana Ionescu, Cristina Zaharia)

""The Ukrainian Defense Forces have stopped Russian troops in the Kharkiv sector and are conducting counter-offensive actions,"" the military said in a statement on social media.

Despite Russian forces being halted in Kharkiv, Moscow's troops were reinforcing its assault on other parts of the frontline.

The fresh Russian land assault has been raging across the northeastern Kharkiv region since May 10, when thousands of Russian forces stormed the border, making their biggest territorial advances in 18 months.

Thank you for following today's live coverage of the war in Ukraine.

We'll be back soon with more updates and analysis from the conflict.

Russia and Belarus will tighten their cooperation in industry and technology in the face of Western sanctions against both their economies, presidents Vladimir Putin and Alexander Lukashenko said on Friday.

We reported earlier that Putin arrived for a two-day visit in Belarus on Wednesday, where he will discuss nuclear weapons with his ally (see post at 12:06 pm).

Russian forces have become ""bogged down"" in attempts to seize the border-town Vovchansk, but have sharpened their offensive elsewhere along the eastern front, Ukraine's top general said on Friday.

Kyiv has been battling a fresh Russian land assault on its northeastern Kharkiv region since May 10, when thousands of Moscow's troops stormed the border, making their biggest territorial advances in 18 months.

Despite initial success , ""the enemy has got completely bogged down in street battles for Vovchansk and suffered very high losses in assault units', said Ukrainian commander-in-chief Oleksandr Syrsky on social media.

In an attempt to seize the town, Russia ""is currently moving reserves from different sectors to support active assault operations, but to no avail"", Mr Syrsky added.

Although he warned that the situation on the eastern front was unstable, where Russia claims its forces have made a series of gains in the past two weeks.

Fighting near the eastern towns of Chasiv Yar, Pokrovsk and Kurakhove has been particularly ""intense"", he added.

The fresh offensive on the region has seen more than 11,000 people evacuate.

World Bank President Ajay Banga said on Friday that he is ""absolutely"" open to the idea of managing a fund for Ukraine that would pay out a G7 loan to the war-ravaged country.

The sum would be based on the earnings from frozen Russian assets, at least for non-military purposes, Mr Banga said.

""All I know is that if they do decide to give it to us, would I be ready? Yeah,"" Mr Banga said at a meeting of G7 finance ministers called to tackle the concept of such a loan.

He added: ""I could manage a fund of that type. I would need safeguards, I would need to make sure our people understand how to use it.""

Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, held a meeting on the regional situation in Kharkiv on Friday.

""We paid special attention to the housing needs of our people who had been displaced from Kharkiv region territories targeted by enemy shelling,"" he wrote on X.

Ukraine has freed at least 50 convicts under a new law that allows them to serve in exchange for the possibility of parole, as part of a wider effort to replenish Ukraine's depleted forces.

It is unclear how many prisoners in total have been released since the law was enacted a week ago.

Denys Maliuska, Ukraine's justice minister, said that 10,000 to 20,000 prisoners could be recruited.

We reported earlier that the number of convicts in Russian prisons dropped by 58,000 last year, as prisoners are promised a pardon if they survive six months fighting on the front lines (see post at 9:55 am).

Russia has detained two more senior military figures - the deputy head of the army's General Staff and a senior procurement official at the defence ministry - as a bribery scandal intensifies, investigators said on Thursday.

The arrests of Lieutenant-General Vadim Shamarin and ministry official Vladimir Verteletsky bumped the number of arrested military officials to five in a single month.

The crackdown signals a major effort to crack down on corruption surrounding the awarding of lucrative military contracts at a time when Russian forces are fighting in Ukraine.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will travel to Spain on Sunday and will meet with Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez and King Felipe on Monday, said sources familiar with his movements.

It comes after Zelensky was forced to suspend all international visits last week amid tense fighting in the Kharkiv region.

Ukrainian forces have ""stopped"" Russia from advancing further into the northeastern Kharkiv region and are now counter-attacking, but Moscow is intensifying its assault on other parts of the front, Ukraine's army said Friday.

Kyiv has been battling a fresh Russian land assault on its northeastern Kharkiv region since May 10, when thousands of Moscow's troops stormed the border, making their biggest territorial advances in 18 months.

Vladimir Putin is ready to halt the war in Ukraine with a negotiated ceasefire that recognises the current battlefield lines, Russian sources have said.

The Russian leader had expressed frustration to a small group of advisers about Western attempts to stymie negotiations, three of the sources, who are familiar with discussions in Putin's inner circle, told Reuters.

They added that he was also vexed by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's decision to rule out further truce talks.

""Putin can fight for as long as it takes, but Putin is also ready for a ceasefire - to freeze the war,"" said one of the sources, a senior Russian figure who has worked with the Kremlin chief.

Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the Russian President had repeatedly made clear Russia was open to ceasefire discussions, saying the country did not want ""eternal war.""

The United States is expected to announce an additional $275 million (£234 million) in military aid for Ukraine on Friday as Kyiv struggles to hold off Russian advances in the Kharkiv region, said two US officials.

This will be the fourth instalment of military aid for Ukraine after US Congress last month passed a $61 billion (£48 billion) major military aid package, following a six month delay during which Russia gained advantage on the battlefield.

It comes as the Biden administration promised to supply a regular flow of weapons and to ensure they reach the front lines as swiftly as possible.

Russian forces now control more than half the territory of border town Vovchansk in the Kharkiv region, a Russian MP has said.

Viktor Vodolatskiy added that the towns of Slavyansk, Kramatorsk and Pokrovsk would be Russia's next major targets once it takes over Vovchansk.

Fears that Russia would mount an attack on any Nato member are unfounded, the Hungarian prime minister has said.

Viktor Orban said on Friday that the war in Ukraine, now in its third year, highlights the limitations of Russia's military power.

""I do not consider it logical that Russia, which cannot even defeat Ukraine, would all of a sudden come and swallow the Western world whole,"" said Orban. ""The chances of this are extremely slim.""

Hungary, a member of the European Union and Nato, has refused to provide military assistance to Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.

We reported earlier that the head of Russia's Federal Security Service accused Ukraine of being ""directly involved"" in the attack on a concert hall near Moscow (see post at 7:47am).

Islamic State claimed responsibility for the massacre in March and US officials said they had intelligence showing it was carried out by the network's Afghan branch, Islamic State Khorasan.

Russian spy chief, Alexander Bortnikov, has now accused Nato of enabling the transfer of militants from terror groups in the Middle East, North Africa and Afghanistan to Ukraine to help push back against Russian forces.

The Kharkiv region is still recovering after being hit by multiple Russian attacks, said Ukraine's president.

Volodymyr Zelensky said that one of Ukraine's largest printing facilities was struck in the attack, killing and injuring a number of people.

""Book storage and equipment were destroyed by fire. Many Ukrainian publishers had their books printed there...Russia want to burn and destroy all aspects of life,"" Zelensky wrote on X.

Ukrainian military intelligence was instrumental in a fatal attack on a concert hall near Moscow, the head of Russia's Federal Security Service has said.

Alexander Bortnikov said an investigation was ongoing, but it was ""already safe to say that Ukrainian military intelligence is directly involved in this attack,"" he said.

The attack, which killed 144 people, was claimed by an offshoot of the Islamic State group.

Ukraine has repeatedly denied it had anything to do with the attack.

""The Ukrainian Defense Forces have stopped Russian troops in the Kharkiv sector and are conducting counter-offensive actions,"" the military said in a statement on social media.

Despite Russian forces being halted in Kharkiv, Moscow's troops were reinforcing its assault on other parts of the frontline.

The fresh Russian land assault has been raging across the northeastern Kharkiv region since May 10, when thousands of Russian forces stormed the border, making their biggest territorial advances in 18 months.

Thank you for following today's live coverage of the war in Ukraine.

We'll be back soon with more updates and analysis from the conflict.

Russia and Belarus will tighten their cooperation in industry and technology in the face of Western sanctions against both their economies, presidents Vladimir Putin and Alexander Lukashenko said on Friday.

We reported earlier that Putin arrived for a two-day visit in Belarus on Wednesday, where he will discuss nuclear weapons with his ally (see post at 12:06 pm).

Russian forces have become ""bogged down"" in attempts to seize the border-town Vovchansk, but have sharpened their offensive elsewhere along the eastern front, Ukraine's top general said on Friday.

Kyiv has been battling a fresh Russian land assault on its northeastern Kharkiv region since May 10, when thousands of Moscow's troops stormed the border, making their biggest territorial advances in 18 months.

Despite initial success , ""the enemy has got completely bogged down in street battles for Vovchansk and suffered very high losses in assault units', said Ukrainian commander-in-chief Oleksandr Syrsky on social media.

In an attempt to seize the town, Russia ""is currently moving reserves from different sectors to support active assault operations, but to no avail"", Mr Syrsky added.

Although he warned that the situation on the eastern front was unstable, where Russia claims its forces have made a series of gains in the past two weeks.

Fighting near the eastern towns of Chasiv Yar, Pokrovsk and Kurakhove has been particularly ""intense"", he added.

The fresh offensive on the region has seen more than 11,000 people evacuate.

World Bank President Ajay Banga said on Friday that he is ""absolutely"" open to the idea of managing a fund for Ukraine that would pay out a G7 loan to the war-ravaged country.

The sum would be based on the earnings from frozen Russian assets, at least for non-military purposes, Mr Banga said.

""All I know is that if they do decide to give it to us, would I be ready? Yeah,"" Mr Banga said at a meeting of G7 finance ministers called to tackle the concept of such a loan.

He added: ""I could manage a fund of that type. I would need safeguards, I would need to make sure our people understand how to use it.""

Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, held a meeting on the regional situation in Kharkiv on Friday.

""We paid special attention to the housing needs of our people who had been displaced from Kharkiv region territories targeted by enemy shelling,"" he wrote on X.

Ukraine has freed at least 50 convicts under a new law that allows them to serve in exchange for the possibility of parole, as part of a wider effort to replenish Ukraine's depleted forces.

It is unclear how many prisoners in total have been released since the law was enacted a week ago.

Denys Maliuska, Ukraine's justice minister, said that 10,000 to 20,000 prisoners could be recruited.

We reported earlier that the number of convicts in Russian prisons dropped by 58,000 last year, as prisoners are promised a pardon if they survive six months fighting on the front lines (see post at 9:55 am).

Russia has detained two more senior military figures - the deputy head of the army's General Staff and a senior procurement official at the defence ministry - as a bribery scandal intensifies, investigators said on Thursday.

The arrests of Lieutenant-General Vadim Shamarin and ministry official Vladimir Verteletsky bumped the number of arrested military officials to five in a single month.

The crackdown signals a major effort to crack down on corruption surrounding the awarding of lucrative military contracts at a time when Russian forces are fighting in Ukraine.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will travel to Spain on Sunday and will meet with Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez and King Felipe on Monday, said sources familiar with his movements.

It comes after Zelensky was forced to suspend all international visits last week amid tense fighting in the Kharkiv region.

Ukrainian forces have ""stopped"" Russia from advancing further into the northeastern Kharkiv region and are now counter-attacking, but Moscow is intensifying its assault on other parts of the front, Ukraine's army said Friday.

Kyiv has been battling a fresh Russian land assault on its northeastern Kharkiv region since May 10, when thousands of Moscow's troops stormed the border, making their biggest territorial advances in 18 months.

Vladimir Putin is ready to halt the war in Ukraine with a negotiated ceasefire that recognises the current battlefield lines, Russian sources have said.

The Russian leader had expressed frustration to a small group of advisers about Western attempts to stymie negotiations, three of the sources, who are familiar with discussions in Putin's inner circle, told Reuters.

They added that he was also vexed by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's decision to rule out further truce talks.

""Putin can fight for as long as it takes, but Putin is also ready for a ceasefire - to freeze the war,"" said one of the sources, a senior Russian figure who has worked with the Kremlin chief.

Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the Russian President had repeatedly made clear Russia was open to ceasefire discussions, saying the country did not want ""eternal war.""

Ukraine is seeking to maximise possible imports of electricity from European Union countries to compensate for the generation capacity destroyed by the Russian attacks, Ukrainian energy minister said on Friday.

Russian missile and drone attacks on Ukraine's energy sector have caused significant damage and blackouts in many regions.

The attacks have cost more than $1 billion (£786 million) of damage to the sector and drained of 8,000 MWh of generating capacity from the energy system, the government said.

Currently, Ukraine can import from the EU states no more than 1,700 Mwh of electricity simultaneously.

""We're negotiating. Our task is to maximise this figure,"" Energy Minister German Galushchenko told parliament.

We reported earlier that Alexander Bortnikov, the head of Russia's Federal Security Service, accused Ukraine of being ""directly involved"" in the attack on a concert hall near Moscow (see post at 7:47am).

Now, we are hearing that on Friday Russia arrested more than 20 people in connection with the attack.

Mr Bortnikov repeated Russia's assertion, for which it has not provided evidence, that Ukraine was behind the attack that killed more than 140 people in March.

Ukraine has dismissed the allegation as ""absurd"".

Vladimir Putin arrived for a two-day visit in Belarus on Wednesday, where he will discuss nuclear weapons with his ally Alexander Lukashenko.

Belarus started taking delivery of such Russian warheads - shorter-range less powerful nuclear weapons that could potentially be used on the battlefield - in June last year.

It marked the first movement of such warheads since the fall of the Soviet Union, some of which are three times more powerful than the atomic bombs the US dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945.

Vladimir Putin's call for a ceasefire in Ukraine, broadcast through Kremlin briefings to Reuters, should be treated with caution.

Its real aim may be to fragment European support for Ukraine ahead of a peace conference next month in Switzerland.

Ukraine's defence against Russia has lasted for more than two years and interest and patience is wearing thin in some European countries.

Putin is a master at spotting weakness and exploiting it. If he can sow more doubt into the minds of European leaders and populations, Putin knows that he will weaken Ukraine.

The Russian leader has regularly tried to pose as a peacenik since he launched his invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, accusing Volodymyr Zelensky and Nato of forcing war on him.

But he also knows that the conditions he lays out for peace negotiations are unacceptable to the US, Ukraine's main backer, and will be ignored.

Underpinning Putin's offers of peace talks are tactics designed to fragment European support for Kyiv.

Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, has visited the northeast region of Kharkiv amid Russia's renewed offensive in the region.

""The entire city and region of Kharkiv deserve our support, gratitude, and respect, as does every Ukrainian community and person who refuses to give in to the enemy,"" he wrote on X.

Sergey Viktorovich, the Russian foreign minister, has accused Ukraine of already using weapons supplied by the US to attack targets beyond its territory, in what he called ""the conflict zone and against civilian infrastructure"".

Russia has repeatedly said that Western arms shipment will only prolong the conflict and will not change the situation at the battlefield.

The Biden administration insists that US-supplied weapons should not be used beyond Ukrainian territories.

Romanian prosecutors have opened a criminal investigation against a Romanian citizen accused of treason and spying for Russia for more than two years, they said on Friday.

The country's anti-organised crime prosecuting unit, DIICOT, said in a statement the suspect ""collected military information and took photographs of military equipment and staff movements in the border area with Ukraine which he then sent to diplomats from the Russian embassy in Bucharest"".

The alleged surveillance occurred near Tulcea, the southeastern Romanian county - near the country's border with Ukraine - beginning in 2022.

A Romanian court has approved the suspect's arrest for 30 days pending the criminal investigation

The US has interrogated claims by Britain's defence secretary that China was providing Russia with ""lethal aid"" for its war in Ukraine.

Grant Shapps on Wednesday said he had ""evidence"" of China providing or preparing to provide Russia with ""lethal aid"" for the Kremlin to use in its war against Ukraine.

But US national security adviser Jake Sullivan refuted the allegation, saying Washington had not observed that China had directly provided weapons to Russia.

""We have not seen that to date. I look forward to speaking with the UK to make sure that we have a common operating picture,"" Sullivan said.

Beijing on Thursday condemned what it called ""baseless and irresponsible statements made by British politicians"".

Ukraine used Atacms missiles to destroy a space radar in a strike on Crime, sources on the occupied peninsula said.

The Crimean Wind channel said the large Soviet military antenna was struck near the city of Alushta on the eastern coast.

At least six US-supplied Atacms hit the facility, where ""high-ranking military personnel... were located at the moment"", the Telegram channel wrote.

Russia's defence ministry claimed that the missile attack was repelled with its air defence forces shooting down at least three Atacms.

""Explosions were heard in almost all regions of Crimea. Russian air defences were active in many, but they were not very effective,"" Crimean Wind said.

Atesh, a pro-Ukrainian partisan group, claimed that there were many casualties, but said it was too early to confirm the damage to the radar centre.

The number of people locked up in Russian prisons dropped by 58,000 last year, Russian independent media reported on Friday.

The report said that some 105,000 prisoners were released between 2022-2023, citing data published in the official journal of Russia's prison service.

Russia started to recruit convicts to fight in Ukraine in 2022, when Yevgeny Prigozhin, the late head of the Wagner mercenary group, began to offer prisoners a pardon if they survived six months at the front.

Mr Prigozhin, who was killed in a plane crash last year, said he had recruited 50,000 prisoners for Wagner.

The first batch of Ukrainian Armed Forces pilots have graduated from F-16 training at an Arizona military base, an Air National Guard spokesman has said.

Capt. Eric Hannigan would not confirm how many have graduated or the exact date of graduation ""out of abundance of caution for their safety"".

The pilots are now headed to Europe for additional training, according to a person with knowledge of their movements.

Ukraine is set to receive more than 60 F-16s from Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands and Belgium.

A Ukrainian missile attack has killed two people near Crimea's Simferopol, the head of the Russian-annexed territory has said

Sergei Aksyonov said the missile hit an empty building near Alushta on the peninsula's Black Sea coast.

It came as Russia's defence ministry claimed that their air defences had intercepted three US-donated long-range Atacms missiles over Crimea, reported TASS news agency. Three Ukrainian sea drones firing towards the peninsula were also struck by Moscow's forces, the ministry further claimed.

Ukraine has not issued an official statement.

Unofficial Ukrainian military bloggers reported a number of targets had been hit throughout the peninsula.

Russian bloggers on the peninsula wrote that not all incoming missiles had been intercepted.

We reported earlier than Russia has now seized more than half of the border town Vovchansk amid its renewed ground offensive (see post at 8:29 am).

Read the Telegraph's full frontline dispatch here.

The US should lift its ""absolutely unfair"" ban on the Ukrainian army using American-supplied weapons to strike targets inside Russia, Ukraine's top national security official has said.

Oleksandr Lytvynenko said that lifting the restriction ""would be beneficial"" for Ukraine and could help to thwart Moscow's renewed offensive.

Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, has said that any strikes in Russian territory would be strictly for ""defence"".

Washington has argued the ban was necessary to avoid further escalation with Moscow.

National Grid announces £60bn investment plan. (Credit: National Grid)

National Grid, a leading energy transmission and distribution company, today announces its Full Year results for the period ended 31 March 2024. Alongside these results the company has announced a fully underwritten equity raise of £7 billion through a Rights Issue.

John Pettigrew, Chief Executive, said:

""Today is a defining moment for National Grid as we announce a significant increase in investment that cements our position as a leader in the energy transition on both sides of the Atlantic.

Governments and regulators are moving with increased urgency to attract the levels of investment required to meet their net zero ambitions, giving us improved visibility and confidence over our medium term investment plan. That is why we're announcing today a new five-year financial framework. We will be investing £60 billion in the five years to the end of March 2029 - that's nearly double the level of investment of the past five years. We expect this significant step-up in capital investment will deliver annual group asset growth of around 10%, and 6-8% underlying EPS CAGR from a 2024/25 baseline, supported by a comprehensive financing plan that includes a £7 billion equity raise.

This is an unprecedented time for our industry that is creating significant opportunities for National Grid today, over the next five years and for decades to come. Our new five-year investment plan will deliver long-term value and returns for our shareholders, support over 60,000 more jobs, and accelerate the decarbonisation of the energy system for the digital, electrified economies of the future.

Our readiness to take this step is underscored by another year of strong financial and operational performance, with underlying operating profit and underlying EPS both up 6% at constant currency, with record investment of

£8.2 billion across the Group. In the UK, our 17 major onshore and offshore transmission projects are moving ahead at pace, and in the US our $4 billion 'Upstate Upgrade' is underway representing the largest investment in New York's electricity transmission network for over a century. Our sixth interconnector, the Viking Link to Denmark, came online in December and is the world's longest onshore and subsea HVDC cable, demonstrating the world-class capabilities within National Grid.

Alongside our new five-year financial framework, we are also today further evolving our strategy to focus on networks and will therefore be streamlining our business as we announce our intention to sell Grain LNG, our UK LNG asset, and National Grid Renewables, our US onshore renewables business.""",nsenergybusiness.com,news,NS Business,,0.3960784313725489,454249313,1,https://www.nsenergybusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/4PylonEngineersH-scaled.jpg,

The Novo Nordisk Foundation has committed DKK150 million (US$22 million) for the first phase of the Microbiome Health Initiative, a virtual research center based at the Technical University of Denmark, Copenhagen. The initiative establishes a causal link between the gut microbiome and the development of cardiometabolic diseases (CMD) such as obesity, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The goal is to generate knowledge that can lead to new prevention or treatment options for people living with, or at risk of, CMD. In Phase 1, which will run from 2024-2028, the initiative will focus on collaborative research projects that investigate the specific effects of these bacteria or metabolites and advance understanding of how microbiome interventions could reduce the risk of CMD or help manage it.

Kirin has launched a new Health Science device called Electric Salt Spoon, which enhances the salty and umami taste of low-sodium foods with the power of electricity. The tableware-type device is equipped with technology that improves the salty taste perceived when eating low-sodium foods by approximately 1.5 times. The technology was collaboratively developed by researchers from the Meiji University, Miyashita Laboratory of the Department of Frontier Media Science, School of Interdisciplinary Mathematical Sciences. In addition, Kirin is proposing the development of tableware other than spoons and low-sodium food menus and is working with companies and local governments to expand the use of Electric Salt.

Lansinoh Laboratories will pursue strategic acquisition opportunities to broaden its portfolio into nutrition and wellness solutions that support women throughout their maternity journey.

Scientific research

A research analysis by Arla Foods Ingredients has provided new insights into why many patients struggle to complete a medical nutrition plan. Data based on 12,000 patients with severe illnesses in 12 countries were studied. Seven in ten were recommended medical nutrition plans, but three in ten of them were not completed. The most common reasons for non-completion of plans were price, difficulty ingesting or digesting products and bodily intolerance. The company also commissioned new qualitative research that focused on the experiences of 40 people with cancer, sarcopenia or gut-related illnesses who had or were following a medical nutrition plan. The researchers explored the taste and texture of products -- an aspect of the medical nutrition experience that leads to daily non-compliance.

A research team from the Research Institute for Future Food and the Department of Food Science and Nutrition of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University have developed AkkMore, a novel fungus-based fat replacer that is effective in preventing obesity and metabolic diseases, enhancing gut health, modulating immune response and relieving anxiety. The fat replacer lowers the calorific content of food and extends the shelf life of cream products. In the long term, it can reduce dairy consumption and food waste. Using the thickening, emulsifying and stabilizing properties of AkkMore, the team has developed Cream Mate, an AkkMore-based cream substitute that can be used with traditional cream to reduce the fat and caloric content of desserts while maintaining the taste and texture.A recent study has observed a correlation between eating meals with other and overall happiness.

New findings from a study conducted by researchers at the University of Minnesota, US and supported by the Barilla Group observe a connection between eating meals with others and overall happiness. The study, published in the journal Family, Systems, and Health, shows a positive correlation between how often people gather around the table during mealtime and enhanced connectedness, reduced depressive symptoms and improved mood across individuals studied in the US, Italy and Germany. More than 1,000 adults from each country participated in an online survey, answering questions about eating customs and habits at home, related feelings, emotions and other well-being outcomes. Roughly 50% of participants said they engage in six or more family or shared meals per week. Dinner was the most prevalent shared meal and the highest frequency of shared meals occurred on the weekends. The highest frequency of shared meals occurred in Italy, with 74% of adults reporting six or more weekly. The findings support the importance of togetherness around the table, from food preparation to eating and cleaning up after the meal.

New research from Lifesum reveals that one in six US employees consider themselves addicted to ultra-processed food (UPF), based on a survey of 5,000 people. This is off the back of the world's most extensive review published in the BMJ, which showed that UPFs are linked to higher risks of cancer, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, adverse mental health and early death. The research underscores the prevalence and severity of UPF addiction within the workplace, highlighting the need for interventions to address unhealthy eating habits.

The LEGO Group asked kids across the world to share their visions of how they would like to explore the cosmos. With the help of Associate Master Builder at the LEGO House, Didac Perez Soriano, a selection of these spacecrafts were reimagined in LEGO bricks.

The LEGO Group then showcased the future of space travel according to a group of young budding space explorers - Lotty (10, UK), Sebastian (10, Denmark), Jace (13, Hong Kong SAR, China), Jillian (7, USA), Jordan (12, USA) and Orla (6, UK) - by blasting their unique designs, playfully coined Unidentified Playing Objects (UPOs), over the New York City skyline.

Taking over the most photographed skyline of all time, the show included a space bed UPO powered by butterfly wings complete with a snack drawer for long journeys, a turtle spaceship that walks on the moon, a dog spaceship with 360° windows to see all that space has to offer, and a dinosaur ship with a jetpack, among others.

Didac Perez Soriano, associate master builder at the LEGO House, said, ""Children are our inspiration for play and creativity. At LEGO House, we aim to provide the pinnacle experience for letting play and creativity run free, and that's why I leapt at the opportunity to build 3D representations of their creative spaceships in LEGO bricks. The imagination shown by young children around the world was mind-blowing and this was one of the best experiences I have had. I'm ecstatic we can share these with the world. With so much of the universe still to be explored, we can't say that what they have created isn't possible or even out there already.""

Lotty Ingle, the 10-year-old designer of the butterfly wing powered bed spaceship from Leeds, UK, said, ""I was over the moon when I found out that my design had been picked. I kept saying to my mum ""Really?"", ""No, but really Mum?"". I like to be eco-friendly and didn't want to use any electricity so I thought butterfly wings would be a good idea. I would love to travel to all the planets that no one has discovered yet and see if there is life there, and if they are just like us. I would really like them to try all my favourite snacks that I am bringing with me.""

All UPOs in their LEGO brick form can be viewed at the 'Explore Space Your Way' exhibition at LEGO House in Billund, Denmark, until June 17th. The LEGO House is the ultimate destination for celebrating everything beyond our world. The collaborative exhibition with the Technical University of Denmark at LEGO Square allows visitors to learn more about the infinite depths of space through wildly creative exhibits crafted entirely from LEGO bricks.

While the constellations of our night sky have been set by astronomers in history, the LEGO Group also believes that Gen Alpha can bring a new creative lens to our view of the stars. Celebrating kids' curiosity about the future of space, the LEGO Group is asking children to reimagine the night sky with their own Funstellations.

With a guardian's help, children are invited to visit here to download a sky map and join the dots together to show what object or shape they can see in the stars - maybe it's a cowboy riding a unicorn or a flying whale.

The LEGO Group will then work with the International Astronomical Union to recognise their formations as Funstellations - official reimaginations of our constellations - and update our vision of the night sky.

Debra Elmegreen, president of the International Astronomical Union said, ""We are excited to tap into the unbridled creativity of children through this collaboration by encouraging them to look up at the night sky and think about the stars. The next generation of scientists and space explorers will shape how we understand and interact with the Universe. With this project, we hope to give them a head start.""",lbbonline.com,news,lbbonline.com,,0.4745098039215687,454246995,7,https://d3bzyjrsc4233l.cloudfront.net/news/LEGO_Dinosaur.png,eng-9595495

The strategic move will yield an annual asset growth of around 10%, propelling the group's assets towards £100bn by 2029.

The investment is not only expected to enhance shareholder value and support more than 60,000 additional jobs but also to expedite the decarbonisation of the energy system, aligning with the needs of increasingly digital and electrified economies.

To fund the expansion, National Grid is preparing for a £7bn fully underwritten rights issue.

The company is also optimising its operations by divesting its US onshore renewables division, National Grid Renewables, and its UK-based LNG asset, Grain LNG.

The decisions were announced alongside its financial results for 2023. The company reported gross revenue of £19.85bn, an 8% decrease from the previous year's £21.6bn.

National Grid's operating costs have seen a reduction of 13%, falling to £15.4bn from £17.7bn in the previous year.

The underlying operating profit has risen by 4% to £4.8bn, with a 6% increase at constant currency rates.

However, statutory operating profit for continuing operations has decreased by 8% to £4.5bn, primarily due to non-cash exceptional charges in 2023/24.

Despite a downturn in statutory international financial reporting standards earnings, which dropped by 18% to £2.2bn from the previous year's £2.7bn, National Grid's underlying earnings improved, reaching £2.8bn -- a 6% increase.

The company's capital investment has also increased to £8.23bn, an 8% rise compared to the previous year's £7.59bn, driven by early investment in the UK Electricity Transmission's accelerated strategic transmission investment (ASTI), new transmission projects in New York, including the Smart Path Connect project, and increased spending on asset condition and grid modernisation in New England.

National Grid CEO John Pettigrew stated: ""We will be investing £60bn in the five years to the end of March 2029 - that's nearly double the level of investment of the past five years.

""Our readiness to take this step is underscored by another year of strong financial and operational performance, with underlying operating profit and underlying EPS [earnings per share] both up 6% at constant currency, with record investment of £8.2bn across the group.""

""In the UK, our 17 major onshore and offshore transmission projects are moving ahead at pace, and in the US our $4bn upstate upgrade is underway, representing the largest investment in New York's electricity transmission network for over a century.

The Sahel region, which is one of the most vulnerable regions in the world, will become a solar energy hub, targeting 11 countries: Burkina Faso, Chad, Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal and Sudan.

Desert to Power seeks to generate 10 GW of solar power by 2030 by harnessing the region's significant solar potential, thereby facilitating access to electricity for 250-million people.

The project is the brainchild of AfDB president Dr Akinwumi Adesina.

""Desert to Power is what I call the baobab of projects. It will require all our efforts if we are to effect change,"" he said at the most recent Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.

Last December, the AfDB approved the 225 kV Mauritania-Mali Power Interconnection and related Solar Power Plants Development Project (PIEMM) which is a priority operation under that Desert to Power Initiative.

The project will help develop regional electricity trade in the Sahel, allow Mali to import about 600 GWh/y of electricity from renewable energy sources from Mauritania and enable both Mali and Mauritania to increase their national electricity access rate and to improve the performance of their electricity subsector.

This will be achieved by reducing fuel consumption and shutting down several generators with exorbitant operating costs, while also reducing greenhouse-gas emissions.

Ultimately, the project is expected to connect 100 000 new households - 80 000 in Mauritania and 20 000 in Mali.

The initiative presents a major step along the way to solving Africa's critical energy access issues and reducing dependence on fossil fuels like heavy fuel oil. These are key drivers of environmental fragility in the region, worsening climate warming behind many of the dramatic weather events now regularly hitting the continent.

The AfDB has also leveraged climate finance from international sources such as the Green Climate to blend with the bank's own resources to support the Desert to Power Initiative.

Additionally, the AfDB's Sustainable Energy Fund for Africa, which is its largest in-house blended finance facility with commitments of more than $500-million from ten donors, including Denmark, the US, the UK, Italy, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Germany, the Nordic Development Fund, and the Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet, is providing catalytic capital for private sector projects across the Desert to Power countries.

Currently, the Desert to Power portfolio counts ten investment projects and more than 15 technical assistance operations across seven of the 11 countries of operation.

The initiative is part of a broader effort to transition Africa towards more sustainable energy sources, helping mitigate deforestation and its associated impacts, the AfDB says.

In Africa, deforestation is a significant issue, with an area equivalent to the size of Switzerland being cleared of forestation yearly, largely for cooking and heating purposes. This loss of forestation exacerbates dust storms, disrupts rain patterns, and accelerates desertification, posing severe threats to biodiversity and local climates.

The AfDB says its investment in solar energy is crucial because reliable and affordable energy is essential for reducing reliance on charcoal, which is not only a leading cause of deforestation, but also an expensive option for many households.

The continent's rapid population growth has intensified energy demands, with the population doubling and doubling again to at least 1.2-billion, nearly half of whom lack access to electricity.

While there are ongoing reforestation projects in countries such as Kenya, Congo, Madagascar, and Malawi, the rate of forestation loss far outpaces these efforts. The immediate need is to electrify the continent quickly, choosing sustainable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydro over more harmful fossil fuels, the AfDB asserts.

Africa's potential for renewable energy is vast but largely untapped. The continent has an almost unlimited solar capacity of about 11 TW, significant hydro resources of about 350 GW, with only between 5% and 6% currently harnessed, wind power potential of about 110 GW, with only about 2% currently used and geothermal energy sources of up to 15 GW.

Despite this potential, 600-million people in Africa live without access to electricity. The continent accounts for just 6% of global energy demand and slightly more than 3% of electricity demand. This underscores the importance of scaling up renewable energy investments to meet the continent's energy needs sustainably, the AfDB says.

From 2016 to 2022, the AfDB approved $8.3-billion in energy commitments, with 87% directed towards renewable energy projects. This investment has already generated 3.4 GW of electricity, including 2.6 GW from renewable sources.

The bank is also developing an African Green Mineral Strategy to capitalise on the continent's abundant critical minerals, such as cobalt, manganese and platinum, which are essential for facilitating the energy transition.",engineeringnews.co.za,news,Engineering News,Darren Parker,0.2941176470588236,454241800,25,https://cdn.creamermedia.com/assets/articles/images/resized/0001134043_resized_akinwumiadesina0522reuters1022.jpg,eng-9584744

What storage technologies are available and how good are they? An overview of four methods.

Winter heating is energy intensive, but it is possible to save up warmth over summer and release it over winter.

Several seasonal heat storage systems are already in use.

In Marstal, Denmark, for example, a large, covered reservoir is heated with solar thermal collectors in summer. In winter, the reservoir produces enough warmth to cover half of the heating requirements of around 2000 residents.

More and more variants of such heat storage systems are being built, and not just in Europe. What technologies are available and how do they work?

In the case of underground heat storage tanks, large pits are dug and sealed with foil. About 70,000 cubic meters of water are then poured into an area of around one hectare.

This water is heated up to 90 degrees Celcius (194 Fahrenheit) using solar thermal systems, waste heat from factories or trash incineration plants. An insulated lid ensures that just 10% of the stored heat is lost throughout the course of the year, and in winter, the warm water flows from the large storage tank into the district heating network to warm homes.

To date, there are six large geothermal storage tanks in Denmark, one in Tibet and three are under construction in Germany and Poland. Interest in storage technology is growing.

Another option is to repurpose disused underground coal mines.

In Germany's Ruhr region, a heat storage system is already being tested in an old mine shaft.

Advantages and disadvantages: Large underground reservoirs store excess heat for the winter at low cost and lend themselves to feeding district heating networks. While construction costs are relatively low, they do require enough space for the basins.

Large water tanks in buildings can also store heat for months. For this purpose, steel tanks of up to 260 cubic meters are installed in the middle of new buildings. They can be several storeys high and are very well insulated.

Because steel tanks are more expensive and the buildings in which they are contained have to be specially constructed, investment costs are around 10 times higher than for geothermal storage tanks. A storage tank with 50 cubic meters costs around €170,000 ($184,000), including a large solar system.

This building complex (pictured) in Frankfurt has several tanks holding a total of 50 cubic meters of water. A solar thermal system on the roof heats the tanks to 80 degrees in summer. In conjunction with a heat pump, this provides winter warmth for 56 apartments.

Advantages and disadvantages: Heat storage tanks in buildings are practical, well-insulated and save on additional pipes. The buildings can largely be heated with solar power, which keeps running costs very low. However, the additional construction outlay may deter building owners.

Energy efficiency: Very high: The heat storage tank is in the middle of the house and hardly any heat is lost.

Where can it be used: In new buildings worldwide.

Heat can also be stored in the ground to supply existing buildings. To do this, water pipes are laid in the ground and the soil is insulated on the sides and at the top.

In summer, the ground is heated with hot water from a solar thermal system. In winter, a heat pump uses this stored geothermal energy to supply warmth to homes.

This Berlin residential complex from the 1920s (photo) is heated with such a geothermal storage tank.

Advantages and disadvantages: Retrofitting is possible. However, space is needed next to the building to lay pipes in the ground. Around 40 square meters are needed for a detached house, but more is required for larger buildings.

Heat can also be stored using hydrogen. The technology already exists in some buildings.

In summer, excess solar power is used to produce hydrogen in an electrolysis process. This is stored in pressurized cylinders. In winter, the hydrogen is converted back into electricity and heat using fuel cells to supply buildings.

In the future, hydrogen could account for almost 9% of Germany's district heating network, according to long-term scenarios calculated on behalf of the German government. The hydrogen would be stored primarily in large underground salt caverns, which are currently used to store natural gas.

Advantages and disadvantages: For energy systems and municipal utilities, hydrogen can be a good addition when combined with other storage systems to cover electricity and heating requirements in a climate-neutral way all year round. However, such systems are very expensive for individual houses; the installation in this building near Bonn (photo) cost around 550,000 euros.

Energy efficiency: Poor. The conversion of electricity to hydrogen and its recovery to electricity in winter generates around 40% waste heat. This waste heat should be used promptly to reduce energy losses. Other seasonal storage systems are usually more efficient.",dw.com,news,Deutsche Welle,,0.2,454241208,13,https://static.dw.com/image/68778618_6.jpg,

Accelerating its green energy initiatives, Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) has entered into a technology licensing agreement with Norway's Nel ASA to make electrolysers for production of green hydrogen.

""The agreement with Nel Hydrogen Electrolyser AS, a fully owned subsidiary of Nel ASA, provides Reliance with an exclusive license for Nel's alkaline electrolysers in India and also allows it to manufacture Nel's alkaline electrolysers for captive purposes globally,"" the Norwegian firm said in a statement.

Green hydrogen is generated through the electrolysis of water using electricity derived from renewable sources. The carbon footprint of this process hinges on the carbon neutrality of the electricity source. In simpler terms, the more renewable energy in the electricity mix, the greener the produced hydrogen becomes.

Central to the green hydrogen production process is the electrolyser technology. Alkaline and polymer electrolyte membrane electrolysers are two commercially available technologies for green hydrogen production today. Advanced electrolyser technologies like solid oxide and anion exchange membrane are nearing commercial deployment as well.

Under the agreement, Reliance gains access to Nel's top-notch electrolyser manufacturing technology platform. In return, Nel has the option to procure equipment from Reliance for its own projects, while still providing technology platforms to the Indian market outside the agreement's scope.

RIL announced its foray into green hydrogen during Covid-19 pandemic. The Fortune 500 company is among the largest global producers of grey hydrogen.

The company has partnered with Denmark's Stiesdal to reduce costs and commercialise their pressurised alkaline electrolyser technology. Additionally, Reliance is in advanced talks with other leading electrolyser technology players globally to establish a fully-integrated, automated, giga-scale electrolyser manufacturing facility at the Dhirubhai Ambani Green Energy Giga Complex in Jamnagar.

After proving cost and performance targets, the company aims to progressively commence transition from grey to green hydrogen by 2025. This will serve its own needs and that of other industries and companies.

In essence, all these deals will help RIL meet its ambitious goal of 1-1-1 for green-hydrogen production, shared by its chairman Mukesh Ambani, of making one kilo of green hydrogen available for $1 in a decade.

The African Development Bank is the driving force behind one of the world's most ambitious energy projects: the Desert to Power initiative which aims to bring energy to one of the least developed and most marginal parts of the continent.

This transformative and bold effort aims to turn Africa's vast, sun-drenched Sahel region one of the most vulnerable regions in the world into a powerhouse of solar energy.

Today, the Desert to Power portfolio counts 10 investment projects and over 15 technical assistance operations across 7 of the 11 countries of operation.

The initiative has drawn plaudits from policy makers, diplomats, politicians and media commentators.

The authoritative British newspaper the Financial Times (FT) recently hailed it as a showcase example of imaginative development projects of the type Africa needs to engage its populations and prevent regional unrest exploited by anti-state actors.

In an article, endorsed by its editorial board, the FT called on Western governments to back the project along with similar initiatives directed at improving people's daily lives. Development brings stability, it argued.

According to the report distributed by the APO Group on behalf of African Development Bank Group (AfDB), Africa's potential for renewable energy is vast but largely untapped.

The continent has an almost unlimited solar capacity (11 TW), significant hydro resources (350 GW, with only between five and six percent currently harnessed), wind power (110 GW, with only two percent utilized), and geothermal energy sources (15 GW).

Despite this potential, 600 million people in Africa live without access to electricity.

The continent accounts for just six percent of global energy demand and slightly over three percent of electricity demand. This underscores the importance of scaling up renewable energy investments to meet the continent's energy needs sustainably.

From 2016 to 2022, the AfDB approved US $8.3 billion in energy commitments, with 87 percent directed towards renewable energy projects.

This investment has already generated 3.4 GW of electricity, including 2.6 GW from renewable sources.

The African Development Bank is the driving force behind one of the world's most ambitious energy projects: the Desert to Power initiative aims to bring energy to one of the least developed and most marginal parts of the continent.

This transformative and bold effort aims to turn Africa's vast, sun-drenched Sahel region - one of the most vulnerable regions in the world - into a powerhouse of solar energy, targeting 11 countries: Burkina Faso, Chad, Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, and Sudan.

By harnessing the region's immense solar potential, Desert to Power seeks to generate 10 gigawatts of solar power by 2030, thereby facilitating access to electricity for 250 million people.

The ground-breaking project is the brainchild of Bank President Dr Akinwumi Adesina who has termed it the Bank's ""baobab"".

""Desert to Power is what I call the baobab of projects. It will require all our efforts if we are to effect change,"" he told a COP meeting.

Last December, the Bank approved the 225 kV Mauritania-Mali Power Interconnection and related Solar Power Plants Development Project (PIEMM) which is a priority operation under that Desert to Power Initiative. The project will help develop regional electricity trade in the Sahel, allow Mali to import about 600 GWh of electricity from renewable energy sources from Mauritania each year and enable both Mali and Mauritania to increase their national electricity access rate and to improve the performance of their electricity sub-sector by reducing fuel consumption, and shutting down several generators with exorbitant operating costs thus reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Ultimately, the project is expected to connect 100,000 new households (80,000 in Mauritania and 20,000 in Mali).

The initiative presents a major step along the way to solving Africa's critical energy access issues and reducing dependence on fossil fuels like heavy fuel oil. These are key drivers of environmental fragility in the region, worsening climate warming behind many of the dramatic weather events now regularly hitting the continent.

The Bank has also successfully leveraged climate finance from international sources like the Green Climate to blend with the Bank's own resources to support the Desert to Power initiative.

Additionally, the Bank's Sustainable Energy Fund for Africa (SEFA), the Bank's largest in-house blended finance facility with commitments of over US $500 million from 10 donors, including Denmark, the United States, the United Kingdom, Italy, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Germany, the Nordic Development Fund, and the Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet, is providing catalytic capital for private sector projects across the Desert to Power countries and beyond.

Today, the Desert to Power portfolio counts 10 investment projects and over 15 technical assistance operations across 7 of the 11 countries of operation.

The initiative has drawn plaudits from policy makers, diplomats, politicians and media commentators.

The authoritative British newspaper the Financial Times (FT) recently hailed it as a showcase example of imaginative development projects of the type Africa needs to engage its populations and prevent regional unrest exploited by anti-state actors.

In an article, endorsed by its editorial board, the FT called on Western governments to back the project along with similar initiatives directed at improving people's daily lives. Development brings stability, it argued.

The initiative is part of a broader effort to transition Africa towards more sustainable energy sources, helping mitigate deforestation and its associated impacts.

In Africa, deforestation is a significant issue, with an area equivalent to the size of Switzerland being cleared of forest annually, largely for cooking and heating purposes. This loss of forest exacerbates dust storms, disrupts rain patterns, and accelerates desertification, posing severe threats to biodiversity and local climates.

The Bank's investment in solar energy is crucial for several reasons. Firstly, reliable and affordable energy is essential for reducing reliance on charcoal, which is not only a leading cause of deforestation, but also an expensive option for many households. The continent's rapid population growth has intensified energy demands, with the population doubling and doubling again to at least 1.2 billion, nearly half of whom lack access to electricity.

While there are ongoing reforestation projects in countries like Kenya, Congo, Madagascar, and Malawi, the rate of forest loss far outpaces these efforts. The immediate need is to electrify the continent quickly, choosing sustainable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydro over more harmful fossil fuels.

It is indisputable that the air quality here has significantly improved over these years. I still remember when I first moved to China in 1998, the main source of air pollution in Beijing was coal burning. Soon, in 1999, the Beijing Municipal Government introduced supervisory regulations on the quality of coal use. The changes that have occurred since are evident to all. Later on, construction and motor vehicles became a major source of PM2.5 (fine inhalable particles) emissions in Beijing. Due to effective governance, the blue sky during the 2014 APEC meeting in Beijing was very impressive.

China has achieved great success in reducing particulate matter pollution. Such examples can be seen everywhere. For example, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in north China is a resource-rich area. I believe this is one of the regions with the best air quality in the country, and I know many companies consider it an excellent choice for producing green electricity.

Green electricity refers to the production of electricity with zero or near-zero carbon dioxide emissions, which has a lower impact on the environment compared to thermal power generation. At present, green electricity mainly comes from photovoltaic and wind power.

European companies also need green electricity to produce green methanol, known as ""liquid sunshine."" It uses renewable energy sources such as solar and wind energy to decompose water into green hydrogen, which is then synthesized into clean energy through the catalytic action of green hydrogen and carbon dioxide, to achieve decarbonization of the entire industrial chain.

It is worth noting that my home country of Denmark does not have a resource reserve as large as Inner Mongolia for the development of photovoltaic power. So we mainly rely on offshore wind power in the northern coastal areas. By 2026, 100 percent of Denmark's electricity is expected to come from renewable sources.

Denmark and China both have some of the world's leading wind power companies, such as Vestas, Goldwind and Envision. Their research and development capabilities, as well as innovative technologies, ensure that we produce as much green electricity as possible, while reducing the use of coal and other fossil fuels, thereby promoting energy transformation and green development, and rebuilding energy-intensive cities with clean and low-carbon energy systems.

The Chinese Government has set a dual carbon goal, meaning the country intends to peak carbon dioxide emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060. I think it is very positive and achievable. This matter is of great significance because without China, the world cannot solve the problem of climate change.

There is great potential for bilateral cooperation between European and Chinese companies in this field. China has true global leadership in green technology, which is also one of the areas where Europe and China can learn from each other.

In Copenhagen, capital of Denmark, and Brussels, capital of Belgium and home to the EU headquarters, Chinese electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer BYD's taxis can be seen everywhere. Chinese battery manufacturer Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd. is also investing in building factories in Europe, aiming for high-level cooperation. At the same time, many European car manufacturers have come to China to produce EVs. Undoubtedly, China will become a leader in EV production, and European manufacturers have gained a lot of beneficial experience from the Chinese market.

If we think along the green industrial chain, there are still many industries with great potential for further cooperation. The EU and China have strong complementarity in carbon reduction and related technologies. China has an important industrial foundation and Europe can use this foundation to achieve its decarbonization goals. In other words, China's dual carbon goal can also help Europe achieve its transformation and development toward a green economy.

China is also a very important market for Europe's green technology. Both sides have invested a large amount of funds in decarbonization technology, and they have always maintained a close research and development collaboration. For example, European wind turbine manufacturers have played a crucial role in the development of China's wind power industry for many years.

Today's China can also provide many solutions that the world at large needs to reduce carbon emissions and address the challenges of climate change. We just need to find a path that creates maximum value for both China and Europe, so that everything we do will not come at the cost of sacrificing the other party, but can complement each other.

The year 2023 celebrated the 20th anniversary of the establishment of the EU-China Comprehensive Strategic Partnership. The past two decades of achievements have confirmed that a comprehensive strategic partnership is crucial for the EU.

In the current global economic downturn, both Europe and China are facing challenges in their economies, as well as some disagreements in the field of trade. But it is right at this time that EU-China relations are more important than ever. We need to maintain high-level dialogue and resolve our issues and concerns in a friendly manner so that both sides can benefit and create more value. BR

This move comes as Haas-Meincke was renamed to Bühler Denmark to indicate the complete integration into the Bühler Group since its acquisition in 2018. The production of ovens for biscuit and cracker lines will be consolidated into one location in Roedkaersbro, Denmark to optimize and renew the company's production footprint. The company will also use the new office to host customer visits and industry events.

The Coca-Cola Company and its authorized bottler, Coca-Cola Beverages Africa, unveiled plans to grow its investment in Kenya by up to US$175 million over the next five years, should the business achieve its anticipated growth targets in the country. The Coca-Cola system also works with over 500,000 Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises across the region, directly linking the experiences shared by many businesses in Kenya and across the East African region. Coca-Cola Beverages Africa accounts for over 40% of all Coca-Cola products sold in Africa by volume.

Lower energy prices in the UK pushed inflation closer to 2%, according to the British Retail Consortium (BRC). Recent consumer price inflation figures showed headline inflation falling to 2.3% and food inflation falling 1.1 percentage points to 2.9%. Commenting on this, Kris Hamer, director of Insight of the BRC, said that inflation continued to head back toward the Bank of England's 2% target, with a significant drop in April. Meanwhile, the lowest energy price cap in two years and food inflation falling to its lowest level since November 2021 helped to reduce pressure on household finances with significant falls in the inflation rate of alcoholic beverages. The price of fresh, dried and preserved fruit products also declined. He acknowledged retailers' role in bringing prices down but called for the government's support too.

The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) allocated US$300 million to 66 US organizations, under the new Regional Agricultural Promotion Program (RAPP) to amplify demand for American food and farm exports in high-potential markets globally. The funding involves various projects encompassing various products and markets such as cranberries, yellow pine, hazelnut, dairy, meat and beer. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said the move is important to reverse the decline of small and mid-sized farms and raise wealth that stays in rural communities.

Coca-Cola's investment in Africa will bolster its capacity in a country where it employs 10,000 people (Image credit: Coca Cola Beverages Africa).Innovation and launches

Kraft Heinz unveiled its Canadian brand Pure JL KRAFT for shelf-stable premium dressings and marinades made with no artificial preservatives, flavors or colors. The move marks Kraft Heinz Canada's ""first innovation"" in the salad dressing category in over five years. The launch targets consumers who prefer homemade salad dressings but crave convenience. The range includes twelve flavors: Pomegranate Zaatar, Honey & Shallots, Miso Lime Ginger, Moroccan Lemon, Orange Turmeric Poppyseed, Black Garlic, and Cracked Pepper.

Kirin Holdings addressed the problem of ""excessive salt consumption"" among the Japanese by launching an ""Electric Salt Spoon"" that uses electricity to enhance salty and umami flavor by 1.5 times. The spoons have a unique current waveform that enhances the taste sensation of low-sodium foods to tackle consumer dissatisfaction associated with them. The technology has been developed through joint research with Japan's Meiji University. The innovation is essential for the country since the daily salt intake of Japanese people over 20 years of age is 10.1g, much higher than the recommended by the WHO of 5.0g.

Food safety highlights

The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) alerted traders'/fruits handlers and Food Business Operators operating fruit ripening chambers to ""strictly ensure compliance"" with the prohibition on calcium carbide for artificial ripening of fruits, particularly during the mango season. The chemical is banned in India but is often used for ripening fruits like mangoes, releasing acetylene gas, which contains harmful traces of arsenic and phosphorus. These substances, also known as 'Masala,' can cause serious health issues such as dizziness, frequent thirst, irritation, weakness, difficulty in swallowing, vomiting and skin ulcers.

The FSSAI has banned the use of calcium carbide for ripening fruits like mangoes in India.ScaleUp Bio secured a food manufacturing license from the Singapore Food Agency for its commercial pilot production facility in Singapore.

NEW YORK, May 23, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- The LEGO Group is harnessing children's creativity and imagination to show the world what may await us in space.

A new global study by the LEGO Group finds that 86 percent of kids aged four to 14 are interested in finding new planets, stars and galaxies, and 77 percent want to travel to space. Additionally, more than 3 in 5 (68 percent) children believe there are aliens in space, and 64 percent say they would want to meet one.

The LEGO Group, drawing inspiration from the universe for over 50 years, aims to unite children's curiosity about space through the ultimate creative medium of LEGO® bricks. This year, the company is unveiling many epic Space-themed sets like the LEGO® Friends Stargazing Camping Vehicle, inviting adventurers to stargaze and spot constellations, and the LEGO® City Space Explorer Rover and Alien Life Playset, enabling kids to explore new worlds and unleash their creativity.

Scientists estimate that only four percent of our universe has been explored, with just 646 people ever seeing the great beyond in person. The LEGO Group predicts that Gen Alpha's eagerness to search the cosmos will be the key to exploring the 96 percent of the universe still to be discovered.

Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No, it's a UPO!

The LEGO Group asked kids across the world to share their visions of how they would like to explore the cosmos. With the help of Associate Master Builder at LEGO House, Didac Perez Soriano, a selection of these spacecrafts were reimagined in LEGO bricks.

The LEGO Group then showcased the future of space travel according to a group of young budding space explorers - Lotty (10, UK), Sebastian (10, Denmark), Jace (13, Hong Kong SAR, China), Jillian (7, USA), Jordan (12, USA) and Orla (6, UK) - by blasting their unique designs, playfully coined Unidentified Playing Objects (UPOs), over the New York City skyline.

Taking over the most photographed skyline of all time, the show included a space bed UPO powered by butterfly wings complete with a snack drawer for long journeys, a turtle spaceship that walks on the moon, a dog spaceship with 360° windows to see all that space has to offer, and a dinosaur ship with a jetpack, among others.

Didac Perez Soriano, Associate Master Builder at LEGO House, said: ""Children are our inspiration for play and creativity. At LEGO House, we aim to provide the pinnacle experience for letting play and creativity run free, and that's why I leapt at the opportunity to build 3D representations of their creative spaceships in LEGO bricks. The imagination shown by young children around the world was mind-blowing and this was one of the best experiences I have had. I'm ecstatic we can share these with the world. With so much of the universe still to be explored, we can't say that what they have created isn't possible or even out there already.""

Lotty Ingle, the 10-year-old designer of the butterfly wing powered bed spaceship from Leeds, UK, said: ""I was over the moon when I found out that my design had been picked. I kept saying to my mum ""Really?"", ""No, but really Mum?"". I like to be eco-friendly and didn't want to use any electricity so I thought butterfly wings would be a good idea. I would love to travel to all the planets that no one has discovered yet and see if there is life there, and if they are just like us. I would really like them to try all my favourite snacks that I am bringing with me.""

All UPOs in their LEGO brick form can be viewed at the ""Explore Space Your Way"" exhibition at LEGO House in Billund, Denmark, until June 17. LEGO House is the ultimate destination for celebrating everything beyond our world. The collaborative exhibition with the Technical University of Denmark at LEGO Square allows visitors to learn more about the infinite depths of space through wildly creative exhibits crafted entirely from LEGO bricks.

Reimagining the Constellations

While the constellations of our night sky have been set by astronomers in history, the LEGO Group also believes that Gen Alpha can bring a new creative lens to our view of the stars. Celebrating kids' curiosity about the future of space, the LEGO Group is asking children to reimagine the night sky with their own Funstellations.

With a guardian's help, children are invited to visit LEGO.com/Space to download a sky map and join the dots together to show what object or shape they can see in the stars - maybe it's a cowboy riding a unicorn or a flying whale.

The LEGO Group will then work with the International Astronomical Union to recognise their formations as Funstellations - official reimaginations of our constellations - and update our vision of the night sky.

Debra Elmegreen, President of the International Astronomical Union said: ""We are excited to tap into the unbridled creativity of children through this collaboration by encouraging them to look up at the night sky and think about the stars. The next generation of scientists and space explorers will shape how we understand and interact with the Universe. With this project, we hope to give them a head start.""

The LEGO Group's mission is to inspire and develop the builders of tomorrow through the power of play. The LEGO System in Play, with its foundation in LEGO bricks, allows children and fans to build and rebuild anything they can imagine.

The LEGO Group was founded in Billund, Denmark in 1932 by Ole Kirk Kristiansen, its name derived from the two Danish words Leg Godt, which means ""Play Well"". Today, the LEGO Group remains a family-owned company headquartered in Billund. However, its products are now sold in more than 130 countries worldwide.

Operator: Thank you for standing by ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Star Bulk Carriers Conference Call on the First Quarter 2024 Financial Results. We have with us. Mr. Petros Pappas's, Chief Executive Officer; Mr. Hamish Norton, President; Mr. Simos Spyrou and Mr. Christos Begleris, Co-Chief Financial Officers; Mr. Nicos Rescos, Chief Operating Officer; and Mrs. Charis Plakantonaki, Chief Strategy Officer of the company. At this time all participants are on a listen only more. There will be a presentation followed by a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. I must advise you that this conference is being recorded today. We now pass the floor to one of the speakers today. Mr. Christos Begleris. Please go ahead sir.

Christos Begleris: Thank you very much. I'm Christos Begleris Co-CFO at Star Bulk Carriers and I would like to welcome you to our conference call regarding our financial results for the first quarter of 2024. Before we begin, I kindly ask you to take a moment to read the Safe Harbor statement on Slide 2 of our presentation. In today's presentation, we will go through our Q1 results, cash evolution during the quarter, actions taken to create value for our shareholders, and update on the Eagle Bulk integration, vessel operations, fleet update, the latest on the ESG front and our views on industry fundamentals before opening up for questions. Let us now turn to Slide 3 of the presentation for a summary of our first quarter 2024 highlights. For the first quarter the company reported the following, net income amounted to $75 million with adjusted net income of $73 million or $0.87 adjusted earnings per share. Adjusted EBITDA was $123 million for the quarter. For the first quarter as per our existing dividend policy, we declared a dividend per share of $0.75 payable on or about June 6, 2023. Since 2021 dividend distributions and share buybacks are over $1.2 billion and $0.4 billion respectively. Our total liquidity today stands strong at $472 million. Meanwhile, our total debt stands at $1.45 billion. On the top right of the page you will see our daily figures per vessel for the quarter. Our TCE rate was 19,627 per vessel per day, our combined daily OpEx and net cash G&A expenses per vessel per day amounted to 6,185. Therefore our TCE less OpEx and cash G&A is around $13,442 per vessel per day. Following Eagle shareholders' approval on April 9th, the Eagle Bulk transaction was completed and each Eagle Bulk shareholder received 2.6211 Star Bulk shares per share of Eagle. Eagle Bulk's convertible notes will be exchangeable at the conversion rate equal to 83.67 shares of Star Bulk common stock when it matures on August 1, 2024. Cash received following the Eagle merger amounted to $104.3 million. Currently, we have 161 vessels on a fully delivered basis, including the five newbuilding Kamsarmax vessels we have announced. During 2024, we have sold eight vessels for total gross proceeds of $150 million. Four of these vessels, namely Star Audrey, Star Pyxis, Stellar Eagle and Crowned Eagle, are expected to be delivered during Q2 to their new owners. Slide 4, graphically illustrates the change in the company's cash balance during the first quarter. We started the quarter with $262 million in cash and generated positive cash flow for operating activities of $114 million, including debt proceeds and repayments, CapEx payments for energy saving devices and Ballast Water Treatment System installments and the Q4 dividend payment, we arrived at the cash balance of $269 million at the end of the quarter. . Slide 5, provides an overview of the company's capital allocation policy over the last three years, and the various levers we have used to create shareholder value. On the top left, we show our net debt reduction. Since 2021 we have reduced leverage in the company by 43%. Over the same period we have declared consecutive quarterly dividends totaling $1.2 billion. We have taken advantage of historically elevated S&P values to sell some of our older and less efficient vessels using the equity proceeds to buy back our shares at attractive values. Since 2022, we have bought back $423 million worth of Star Bulk stock. 20 million shares, valued at $380 million, were bought in the fourth quarter of 2023 form Oaktree. Even that, our shares at the time were trading at a significant discount to net asset value and we used process from vessel sales at net asset value, we have taken advantage of the arbitrage to create shareholder value. Combining all of the above, you see that we are focused on returning capital to shareholders while at the same time, deleveraging the balance sheet and buying back shares when the opportunity is to do so accretively. In total, since 2021, we have taken actions of $2.1 billion to create value for our shareholders. I will now pass the floor to our COO, Nicos Rescos, for an update on the Eagle Bulk transaction integration and operational performance.

Nicos Rescos: Thank you, Christos. Slide 6 illustrates a summary of the Eagle Bulk transaction integration. The merger with Eagle Bulk will allow us to leverage our strong global presence of the combined entity with offices in Singapore, the US, Greece, Denmark and Cyprus. The respective Singapore offices are to merge into one and continue as a commercial and technical management hub covering the Asia Pacific. The Stanford office is to continue both on commercial and technical management, covering the Atlantic and the US markets. Together with the Athens headquarters in Europe, we will maintain presence in Copenhagen for chartering operations covering the Atlantic, continent of the Mediterranean. We are creating a new integrated commercial team, managing the second largest Ultramax/Supramax fleet globally to combine capabilities and name for improved time-chatter performance. We also aim to rebalance employment strategy and include Voyage business. We have already refinanced the ex-Eagle debt facility, resulting in interest cost savings of $3.2 million per year. We have executed new insurance agreements for the ex-Eagle vessel saving $1.9 million per annum in insurance premium costs. Crewing will be gradually taken in-house, with an expected cost reduction of about $600 per vessel per day during the next 18 months. Significant synergies are expected from the centralization of procurement of all stores, spare parts and lubricants. Dry docks of ex-Eagle Bulk vessels will benefit from Star Bulk competitive pricing agreements with service providers and shipyards globally. Marine Safety Quality and Technical maintenance standards, processes, policies, and systems are to be applied across the combined fleet, aiming to align with the Star Bulk Rightship Safety Score and Port State Control performance. Lastly systems integrations are under way to enable efficiencies among offices and departments and create further synergies. Turn into Slide 7. We provide an operational update. OpEx expenses was at $4,962 for Q1, 2024. Net cash G&A expenses were at $1,223 per vessel per day for the same period. In addition we continue to raise at the top amongst our listed peers in terms of Rightship Safety Score. Slide 8 provides a fleet update and some guidance around the future dry dock and the relevant total off-hire days. On the top right of the page we provide a CapEx schedule illustrating our new building CapEx and vessel energy efficiency upgrade with a 100% of our fleet by now being ballast water system fitted. Our expected dry dock expense for the remainder of 2024 is estimated $42.4 million for the dry docking of 51 vessels, including 12 ex-Eagle Bulk vessels. In total we expect to have approximately 1,250 off‐hire days for the same period. Based on our latest construction schedule our newbuilding vessels are expected to be delivered during Q4 of 2025, Q2 and Q3 of 2026. In the with EEXI and CII regulations will continue investing in upgrading our fleet with the latest operation technologies available aimed in improving our fuel consumption and reducing our environmental footprint, and further enhancing commercial attractiveness of the Star Bulk fleet. Regarding our energy saving devices, programmed during the quarter, we have completed and tested retrofits on four vessels with 19 more vessels planned for retrofit by the end of 2024. The above numbers are based on current estimates around dry dock, retrofit planning, vessel employment and yard capacity. Turning to Slide 9 for an update on our fleet sales. On the vessel sales front will continue disposing of vessels opportunistically at historically attractive levels, having agreed during Q1 to sell seven vessels for a total gross process of $134 million, reducing our average fleet age and improving overall fleet efficiency. During the second quarter, we have further agreed to sell one more vessel the Crowned Eagle. We took delivery of three out of the six long-term chartering Eco vessels that will be delivered to us throughout 2024 and specifically to Tsuneishi Cebu with Kamsarmax, and a Tsuneishi Zhousan with Ultramax. The Eagle Bulk existing chartering contracts have been rolled over to Star Bulk following the merger. We have five firm shipbuilding contracts with Qingdao Shipyard for the construction of 82,000 dwt Kamsarmax newbuilding vessels. Considering the aforementioned changes in our fleet mix, we operate one of the largest dry dock fleet amongst US and European listed peers, with 161 vessels on a fully delivered basis and an average age of 11.3 years. I will now pass the floor to our Chief Strategy Officer, Charis Plakantonaki for an ESG update.

Charis Plakantonaki: Thank you, Nicos. Please turn to Slide 10, where we highlight our continued leadership on the ESP front. The Star Bulk Sustainalytics' ESG Risk Smart Score has further improved from 21.3 medium risk to 19.0 low risk, maintaining Star Bulk's number 1 ranking among US-listed peers and positioning the company as one of the best-performing companies globally in the category transportation shipping. During Q1 2024, we began, along with our partners, the scoping of work and initial projects with the Maritime Emissions Reduction Centre to develop and adopt new and existing solutions for reducing GHG emissions from the global fleet. The Centre was granted the Motivation Award at the ESG Shipping Awards International 2024. On the regulatory front, MEPC 81 has progressed discussions related to IMO's mid-term market-based measures, which are set to come in to force in 2027. We are continuously assessing the impact of upcoming environmental regulations and considering action plan options for compliance. As part of Star Bulk's program to enhance diversity and inclusion, our first two female cadets have embarked on board one of our Newcastlemax vessels. We continue the deployment of Starlink along with the installation of Firewalls on board our vessels and have embarked on a project to equip our vessels with the CyberOwl technology to digitalize and advance the monitoring of onboard systems' performance and security. On the governance front, and as part of our enhanced Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, we have launched a new online Whistleblowing platform on the company's website to encourage open reporting by employees, crews, and third parties, safeguard confidentiality and anonymity, and improve the handling and monitoring process of any whistleblowing reports. I will now pass the floor to our CEO, Petros Pappas for a market update and his closing remarks.

Petros Pappas: Thank you, Charis. Please turn to Slide 11, for a brief update of supply. During the first four months of 2024 a total of 12.1 million dead weight was delivered and 1.6 million dead weight was sent to demolition for a net fleet growth of 10.5 million dead weight or 2.9% year-on-year. Uncertainty on future green propulsion, high shipbuilding costs and limited shipyard capacity until late 2026 have helped keep new orders under relative control. The order book presently stands at a low level of 9.3% of the fleet. Furthermore vessels above 20 and 15 years of age stand at 8.8% and 21.2% of the fleet while scrap prices stabilized at elevated levels and to make demolition of overage and energy inefficient tonnage and attractive option during seasonal downturns over the next years. The average steaming speed of the dry dock feet decrease to a new record low level in January, due to downward pressures from inflated bunker costs and new environmental regulations. Having said that, over the last two months speech have rebounded to 11.2 knots following the higher freight rate environment and a stabilization of oil prices. We expect emissions regulations including EXI and CII to increasingly incentivize slow steaming retrofits and to help moderate supply over the next several years. Global port congestion follow the strong downward trend over the last two years, the gradually inflated available supply by approximately 5%. During the first quarter of 2024 congestion appears to have fully normalized on all sizes and going forward we expect it to follow seasonal trends. Moreover Panama Canal constraints since mid-2023 and rising tension in the Red Sea continue to cause strong inefficiencies portrayed with a positive effect on the supply demand balance of 2024. As a result of the above trends, nominal fleet growth is unlikely to exceed 2.5% per annum over the next couple of years. Let us now turn to Slide 12 for a brief update of demand. According to Clarkson's total dry dock trade during 2023 is projected to expand by 1.6% in tons and 2.4% in ton miles. During the first quarter 2024 total dry dock volumes increased by approximately 5.5% year-on-year supported by iron ore, coal and record minor bulk exports. While ton-miles increased at a faster pace, due to favorable conditions in Brazil and canal inefficiencies. The IMF is projecting global GDP growth at 3.2% for 2024 and 2025. The same pace as in 2023 with China projected to slow down to 4.6% and 4.1% respectively. Nevertheless, Chinese GDP increased by 5.3% in Q1, faster than initially expected, while dry bulk imports were up by 8.2% compared to last year. The country's full economic recovery from COVID-19 has yet to unfold due to the struggling property market, but has received support by strength in infrastructure manufacturing and exports. Dry bulk demand from the rest of the world is experiencing a strong recovery over the last quarters. That is expected to continue as it receives support from lower commodity prices and expectations of using monetary policy. During the first quarter, imports were up by 2.9% year-on-year, with increase coming mainly from India and Far East countries, while imports from western economies are also moving higher, following two years of contraction. Iron ore trade is projected to remain flat in tons and to expand by 1% in ton miles during 2024. China's steel production declined by 3.1% year-on-year during the first quarter. Weak domestic consumption is forcing steel makers to export excess output and some western economies are raising tariffs as a response. At the same time, domestic iron ore production and imports increased by 15.7% and 7% respectively, and have helped through stockpiles higher. On the other hand, steel production from the rest of the world has been on a strong upward trend since September and increased by 7.2% during the first quarter. Coal trade is projected to contract by 0.3% in tons and by 2.5% in ton miles during 2024 Global focus on energy security has inflated coal trade, while Atlantic exporters have redistributed the original quantities east with positive effect for ton miles. Chinese imports surged 61% during 2023 and remains strong during the first quarter of 2024, supported by 4.1% year-on-year decline in domestic coal production and a 7.4% year-on-year increase in thermal electricity generation. Furthermore, India is emerging as a leading buyer of coal during the last quarters as consumption has outpaced domestic production and has led to a strong increase in imports Grains trade is projected to expand by 2.1% tons and by 5.2% ton miles during 2024. Exports from Latin America increased by approximately 14% during the first quarter, following strong Brazilian soybean exports and a recovery of Argentinian volumes. However, Ukraine increased exports to the highest level since the start of the war, while lower grain prices, improving crop forecasts and increased focus on food security is projected to support grain trade in the medium term. Minor bulk trade is projected to expand by 3.7% in tons and by 4.7% in ton miles during 2024. Minor bulk trade has the highest correlation to global GDP growth, and the recent trend in the container market provides a positive indicator for short-term prospects of smaller sites. The positive price arbitrage continues to incentivize Chinese steel exports and backhaul trades, while bauxite exports out of West Africa continue to expand at the high priced pace and generate strong ton miles for Capesize vessels. As a final comment, the long-term prospects of the dry bulk market remain positive due to favorable supply dynamics, increased inefficiencies in trade, and a recovery of demand supported by large global infrastructure investment needs for the world's green transition. Star Bulk expects to take advantage of the recent strength in the dry bulk market, having mostly maintained its diverse scrubber fitted fleet in the spot market, and thus continue to create value for its shareholders. Without taking any more of your time, I will now pass the floor over to the operator to answer any questions you may have.

Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Omar Nokta with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.

Omar Nokta: Thank you. Hey guys, good afternoon. Just a couple questions from me, and you've been asked this before. I recall you were asked shortly after the Eagle announcement. Just in general, how you view the Star Bulk fleet from here. Petros, you just talked about the diversified. Just towards the end of the comments you mentioned the diversified fleet. You've been more dynamic recently. Obviously with the merger, you've sold some ships. Post-merger now you are a bit bottom heavy on the super ultra side, obviously giving you more exposure to the minor bulk trade. I guess in general, as we think of you being more dynamic with the fleet, are Capes a place - Capesize vessels, is that a place you'd like to see a higher ratio of Star's fleet going forward, or do you prefer to build or increase the sub-cape ratio of the fleet? Sorry for the long-winded question.

Petros Pappas: Thank you, Omar. Well, it happened that this is a Supramax - Supramax fleet. Next merger may be a Cape fleet, who knows. For the time being, you are right. We are smaller vessel heavy, but that also gives us an opportunity, in the sense that during high markets like this is, one can sell older vessels of the fleet and that way keep the average age at a better level. So I think that going forward, you may see us sell some of our less efficient and older vessels, and that may rectify the count until we make our next move.

Omar Nokta: Makes sense. Thanks Petros, and maybe just to follow-up. In terms of just the debt load at the moment with the company, you have $1.4 billion of debt and you've got 470 or so of cash. How are you thinking about that amount of debt in general? Are you comfortable keeping at that level? You have on slide five, the 43% reductions in that debt since '21. Do you feel the need to keep that trend going and lowering that figure or are you okay with the current balance?

Hamish Norton: For the moment, Omar, we're continuing to delever at basically the same absolute rate as we've been delevering for a while. We're paying down $250 million in debt a year and for the foreseeable future we're going to keep doing that. Obviously at some point we get to net debt zero and we'll figure out something to do then. But we want to set the company up to be able to get into the era of decarbonization and we think you need a strong company with a strong balance sheet to do that well.

Omar Nokta: Yeah. No, I agree. And then I guess just on that, potentially getting to net debt zero, is that in any way a shift or a change the different policy approach or the minimum cash requirements you are looking to keep?

Hamish Norton: We have no current plans to change any of our capital allocation policies. If the world changes, the policy may change, but for the moment, the policy is our policy.

Omar Nokta: Okay, very good. Thanks Hamish and thanks Petros. I'll turn it over.

Petros Pappas: Thank you, Omar.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line Ben Nolan with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.

Ben Nolan: Yeah, thanks. Actually first, Hamish, could you maybe dive into that comment that you made there about wanting to have a strong balance sheet to move into decarbonizing the world or I forget exactly how you framed it. What does that - does that mean at some point you are going to need to replace the assets for things that have much lower carbon emissions or maybe just unpack that comment if you could.

A - Hamish Norton: I mean, I guess the answer is, we don't actually know what's going to happen and if you don't know what's going to happen, that sounds like a really good reason to have a strong balance sheet. The more you know what's going to happen, the more you can lever up in anticipation of what's going to happen. But yes, I mean we think that probably there will be expensive ships burning expensive fuel, getting really high charter rates, and we think it will be very good for the business and very good for us, because we think it will favor large companies that can afford R&D and compliance and all the overheads that go with having a difficult regulatory environment. But whatever it is, it's going to favor big companies with lots of resources and a strong balance sheet.

Christos Begleris: And if I may add to Hamish's point, this is Christos. Hi Ben. We think it's proven that during a healthy market would reduced debt as much as possible, so that in the future, effectively we have more capacity to take on, more debt when the prices are lower and when we want to further leverage on the upside.

Ben Nolan: Sure. Yeah, and I absolutely agree with that. Sticking with sort of the decarbonization theme a little bit, I know that you guys have investigated or invested in some cases in certain early stage R&D type technologies. Curious if you have any updated thoughts on what that might look like, whether it's carbon capture or any particular fuel types that you think are emerging as the best candidates? Any new color in that respect?

Nicos Rescos: Hi Ben, this is Nicos. For the time being we're investing on technologies that have been tested, so basically improving as much as we can with this in fleet. You have noticed that we are continuing installing energy efficiency devices that are proven to decrease our consumption and improve the commercial appeal of each vessel. We are agnostic of all technologies growing in the market. We're testing the [inaudible], we're testing paints, they both have an effect on performance. We have tested carbon capture on both or all of our vessels, but it's a matter of putting on ends to meet in order to make these a viable commercial solution. We do believe that it is an intermediate solution that will have pure, that will be widely acceptable, both in terms of supply, consumption, and of course on the engines. But for the time being we're trying to improve the existing vessels as much as we can. Star Bulk current shares [ph], yes, we do have hope that this may materialize later into the year.

Ben Nolan: Okay, that's helpful. And then lastly for me, it seems like, and I appreciate the color that you guys gave on the integration of Eagle, and it seems like so far so good with respect to finding synergies, which I know is difficult in this industry, but the costs are down. The share price is up, and at least by my math is above NAV, so that part of the thesis has played out thus far. I'm curious if that is opening the doors for other opportunities. And Petros, I know you talked about the next merger, what have you. Are you finding potential sellers out there that can look at that transaction and say, this is a good liquidity event for me and a way to maximize the value for my assets and at the same time you guys can utilize your shares as a currency?

Hamish Norton: Well look, everything like this helps, like closing one deal and doing a good job of it is clearly going to help our reputation in the market for other deals. But I don't underestimate how hard these deals already get done. We have gotten a lot of them done, but they are always hard to close and they are always low probability. That being said, we're looking at possible transactions, and we may be able to do one or more. We certainly intend to try to keep growing.

Ben Nolan: Okay, that's all. I guess, are you maybe more optimistic about that than maybe you would have been a few months ago?

Hamish Norton: I think we are more optimistic, but I hope our optimism is actually able to influence the way the world works. We're doing our best.

Petros Pappas: Ben, I think that we are more optimistic than usual, also because of the environmental regulations. I think they will have an impact, a positive impact on the supply, and so I think this is going to happen to take place for several years going forward, so that's a good basis for our optimism I believe.

Hamish Norton: Yeah, I mean what the environmental regulations do in large part is make it no fun to operate a small shipping company. For a long time, for centuries it's been great fun to operate a small shipping company. I think that's changing and the business is becoming less fun and more sort of demanding of a large corporate organization.

Ben Nolan: Yeah, well it's always fun to have fun. So, I appreciate the color and I appreciate it. Thanks.

Petros Pappas: Thank you, Ben.

Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And it looks like we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the call back forward to Mr. Petros Pappas for closing remarks.

Petros Pappas: No further comments operator. Thank you very much.

Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference and you may disconnect your line. Thank you for your participation.",investing.com,news,Investing.com,,0.4588235294117646,454190999,1,https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/LYNXNPEB9M0BY_L.jpg,

I must advise you that this conference is being recorded today. We now pass the floor to one of the speakers today. Mr. Christos Begleris. Please go ahead sir.

Christos Begleris: Thank you very much. I'm Christos Begleris Co-CFO at Star Bulk Carriers and I would like to welcome you to our conference call regarding our financial results for the first quarter of 2024. Before we begin, I kindly ask you to take a moment to read the Safe Harbor statement on Slide 2 of our presentation. In today's presentation, we will go through our Q1 results, cash evolution during the quarter, actions taken to create value for our shareholders, and update on the Eagle Bulk integration, vessel operations, fleet update, the latest on the ESG front and our views on industry fundamentals before opening up for questions. Let us now turn to Slide 3 of the presentation for a summary of our first quarter 2024 highlights. For the first quarter the company reported the following, net income amounted to $75 million with adjusted net income of $73 million or $0.87 adjusted earnings per share. Adjusted EBITDA was $123 million for the quarter. For the first quarter as per our existing dividend policy, we declared a dividend per share of $0.75 payable on or about June 6, 2023. Since 2021 dividend distributions and share buybacks are over $1.2 billion and $0.4 billion respectively. Our total liquidity today stands strong at $472 million. Meanwhile, our total debt stands at $1.45 billion. On the top right of the page you will see our daily figures per vessel for the quarter. Our TCE rate was 19,627 per vessel per day, our combined daily OpEx and net cash G&A expenses per vessel per day amounted to 6,185. Therefore our TCE less OpEx and cash G&A is around $13,442 per vessel per day. Following Eagle shareholders' approval on April 9th, the Eagle Bulk transaction was completed and each Eagle Bulk shareholder received 2.6211 Star Bulk shares per share of Eagle. Eagle Bulk's convertible notes will be exchangeable at the conversion rate equal to 83.67 shares of Star Bulk common stock when it matures on August 1, 2024. Cash received following the Eagle merger amounted to $104.3 million. Currently, we have 161 vessels on a fully delivered basis, including the five newbuilding Kamsarmax vessels we have announced. During 2024, we have sold eight vessels for total gross proceeds of $150 million. Four of these vessels, namely Star Audrey, Star Pyxis, Stellar Eagle and Crowned Eagle, are expected to be delivered during Q2 to their new owners. Slide 4, graphically illustrates the change in the company's cash balance during the first quarter. We started the quarter with $262 million in cash and generated positive cash flow for operating activities of $114 million, including debt proceeds and repayments, CapEx payments for energy saving devices and Ballast Water Treatment System installments and the Q4 dividend payment, we arrived at the cash balance of $269 million at the end of the quarter. . Slide 5, provides an overview of the company's capital allocation policy over the last three years, and the various levers we have used to create shareholder value. On the top left, we show our net debt reduction. Since 2021 we have reduced leverage in the company by 43%. Over the same period we have declared consecutive quarterly dividends totaling $1.2 billion. We have taken advantage of historically elevated S&P values to sell some of our older and less efficient vessels using the equity proceeds to buy back our shares at attractive values. Since 2022, we have bought back $423 million worth of Star Bulk stock. 20 million shares, valued at $380 million, were bought in the fourth quarter of 2023 form Oaktree. Even that, our shares at the time were trading at a significant discount to net asset value and we used process from vessel sales at net asset value, we have taken advantage of the arbitrage to create shareholder value. Combining all of the above, you see that we are focused on returning capital to shareholders while at the same time, deleveraging the balance sheet and buying back shares when the opportunity is to do so accretively. In total, since 2021, we have taken actions of $2.1 billion to create value for our shareholders. I will now pass the floor to our COO, Nicos Rescos, for an update on the Eagle Bulk transaction integration and operational performance.

Nicos Rescos: Thank you, Christos. Slide 6 illustrates a summary of the Eagle Bulk transaction integration. The merger with Eagle Bulk will allow us to leverage our strong global presence of the combined entity with offices in Singapore, the US, Greece, Denmark and Cyprus. The respective Singapore offices are to merge into one and continue as a commercial and technical management hub covering the Asia Pacific. The Stanford office is to continue both on commercial and technical management, covering the Atlantic and the US markets. Together with the Athens headquarters in Europe, we will maintain presence in Copenhagen for chartering operations covering the Atlantic, continent of the Mediterranean. We are creating a new integrated commercial team, managing the second largest Ultramax/Supramax fleet globally to combine capabilities and name for improved time-chatter performance. We also aim to rebalance employment strategy and include Voyage business. We have already refinanced the ex-Eagle debt facility, resulting in interest cost savings of $3.2 million per year. We have executed new insurance agreements for the ex-Eagle vessel saving $1.9 million per annum in insurance premium costs. Crewing will be gradually taken in-house, with an expected cost reduction of about $600 per vessel per day during the next 18 months. Significant synergies are expected from the centralization of procurement of all stores, spare parts and lubricants. Dry docks of ex-Eagle Bulk vessels will benefit from Star Bulk competitive pricing agreements with service providers and shipyards globally. Marine Safety Quality and Technical maintenance standards, processes, policies, and systems are to be applied across the combined fleet, aiming to align with the Star Bulk Rightship Safety Score and Port State Control performance. Lastly systems integrations are under way to enable efficiencies among offices and departments and create further synergies. Turn into Slide 7. We provide an operational update. OpEx expenses was at $4,962 for Q1, 2024. Net cash G&A expenses were at $1,223 per vessel per day for the same period. In addition we continue to raise at the top amongst our listed peers in terms of Rightship Safety Score. Slide 8 provides a fleet update and some guidance around the future dry dock and the relevant total off-hire days. On the top right of the page we provide a CapEx schedule illustrating our new building CapEx and vessel energy efficiency upgrade with a 100% of our fleet by now being ballast water system fitted. Our expected dry dock expense for the remainder of 2024 is estimated $42.4 million for the dry docking of 51 vessels, including 12 ex-Eagle Bulk vessels. In total we expect to have approximately 1,250 off‐hire days for the same period. Based on our latest construction schedule our newbuilding vessels are expected to be delivered during Q4 of 2025, Q2 and Q3 of 2026. In the with EEXI and CII regulations will continue investing in upgrading our fleet with the latest operation technologies available aimed in improving our fuel consumption and reducing our environmental footprint, and further enhancing commercial attractiveness of the Star Bulk fleet. Regarding our energy saving devices, programmed during the quarter, we have completed and tested retrofits on four vessels with 19 more vessels planned for retrofit by the end of 2024. The above numbers are based on current estimates around dry dock, retrofit planning, vessel employment and yard capacity. Turning to Slide 9 for an update on our fleet sales. On the vessel sales front will continue disposing of vessels opportunistically at historically attractive levels, having agreed during Q1 to sell seven vessels for a total gross process of $134 million, reducing our average fleet age and improving overall fleet efficiency. During the second quarter, we have further agreed to sell one more vessel the Crowned Eagle. We took delivery of three out of the six long-term chartering Eco vessels that will be delivered to us throughout 2024 and specifically to Tsuneishi Cebu with Kamsarmax, and a Tsuneishi Zhousan with Ultramax. The Eagle Bulk existing chartering contracts have been rolled over to Star Bulk following the merger. We have five firm shipbuilding contracts with Qingdao Shipyard for the construction of 82,000 dwt Kamsarmax newbuilding vessels. Considering the aforementioned changes in our fleet mix, we operate one of the largest dry dock fleet amongst US and European listed peers, with 161 vessels on a fully delivered basis and an average age of 11.3 years. I will now pass the floor to our Chief Strategy Officer, Charis Plakantonaki for an ESG update.

Charis Plakantonaki: Thank you, Nicos. Please turn to Slide 10, where we highlight our continued leadership on the ESP front. The Star Bulk Sustainalytics' ESG Risk Smart Score has further improved from 21.3 medium risk to 19.0 low risk, maintaining Star Bulk's number 1 ranking among US-listed peers and positioning the company as one of the best-performing companies globally in the category transportation shipping. During Q1 2024, we began, along with our partners, the scoping of work and initial projects with the Maritime Emissions Reduction Centre to develop and adopt new and existing solutions for reducing GHG emissions from the global fleet. The Centre was granted the Motivation Award at the ESG Shipping Awards International 2024. On the regulatory front, MEPC 81 has progressed discussions related to IMO's mid-term market-based measures, which are set to come in to force in 2027. We are continuously assessing the impact of upcoming environmental regulations and considering action plan options for compliance. As part of Star Bulk's program to enhance diversity and inclusion, our first two female cadets have embarked on board one of our Newcastlemax vessels. We continue the deployment of Starlink along with the installation of Firewalls on board our vessels and have embarked on a project to equip our vessels with the CyberOwl technology to digitalize and advance the monitoring of onboard systems' performance and security. On the governance front, and as part of our enhanced Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, we have launched a new online Whistleblowing platform on the company's website to encourage open reporting by employees, crews, and third parties, safeguard confidentiality and anonymity, and improve the handling and monitoring process of any whistleblowing reports. I will now pass the floor to our CEO, Petros Pappas for a market update and his closing remarks.

Petros Pappas: Thank you, Charis. Please turn to Slide 11, for a brief update of supply. During the first four months of 2024 a total of 12.1 million dead weight was delivered and 1.6 million dead weight was sent to demolition for a net fleet growth of 10.5 million dead weight or 2.9% year-on-year. Uncertainty on future green propulsion, high shipbuilding costs and limited shipyard capacity until late 2026 have helped keep new orders under relative control. The order book presently stands at a low level of 9.3% of the fleet. Furthermore vessels above 20 and 15 years of age stand at 8.8% and 21.2% of the fleet while scrap prices stabilized at elevated levels and to make demolition of overage and energy inefficient tonnage and attractive option during seasonal downturns over the next years. The average steaming speed of the dry dock feet decrease to a new record low level in January, due to downward pressures from inflated bunker costs and new environmental regulations. Having said that, over the last two months speech have rebounded to 11.2 knots following the higher freight rate environment and a stabilization of oil prices. We expect emissions regulations including EXI and CII to increasingly incentivize slow steaming retrofits and to help moderate supply over the next several years. Global port congestion follow the strong downward trend over the last two years, the gradually inflated available supply by approximately 5%. During the first quarter of 2024 congestion appears to have fully normalized on all sizes and going forward we expect it to follow seasonal trends. Moreover Panama Canal constraints since mid-2023 and rising tension in the Red Sea continue to cause strong inefficiencies portrayed with a positive effect on the supply demand balance of 2024. As a result of the above trends, nominal fleet growth is unlikely to exceed 2.5% per annum over the next couple of years. Let us now turn to Slide 12 for a brief update of demand. According to Clarkson's total dry dock trade during 2023 is projected to expand by 1.6% in tons and 2.4% in ton miles. During the first quarter 2024 total dry dock volumes increased by approximately 5.5% year-on-year supported by iron ore, coal and record minor bulk exports. While ton-miles increased at a faster pace, due to favorable conditions in Brazil and canal inefficiencies. The IMF is projecting global GDP growth at 3.2% for 2024 and 2025. The same pace as in 2023 with China projected to slow down to 4.6% and 4.1% respectively. Nevertheless, Chinese GDP increased by 5.3% in Q1, faster than initially expected, while dry bulk imports were up by 8.2% compared to last year. The country's full economic recovery from COVID-19 has yet to unfold due to the struggling property market, but has received support by strength in infrastructure manufacturing and exports. Dry bulk demand from the rest of the world is experiencing a strong recovery over the last quarters. That is expected to continue as it receives support from lower commodity prices and expectations of using monetary policy. During the first quarter, imports were up by 2.9% year-on-year, with increase coming mainly from India and Far East countries, while imports from western economies are also moving higher, following two years of contraction. Iron ore trade is projected to remain flat in tons and to expand by 1% in ton miles during 2024. China's steel production declined by 3.1% year-on-year during the first quarter. Weak domestic consumption is forcing steel makers to export excess output and some western economies are raising tariffs as a response. At the same time, domestic iron ore production and imports increased by 15.7% and 7% respectively, and have helped through stockpiles higher. On the other hand, steel production from the rest of the world has been on a strong upward trend since September and increased by 7.2% during the first quarter. Coal trade is projected to contract by 0.3% in tons and by 2.5% in ton miles during 2024 Global focus on energy security has inflated coal trade, while Atlantic exporters have redistributed the original quantities east with positive effect for ton miles. Chinese imports surged 61% during 2023 and remains strong during the first quarter of 2024, supported by 4.1% year-on-year decline in domestic coal production and a 7.4% year-on-year increase in thermal electricity generation. Furthermore, India is emerging as a leading buyer of coal during the last quarters as consumption has outpaced domestic production and has led to a strong increase in imports Grains trade is projected to expand by 2.1% tons and by 5.2% ton miles during 2024. Exports from Latin America increased by approximately 14% during the first quarter, following strong Brazilian soybean exports and a recovery of Argentinian volumes. However, Ukraine increased exports to the highest level since the start of the war, while lower grain prices, improving crop forecasts and increased focus on food security is projected to support grain trade in the medium term. Minor bulk trade is projected to expand by 3.7% in tons and by 4.7% in ton miles during 2024. Minor bulk trade has the highest correlation to global GDP growth, and the recent trend in the container market provides a positive indicator for short-term prospects of smaller sites. The positive price arbitrage continues to incentivize Chinese steel exports and backhaul trades, while bauxite exports out of West Africa continue to expand at the high priced pace and generate strong ton miles for Capesize vessels. As a final comment, the long-term prospects of the dry bulk market remain positive due to favorable supply dynamics, increased inefficiencies in trade, and a recovery of demand supported by large global infrastructure investment needs for the world's green transition. Star Bulk expects to take advantage of the recent strength in the dry bulk market, having mostly maintained its diverse scrubber fitted fleet in the spot market, and thus continue to create value for its shareholders. Without taking any more of your time, I will now pass the floor over to the operator to answer any questions you may have.

Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Omar Nokta with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.

Omar Nokta: Thank you. Hey guys, good afternoon. Just a couple questions from me, and you've been asked this before. I recall you were asked shortly after the Eagle announcement. Just in general, how you view the Star Bulk fleet from here. Petros, you just talked about the diversified. Just towards the end of the comments you mentioned the diversified fleet. You've been more dynamic recently. Obviously with the merger, you've sold some ships. Post-merger now you are a bit bottom heavy on the super ultra side, obviously giving you more exposure to the minor bulk trade. I guess in general, as we think of you being more dynamic with the fleet, are Capes a place - Capesize vessels, is that a place you'd like to see a higher ratio of Star's fleet going forward, or do you prefer to build or increase the sub-cape ratio of the fleet? Sorry for the long-winded question.

Petros Pappas: Thank you, Omar. Well, it happened that this is a Supramax - Supramax fleet. Next merger may be a Cape fleet, who knows. For the time being, you are right. We are smaller vessel heavy, but that also gives us an opportunity, in the sense that during high markets like this is, one can sell older vessels of the fleet and that way keep the average age at a better level. So I think that going forward, you may see us sell some of our less efficient and older vessels, and that may rectify the count until we make our next move.

Omar Nokta: Makes sense. Thanks Petros, and maybe just to follow-up. In terms of just the debt load at the moment with the company, you have $1.4 billion of debt and you've got 470 or so of cash. How are you thinking about that amount of debt in general? Are you comfortable keeping at that level? You have on slide five, the 43% reductions in that debt since '21. Do you feel the need to keep that trend going and lowering that figure or are you okay with the current balance?

Hamish Norton: For the moment, Omar, we're continuing to delever at basically the same absolute rate as we've been delevering for a while. We're paying down $250 million in debt a year and for the foreseeable future we're going to keep doing that. Obviously at some point we get to net debt zero and we'll figure out something to do then. But we want to set the company up to be able to get into the era of decarbonization and we think you need a strong company with a strong balance sheet to do that well.

Omar Nokta: Yeah. No, I agree. And then I guess just on that, potentially getting to net debt zero, is that in any way a shift or a change the different policy approach or the minimum cash requirements you are looking to keep?

Hamish Norton: We have no current plans to change any of our capital allocation policies. If the world changes, the policy may change, but for the moment, the policy is our policy.

Omar Nokta: Okay, very good. Thanks Hamish and thanks Petros. I'll turn it over.

Petros Pappas: Thank you, Omar.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line Ben Nolan with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.

Ben Nolan: Yeah, thanks. Actually first, Hamish, could you maybe dive into that comment that you made there about wanting to have a strong balance sheet to move into decarbonizing the world or I forget exactly how you framed it. What does that - does that mean at some point you are going to need to replace the assets for things that have much lower carbon emissions or maybe just unpack that comment if you could.

A - Hamish Norton: I mean, I guess the answer is, we don't actually know what's going to happen and if you don't know what's going to happen, that sounds like a really good reason to have a strong balance sheet. The more you know what's going to happen, the more you can lever up in anticipation of what's going to happen. But yes, I mean we think that probably there will be expensive ships burning expensive fuel, getting really high charter rates, and we think it will be very good for the business and very good for us, because we think it will favor large companies that can afford R&D and compliance and all the overheads that go with having a difficult regulatory environment. But whatever it is, it's going to favor big companies with lots of resources and a strong balance sheet.

Christos Begleris: And if I may add to Hamish's point, this is Christos. Hi Ben. We think it's proven that during a healthy market would reduced debt as much as possible, so that in the future, effectively we have more capacity to take on, more debt when the prices are lower and when we want to further leverage on the upside.

Ben Nolan: Sure. Yeah, and I absolutely agree with that. Sticking with sort of the decarbonization theme a little bit, I know that you guys have investigated or invested in some cases in certain early stage R&D type technologies. Curious if you have any updated thoughts on what that might look like, whether it's carbon capture or any particular fuel types that you think are emerging as the best candidates? Any new color in that respect?

Nicos Rescos: Hi Ben, this is Nicos. For the time being we're investing on technologies that have been tested, so basically improving as much as we can with this in fleet. You have noticed that we are continuing installing energy efficiency devices that are proven to decrease our consumption and improve the commercial appeal of each vessel. We are agnostic of all technologies growing in the market. We're testing the [inaudible], we're testing paints, they both have an effect on performance. We have tested carbon capture on both or all of our vessels, but it's a matter of putting on ends to meet in order to make these a viable commercial solution. We do believe that it is an intermediate solution that will have pure, that will be widely acceptable, both in terms of supply, consumption, and of course on the engines. But for the time being we're trying to improve the existing vessels as much as we can. Star Bulk current shares [ph], yes, we do have hope that this may materialize later into the year.

Ben Nolan: Okay, that's helpful. And then lastly for me, it seems like, and I appreciate the color that you guys gave on the integration of Eagle, and it seems like so far so good with respect to finding synergies, which I know is difficult in this industry, but the costs are down. The share price is up, and at least by my math is above NAV, so that part of the thesis has played out thus far. I'm curious if that is opening the doors for other opportunities. And Petros, I know you talked about the next merger, what have you. Are you finding potential sellers out there that can look at that transaction and say, this is a good liquidity event for me and a way to maximize the value for my assets and at the same time you guys can utilize your shares as a currency?

Hamish Norton: Well look, everything like this helps, like closing one deal and doing a good job of it is clearly going to help our reputation in the market for other deals. But I don't underestimate how hard these deals already get done. We have gotten a lot of them done, but they are always hard to close and they are always low probability. That being said, we're looking at possible transactions, and we may be able to do one or more. We certainly intend to try to keep growing.

Ben Nolan: Okay, that's all. I guess, are you maybe more optimistic about that than maybe you would have been a few months ago?

Hamish Norton: I think we are more optimistic, but I hope our optimism is actually able to influence the way the world works. We're doing our best.

Petros Pappas: Ben, I think that we are more optimistic than usual, also because of the environmental regulations. I think they will have an impact, a positive impact on the supply, and so I think this is going to happen to take place for several years going forward, so that's a good basis for our optimism I believe.

Hamish Norton: Yeah, I mean what the environmental regulations do in large part is make it no fun to operate a small shipping company. For a long time, for centuries it's been great fun to operate a small shipping company. I think that's changing and the business is becoming less fun and more sort of demanding of a large corporate organization.

Ben Nolan: Yeah, well it's always fun to have fun. So, I appreciate the color and I appreciate it. Thanks.

Petros Pappas: Thank you, Ben.

Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And it looks like we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the call back forward to Mr. Petros Pappas for closing remarks.

Petros Pappas: No further comments operator. Thank you very much.

Thank you for standing by ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Star Bulk Carriers Conference Call on the First Quarter 2024 Financial Results.

We have with us. Mr. Petros Pappas's, Chief Executive Officer; Mr. Hamish Norton, President; Mr. Simos Spyrou and Mr. Christos Begleris, Co-Chief Financial Officers; Mr. Nicos Rescos, Chief Operating Officer; and Mrs. Charis Plakantonaki, Chief Strategy Officer of the company.

At this time all participants are on a listen only more. There will be a presentation followed by a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. I must advise you that this conference is being recorded today.

We now pass the floor to one of the speakers today. Mr. Christos Begleris. Please go ahead sir.

Christos Begleris

Thank you very much. I'm Christos Begleris Co-CFO at Star Bulk Carriers and I would like to welcome you to our conference call regarding our financial results for the first quarter of 2024. Before we begin, I kindly ask you to take a moment to read the Safe Harbor statement on Slide 2 of our presentation.

In today's presentation, we will go through our Q1 results, cash evolution during the quarter, actions taken to create value for our shareholders, and update on the Eagle Bulk integration, vessel operations, fleet update, the latest on the ESG front and our views on industry fundamentals before opening up for questions.

Let us now turn to Slide 3 of the presentation for a summary of our first quarter 2024 highlights. For the first quarter the company reported the following, net income amounted to $75 million with adjusted net income of $73 million or $0.87 adjusted earnings per share.

Adjusted EBITDA was $123 million for the quarter. For the first quarter as per our existing dividend policy, we declared a dividend per share of $0.75 payable on or about June 6, 2023. Since 2021 dividend distributions and share buybacks are over $1.2 billion and $0.4 billion respectively. Our total liquidity today stands strong at $472 million. Meanwhile, our total debt stands at $1.45 billion.

On the top right of the page you will see our daily figures per vessel for the quarter. Our TCE rate was 19,627 per vessel per day, our combined daily OpEx and net cash G&A expenses per vessel per day amounted to 6,185. Therefore our TCE less OpEx and cash G&A is around $13,442 per vessel per day.

Following Eagle shareholders' approval on April 9, the Eagle Bulk transaction was completed and each Eagle Bulk shareholder received 2.6211 Star Bulk shares per share of Eagle. Eagle Bulk's convertible notes will be exchangeable at the conversion rate equal to 83.67 shares of Star Bulk common stock when it matures on August 1, 2024.

Cash received following the Eagle merger amounted to $104.3 million. Currently, we have 161 vessels on a fully delivered basis, including the five newbuilding Kamsarmax vessels we have announced.

During 2024, we have sold eight vessels for total gross proceeds of $150 million. Four of these vessels, namely Star Audrey, Star Pyxis, Stellar Eagle and Crowned Eagle, are expected to be delivered during Q2 to their new owners.

Slide 4, graphically illustrates the change in the company's cash balance during the first quarter. We started the quarter with $262 million in cash and generated positive cash flow for operating activities of $114 million, including debt proceeds and repayments, CapEx payments for energy saving devices and Ballast Water Treatment System installments and the Q4 dividend payment, we arrived at the cash balance of $269 million at the end of the quarter.

.

Slide 5, provides an overview of the company's capital allocation policy over the last three years, and the various levers we have used to create shareholder value. On the top left, we show our net debt reduction. Since 2021 we have reduced leverage in the company by 43%. Over the same period we have declared consecutive quarterly dividends totaling $1.2 billion. We have taken advantage of historically elevated S&P values to sell some of our older and less efficient vessels using the equity proceeds to buy back our shares at attractive values.

Since 2022, we have bought back $423 million worth of Star Bulk stock. 20 million shares, valued at $380 million, were bought in the fourth quarter of 2023 form Oaktree. Even that, our shares at the time were trading at a significant discount to net asset value and we used process from vessel sales at net asset value, we have taken advantage of the arbitrage to create shareholder value.

Combining all of the above, you see that we are focused on returning capital to shareholders while at the same time, deleveraging the balance sheet and buying back shares when the opportunity is to do so accretively. In total, since 2021, we have taken actions of $2.1 billion to create value for our shareholders.

I will now pass the floor to our COO, Nicos Rescos, for an update on the Eagle Bulk transaction integration and operational performance.

Nicos Rescos

Thank you, Christos. Slide 6 illustrates a summary of the Eagle Bulk transaction integration. The merger with Eagle Bulk will allow us to leverage our strong global presence of the combined entity with offices in Singapore, the US, Greece, Denmark and Cyprus. The respective Singapore offices are to merge into one and continue as a commercial and technical management hub covering the Asia Pacific.

The Stanford office is to continue both on commercial and technical management, covering the Atlantic and the US markets. Together with the Athens headquarters in Europe, we will maintain presence in Copenhagen for chartering operations covering the Atlantic, continent of the Mediterranean.

We are creating a new integrated commercial team, managing the second largest Ultramax/Supramax fleet globally to combine capabilities and name for improved time-chatter performance. We also aim to rebalance employment strategy and include Voyage business.

We have already refinanced the ex-Eagle debt facility, resulting in interest cost savings of $3.2 million per year. We have executed new insurance agreements for the ex-Eagle vessel saving $1.9 million per annum in insurance premium costs.

Crewing will be gradually taken in-house, with an expected cost reduction of about $600 per vessel per day during the next 18 months. Significant synergies are expected from the centralization of procurement of all stores, spare parts and lubricants. Dry docks of ex-Eagle Bulk vessels will benefit from Star Bulk competitive pricing agreements with service providers and shipyards globally.

Marine Safety Quality and Technical maintenance standards, processes, policies, and systems are to be applied across the combined fleet, aiming to align with the Star Bulk Rightship Safety Score and Port State Control performance. Lastly systems integrations are under way to enable efficiencies among offices and departments and create further synergies.

Turn into Slide 7. We provide an operational update. OpEx expenses was at $4,962 for Q1, 2024. Net cash G&A expenses were at $1,223 per vessel per day for the same period. In addition we continue to raise at the top amongst our listed peers in terms of Rightship Safety Score.

Slide 8 provides a fleet update and some guidance around the future dry dock and the relevant total off-hire days. On the top right of the page we provide a CapEx schedule illustrating our new building CapEx and vessel energy efficiency upgrade with a 100% of our fleet by now being ballast water system fitted.

Our expected dry dock expense for the remainder of 2024 is estimated $42.4 million for the dry docking of 51 vessels, including 12 ex-Eagle Bulk vessels. In total we expect to have approximately 1,250 off‐hire days for the same period.

Based on our latest construction schedule our newbuilding vessels are expected to be delivered during Q4 of 2025, Q2 and Q3 of 2026. In the with EEXI and CII regulations will continue investing in upgrading our fleet with the latest operation technologies available aimed in improving our fuel consumption and reducing our environmental footprint, and further enhancing commercial attractiveness of the Star Bulk fleet.

Regarding our energy saving devices, programmed during the quarter, we have completed and tested retrofits on four vessels with 19 more vessels planned for retrofit by the end of 2024. The above numbers are based on current estimates around dry dock, retrofit planning, vessel employment and yard capacity.

Turning to Slide 9 for an update on our fleet sales. On the vessel sales front will continue disposing of vessels opportunistically at historically attractive levels, having agreed during Q1 to sell seven vessels for a total gross process of $134 million, reducing our average fleet age and improving overall fleet efficiency. During the second quarter, we have further agreed to sell one more vessel the Crowned Eagle.

We took delivery of three out of the six long-term chartering Eco vessels that will be delivered to us throughout 2024 and specifically to Tsuneishi Cebu with Kamsarmax, and a Tsuneishi Zhousan with Ultramax. The Eagle Bulk existing chartering contracts have been rolled over to Star Bulk following the merger.

We have five firm shipbuilding contracts with Qingdao Shipyard for the construction of 82,000 dwt Kamsarmax newbuilding vessels. Considering the aforementioned changes in our fleet mix, we operate one of the largest dry dock fleet amongst US and European listed peers, with 161 vessels on a fully delivered basis and an average age of 11.3 years.

I will now pass the floor to our Chief Strategy Officer, Charis Plakantonaki for an ESG update.

Charis Plakantonaki

Thank you, Nicos. Please turn to Slide 10, where we highlight our continued leadership on the ESP front. The Star Bulk Sustainalytics' ESG Risk Smart Score has further improved from 21.3 medium risk to 19.0 low risk, maintaining Star Bulk's number 1 ranking among US-listed peers and positioning the company as one of the best-performing companies globally in the category transportation shipping.

During Q1 2024, we began, along with our partners, the scoping of work and initial projects with the Maritime Emissions Reduction Centre to develop and adopt new and existing solutions for reducing GHG emissions from the global fleet. The Centre was granted the Motivation Award at the ESG Shipping Awards International 2024.

On the regulatory front, MEPC 81 has progressed discussions related to IMO's mid-term market-based measures, which are set to come in to force in 2027. We are continuously assessing the impact of upcoming environmental regulations and considering action plan options for compliance.

As part of Star Bulk's program to enhance diversity and inclusion, our first two female cadets have embarked on board one of our Newcastlemax vessels. We continue the deployment of Starlink along with the installation of Firewalls on board our vessels and have embarked on a project to equip our vessels with the CyberOwl technology to digitalize and advance the monitoring of onboard systems' performance and security.

On the governance front, and as part of our enhanced Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, we have launched a new online Whistleblowing platform on the company's website to encourage open reporting by employees, crews, and third parties, safeguard confidentiality and anonymity, and improve the handling and monitoring process of any whistleblowing reports.

I will now pass the floor to our CEO, Petros Pappas for a market update and his closing remarks.

Petros Pappas

Thank you, Charis. Please turn to Slide 11, for a brief update of supply. During the first four months of 2024 a total of 12.1 million dead weight was delivered and 1.6 million dead weight was sent to demolition for a net fleet growth of 10.5 million dead weight or 2.9% year-on-year.

Uncertainty on future green propulsion, high shipbuilding costs and limited shipyard capacity until late 2026 have helped keep new orders under relative control. The order book presently stands at a low level of 9.3% of the fleet.

Furthermore vessels above 20 and 15 years of age stand at 8.8% and 21.2% of the fleet while scrap prices stabilized at elevated levels and to make demolition of overage and energy inefficient tonnage and attractive option during seasonal downturns over the next years.

The average steaming speed of the dry dock feet decrease to a new record low level in January, due to downward pressures from inflated bunker costs and new environmental regulations. Having said that, over the last two months speech have rebounded to 11.2 knots following the higher freight rate environment and a stabilization of oil prices. We expect emissions regulations including EXI and CII to increasingly incentivize slow steaming retrofits and to help moderate supply over the next several years.

Global port congestion follow the strong downward trend over the last two years, the gradually inflated available supply by approximately 5%. During the first quarter of 2024 congestion appears to have fully normalized on all sizes and going forward we expect it to follow seasonal trends.

Moreover Panama Canal constraints since mid-2023 and rising tension in the Red Sea continue to cause strong inefficiencies portrayed with a positive effect on the supply demand balance of 2024. As a result of the above trends, nominal fleet growth is unlikely to exceed 2.5% per annum over the next couple of years.

Let us now turn to Slide 12 for a brief update of demand. According to Clarkson's total dry dock trade during 2023 is projected to expand by 1.6% in tons and 2.4% in ton miles. During the first quarter 2024 total dry dock volumes increased by approximately 5.5% year-on-year supported by iron ore, coal and record minor bulk exports. While ton-miles increased at a faster pace, due to favorable conditions in Brazil and canal inefficiencies.

The IMF is projecting global GDP growth at 3.2% for 2024 and 2025. The same pace as in 2023 with China projected to slow down to 4.6% and 4.1% respectively. Nevertheless, Chinese GDP increased by 5.3% in Q1, faster than initially expected, while dry bulk imports were up by 8.2% compared to last year. The country's full economic recovery from COVID-19 has yet to unfold due to the struggling property market, but has received support by strength in infrastructure manufacturing and exports.

Dry bulk demand from the rest of the world is experiencing a strong recovery over the last quarters. That is expected to continue as it receives support from lower commodity prices and expectations of using monetary policy. During the first quarter, imports were up by 2.9% year-on-year, with increase coming mainly from India and Far East countries, while imports from western economies are also moving higher, following two years of contraction.

Iron ore trade is projected to remain flat in tons and to expand by 1% in ton miles during 2024. China's steel production declined by 3.1% year-on-year during the first quarter. Weak domestic consumption is forcing steel makers to export excess output and some western economies are raising tariffs as a response.

At the same time, domestic iron ore production and imports increased by 15.7% and 7% respectively, and have helped through stockpiles higher. On the other hand, steel production from the rest of the world has been on a strong upward trend since September and increased by 7.2% during the first quarter.

Coal trade is projected to contract by 0.3% in tons and by 2.5% in ton miles during 2024 Global focus on energy security has inflated coal trade, while Atlantic exporters have redistributed the original quantities east with positive effect for ton miles.

Chinese imports surged 61% during 2023 and remains strong during the first quarter of 2024, supported by 4.1% year-on-year decline in domestic coal production and a 7.4% year-on-year increase in thermal electricity generation. Furthermore, India is emerging as a leading buyer of coal during the last quarters as consumption has outpaced domestic production and has led to a strong increase in imports

Grains trade is projected to expand by 2.1% tons and by 5.2% ton miles during 2024. Exports from Latin America increased by approximately 14% during the first quarter, following strong Brazilian soybean exports and a recovery of Argentinian volumes. However, Ukraine increased exports to the highest level since the start of the war, while lower grain prices, improving crop forecasts and increased focus on food security is projected to support grain trade in the medium term.

Minor bulk trade is projected to expand by 3.7% in tons and by 4.7% in ton miles during 2024. Minor bulk trade has the highest correlation to global GDP growth, and the recent trend in the container market provides a positive indicator for short-term prospects of smaller sites. The positive price arbitrage continues to incentivize Chinese steel exports and backhaul trades, while bauxite exports out of West Africa continue to expand at the high priced pace and generate strong ton miles for Capesize vessels.

As a final comment, the long-term prospects of the dry bulk market remain positive due to favorable supply dynamics, increased inefficiencies in trade, and a recovery of demand supported by large global infrastructure investment needs for the world's green transition. Star Bulk expects to take advantage of the recent strength in the dry bulk market, having mostly maintained its diverse scrubber fitted fleet in the spot market, and thus continue to create value for its shareholders.

Without taking any more of your time, I will now pass the floor over to the operator to answer any questions you may have.

Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Omar Nokta with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.

Omar Nokta

Thank you. Hey guys, good afternoon. Just a couple questions from me, and you've been asked this before. I recall you were asked shortly after the Eagle announcement. Just in general, how you view the Star Bulk fleet from here. Petros, you just talked about the diversified. Just towards the end of the comments you mentioned the diversified fleet. You've been more dynamic recently. Obviously with the merger, you've sold some ships. Post-merger now you are a bit bottom heavy on the super ultra side, obviously giving you more exposure to the minor bulk trade.

I guess in general, as we think of you being more dynamic with the fleet, are Capes a place - Capesize vessels, is that a place you'd like to see a higher ratio of Star's fleet going forward, or do you prefer to build or increase the sub-cape ratio of the fleet? Sorry for the long-winded question.

Petros Pappas

Thank you, Omar. Well, it happened that this is a Supramax - Supramax fleet. Next merger may be a Cape fleet, who knows. For the time being, you are right. We are smaller vessel heavy, but that also gives us an opportunity, in the sense that during high markets like this is, one can sell older vessels of the fleet and that way keep the average age at a better level. So I think that going forward, you may see us sell some of our less efficient and older vessels, and that may rectify the count until we make our next move.

Omar Nokta

Makes sense. Thanks Petros, and maybe just to follow-up. In terms of just the debt load at the moment with the company, you have $1.4 billion of debt and you've got 470 or so of cash. How are you thinking about that amount of debt in general? Are you comfortable keeping at that level? You have on slide five, the 43% reductions in that debt since '21. Do you feel the need to keep that trend going and lowering that figure or are you okay with the current balance?

Hamish Norton

For the moment, Omar, we're continuing to delever at basically the same absolute rate as we've been delevering for a while. We're paying down $250 million in debt a year and for the foreseeable future we're going to keep doing that. Obviously at some point we get to net debt zero and we'll figure out something to do then. But we want to set the company up to be able to get into the era of decarbonization and we think you need a strong company with a strong balance sheet to do that well.

Omar Nokta

Yeah. No, I agree. And then I guess just on that, potentially getting to net debt zero, is that in any way a shift or a change the different policy approach or the minimum cash requirements you are looking to keep?

Hamish Norton

We have no current plans to change any of our capital allocation policies. If the world changes, the policy may change, but for the moment, the policy is our policy.

Omar Nokta

Okay, very good. Thanks Hamish and thanks Petros. I'll turn it over.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line Ben Nolan with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.

Ben Nolan

Yeah, thanks. Actually first, Hamish, could you maybe dive into that comment that you made there about wanting to have a strong balance sheet to move into decarbonizing the world or I forget exactly how you framed it. What does that - does that mean at some point you are going to need to replace the assets for things that have much lower carbon emissions or maybe just unpack that comment if you could.

A - Hamish Norton

I mean, I guess the answer is, we don't actually know what's going to happen and if you don't know what's going to happen, that sounds like a really good reason to have a strong balance sheet. The more you know what's going to happen, the more you can lever up in anticipation of what's going to happen.

But yes, I mean we think that probably there will be expensive ships burning expensive fuel, getting really high charter rates, and we think it will be very good for the business and very good for us, because we think it will favor large companies that can afford R&D and compliance and all the overheads that go with having a difficult regulatory environment. But whatever it is, it's going to favor big companies with lots of resources and a strong balance sheet.

Christos Begleris

And if I may add to Hamish's point, this is Christos. Hi Ben. We think it's proven that during a healthy market would reduced debt as much as possible, so that in the future, effectively we have more capacity to take on, more debt when the prices are lower and when we want to further leverage on the upside.

Ben Nolan

Sure. Yeah, and I absolutely agree with that. Sticking with sort of the decarbonization theme a little bit, I know that you guys have investigated or invested in some cases in certain early stage R&D type technologies. Curious if you have any updated thoughts on what that might look like, whether it's carbon capture or any particular fuel types that you think are emerging as the best candidates? Any new color in that respect?

Nicos Rescos

Hi Ben, this is Nicos. For the time being we're investing on technologies that have been tested, so basically improving as much as we can with this in fleet. You have noticed that we are continuing installing energy efficiency devices that are proven to decrease our consumption and improve the commercial appeal of each vessel.

We are agnostic of all technologies growing in the market. We're testing the [inaudible], we're testing paints, they both have an effect on performance. We have tested carbon capture on both or all of our vessels, but it's a matter of putting on ends to meet in order to make these a viable commercial solution. We do believe that it is an intermediate solution that will have pure, that will be widely acceptable, both in terms of supply, consumption, and of course on the engines. But for the time being we're trying to improve the existing vessels as much as we can. Star Bulk current shares [ph], yes, we do have hope that this may materialize later into the year.

Ben Nolan

Okay, that's helpful. And then lastly for me, it seems like, and I appreciate the color that you guys gave on the integration of Eagle, and it seems like so far so good with respect to finding synergies, which I know is difficult in this industry, but the costs are down. The share price is up, and at least by my math is above NAV, so that part of the thesis has played out thus far.

I'm curious if that is opening the doors for other opportunities. And Petros, I know you talked about the next merger, what have you. Are you finding potential sellers out there that can look at that transaction and say, this is a good liquidity event for me and a way to maximize the value for my assets and at the same time you guys can utilize your shares as a currency?

Hamish Norton

Well look, everything like this helps, like closing one deal and doing a good job of it is clearly going to help our reputation in the market for other deals. But I don't underestimate how hard these deals already get done. We have gotten a lot of them done, but they are always hard to close and they are always low probability.

That being said, we're looking at possible transactions, and we may be able to do one or more. We certainly intend to try to keep growing.

Ben Nolan

Okay, that's all. I guess, are you maybe more optimistic about that than maybe you would have been a few months ago?

Hamish Norton

I think we are more optimistic, but I hope our optimism is actually able to influence the way the world works. We're doing our best.

Petros Pappas

Ben, I think that we are more optimistic than usual, also because of the environmental regulations. I think they will have an impact, a positive impact on the supply, and so I think this is going to happen to take place for several years going forward, so that's a good basis for our optimism I believe.

Hamish Norton

Yeah, I mean what the environmental regulations do in large part is make it no fun to operate a small shipping company. For a long time, for centuries it's been great fun to operate a small shipping company. I think that's changing and the business is becoming less fun and more sort of demanding of a large corporate organization.

Ben Nolan

Yeah, well it's always fun to have fun. So, I appreciate the color and I appreciate it. Thanks.

Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And it looks like we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the call back forward to Mr. Petros Pappas for closing remarks.

Petros Pappas

No further comments operator. Thank you very much.

The African Development Bank is the driving force behind one of the world's most ambitious energy projects: the Desert to Power initiative aims to bring energy to one of the least developed and most marginal parts of the continent.

This transformative and bold effort aims to turn Africa's vast, sun-drenched Sahel region - one of the most vulnerable regions in the world - into a powerhouse of solar energy, targeting 11 countries: Burkina Faso, Chad, Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, and Sudan.

By harnessing the region's immense solar potential, Desert to Power seeks to generate 10 gigawatts of solar power by 2030, thereby facilitating access to electricity for 250 million people.

The ground-breaking project is the brainchild of Bank President Dr Akinwumi Adesina who has termed it the Bank's ""baobab"".

""Desert to Power is what I call the baobab of projects. It will require all our efforts if we are to effect change,"" he told a COP meeting.

Last December, the Bank approved the 225 kV Mauritania-Mali Power Interconnection and related Solar Power Plants Development Project (PIEMM) which is a priority operation under that Desert to Power Initiative. The project will help develop regional electricity trade in the Sahel, allow Mali to import about 600 GWh of electricity from renewable energy sources from Mauritania each year and enable both Mali and Mauritania to increase their national electricity access rate and to improve the performance of their electricity sub-sector by reducing fuel consumption, and shutting down several generators with exorbitant operating costs thus reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Ultimately, the project is expected to connect 100,000 new households (80,000 in Mauritania and 20,000 in Mali).

The initiative presents a major step along the way to solving Africa's critical energy access issues and reducing dependence on fossil fuels like heavy fuel oil. These are key drivers of environmental fragility in the region, worsening climate warming behind many of the dramatic weather events now regularly hitting the continent.

The Bank has also successfully leveraged climate finance from international sources like the Green Climate to blend with the Bank's own resources to support the Desert to Power initiative.

Additionally, the Bank's Sustainable Energy Fund for Africa (SEFA), the Bank's largest in-house blended finance facility with commitments of over US $500 million from 10 donors, including Denmark, the United States, the United Kingdom, Italy, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Germany, the Nordic Development Fund, and the Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet, is providing catalytic capital for private sector projects across the Desert to Power countries and beyond.

Today, the Desert to Power portfolio counts 10 investment projects and over 15 technical assistance operations across 7 of the 11 countries of operation.

The initiative has drawn plaudits from policy makers, diplomats, politicians and media commentators.

The authoritative British newspaper the Financial Times (FT) recently hailed it as a showcase example of imaginative development projects of the type Africa needs to engage its populations and prevent regional unrest exploited by anti-state actors.

In an article, endorsed by its editorial board, the FT called on Western governments to back the project along with similar initiatives directed at improving people's daily lives. Development brings stability, it argued.

The initiative is part of a broader effort to transition Africa towards more sustainable energy sources, helping mitigate deforestation and its associated impacts.

In Africa, deforestation is a significant issue, with an area equivalent to the size of Switzerland being cleared of forest annually, largely for cooking and heating purposes. This loss of forest exacerbates dust storms, disrupts rain patterns, and accelerates desertification, posing severe threats to biodiversity and local climates.

The Bank's investment in solar energy is crucial for several reasons. Firstly, reliable and affordable energy is essential for reducing reliance on charcoal, which is not only a leading cause of deforestation, but also an expensive option for many households. The continent's rapid population growth has intensified energy demands, with the population doubling and doubling again to at least 1.2 billion, nearly half of whom lack access to electricity.

While there are ongoing reforestation projects in countries like Kenya, Congo, Madagascar, and Malawi, the rate of forest loss far outpaces these efforts. The immediate need is to electrify the continent quickly, choosing sustainable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydro over more harmful fossil fuels.

Africa's potential for renewable energy is vast but largely untapped. The continent has an almost unlimited solar capacity (11 TW), significant hydro resources (350 GW, with only between five and six percent currently harnessed), wind power (110 GW, with only two percent utilized), and geothermal energy sources (15 GW).

Despite this potential, 600 million people in Africa live without access to electricity. The continent accounts for just six percent of global energy demand and slightly over three percent of electricity demand. This underscores the importance of scaling up renewable energy investments to meet the continent's energy needs sustainably.

From 2016 to 2022, the AfDB approved US $8.3 billion in energy commitments, with 87 percent directed towards renewable energy projects. This investment has already generated 3.4 GW of electricity, including 2.6 GW from renewable sources. The Bank is also developing an African Green Mineral Strategy to capitalize on the continent's abundant critical minerals, such as cobalt, manganese, and platinum, which are essential for facilitating the energy transition. the entire Sahel region and forever changing the face of one of Africa's most neglected areas.

District energy is the most economically viable low-carbon heating option for 64 per cent of the Irish population, according to research published by the Irish District Energy Association (IrDEA).

The case for significant State investment to kick-start the sector has been set out in two reports from the not-for-profit organisation. An investment of around €1 billion in coming years could unlock the potential of the sector to deliver affordable emissions-free heat to consumers across Ireland, it finds.

The sector has been tasked with delivering enough heat for 200,000 homes and 2,500 public buildings by 2030 - equating to 10 per cent of national building heat demand.

District energy networks, widely deployed in Europe, distribute water, which has been heated at a local energy centre, to buildings through a network of insulated underground pipes eliminating the need for fossil fuels and individual boilers. Benefits include improved energy security; efficiency savings, affordability, better air quality and employment opportunities, IrDEA says.

The reports compare roll-out of the technology in six European countries, using this as the basis for recommendations on policies needed to deliver district energy to Irish consumers quickly and at scale. Recommendations include consumer protection measures and rules on planning and licensing.

Around 70 per cent of heat demand in countries like Denmark and Sweden is met with district energy, said IrDEA chief executive Yvonne Murphy

Less than 1 per cent of building heat demand is currently provided from this source, most commonly through communal schemes, mostly located in Dublin, but it ""is the most economical way of meeting the heat demand of 67 per cent of buildings across Ireland"".

Launching the reports, Minister for Environment, Climate and Energy Eamon Ryan said the Government was committed to accelerating building heat decarbonisation.

""District energy is a proven technology, with millions of customers across Europe and beyond, and it can play a key role in improving energy efficiency and reducing emissions in Ireland. That is why we have committed to clear climate action plan targets to deliver up to 2.7 terawatt hours (TWh) of district energy capacity by 2030,"" he added.

Around 70 per cent of heat demand in countries like Denmark and Sweden is met with district energy, said IrDEA chief executive Yvonne Murphy. ""Europe-wide, 30 million households and 70 million people rely on district energy. It is a well-proven technology that is available right now for deployment in Ireland,"" she added.

Two decades ago, widespread generation of wind-powered electricity seemed far-fetched to many, said IrDEA founder and chairman David Connolly. ""Now, after a concerted effort, it's a natural part of our energy supply chain. The same can happen with district heating. The system can use any source of energy including renewable electricity or surplus heat from industry or cooling processes, which is a real game changer as we reduce our reliance on imported oil and gas.""

The key barrier was lack of a mechanism to draw down Government funding to help finance roll-out of projects, Mr Connolly said. ""We're optimistic that if the financing barrier is addressed quickly, we could start to see projects materialise in the next 12 to 24 months.""",irishtimes.com,news,The Irish Times,,0.2784313725490195,454183416,7,https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/ayRAHQ1LJSTqWLgQueMY8vvrfBc=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/irishtimes/JOMGBFZB5KBTXQIO62VWYNOMAY.jpg,eng-9584744

The project will help develop regional electricity trade in the Sahel, allow Mali to import about 600 GWh of electricity from renewable energy sources from Mauritania each year and enable both Mali and Mauritania to increase their national electricity access rate and to improve the performance of their electricity sub-sector by reducing fuel consumption, and shutting down several generators with exorbitant operating costs thus reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Ultimately, the project is expected to connect 100,000 new households (80,000 in Mauritania and 20,000 in Mali).

The initiative presents a major step along the way to solving Africa's critical energy access issues and reducing dependence on fossil fuels like heavy fuel oil. These are key drivers of environmental fragility in the region, worsening climate warming behind many of the dramatic weather events now regularly hitting the continent.

The Bank has also successfully leveraged climate finance from international sources like the Green Climate to blend with the Bank's own resources to support the Desert to Power initiative.

Additionally, the Bank's Sustainable Energy Fund for Africa (SEFA), the Bank's largest in-house blended finance facility with commitments of over US $500 million from 10 donors, including Denmark, the United States, the United Kingdom, Italy, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Germany, the Nordic Development Fund, and the Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet, is providing catalytic capital for private sector projects across the Desert to Power countries and beyond.

Today, the Desert to Power portfolio counts 10 investment projects and over 15 technical assistance operations across 7 of the 11 countries of operation.

The initiative has drawn plaudits from policy makers, diplomats, politicians and media commentators.

The authoritative British newspaper the Financial Times (FT) recently hailed it as a showcase example of imaginative development projects of the type Africa needs to engage its populations and prevent regional unrest exploited by anti-state actors.

In an article, endorsed by its editorial board, the FT called on Western governments to back the project along with similar initiatives directed at improving people's daily lives. Development brings stability, it argued.

The initiative is part of a broader effort to transition Africa towards more sustainable energy sources, helping mitigate deforestation and its associated impacts.

In Africa, deforestation is a significant issue, with an area equivalent to the size of Switzerland being cleared of forest annually, largely for cooking and heating purposes. This loss of forest exacerbates dust storms, disrupts rain patterns, and accelerates desertification, posing severe threats to biodiversity and local climates.

The Bank's investment in solar energy is crucial for several reasons. Firstly, reliable and affordable energy is essential for reducing reliance on charcoal, which is not only a leading cause of deforestation, but also an expensive option for many households. The continent's rapid population growth has intensified energy demands, with the population doubling and doubling again to at least 1.2 billion, nearly half of whom lack access to electricity.

While there are ongoing reforestation projects in countries like Kenya, Congo, Madagascar, and Malawi, the rate of forest loss far outpaces these efforts. The immediate need is to electrify the continent quickly, choosing sustainable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydro over more harmful fossil fuels.

Africa's potential for renewable energy is vast but largely untapped. The continent has an almost unlimited solar capacity (11 TW), significant hydro resources (350 GW, with only between five and six percent currently harnessed), wind power (110 GW, with only two percent utilized), and geothermal energy sources (15 GW).

Despite this potential, 600 million people in Africa live without access to electricity. The continent accounts for just six percent of global energy demand and slightly over three percent of electricity demand. This underscores the importance of scaling up renewable energy investments to meet the continent's energy needs sustainably.

From 2016 to 2022, the AfDB approved US $8.3 billion in energy commitments, with 87 percent directed towards renewable energy projects. This investment has already generated 3.4 GW of electricity, including 2.6 GW from renewable sources. The Bank is also developing an African Green Mineral Strategy to capitalize on the continent's abundant critical minerals, such as cobalt, manganese, and platinum, which are essential for facilitating the energy transition. the entire Sahel region and forever changing the face of one of Africa's most neglected areas.

The African Development Bank is the driving force behind one of the world's most ambitious energy projects: the Desert to Power initiative aims to bring energy to one of the least developed and most marginal parts of the continent.

This transformative and bold effort aims to turn Africa's vast, sun-drenched Sahel region - one of the most vulnerable regions in the world - into a powerhouse of solar energy, targeting 11 countries: Burkina Faso, Chad, Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, and Sudan.

By harnessing the region's immense solar potential, Desert to Power seeks to generate 10 gigawatts of solar power by 2030, thereby facilitating access to electricity for 250 million people.

It will give users hands-on experience with producing sustainable fuels for ocean-going cargo ships, aircraft, trucks, and heavy industry.

The education and research facility will be located in GreenLab, which houses the world's first green and circular industrial park. Here, DTU and other Danish universities are engaged in developing and demonstrating methods for solving some of the climate challenges faced by Denmark and the rest of the world.

""Getting access to a physical training and research facility in Power-to-X is s a game-changer for both our students and researchers. The facility enables us to create an attractive education and research environment in Skive, where we can equip the engineers of tomorrow to meet global challenges in the green transition. It means that we can help educate more engineers for the whole of Denmark,"" says DTU Senior Vice President Carsten Orth Gaarn-Larsen.

The education and research facility consists of an advanced electrolysis module from Green Hydrogen Systems, which develops and manufactures electrolysis facilities (electrolysers).

In GreenLab, the electrolysis facility will function in an interaction between electricity generated by wind and solar energy as well as batteries and be a mini version of the future facilities located in Denmark and the rest of the world.

Green fuels like Power-to-X will, in fact, play a significant role in constructing a 100 per cent renewable energy system in the future. The technology can be used to convert electricity from sun and wind into hydrogen or hydrogen-based substances such as ammonia, methanol, and methane.

""Our new Power-to-X facility for testing and training gives DTU's researchers and students a unique opportunity to gain practical hydrogen production experience. Green hydrogen is a key prerequisite for converting heavy transport from black to green, and, at GreenLab, we're proud to be the place where you can gain hands-on experience in new green technologies by testing them in practice,"" says Ebbe Kruse Vestergaard, Research Director at GreenLab.

Although Power-to-X technology is not new, it is an innovation to integrate the technology in an energy system in a smart approach to up-scaling and cost-effectiveness. With the electrolysis facility in GreenLab, students and researchers can collect data and, among other activities, test how flexible the electrolysis facility is and what the relationship is between electricity, heat, and hydrogen production. This knowledge can be used to find answers to a number of questions, including how best to design and control an electrolysis facility, and how the interaction is between the individual energy system elements.

It is an important piece of the puzzle in understanding our overall energy system. The plant in GreenLab will also supplement DTU's energy laboratory PowerLabDK. Here, students and researchers can use Power-to-X facilities to test how best to link the different parts of the energy system. Jacob Østergaard, Professor at DTU Wind, explains:

""We don't have a sufficient understanding of the Power-to-X technology and its properties. It's therefore essential that we learn more about how an electrolysis facility works as an integrated part of an energy system. Today, we analyse the future energy system based on models of different types of facilities. These models are completely dependent on the data you feed into them. And there are actually only a few of them which are based on realistic facilities with real verified data, making in crucial to have access to a facility like the one in GreenLab.""

Søren Linderoth, Head of Department at DTU Energy, also sees great potential in the education and research facility. For example, he envisions that it can be included in the digital education Bachelor of Technology programme, where students work with Power-to-X as a recurring theme.

Another obvious option is a continuing education programme, a so-called flexible Master's programme with focus on Power-to-X. This study programme originates from a wish from the industry and has been composed and prepared by an advisory committee under Danish Center for Energy Storage (DaCES), where DTU collaborates with Aalborg University, Aarhus University, the University of Southern Denmark and companies like Topsoe and Vestas, says Søren Linderoth:

""It will be very exciting if DTU's students are given the opportunity to see, measure, and analyse data, and perhaps even be allowed to change parameters for the functioning facility. Finally, in the short term, we will also have a much higher proportion of part-time MSc graduates who may be able to benefit from using the facility. This could, for example, be in connection with the Master of Science (MSc) programme Sustainable Energy Technology, where it will be both useful and rewarding for the MSc students to test theories and experiments in practice.""",dtu.dk,news,https://www.dtu.dk,,0.3568627450980393,454173144,16,https://www.dtu.dk/english/-/media/dtudk/nyheder/webnyheder/2024/05/web_greenlab_drone-image.jpg,

Here's What That Means for British Luxury.,"In a 21st-century democracy, a royal decree doesn't carry the same weight it once did. But there is one area where a monarch may still rule absolutely: issuing royal warrants.

King Charles III and Queen Camilla reminded the world of this fact earlier this month when the royal duo announced the first warrants to be issued under their reign. From a review of firms that had previously held a warrant under the king's former station as the Prince of Wales, 145 businesses were named as recipients of a Royal Warrant of Appointment to HM The King (of these, seven also scored a Royal Warrant of Appointment to HM The Queen).

But what is a royal warrant, and what do the new ones mean for the U.K.'s leading luxury businesses? Read on to find out.

What Is a Royal Warrant?

As the inheritors of a revolution waged for independence from a distant crown, Americans like to think of themselves as immune to the charms of monarchy. Then why is it, when we look into our Barbour jackets and see those words and seals, ""By Appointment to Her Majesty the Queen..."", ""By Appointment to H.R.H. The Duke of Edinburgh..."", ""By Appointment to H.R.H. The Prince of Wales..."" that we feel so...impressed?

We're certainly not the first: British monarchs have issued royal warrants since the 15th century. These warrants, which acknowledge providers of commercial goods to the royal household, were issued over the centuries to craftspeople who supplied the crown with everything from playing cards to waterfowl. By the 1700s, warrant holders began displaying the royal arms on their businesses in an early example of consumer-facing marketing.

Royal warrants gained further recognition under Queen Victoria, and nearly 2,000 were issued over the course of her 63-year reign. The Victorian Era also saw the creation of what is now the Royal Warrant Holder's Association, and the codification of rules concerning how royal warrants could be displayed and used.

According to the royal family's official website, there are over 800 royal warrant holders today. These range from internationally recognized names like Burberry (credited as ""Outfitters"" to the king) to local dry cleaners and suppliers of buttons. But whether they operate retail stores across multiple continents or install fire alarms in Gloucestershire, the process for how companies receive their royal warrant is the same.

Who Did King Charles Award Warrants To?

Among the scores of businesses that provide a service to the king -- which encompasses anything from ""Wine and Spirit Merchants"" (London's Berry Bros. & Rudd) to ""Window & Exterior Cleaning Services"" (Perfectshine Window Cleaning Ltd in Aberdeen) were a significant number of clothiers, tailors, and shoemakers. It appears that many of the firms formerly famous for outfitting the Prince of Wales will have the honor of dressing the king, with warrants issued to the likes of Turnbull & Asser, Anderson & Sheppard, Tricker's, John Smedley, and other makers.

""I think one could probably say that there has been a collective sigh of relief from those UK heritage and textile brands that have had their warrants renewed under his majesty,"" says Paul Alger, who serves as international business director of the U.K. Fashion & Textile Association (UKFT).

Likening it to a high-end restaurant losing a Michelin star, Alger explains that the lapse of a royal warrant could significantly affect how a brand is perceived beyond the king's dominion.

""It's not the end of the world, but from a business promotion point of view a royal warrant is still very highly regarded around the world, and these are luxury brands that are very aware of that. So that it would have been a very bad news story had they lost their royal warrants.""

What Criteria Were Considered?

Among the 145 businesses that appeared on the list was the family-owned, London-based leather accessories brand Ettinger. ""We were very, very pleased when that letter arrived one Monday morning,"" says its CEO Robert Ettinger.

As Ettinger recounts, he was required in 2023 to fill out the ""green book"" relating to the renewal of the royal warrant, which comes up for review every five years. There was a particular focus on sustainable and energy-efficient business practices, with criteria including workers' commute times and gas and electricity usage under scrutiny. The process even led the company to install double-glazed windows in its 130-year-old factory, in order to better regulate temperature without using additional fuel.

""Which is something we would have done eventually, but maybe not quite as quickly,"" Ettinger says of the environmentally friendly upgrade.

From an industry-wide perspective, Alger agrees. ""The process does appear to be becoming more based on sustainability and ethical trade.""

How Will Having a Warrant from The King Rather than the Prince of Wales Affect Businesses?

As the awarding of a royal warrant allows the grantee to display its cipher -- within certain bounds -- on their products and in their stores, a particular royal warrant can become almost as recognizable as a brand's logo. Which means that a big change will be coming for those companies who've transitioned from holding a warrant from the Prince of Wales to holding a warrant from the king.

How Does a Business Earn a Royal Warrant?

For starters, royal warrants can only be issued to businesses that have supplied products or non-professional services (i.e., not bankers, lawyers, doctors, etc.) to a warrant-issuing member of the royal household for at least five of the most recent seven years. Once these criteria are met, the company can apply for a royal warrant.

To take the example of Anderson & Sheppard, its head cutter Dennis Hallbery was invited to Kensington Palace in 1983 to measure the then-Prince of Wales for a double-breasted suit. Over the next five years, the prince engaged the bespoke tailor to make additional suits and sport jackets, finally awarding it a royal warrant in 1988.

Crucially, the relationship between the royal warrant giver and receiver must be strictly commercial: goods are never gifted. In an era awash with lucrative celebrity ad campaigns and freebie-grubbing influencers, the strictures and character of the royal warrant have made it that rarest of endorsements: an honest one.

""In some ways, this is the quintessential quality mark or stamp of approval,"" says Alger. ""It's not like any other standard mark where you can fill in the forms and if you meet the criteria or pay the money, you're in. These are built up over tens of years.""

How Long Do Royal Warrants Last?

While earning a royal warrant might take decades, it has a shelf life of just five years. In the year leading up to the warrant's expiration, it will be reviewed by the Royal Household Warrant Committee to ensure that the company and its goods remain up to snuff.

The standards the company must meet are exacting and can change with the times. Huddersfield Fine Worsteds, which provides the tweed fabric used to make the estate worker's uniforms at Balmoral Castle, must prove more than just the quality of their cloth.

""Prince Charles is pushing very hard on the sustainable side of business, and every time we apply, we have to show what we're doing for the environment,"" said Huddersfield managing director Iain Milligan in an interview before the queen's death, adding that its most recent renewal required the company to invest in an electric van.

While preparing for the renewal process is labor-intensive -- Milligan estimates that it takes him a full year to gather the relevant information, which also covers criteria like employee welfare and waste disposal -- the right to display the warrant is of immense value to its holders.

""For traditional British brands, their royal warrants will be one of their most precious assets, even if the U.K. market is not their primary market,"" says Alger, adding that its influence extends far beyond the king's realm. Specifically, Alger says that consumers in the United States, Japan, and China hold the royal warrant in high regard.

""One would not expect in communist China that the Royal Family would be any motive for selling clothes and luxury garments. But actually, the experience of most of our brands is that the royal warrant is even more valuable outside of the U.K. than it is inside.""

What Happens to Queen Elizabeth II's Royal Warrants Now?

The short answer is that they were voided when she died -- and so were the ones issued by her late husband the Duke of Edinburgh and the present king in his former station as Prince of Wales. As Alger explains, the passing of a monarch -- who also determines who in the royal family may issue warrants -- reshuffles the deck.

""In a nutshell, what happens is that the warrants that were granted by the queen, and any of those warrants which were granted by people who were enabled to give warrants, lapse effectively,"" Alger says. ""They cease to exist.""

Still, according to Alger, the crown has adopted a rather lenient policy in regard to holders of expired warrants.

""In a very pragmatic, very British way, the warrant holders [had] two years during which they can try to transfer those warrants to another member of the royal family,"" he says.

During this grace period, holders could continue to display the warrants as they had been originally issued. But then what? According to Alger, this is one instance in which the British monarch may rule absolutely, as the king has the power to transfer the warrants with the wave of his scepter.

""My guess is that the default position of the royal family and the monarch is that they want to keep as many of these warrants in place as long as possible, so long as there is a reasonable reason for doing so,"" Alger said at the time of Elizabeth's death. ""Because a certain biscuit was her majesty's favorite biscuit, chances are that King Charles may decide that they were his favorite biscuits as well.""

Which Royals Can Issue a Royal Warrant?

King Charles III has the power to name new royal warrant givers in the family. While the king has not yet taken action on this subject, Alger is comfortable making some guesses.

""One expects that the new Prince of Wales, Prince William, will continue to do so. It remains to be seen if there are other members of the royal family who will also be able to do this themselves in the future,"" he says.

Do Other Monarchies Issue Royal Warrants?

The British monarchy is not alone in granting royal warrants to private businesses. Leather-goods purveyor Delvaux holds a warrant from the Belgian royal court, silversmith Georg Jensen displays a warrant from the queen of Denmark, and bespoke shirtmaker Camisería Burgos is the recipient of a warrant from the king of Spain. However, it feels as if the British royal warrant looms largest in the global consumer conscience.

Alger ascribes this to the close connection Queen Victoria forged between the crown and British industry, which continues to this day (indeed, Princess Anne has served as the president of UKFT for over 35 years). But he also chalks it up to the character and interests of the royals themselves.

""They're very close to the land, they're very close to jobs...Prince Charles has an encyclopedic knowledge of issues around agriculture, animal husbandry and production of textile and fashion products.""

Because each royal warrant is awarded by an individual member of the royal household, grantees might be viewed as an expression of the granter's personality. It's not surprising that Charles, who's become something of a classic menswear icon, should patronize makers including Tricker's, Turnbull & Asser, Anderson & Sheppard and Ettinger.

For decades, the queen, Charles and Prince Philip had been the only members of the royal household to grant warrants. But now, there is speculation that Prince William might become the next royal warrant giver and may approach the task with a different sensibility.

""My guess with the Duke of Cambridge is that we may see a broadening out, because he's a different person. He's his own man, and he may want to support some younger British fashion brands,"" says Alger, who also points out the Duchess of Cambridge's support for budding British designers.

Alger clarifies that this is speculation and that the status of future royal warrant givers remains shrouded behind the monarchial veil. However, it seems safe to bet that so long as the English throne is occupied, we'll continue to find interest in who its occupant, and their family, patronize.",robbreport.com,news,Robb Report,Eric Twardzik,0.07450980392156858,454173047,1,https://robbreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/RR_Royal_Warrants_Charles_Camilla_2024.jpg?w=1024,

In 2023, Switzerland thus ranks 22nd in a European comparison, just ahead of Malta, Romania, the Czech Republic, Slovenia, Slovakia and Latvia, SES said in a statement on Thursday.

Every year, the organisation analyses the per capita production of solar and wind-generated electricity in Switzerland and the 27 European Union (EU) member states.

Top-ranked countries Denmark and Sweden produce six to seven times more solar and wind-generated electricity per capita than Switzerland. And when compared with the eight countries around it, Switzerland finds itself in the penultimate spot.

Just 9% of the electricity consumed in Switzerland is generated by solar panels and wind turbines in Switzerland. In Denmark, the figure is over 70%.

In wind power, the Netherlands is now in the European lead, producing more than twice as much solar energy per capita as Switzerland. Germany is also ahead of Switzerland in terms of solar electricity production.

On June 9, the Swiss electorate will vote on the so-called electricity law, which proposes binding targets and an investment-friendly framework to drive the development of renewable energies. The SES is campaigning in favour of a yes vote.

NEW YORK, May 23, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- The LEGO Group is harnessing children's creativity and imagination to show the world what may await us in space.

A new global study by the LEGO Group finds that 86 percent of kids aged four to 14 are interested in finding new planets, stars and galaxies, and 77 percent want to travel to space. Additionally, more than 3 in 5 (68 percent) children believe there are aliens in space, and 64 percent say they would want to meet one.

The LEGO Group, drawing inspiration from the universe for over 50 years, aims to unite children's curiosity about space through the ultimate creative medium of LEGO® bricks. This year, the company is unveiling many epic Space-themed sets like the LEGO® Friends Stargazing Camping Vehicle, inviting adventurers to stargaze and spot constellations, and the LEGO® City Space Explorer Rover and Alien Life Playset, enabling kids to explore new worlds and unleash their creativity.

Scientists estimate that only four percent of our universe has been explored, with just 646 people ever seeing the great beyond in person. The LEGO Group predicts that Gen Alpha's eagerness to search the cosmos will be the key to exploring the 96 percent of the universe still to be discovered.

Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No, it's a UPO!

The LEGO Group asked kids across the world to share their visions of how they would like to explore the cosmos. With the help of Associate Master Builder at LEGO House, Didac Perez Soriano, a selection of these spacecrafts were reimagined in LEGO bricks.

The LEGO Group then showcased the future of space travel according to a group of young budding space explorers - Lotty (10, UK), Sebastian (10, Denmark), Jace (13, Hong Kong SAR, China), Jillian (7, USA), Jordan (12, USA) and Orla (6, UK) - by blasting their unique designs, playfully coined Unidentified Playing Objects (UPOs), over the New York City skyline.

Taking over the most photographed skyline of all time, the show included a space bed UPO powered by butterfly wings complete with a snack drawer for long journeys, a turtle spaceship that walks on the moon, a dog spaceship with 360° windows to see all that space has to offer, and a dinosaur ship with a jetpack, among others.

Didac Perez Soriano, Associate Master Builder at LEGO House, said: ""Children are our inspiration for play and creativity. At LEGO House, we aim to provide the pinnacle experience for letting play and creativity run free, and that's why I leapt at the opportunity to build 3D representations of their creative spaceships in LEGO bricks. The imagination shown by young children around the world was mind-blowing and this was one of the best experiences I have had. I'm ecstatic we can share these with the world. With so much of the universe still to be explored, we can't say that what they have created isn't possible or even out there already.""

Lotty Ingle, the 10-year-old designer of the butterfly wing powered bed spaceship from Leeds, UK, said: ""I was over the moon when I found out that my design had been picked. I kept saying to my mum ""Really?"", ""No, but really Mum?"". I like to be eco-friendly and didn't want to use any electricity so I thought butterfly wings would be a good idea. I would love to travel to all the planets that no one has discovered yet and see if there is life there, and if they are just like us. I would really like them to try all my favourite snacks that I am bringing with me.""

All UPOs in their LEGO brick form can be viewed at the ""Explore Space Your Way"" exhibition at LEGO House in Billund, Denmark, until June 17. LEGO House is the ultimate destination for celebrating everything beyond our world. The collaborative exhibition with the Technical University of Denmark at LEGO Square allows visitors to learn more about the infinite depths of space through wildly creative exhibits crafted entirely from LEGO bricks.

Reimagining the Constellations

While the constellations of our night sky have been set by astronomers in history, the LEGO Group also believes that Gen Alpha can bring a new creative lens to our view of the stars. Celebrating kids' curiosity about the future of space, the LEGO Group is asking children to reimagine the night sky with their own Funstellations.

With a guardian's help, children are invited to visit LEGO.com/Space to download a sky map and join the dots together to show what object or shape they can see in the stars - maybe it's a cowboy riding a unicorn or a flying whale.

The LEGO Group will then work with the International Astronomical Union to recognise their formations as Funstellations - official reimaginations of our constellations - and update our vision of the night sky.

Debra Elmegreen, President of the International Astronomical Union said: ""We are excited to tap into the unbridled creativity of children through this collaboration by encouraging them to look up at the night sky and think about the stars. The next generation of scientists and space explorers will shape how we understand and interact with the Universe. With this project, we hope to give them a head start.""

The LEGO Group's mission is to inspire and develop the builders of tomorrow through the power of play. The LEGO System in Play, with its foundation in LEGO bricks, allows children and fans to build and rebuild anything they can imagine.

The LEGO Group was founded in Billund, Denmark in 1932 by Ole Kirk Kristiansen, its name derived from the two Danish words Leg Godt, which means ""Play Well"". Today, the LEGO Group remains a family-owned company headquartered in Billund. However, its products are now sold in more than 130 countries worldwide.

About the UPO Ambassadors:

Lotty Ingle (10, United Kingdom): Lotty will set off into the universe in a space bed powered by butterfly wings. The bed-shaped spacecraft has a dragon's fire engine to give her extra power and keep her warm, and a special snack drawer underneath to keep herself and the aliens well fed in between planet visits.

Sebastian Mikkelsen (10, Denmark): Sebastian's rocket is shaped like a straw hat with reindeer antlers as wings and would have a high-tech computer lab, gaming room and a place to eat and sleep. His spaceship will have a big power rocket attached that will allow him to zoom around to other planets where he will discover aliens to befriend.

Jace Kong (13, Hong Kong SAR, China): Jace can't wait to one day be able to explore space in her dog shaped spacecraft with 360° windows so she can see all that space has to offer and wave to any aliens as they fly by. Taking inspiration from a dream she had, the spacecraft will have fun multi-coloured lights so she can host parties on the moon with all the different breeds of dogs to keep her company whilst exploring the cosmos.

Jillian Granelli (7, USA): Jillian fantasizes about setting off around space on a dinosaur wearing a big jetpack, allowing her to speed between planets faster.

Jordan Hardnett (12, USA): Jordan says he will travel to space and discover the unknown in his alien spaceship fully equipped with futuristic gadgets, including night vision goggles to see other creatures.

Orla Diamond (6, UK): Orla hopes to explore space in her turtle-shaped spacecraft which has a long neck to help her see and hear everything. It even has a slide and ladder for when she ventures out on foot across her newly discovered planets.",asiaone.com,news,AsiaOne,,0.4666666666666666,454165429,16,https://media.asiaone.com/sites/default/files/styles/a1_600x316/public/original_images/May2024/pr-newswire_500_4_1800.jpg?h=7de12b8a&itok=Vk7Mt3C2,eng-9584016

Crispian Olver, executive director of the Presidential Climate Commission which is advising the government on the JETP, told Climate Home: ""This is a bit like trying to turn a big container-ship - it's slow to shift onto a new path, but once it's on that new course, things will start to move faster.""

As of last November, just $308 million of grant-funded projects under the JETP had reached the implementation phase, government data shows. Of this, just $30m was categorised as spending on the just transition in the coal-dependent Mpumalanga province.

The government has not published equivalent information on loans - which make up 97% of the donor-backed support. But those following the JETP say progress has been slow partly because South Africa's state-owned electricity generator Eskom is reluctant to take on more debt.

In addition, South Africa's energy ministry and the wealthy governments that are providing funding disagree on the role of gas in the country's energy transition. The donors backing the JETP are the US, Canada, Britain, Switzerland, the European Union, the Netherlands, Germany, France, Denmark and Spain.

Coal plant closures have been delayed by South Africa's lack of reliable electricity, which has led to rolling power black-outs known as ""load-shedding"".

While problems affecting the coal sector are a key cause of unreliable electricity supplies, Eskom has said it will delay the closure of three coal-fired power plants in response to the crisis.

South Africa's best wind and solar resources, in the south and west, meanwhile remain under-utilised because the national power grid is already congested in those areas.

To transport the clean power, Eskom is trying to build transmission cables but progress has been slow as the utility is deeply in debt and reluctant to take on new loans through the JETP - even if those loans are offered on cheap terms.

An Eskom spokesperson said that ""off-balance sheet options"" - like allowing the private sector to build cables and substations - are being considered, but the details are still to be finalised.

Yet not all government departments want a rapid transition to renewables. The Department of Mineral Resources and Energy (DMRE), led by pro-coal minister Gwede Mantashe, recently published an energy planning document that envisages a sharp slowdown in the roll-out of solar and wind power and instead more of a shift from coal to gas power plants.

This has complicated things for the international partner group behind the JETP. Two people with knowledge of the negotiations told Climate Home that South Africa's apparent reticence to switch to renewables is slowing the pace of funding flows under the deal.

On the other hand, South Africa's parliament recently approved a Climate Change Bill and a Electricity Regulation Amendment Bill, which seeks to create a competitive power market and end Eskom's century-long, coal-dominated monopoly. The legislation will render the DMRE's controversial gas-reliant energy plans less relevant, as it paves the way for more electricity to be produced by private companies.

But that has done little to appease anxious workers and residents in the heart of the country's coal belt. In particular, the town of Komati offers a warning of the electoral damage that can occur if coal-plant repurposing projects don't go smoothly.

Eskom's coal-fired power station in Komati was retired from service in October 2022 after reaching its end-of-life date. It is now being converted into a solar, wind and food farm, a solar microgrid assembly factory and training facility.

Parts of it are now starting to open but for many local people, it is too little too late. ""The community is currently facing a pandemic of unemployment and poverty,"" said community leader Carlos Vilankulu, who is also a repurposing project liaison officer.

Eskom says none of its workers lost their jobs when the last coal units were taken offline - many were transferred to other power stations. But local guesthouses and other small businesses in the community say they are struggling as a result of the closure.

""Everything has come to a standstill. Many people are unemployed,"" said Alta de Bruin, a guest-house owner based in Komati village. While the repurposing project has generally been well received, it ""could have started a long time ago"", de Bruin told Climate Home.

The decision to close down Komati was made long before South Africa agreed to its climate finance package at COP26, but the local transformation project is intended to serve as a blueprint for other just transition initiatives in the country.

It has been a cautionary tale, according to Olver. Community consultations on the way forward only took place years after the decision was made to shut Komati - meaning local residents and businesses were left in a state of limbo. ""The next [coal power] stations will do it better,"" he said.

Besides South Africa, JETPs have also been signed with Indonesia, Vietnam and Senegal. Leo Roberts, an analyst with climate change think-tank E3G, said South Africa's delays in closing down its coal plants are concerning.

Indonesia has also postponed coal plant closures after expressing disappointment with rich countries' support, while Vietnam's partnership has ground to a halt amid political turmoil.

""We mustn't lose sight of what the JETPs need to deliver,"" Roberts said. ""This is ultimately about reducing emissions to avoid catastrophic climate change, dealing with the huge health pollution challenges coal causes, and supporting countries to deliver self-defined low-carbon development pathways.""

The Finnish company will supply and oversee the installation of a range of solutions for the project, including the hybrid converters, the energy storage system, and the energy management system.

The contract covers the conversion of two ferries for Scandlines, the Deutschland and the Schleswig-Holstein, that will be used on its Puttgarden, Germany to Rødby, Denmark route as part of the operator's net zero ambitions.

Roger Holm, president of Wärtsilä Marine, said: ""Ship electrification is one of the solutions for marine decarbonisation and as the world's biggest conversion project of its kind, we can help Scandlines move closer to meeting their goal of making the route emission-free by 2030.""

Wärtsilä's equipment is scheduled for delivery in mid-2025 and will also include switchgears, transformers, an onboard port charger, and replacement components for the switchboard.

Once the conversions are complete, the ferries will be able to draw electricity from a shore-charged energy storage system for 80% of the power needed for the 21.4km crossing.

The project continues Scandlines investment in low to zero emission ferry conversions and newbuilds, following other projects such as the construction of the world's largest all-electric double-ended ferry.

In times of relative peace following the end of the Cold War, intelligence gathering in other States' territorial waters and Exclusive Economic Zones (eez s) seemed to pose no immediate threat to peace and security. The situation has changed with Russia's attack on Ukraine. There is a high risk that Russia, as part of its hybrid campaign against nato members, will further attempt to interfere with European communication, electricity, and energy infrastructure, especially in the maritime domain.

The blowing up of the Nord Stream pipelines in September 2022 and the damaging of the Balticconnector gas pipeline in the Gulf of Finland in October 2023 have shown (leaving aside the problem of attribution in each case) that the disruption of underwater supply lines for oil and gas is a realistic scenario due to the fact that it is impossible to effectively protect such infrastructure on the sea floor. Submarine data and power cables are also particularly vulnerable. Attacks on cables can be carried out without technologically advanced capabilities by civilian ships, such as fishing trawlers, research vessels, yachts, or even container ships ""hidden in common marine traffic"". As one journalist put it, for severing cable connections, ""all it takes is a heavy anchor, the will to drag it, and the knowledge of just where to do so"". More precise operations can be conducted by scuba divers, manned or un-manned underwater vehicles, and deep-diving submarines. Recent examples of cable cutting incidents in Northern European waters include the vanishing of a large subsection of a research data cable off the North Norwegian coast (April 2021), the disruption of a fibre-optic communication cable connecting the archipelago of Spitzbergen with the Norwegian mainland (January 2022), the cutting of cables between Shetland and the Scottish mainland, as well as between Shetland and the Faroe Islands (October 2022), and the damaging of a telecommunications cable connecting Finland and Estonia in the Viro Strait (October 2023).

The effort and cost of sabotage against underwater cables and pipelines can be considered minimal compared to the potential impact. Within the global network of submarine communications infrastructure, not every data cable or landing station is critical. However, there are a number of nodes that are vital for connecting Europe with other regions of the world. They are located off the south-west coast of the United Kingdom, in the Bay of Biscay, off the Portuguese Atlantic coast, and off Marseilles. Coordinated and simultaneous strikes against these nodes could largely paralyse Internet traffic in Europe. An attack disrupting key oil and gas supply lines could also have serious cascading effects. Depending on the location and extent of the damage, it can take months or even years to repair a pipeline on the seabed. All in all, a simple act of sabotage - strategically targeted at particularly critical parts of the cable or pipeline infrastructure - can put enormous pressure on the affected States.

Therefore, Russian activities in the waters surrounding the European continent are alarming. In April 2023, a team of investigative journalists from Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden revealed that Moscow is running a large-scale programme to systematically map critical infrastructure and its vulnerabilities in the North and Baltic Seas. Security experts consider these activities as preparation for future sabotage. European waters are home to thousands of kilometres of cables, including data cables that connect the European mainland with the United Kingdom and the United States. Moreover, Europe has an extensive network of underwater pipelines. Another potential target are the numerous wind farms, especially in the North Sea.

According to media sources, the mapping is conducted by a fleet of approximately 50 Russian ships, which have underwater surveillance technology onboard. Reportedly, the ships use to turn off their positional transmitters when operating in the vicinity of critical infrastructure. In their documentary, the journalists focussed on the Admiral Vladimirsky, classified as an oceanographic research vessel, which had been spotted nearby military installations at the northeast coast of Scotland as well as close to several wind farms along the British and Dutch coasts. The reports say that the ship also travelled through Danish territorial waters with its transmitter turned off. A journalist who approached the Admiral Vladimirsky said he was confronted by armed security guards standing on deck. During an earlier research expedition to the South Pole, the ship reportedly deployed a proton magnetometer, which is a device that can be used to detect metallic objects on the seabed.

The fact that Russian ships - whether 'ghost ships' or vessels clearly identifiable as military or research vessels - are mapping foreign maritime infrastructure is not new. Such activities are said to date back to the 1990s and 2000s. Since 2014, however, these efforts have intensified, observers say. In 2015, the US Government got alarmed about Russian submarines and spy ships aggressively operating near vital undersea cables close to US coastlines. Russian vessels conducting intelligence operations around Europe were spotted also in Irish and Portuguese waters and in the Mediterranean. For example, in August 2021, the Yantar was observed sailing through Ireland's eez. The Yantar is officially an oceanographic research vessel, but its missions are believed to include cable cutting, laying of taps on undersea cables, and intelligence gathering. The ship is also capable of hosting deep-diving submersibles and a range of remotely operated and autonomous underwater vehicles.

Among the priority areas for improving mobilisation training and mobilisation readiness in the field of maritime activity ranges ""improving the procedure for the conscription and use of transport, fishing, and specialized vessels of all forms of ownership, (...) by the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, other troops, and military units conducting special operations in peacetime (emphasis added)"".

In response to the growing threat of strategic sabotage, nato has established a new cell for coordinating the protection of critical undersea infrastructure, which is responsible, among other things, for enhancing surveillance of particularly vulnerable installations and structures. National efforts are also becoming more determined. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, for example, announced in October 2023 that more than 20,000 British troops with warships, fighter jets, and helicopters will be deployed across Northern Europe to tackle hybrid threats and protect critical infrastructure in the region.

Against this background, this article examines the legal framework under which States could take action against Russian vessels engaged in mapping critical infrastructure in the North and Baltic Seas. The analysis focuses on the international law of the sea, not on the law of State responsibility or the jus contra bellum. Section 2 shows that the mapping of infrastructure in the territorial sea of another State without the authorisation or consent of that State is incompatible with the regime of innocent passage. The coastal State may therefore adopt laws and regulations, and take a variety of enforcement measures, to sanction ships carrying out unauthorised mapping activities in its territorial sea. Section 3 deals with straits used for international navigation. Here, the legislative and enforcement powers of the bordering States are more limited. This makes it difficult to justify action against Russian spy ships in such straits. Section 4 analyses the legal situation in the eez, where all States enjoy the freedom of navigation. An important question is whether collecting intelligence in a foreign eez constitutes an internationally lawful use of the sea related to the freedom of navigation. In any case, the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (losc) does not give the coastal State clear authority to prevent foreign vessels from mapping infrastructure in its eez. However, coastal States must be able to exercise effectively their sovereign rights for the exploration and exploitation of the natural resources of the eez and continental shelf. This implies that coastal States must be allowed to take the necessary measures to protect the infrastructure that serves the exercise of those sovereign rights. Hence, the article discusses to what extent coastal States may take measures against foreign vessels suspected of being involved in the preparation of acts of sabotage in the eez and on the continental shelf.

We can bridge this valley with fast, flexible government packages for synthetic biology and similar new industries.

Biomanufacturing is estimated to be worth trillions, builds on Australia's comparative strengths (great tech, agriculture feedstocks, clean and green) and will help achieve Australia's net zero targets. Australia is home to leading biomanufacturing technology such as Samsara Eco, which infinitely recycles plastics using plastic-eating super enzymes, and Cauldron Molecules, precision fermenters brewing cost effective, sustainable, alternate food, feed, fibre and fuel.

Australia is a strong performer in knowledge creation (9 of 31 OECD countries) but relatively poor at innovation output (commercialisation) (30 of 132 in WIPO Global Innovation Index) with notably low ranks for high tech manufacturing (50) and production and export complexity (90). Biomanufacturing could help turn that around but the valley of death for a FOAK is a known challenge.

CSIRO projects that the biomanufacturing sector has the potential to generate 50,000 new jobs by 2040 but already the more mature companies have relocated offshore. The bottleneck to this industry in Australia is financing for FOAK. Capital projects larger than US$20 million for a FOAK facility are not serviced by either venture capital or project finance, so FOAK funding requires public and private partnering.

Government equity may crowd out commercial investors. Government grants alone cannot fund capital intensive projects, which means government-debt is a critical financer. Australia's government-funded debt providers are more accustomed to 'new' industries like renewable energy where long-term energy offtake is easier to guarantee and enable loan funding, this isn't as easy in biomanufacturing more broadly.

Opportunity & Solution

Fast, flexible models for FOAKs could ensure Australia doesn't lose out on capturing the value of its IP this time around.

Given our relatively small economy industry policies compared to those of other countries (America's $605b), Australia can't compete on scale. As the Deputy Chair of Australia's Productivity Commission, Alex Robson, said 'we do not have the fiscal resources (to compete with bigger economies) and it would be ""like bringing a slingshot to a tank battle"".

The US's Inflation Reduction Act, bipartisan CHIPS Act, and the recent executive order on bio-manufacturing has turbocharged investment and growth across a host of advanced manufacturing and climate tech sectors in the US. In other new industries that China sought to take a global leadership position on, they offered incentives worth a staggering 30-40 per cent of total cost of fabrication ownership (project build plus 10 years of operation).

In his keynote at the Climate Investor Forum this year, the National Reconstruction Fund Corporation (NRFC) Chair Martijn Wilder indicated that NRFC and Australian government investment must get comfortable with risk and NRFC will explore models that have been applied successfully overseas.

Australia should look at overseas examples and replicate its signals and incentives. While China's scale of investment isn't feasible for Australia, China's incentive packaging provides insights, for example, their ownership of the fabrications' assets with lease back arrangements to the manufacturer.

Germany succeeded in commercialising its wind turbine technology through incentives like Germany's Federal Ministry for Research and Technology's (BMFT) guaranteed offtake. They provided a power purchase agreement which offered 10-12 years of energy purchasing from wind farm development companies for the first 250 MW installed. The rate paid for the electricity was much higher than the commercial rate and was based on the level needed to encourage wind farm development using German-made turbines.

Germany didn't need more power - this was an investment in greening the grid, the orderly phase out of coal and nuclear power and, most importantly, to encourage a domestic German manufacturing industry. This incentive system was somewhat disguised as an instrument of research rather than its true identity of market support. Andrew Garrad CBE, founder of wind turbine consulting company Garrad Hassan, and later President of GL Garrad Hassan with 1,000 staff in 29 countries, commented:

""The BMFT approach, which protected the German industry from foreign competition at the very early stages of development, was echoed in Denmark but not in the UK. The UK, German and Danish technologies were similar at the time, but the lack of national protection at this sensitive juncture, allowed the UK industry to fail whereas the Danish and German industries have continued and now dominate the western markets"".

Coming back to Australia's potential global leadership in biomanufacturing, opportunities like precision fermentation and even partial guaranteed offtake could unlock debt when packaged with other government incentives. While owning fermenters and leasing back to manufacturers may not be top of mind for government, a massive fermenter shortage is predicted as these industries grow with BCG estimating an additional 30 million tonnes of bioreactor (fermenters) capacity is needed by 2035 to meet demand, so asset value could be very healthy and, in fact, appreciating.

Australia is poised to be a biomanufacturing leader, if the government can deliver fast funding models for first-of-a-kind facilities. Government packages that include debt, rebates, grants and other options like subsidised input costs (energy), leasing of assets or partial guarantees on offtake, could be the solution.

Australia has an opportunity to play a world leading role in a trillion dollar biomanufacturing industry but it's a race to scale. We need biomanufacturing facilities built fast or we will lose out to the bigger capital firepower of other developed nations.",innovationaus.com,news,InnovationAus,Justin Hendry,0.2392156862745098,454156683,1,https://www.innovationaus.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Camilla-Roberts_print_4775_socialcrop_lowres.jpg,

The ferries operate on the Puttgarden, Germany - Rödby, Denmark route, and the conversion represents a key element in Scandlines' target to achieve emission-free operations on the route by 2030.

The two Scandlines Ro-Ro ferries selected for conversion to plug-in hybrid operation are the 142 metres-long 'Deutschland' and 'Schleswig-Holstein'.

The project involves replacing an engine and existing systems with a new shore-charged electrical system, including a large energy storage system. This will allow electricity to contribute approximately 80 percent of the energy needed for each crossing.

Wärtsilä will engineer and deliver the hybrid converters, the energy storage system (ESS) and the energy management system (EMS), as well as the switchgears, transformers, the onboard port charger, and replacement components in the existing switchboard equipment.

In addition, Wärtsilä will supervise the installations, carry out the commissioning, and provide preventive maintenance support services. The equipment is scheduled for delivery in summer 2025.

NEW YORK, May 23, 2024 /CNW/ -- The LEGO Group is harnessing children's creativity and imagination to show the world what may await us in space.

A new global study1 by the LEGO Group finds that 86 percent of kids aged four to 14 are interested in finding new planets, stars and galaxies, and 77 percent want to travel to space. Additionally, more than 3 in 5 (68 percent) children believe there are aliens in space, and 64 percent say they would want to meet one.

The LEGO Group, drawing inspiration from the universe for over 50 years, aims to unite children's curiosity about space through the ultimate creative medium of LEGO® bricks. This year, the company is unveiling many epic Space-themed sets like the LEGO® Friends Stargazing Camping Vehicle, inviting adventurers to stargaze and spot constellations, and the LEGO® City Space Explorer Rover and Alien Life Playset, enabling kids to explore new worlds and unleash their creativity.

Scientists estimate that only four percent of our universe has been explored, with just 646 people ever seeing the great beyond in person2. The LEGO Group predicts that Gen Alpha's eagerness to search the cosmos will be the key to exploring the 96 percent of the universe still to be discovered.

Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No, it's a UPO!

The LEGO Group asked kids across the world to share their visions of how they would like to explore the cosmos. With the help of Associate Master Builder at LEGO House, Didac Perez Soriano, a selection of these spacecrafts were reimagined in LEGO bricks.

The LEGO Group then showcased the future of space travel according to a group of young budding space explorers - Lotty (10, UK), Sebastian (10, Denmark), Jace (13, Hong Kong SAR, China), Jillian (7, USA), Jordan (12, USA) and Orla (6, UK) - by blasting their unique designs, playfully coined Unidentified Playing Objects (UPOs), over the New York City skyline.

Taking over the most photographed skyline of all time3, the show included a space bed UPO powered by butterfly wings complete with a snack drawer for long journeys, a turtle spaceship that walks on the moon, a dog spaceship with 360° windows to see all that space has to offer, and a dinosaur ship with a jetpack, among others.

Didac Perez Soriano, Associate Master Builder at LEGO House, said: ""Children are our inspiration for play and creativity. At LEGO House, we aim to provide the pinnacle experience for letting play and creativity run free, and that's why I leapt at the opportunity to build 3D representations of their creative spaceships in LEGO bricks. The imagination shown by young children around the world was mind-blowing and this was one of the best experiences I have had. I'm ecstatic we can share these with the world. With so much of the universe still to be explored, we can't say that what they have created isn't possible or even out there already.""

Lotty Ingle, the 10-year-old designer of the butterfly wing powered bed spaceship from Leeds, UK, said: ""I was over the moon when I found out that my design had been picked. I kept saying to my mum ""Really?"", ""No, but really Mum?"". I like to be eco-friendly and didn't want to use any electricity so I thought butterfly wings would be a good idea. I would love to travel to all the planets that no one has discovered yet and see if there is life there, and if they are just like us. I would really like them to try all my favourite snacks that I am bringing with me.""

All UPOs in their LEGO brick form can be viewed at the ""Explore Space Your Way"" exhibition at LEGO House in Billund, Denmark, until June 17. LEGO House is the ultimate destination for celebrating everything beyond our world. The collaborative exhibition with the Technical University of Denmark at LEGO Square allows visitors to learn more about the infinite depths of space through wildly creative exhibits crafted entirely from LEGO bricks.

Reimagining the Constellations

While the constellations of our night sky have been set by astronomers in history, the LEGO Group also believes that Gen Alpha can bring a new creative lens to our view of the stars. Celebrating kids' curiosity about the future of space, the LEGO Group is asking children to reimagine the night sky with their own Funstellations.

With a guardian's help, children are invited to visit LEGO.com/Space to download a sky map and join the dots together to show what object or shape they can see in the stars - maybe it's a cowboy riding a unicorn or a flying whale.

The LEGO Group will then work with the International Astronomical Union to recognise their formations as Funstellations - official reimaginations of our constellations - and update our vision of the night sky.

Debra Elmegreen, President of the International Astronomical Union said: ""We are excited to tap into the unbridled creativity of children through this collaboration by encouraging them to look up at the night sky and think about the stars. The next generation of scientists and space explorers will shape how we understand and interact with the Universe. With this project, we hope to give them a head start.""

NEW YORK, May 23, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- The LEGO Group is harnessing children's creativity and imagination to show the world what may await us in space.

A new global study1 by the LEGO Group finds that 86 percent of kids aged four to 14 are interested in finding new planets, stars and galaxies, and 77 percent want to travel to space. Additionally, more than 3 in 5 (68 percent) children believe there are aliens in space, and 64 percent say they would want to meet one.

The LEGO Group, drawing inspiration from the universe for over 50 years, aims to unite children's curiosity about space through the ultimate creative medium of LEGO® bricks. This year, the company is unveiling many epic Space-themed sets like the LEGO® Friends Stargazing Camping Vehicle, inviting adventurers to stargaze and spot constellations, and the LEGO® City Space Explorer Rover and Alien Life Playset, enabling kids to explore new worlds and unleash their creativity.

Scientists estimate that only four percent of our universe has been explored, with just 646 people ever seeing the great beyond in person2. The LEGO Group predicts that Gen Alpha's eagerness to search the cosmos will be the key to exploring the 96 percent of the universe still to be discovered.

Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No, it's a UPO!

The LEGO Group asked kids across the world to share their visions of how they would like to explore the cosmos. With the help of Associate Master Builder at LEGO House, Didac Perez Soriano, a selection of these spacecrafts were reimagined in LEGO bricks.

The LEGO Group then showcased the future of space travel according to a group of young budding space explorers - Lotty (10, UK), Sebastian (10, Denmark), Jace (13, Hong Kong SAR, China), Jillian (7, USA), Jordan (12, USA) and Orla (6, UK) - by blasting their unique designs, playfully coined Unidentified Playing Objects (UPOs), over the New York City skyline.

Taking over the most photographed skyline of all time3, the show included a space bed UPO powered by butterfly wings complete with a snack drawer for long journeys, a turtle spaceship that walks on the moon, a dog spaceship with 360° windows to see all that space has to offer, and a dinosaur ship with a jetpack, among others.

Didac Perez Soriano, Associate Master Builder at LEGO House, said: ""Children are our inspiration for play and creativity. At LEGO House, we aim to provide the pinnacle experience for letting play and creativity run free, and that's why I leapt at the opportunity to build 3D representations of their creative spaceships in LEGO bricks. The imagination shown by young children around the world was mind-blowing and this was one of the best experiences I have had. I'm ecstatic we can share these with the world. With so much of the universe still to be explored, we can't say that what they have created isn't possible or even out there already.""

Lotty Ingle, the 10-year-old designer of the butterfly wing powered bed spaceship from Leeds, UK, said:""I was over the moon when I found out that my design had been picked. I kept saying to my mum ""Really?"", ""No, but really Mum?"". I like to be eco-friendly and didn't want to use any electricity so I thought butterfly wings would be a good idea. I would love to travel to all the planets that no one has discovered yet and see if there is life there, and if they are just like us. I would really like them to try all my favourite snacks that I am bringing with me.""

All UPOs in their LEGO brick form can be viewed at the ""Explore Space Your Way"" exhibition at LEGO House in Billund, Denmark, until June 17. LEGO House is the ultimate destination for celebrating everything beyond our world. The collaborative exhibition with the Technical University of Denmark at LEGO Square allows visitors to learn more about the infinite depths of space through wildly creative exhibits crafted entirely from LEGO bricks.

Reimagining the Constellations

While the constellations of our night sky have been set by astronomers in history, the LEGO Group also believes that Gen Alpha can bring a new creative lens to our view of the stars. Celebrating kids' curiosity about the future of space, the LEGO Group is asking children to reimagine the night sky with their own Funstellations.

With a guardian's help, children are invited to visit LEGO.com/Space to download a sky map and join the dots together to show what object or shape they can see in the stars - maybe it's a cowboy riding a unicorn or a flying whale.

The LEGO Group will then work with the International Astronomical Union to recognise their formations as Funstellations - official reimaginations of our constellations - and update our vision of the night sky.

Debra Elmegreen, President of the International Astronomical Union said: ""We are excited to tap into the unbridled creativity of children through this collaboration by encouraging them to look up at the night sky and think about the stars. The next generation of scientists and space explorers will shape how we understand and interact with the Universe. With this project, we hope to give them a head start.""

About the UPO Ambassadors:

Lotty Ingle (10, United Kingdom): Lotty will set off into the universe in a space bed powered by butterfly wings. The bed-shaped spacecraft has a dragon's fire engine to give her extra power and keep her warm, and a special snack drawer underneath to keep herself and the aliens well fed in between planet visits.

Sebastian Mikkelsen (10, Denmark): Sebastian's rocket is shaped like a straw hat with reindeer antlers as wings and would have a high-tech computer lab, gaming room and a place to eat and sleep. His spaceship will have a big power rocket attached that will allow him to zoom around to other planets where he will discover aliens to befriend.

Jace Kong (13, Hong Kong SAR, China): Jace can't wait to one day be able to explore space in her dog shaped spacecraft with 360° windows so she can see all that space has to offer and wave to any aliens as they fly by. Taking inspiration from a dream she had, the spacecraft will have fun multi-coloured lights so she can host parties on the moon with all the different breeds of dogs to keep her company whilst exploring the cosmos.

Jillian Granelli (7, USA): Jillian fantasizes about setting off around space on a dinosaur wearing a big jetpack, allowing her to speed between planets faster.

Jordan Hardnett (12, USA): Jordan says he will travel to space and discover the unknown in his alien spaceship fully equipped with futuristic gadgets, including night vision goggles to see other creatures.

Orla Diamond (6, UK): Orla hopes to explore space in her turtle-shaped spacecraft which has a long neck to help her see and hear everything. It even has a slide and ladder for when she ventures out on foot across her newly discovered planets.

The LEGO Group is harnessing children's creativity and imagination to show the world what may await us in space.

A new global study1 by the LEGO Group finds that 86 percent of kids aged four to 14 are interested in finding new planets, stars and galaxies, and 77 percent want to travel to space. Additionally, more than 3 in 5 (68 percent) children believe there are aliens in space, and 64 percent say they would want to meet one.

The LEGO Group, drawing inspiration from the universe for over 50 years, aims to unite children's curiosity about space through the ultimate creative medium of LEGO® bricks. This year, the company is unveiling many epic Space-themed sets like the LEGO® Friends Stargazing Camping Vehicle, inviting adventurers to stargaze and spot constellations, and the LEGO® City Space Explorer Rover and Alien Life Playset, enabling kids to explore new worlds and unleash their creativity.

Scientists estimate that only four percent of our universe has been explored, with just 646 people ever seeing the great beyond in person2. The LEGO Group predicts that Gen Alpha's eagerness to search the cosmos will be the key to exploring the 96 percent of the universe still to be discovered.

Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No, it's a UPO!

The LEGO Group asked kids across the world to share their visions of how they would like to explore the cosmos. With the help of Associate Master Builder at LEGO House, Didac Perez Soriano, a selection of these spacecrafts were reimagined in LEGO bricks.

The LEGO Group then showcased the future of space travel according to a group of young budding space explorers - Lotty (10, UK), Sebastian (10, Denmark), Jace (13, Hong Kong SAR, China), Jillian (7, USA), Jordan (12, USA) and Orla (6, UK) - by blasting their unique designs, playfully coined Unidentified Playing Objects (UPOs), over the New York City skyline.

Taking over the most photographed skyline of all time3, the show included a space bed UPO powered by butterfly wings complete with a snack drawer for long journeys, a turtle spaceship that walks on the moon, a dog spaceship with 360° windows to see all that space has to offer, and a dinosaur ship with a jetpack, among others.

Didac Perez Soriano, Associate Master Builder at LEGO House, said: ""Children are our inspiration for play and creativity. At LEGO House, we aim to provide the pinnacle experience for letting play and creativity run free, and that's why I leapt at the opportunity to build 3D representations of their creative spaceships in LEGO bricks. The imagination shown by young children around the world was mind-blowing and this was one of the best experiences I have had. I'm ecstatic we can share these with the world. With so much of the universe still to be explored, we can't say that what they have created isn't possible or even out there already.""

Lotty Ingle, the 10-year-old designer of the butterfly wing powered bed spaceship from Leeds, UK, said: ""I was over the moon when I found out that my design had been picked. I kept saying to my mum ""Really?"", ""No, but really Mum?"". I like to be eco-friendly and didn't want to use any electricity so I thought butterfly wings would be a good idea. I would love to travel to all the planets that no one has discovered yet and see if there is life there, and if they are just like us. I would really like them to try all my favourite snacks that I am bringing with me.""

All UPOs in their LEGO brick form can be viewed at the ""Explore Space Your Way"" exhibition at LEGO House in Billund, Denmark, until June 17. LEGO House is the ultimate destination for celebrating everything beyond our world. The collaborative exhibition with the Technical University of Denmark at LEGO Square allows visitors to learn more about the infinite depths of space through wildly creative exhibits crafted entirely from LEGO bricks.

Reimagining the Constellations

While the constellations of our night sky have been set by astronomers in history, the LEGO Group also believes that Gen Alpha can bring a new creative lens to our view of the stars. Celebrating kids' curiosity about the future of space, the LEGO Group is asking children to reimagine the night sky with their own Funstellations.

With a guardian's help, children are invited to visit LEGO.com/Space to download a sky map and join the dots together to show what object or shape they can see in the stars - maybe it's a cowboy riding a unicorn or a flying whale.

The LEGO Group will then work with the International Astronomical Union to recognise their formations as Funstellations - official reimaginations of our constellations - and update our vision of the night sky.

Debra Elmegreen, President of the International Astronomical Union said: ""We are excited to tap into the unbridled creativity of children through this collaboration by encouraging them to look up at the night sky and think about the stars. The next generation of scientists and space explorers will shape how we understand and interact with the Universe. With this project, we hope to give them a head start.""

1 Independent research was conducted on behalf of the LEGO Group from March 18 to April 22, 2024 among kids aged 4-14 and their parents from the United Kingdom (n=1,000), the United States (n=1,000), Germany (n=1,000), Turkey (n=1,000), Australia (n=500), New Zealand (n=500), Singapore (n=1,000), China's Mainland (n=1,000), Hong Kong SAR, China (n=1,000), Taiwan Region (n=1,000), India (n=1,000), South Korea (n=1,000), Japan (n=1,000), Spain (n=1,000), France (n=1,000), Italy (n=1,000), and Portugal (n=1,000).

The LEGO Group's mission is to inspire and develop the builders of tomorrow through the power of play. The LEGO System in Play, with its foundation in LEGO bricks, allows children and fans to build and rebuild anything they can imagine.

The LEGO Group was founded in Billund, Denmark in 1932 by Ole Kirk Kristiansen, its name derived from the two Danish words Leg Godt, which means ""Play Well"". Today, the LEGO Group remains a family-owned company headquartered in Billund. However, its products are now sold in more than 130 countries worldwide.

About the UPO Ambassadors:

Lotty Ingle (10, United Kingdom): Lotty will set off into the universe in a space bed powered by butterfly wings. The bed-shaped spacecraft has a dragon's fire engine to give her extra power and keep her warm, and a special snack drawer underneath to keep herself and the aliens well fed in between planet visits.

Sebastian Mikkelsen (10, Denmark): Sebastian's rocket is shaped like a straw hat with reindeer antlers as wings and would have a high-tech computer lab, gaming room and a place to eat and sleep. His spaceship will have a big power rocket attached that will allow him to zoom around to other planets where he will discover aliens to befriend.

Jace Kong (13, Hong Kong SAR, China): Jace can't wait to one day be able to explore space in her dog shaped spacecraft with 360° windows so she can see all that space has to offer and wave to any aliens as they fly by. Taking inspiration from a dream she had, the spacecraft will have fun multi-coloured lights so she can host parties on the moon with all the different breeds of dogs to keep her company whilst exploring the cosmos.

Jillian Granelli (7, USA): Jillian fantasizes about setting off around space on a dinosaur wearing a big jetpack, allowing her to speed between planets faster.

Jordan Hardnett (12, USA): Jordan says he will travel to space and discover the unknown in his alien spaceship fully equipped with futuristic gadgets, including night vision goggles to see other creatures.

Orla Diamond (6, UK): Orla hopes to explore space in her turtle-shaped spacecraft which has a long neck to help her see and hear everything. It even has a slide and ladder for when she ventures out on foot across her newly discovered planets.

NEW YORK, May 23, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- The LEGO Group is harnessing children's creativity and imagination to show the world what may await us in space.

A new global study by the LEGO Group finds that 86 percent of kids aged four to 14 are interested in finding new planets, stars and galaxies, and 77 percent want to travel to space. Additionally, more than 3 in 5 (68 percent) children believe there are aliens in space, and 64 percent say they would want to meet one.

The LEGO Group, drawing inspiration from the universe for over 50 years, aims to unite children's curiosity about space through the ultimate creative medium of LEGO® bricks. This year, the company is unveiling many epic Space-themed sets like the LEGO® Friends Stargazing Camping Vehicle, inviting adventurers to stargaze and spot constellations, and the LEGO® City Space Explorer Rover and Alien Life Playset, enabling kids to explore new worlds and unleash their creativity.

Scientists estimate that only four percent of our universe has been explored, with just 646 people ever seeing the great beyond in person. The LEGO Group predicts that Gen Alpha's eagerness to search the cosmos will be the key to exploring the 96 percent of the universe still to be discovered.

Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No, it's a UPO!

The LEGO Group asked kids across the world to share their visions of how they would like to explore the cosmos. With the help of Associate Master Builder at LEGO House, Didac Perez Soriano, a selection of these spacecrafts were reimagined in LEGO bricks.

The LEGO Group then showcased the future of space travel according to a group of young budding space explorers - Lotty (10, UK), Sebastian (10, Denmark), Jace (13, Hong Kong SAR, China), Jillian (7, USA), Jordan (12, USA) and Orla (6, UK) - by blasting their unique designs, playfully coined Unidentified Playing Objects (UPOs), over the New York City skyline.

Taking over the most photographed skyline of all time, the show included a space bed UPO powered by butterfly wings complete with a snack drawer for long journeys, a turtle spaceship that walks on the moon, a dog spaceship with 360° windows to see all that space has to offer, and a dinosaur ship with a jetpack, among others.

Didac Perez Soriano, Associate Master Builder at LEGO House, said: ""Children are our inspiration for play and creativity. At LEGO House, we aim to provide the pinnacle experience for letting play and creativity run free, and that's why I leapt at the opportunity to build 3D representations of their creative spaceships in LEGO bricks. The imagination shown by young children around the world was mind-blowing and this was one of the best experiences I have had. I'm ecstatic we can share these with the world. With so much of the universe still to be explored, we can't say that what they have created isn't possible or even out there already.""

Lotty Ingle, the 10-year-old designer of the butterfly wing powered bed spaceship from Leeds, UK, said: ""I was over the moon when I found out that my design had been picked. I kept saying to my mum ""Really?"", ""No, but really Mum?"". I like to be eco-friendly and didn't want to use any electricity so I thought butterfly wings would be a good idea. I would love to travel to all the planets that no one has discovered yet and see if there is life there, and if they are just like us. I would really like them to try all my favourite snacks that I am bringing with me.""

All UPOs in their LEGO brick form can be viewed at the ""Explore Space Your Way"" exhibition at LEGO House in Billund, Denmark, until June 17. LEGO House is the ultimate destination for celebrating everything beyond our world. The collaborative exhibition with the Technical University of Denmark at LEGO Square allows visitors to learn more about the infinite depths of space through wildly creative exhibits crafted entirely from LEGO bricks.

Reimagining the Constellations

While the constellations of our night sky have been set by astronomers in history, the LEGO Group also believes that Gen Alpha can bring a new creative lens to our view of the stars. Celebrating kids' curiosity about the future of space, the LEGO Group is asking children to reimagine the night sky with their own Funstellations.

With a guardian's help, children are invited to visit LEGO.com/Space to download a sky map and join the dots together to show what object or shape they can see in the stars - maybe it's a cowboy riding a unicorn or a flying whale.

The LEGO Group will then work with the International Astronomical Union to recognise their formations as Funstellations - official reimaginations of our constellations - and update our vision of the night sky.

Debra Elmegreen, President of the International Astronomical Union said: ""We are excited to tap into the unbridled creativity of children through this collaboration by encouraging them to look up at the night sky and think about the stars. The next generation of scientists and space explorers will shape how we understand and interact with the Universe. With this project, we hope to give them a head start.""

The LEGO Group's mission is to inspire and develop the builders of tomorrow through the power of play. The LEGO System in Play, with its foundation in LEGO bricks, allows children and fans to build and rebuild anything they can imagine.

The LEGO Group was founded in Billund, Denmark in 1932 by Ole Kirk Kristiansen, its name derived from the two Danish words Leg Godt, which means ""Play Well"". Today, the LEGO Group remains a family-owned company headquartered in Billund. However, its products are now sold in more than 130 countries worldwide.

About the UPO Ambassadors:

Lotty Ingle (10, United Kingdom): Lotty will set off into the universe in a space bed powered by butterfly wings. The bed-shaped spacecraft has a dragon's fire engine to give her extra power and keep her warm, and a special snack drawer underneath to keep herself and the aliens well fed in between planet visits.

Sebastian Mikkelsen (10, Denmark): Sebastian's rocket is shaped like a straw hat with reindeer antlers as wings and would have a high-tech computer lab, gaming room and a place to eat and sleep. His spaceship will have a big power rocket attached that will allow him to zoom around to other planets where he will discover aliens to befriend.

Jace Kong (13, Hong Kong SAR, China): Jace can't wait to one day be able to explore space in her dog shaped spacecraft with 360° windows so she can see all that space has to offer and wave to any aliens as they fly by. Taking inspiration from a dream she had, the spacecraft will have fun multi-coloured lights so she can host parties on the moon with all the different breeds of dogs to keep her company whilst exploring the cosmos.

Jillian Granelli (7, USA): Jillian fantasizes about setting off around space on a dinosaur wearing a big jetpack, allowing her to speed between planets faster.

Jordan Hardnett (12, USA): Jordan says he will travel to space and discover the unknown in his alien spaceship fully equipped with futuristic gadgets, including night vision goggles to see other creatures.

Orla Diamond (6, UK): Orla hopes to explore space in her turtle-shaped spacecraft which has a long neck to help her see and hear everything.

This new agreement builds on an existing commitment by Microsoft to buy 2.67 million tonnes from Asnæs Power Station, bringing the total purchase under contract to 3.67 million tonnes of CO2.","In a landmark deal, Ørsted will sell a further one million tonnes of carbon removal over a ten-year period to Microsoft from Avedøre Power Station, which is part of the bioenergy carbon capture and storage (BECCS) project 'Ørsted Kalundborg CO2 Hub'. This new agreement builds on an existing commitment by Microsoft to buy 2.67 million tonnes from Asnæs Power Station, bringing the total purchase under contract to 3.67 million tonnes of CO2.

22.5.2024 As part of the 'Ørsted Kalundborg CO2 Hub', Ørsted will establish carbon capture at its wood chip-fired Asnæs Power Station in Kalundborg in western Zealand and at the Avedøre Power Station's straw-fired boiler in the Greater Copenhagen area. The 430,000 tonnes per year of biogenic CO2 from the combined heat and power plants will be shipped to a storage reservoir in the Norwegian part of the North Sea and stored permanently. The 'Ørsted Kalundborg CO2 Hub' is set to become operational by the beginning of 2026.

The new agreement between Ørsted and Microsoft entails that Microsoft will take one million tonnes of carbon removal from the straw-fired unit at Avedøre Power Station starting from 2026. The combined heat and power plant converts locally sourced straw, which is a by-product of agriculture, into electricity and district heating. By capturing the biogenic carbon from biomass-fired combined heat and power plants and storing it underground, it is possible to not only reduce, but also remove CO2 from the atmosphere, as biogenic carbon from sustainable biomass is part of a natural biogenic carbon cycle. Thereby, you create negative emissions.

The collaboration between Ørsted and Microsoft will play a vital role in developing the 'Ørsted Kalundborg CO2 Hub', as bioenergy-based carbon capture and storage is still in its early stages. Even though the project was awarded a subsidy from the Danish Energy Agency, the revenue from the sale of carbon removal certificates was included before investment decision and then in the offer submitted through the Danish subsidy scheme, which put great emphasis on competitive offers with the lowest amount of subsidy per tonne.

According to the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) latest report, carbon removal technologies such as BECCS are crucial for limiting global warming. This underscores the importance of projects such as the 'Ørsted Kalundborg CO2 Hub', which can support companies like Microsoft in achieving its sustainability goals and contribute to achieving the global climate targets.

Ole Thomsen, Senior Vice President and Head of Ørsted's Bioenergy business, says: ""This expanded collaboration with Microsoft is a testament to our shared vision for a sustainable future. By combining Ørsted's expertise in bioenergy carbon capture and storage with Microsoft's commitment to reducing its carbon footprint, we're showcasing how strategic relations can accelerate the transition to a greener economy.""

For Microsoft, the agreement represents another large-scale carbon removal deal towards the company's aspiration to be carbon-negative in 2030.

Brian Marrs, Senior Director of Energy & Carbon Removals at Microsoft, says: ""We're proud once again to announce a landmark offtake agreement with Ørsted, which is pioneering responsible carbon removal development in Denmark while also meeting the needs of a decarbonised energy system. The urgency around climate goals means translating great planning into rapid action - and Ørsted remains a valuable collaborator in bringing big ideas to life. Today's announcement is yet another tangible step towards building the technologies and commercial capabilities towards becoming carbon-negative by 2030.""

Facts about 'Ørsted Kalundborg CO2 Hub':

In May 2023, the Danish Energy Agency (DEA) awarded Ørsted a 20-year subsidy contract for its carbon capture and storage (CCS) project 'Ørsted Kalundborg CO2 Hub'. Ørsted will establish carbon capture at the wood chip-fired Asnæs Power Station in Kalundborg in western Zealand and at Avedøre Power Station's straw-fired boiler in the Greater Copenhagen area. Ørsted will capture 150,000 tonnes of biogenic CO2 per year from the straw-fired unit at Avedøre Power Station. The CO2 will initially be transported by lorry to Asnæs Power Station until an improved CO2 infrastructure can be established. The straw-fired unit at Avedøre Power Station converts locally sourced straw into electricity and district heating. The straw is a by-product of agriculture. Ørsted will capture 280,000 tonnes of biogenic CO2 per year from the wood chip-fired unit at Asnæs Power Station, which will also function as a CO2 hub, handling and shipping biogenic CO2 from both the Avedøre and Asnæs combined heat and power stations to the Northern Lights storage reservoir in the Norwegian part of the North Sea. The wood chip-fired unit at Asnæs Power Station converts wood chips from primarily the Baltics into electricity, district heating, and process steam for the local industry. The wood chips come from sustainably managed production forests and consist of residues from trimming or from crooked trees.",w3.windfair.net,news,w3.windfair.net,,0.2078431372549019,454148148,7,,

The LEGO Group is harnessing children's creativity and imagination to show the world what may await us in space.

A new global study1 by the LEGO Group finds that 86 percent of kids aged four to 14 are interested in finding new planets, stars and galaxies, and 77 percent want to travel to space. Additionally, more than 3 in 5 (68 percent) children believe there are aliens in space, and 64 percent say they would want to meet one.

The LEGO Group, drawing inspiration from the universe for over 50 years, aims to unite children's curiosity about space through the ultimate creative medium of LEGO® bricks. This year, the company is unveiling many epic Space-themed sets like the LEGO® Friends Stargazing Camping Vehicle, inviting adventurers to stargaze and spot constellations, and the LEGO® City Space Explorer Rover and Alien Life Playset, enabling kids to explore new worlds and unleash their creativity.

Scientists estimate that only four percent of our universe has been explored, with just 646 people ever seeing the great beyond in person2. The LEGO Group predicts that Gen Alpha's eagerness to search the cosmos will be the key to exploring the 96 percent of the universe still to be discovered.

Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No, it's a UPO!

The LEGO Group asked kids across the world to share their visions of how they would like to explore the cosmos. With the help of Associate Master Builder at LEGO House, Didac Perez Soriano, a selection of these spacecrafts were reimagined in LEGO bricks.

The LEGO Group then showcased the future of space travel according to a group of young budding space explorers - Lotty (10, UK), Sebastian (10, Denmark), Jace (13, Hong Kong SAR, China), Jillian (7, USA), Jordan (12, USA) and Orla (6, UK) - by blasting their unique designs, playfully coined Unidentified Playing Objects (UPOs), over the New York City skyline.

Taking over the most photographed skyline of all time3, the show included a space bed UPO powered by butterfly wings complete with a snack drawer for long journeys, a turtle spaceship that walks on the moon, a dog spaceship with 360° windows to see all that space has to offer, and a dinosaur ship with a jetpack, among others.

Didac Perez Soriano, Associate Master Builder at LEGO House, said: ""Children are our inspiration for play and creativity. At LEGO House, we aim to provide the pinnacle experience for letting play and creativity run free, and that's why I leapt at the opportunity to build 3D representations of their creative spaceships in LEGO bricks. The imagination shown by young children around the world was mind-blowing and this was one of the best experiences I have had. I'm ecstatic we can share these with the world. With so much of the universe still to be explored, we can't say that what they have created isn't possible or even out there already.""

Lotty Ingle, the 10-year-old designer of the butterfly wing powered bed spaceship from Leeds, UK, said: ""I was over the moon when I found out that my design had been picked. I kept saying to my mum ""Really?"", ""No, but really Mum?"". I like to be eco-friendly and didn't want to use any electricity so I thought butterfly wings would be a good idea. I would love to travel to all the planets that no one has discovered yet and see if there is life there, and if they are just like us. I would really like them to try all my favourite snacks that I am bringing with me.""

All UPOs in their LEGO brick form can be viewed at the ""Explore Space Your Way"" exhibition at LEGO House in Billund, Denmark, until June 17. LEGO House is the ultimate destination for celebrating everything beyond our world. The collaborative exhibition with the Technical University of Denmark at LEGO Square allows visitors to learn more about the infinite depths of space through wildly creative exhibits crafted entirely from LEGO bricks.

Reimagining the Constellations

While the constellations of our night sky have been set by astronomers in history, the LEGO Group also believes that Gen Alpha can bring a new creative lens to our view of the stars. Celebrating kids' curiosity about the future of space, the LEGO Group is asking children to reimagine the night sky with their own Funstellations.

With a guardian's help, children are invited to visit LEGO.com/Space to download a sky map and join the dots together to show what object or shape they can see in the stars - maybe it's a cowboy riding a unicorn or a flying whale.

The LEGO Group will then work with the International Astronomical Union to recognise their formations as Funstellations - official reimaginations of our constellations - and update our vision of the night sky.

Debra Elmegreen, President of the International Astronomical Union said: ""We are excited to tap into the unbridled creativity of children through this collaboration by encouraging them to look up at the night sky and think about the stars. The next generation of scientists and space explorers will shape how we understand and interact with the Universe. With this project, we hope to give them a head start.""

1 Independent research was conducted on behalf of the LEGO Group from March 18 to April 22, 2024 among kids aged 4-14 and their parents from the United Kingdom (n=1,000), the United States (n=1,000), Germany (n=1,000), Turkey (n=1,000), Australia (n=500), New Zealand (n=500), Singapore (n=1,000), China's Mainland (n=1,000), Hong Kong SAR, China (n=1,000), Taiwan Region (n=1,000), India (n=1,000), South Korea (n=1,000), Japan (n=1,000), Spain (n=1,000), France (n=1,000), Italy (n=1,000), and Portugal (n=1,000).

The LEGO Group's mission is to inspire and develop the builders of tomorrow through the power of play. The LEGO System in Play, with its foundation in LEGO bricks, allows children and fans to build and rebuild anything they can imagine.

The LEGO Group was founded in Billund, Denmark in 1932 by Ole Kirk Kristiansen, its name derived from the two Danish words Leg Godt, which means ""Play Well"". Today, the LEGO Group remains a family-owned company headquartered in Billund. However, its products are now sold in more than 130 countries worldwide.

Corre Energy, the Dublin-listed renewable energy storage developer, said it plans to raise €2 million from a share sale to its founding shareholders another long-term investor to tide it over as it continues talks with parties interested in making a ""strategic investment"" in the company.

The company's founding shareholders include former director Darren Patrick Green, who stepped down in February, chief executive Keith McGrane and businessman Brendan Boyd.

""This investment would support the working capital of the company as it moves through the next stage in its strategic investment process being managed by Rothschild & Co,"" Corre said.

Corre also intends to carry out an additional share sale to other eligible shareholders in the company to give them the chance to avoid having their stakes watered down by the placing with the group of larger investors.

The €2 million of shares are being offered at a price of 46 cents per share, in line with their closing price on Wednesday.

Corre, which floated on Euronext Dublin almost three years ago, said last month that it has hired investment bank Rothschild & Co to advise it on approaches it has had ""from multiple parties"" to invest in the company to provide it with additional funding for investment on projects and working capital.

Shares in the company have fallen by more than 85 per cent over the past 12 months. This has been partly down to a slump across the wider green energy sector amid a decline in energy prices and the weight of higher interest rates on this capital-intensive sector.

However, according to observers, it is also down to concerns about Corre having failed to sufficiently spell out the financial details of its various projects to allow investors assess their potential for profit.

Corre's most advanced development is its Zuidwending (ZW1) project in the province of Groningen in the Netherlands. ZW1 will be capable of supplying up to 320MW of electricity to the grid for up to 3½ days and is due to come on stream around the end of 2026.

Other key projects include Corre's 320MW Green Hydrogen Hub project in Denmark, another facility in the Netherlands (ZW2) and a plan to develop three compressed air energy storage plants in caverns secured last year in Germany.

Shares in Corre were hit in late February - falling below its €1 initial public offering price for the first time - when Mr Green stepped down as an executive director after a Singaporean company ultimately owned by him was named by UK tax authorities in relation to an alleged tax-avoidance scheme.

Mr Green told The Irish Times that he was ""absolutely astonished"" by the news and had not been a director of - or been involved in the running of - that company for years.",irishtimes.com,news,The Irish Times,,0.2941176470588236,454147479,1,https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/_guoNBTURg0nMZ20oeRLOBkXgw8=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/irishtimes/B337UNETIXTQMZZPZVKBRN7RTY.jpg,

Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs and Paris-based BNP Paribas both said the Bank of England will still begin cutting borrowing costs this summer from their 16-year highs.

It comes after the consumer prices index tumbled from 3.2pc to 2.3pc in April, its lowest level in nearly three years, after a record decline in energy prices.

However, money markets were spooked by strong services inflation, which is closely watched by the Bank of England and fell less than expected from 6pc to 5.9pc.

As a result, traders have pushed back their expectations for interest rate cuts from as early as June to as late as November - and are only pricing in one reduction this year.

Goldman Sachs and BNP Paribas had both predicted a first cut in borrowing costs in June but said this would now come in August.

Goldman analyst Sven Jari Stehn said this would ""provide two more rounds of inflation and labour market data, which we expect to show renewed inflation progress"".

In a note to clients, BNP Paribas said it was still forecasting three cuts this year from 5.25pc to 4.5pc, which it expects in August, September and November.

Federal Reserve minutes show rate-setters retain faith in hitting inflation target

The US Federal Reserve has just released minutes from its interest-rate decision body, the Federal Open Market Committee, for their meeting on April 30 to May 1.

They indicate that, despite disappointment over recent inflation readings, rate-setters still had faith price pressures would ease, if only slowly.

The minutes said:

While the policy response for now would ""involve maintaining"" the central bank's benchmark policy rate at its current level, the minutes also reflected discussion of possible further hikes. They say:

The minutes also reflected debate about just how restrictive current monetary policy is given the strength of the economy, an important discussion given the need for policy to be ""sufficiently"" restrictive to cool inflation.

Officials since that meeting have tamped down expectations for imminent interest rate cuts, which investors now see beginning in September.

But even as Fed officials acknowledged the risk of inflation pressures again building in the economy, they largely viewed the data from the start of the year as a temporary setback in the battle to return inflation to the central bank's 2pc target.

European Space Agency awards contracts in push for European answer to SpaceX

The European Space Agency said today that it has selected two companies to develop a vehicle to transport cargo to the International Space Station by 2028, in a move to ensure a European alternative to SpaceX.

The intergovernmental agency, which counts the UK as a member, has recently struggled to find rockets to launch its missions into space, and is following in the footsteps of Nasa by purchasing services from firms rather than developing them itself.

In November, the ESA launched a competition allocating up to €75m (£63.8m) to a maximum of three firms to build a vehicle to take cargo to the ISS and back.

Out of seven proposals, the ESA selected those from Franco-German The Exploration Company and Franco-Italian company Thales Alenia Space, each of which will receive €25m. A third contract award to a division of France's ArianeGroup may also occur, according to the FT, if a revised proposal can be agreed.

The contracts, which run until June 2026, will focus on developing the technology and structure of the vehicles.

Worries about new Chinese tariffs push down European shares

European stocks closed at a one-week low today, hurt by a sell-off in carmakers following a report about possible Chinese tariffs on imported cars, while tech stocks ticked higher ahead of US-based Nvidia's results.

European automakers fell 1.4pc to a more than three-month low, with shares of Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Volkswagen falling between 0.7pc and 1.7pc.

China should raise its import tariffs on large gasoline-powered cars to 25pc, a car research body affiliated with the Chinese government told the Asian giant's Global Times newspaper, as the country faces sharply higher US car import duties and possibly additional duties to enter the European Union.

The European Commission launched an investigation in October into whether fully-electric cars manufactured in China were receiving unfair subsidies and warranted extra tariffs. The EU could impose provisional duties in July.

The Europe-wide STOXX 600 index dipped 0.3pc, also pressured by a tick up in sovereign bond yields after data showed UK inflation eased less than expected in April.

Wall Street struggles for direction as it awaits Nvidia results

Wall Street's main indexes struggled for direction this afternoon as investors kept to the sidelines ahead of AI chip leader Nvidia's quarterly results and minutes of the Federal Reserve's policy meeting, both due this evening.

Eyes will be on whether semiconductor bellwether Nvidia's first-quarter results, due after markets close, can meet sky-high expectations and sustain the bumper gains the company's shares and other AI-related stocks recorded.

Nvidia has emerged as the third-largest US company by market value after a more-than 92pc surge in its shares this year after a large jump in 2023.

The company's shares were down 0.5pc today, after hitting a nearly two-month high on Tuesday.

Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth, said:

Wall Street's recent bull run has carried all three major indexes to record highs this month, driven by a strong earnings season as well as renewed hopes for interest-rate cuts and a so-called soft landing for the US economy.

Raspberry Pi confirms London float will take place next month

Raspberry Pi has confirmed aims to list in London next month in a boost to the capital's flagging stock market.

The Cambridge-based firm - known for affordable credit card-sized computers designed to boost coding skills among children - has revealed plans to raise $40m (£31.4m) in new money as part of the initial public offering (IPO) on London's main market.

The IPO is a welcome victory for the London market, which has been hit by a swathe of UK-listed firms being bought out or defecting abroad.

Arm and fellow Raspberry Pi investor Lansdowne Partners have agreed to also buy $35m (£27.5 million) and $20m (£15.7 million) worth of shares respectively as part of the plans.

Raspberry Pi was founded by computer scientist Eben Upton in 2008, before releasing its first product in 2012.

It has since sold more than 60m of its single board computers alone.

It is a subsidiary of the Raspberry Pi Foundation - a UK charity founded when the company was set up in 2008, with the goal of promoting interest in computer science among young people.

As a major shareholder in Raspberry Pi, the foundation has received around $50m (£39.7 million) in dividends since 2013, which has been used to advance its educational mission globally, according to the group.

US says new tariffs on Chinese goods start in August

Some of the steep US tariff increases on an array of Chinese imports, including electric vehicles and their batteries, computer chips and medical products, will take effect on August 1, US officials said on Wednesday.

President Joe Biden will keep tariffs put in place by his Republican predecessor Donald Trump while ratcheting up others, including a quadrupling of import duties on Chinese EVs to 100pc and a doubling of semiconductor duties to 50pc.

The Office of the United States Trade Representative, which advises the president on trade policy and conducts trade negotiations, is seeking comments on the effects of the proposed tariff increases on the US economy, including consumers, and on whether a proposed 25pc duty on medical masks, gloves and a planned 50pc tariff on syringes should be higher.

The United States imported nearly $640m (£503m) of gloves, masks and syringes last year from China that will be affected by the new measures.

The proposed Chinese tariff increases include ""products targeted by China for dominance, or are products in sectors where the United States has recently made significant investments.""

Washington is investing hundreds of billions of dollars in clean energy tax subsidies to develop American EV, solar and other new industries, and has said China's state-driven excess production capacity in these sectors threatens the viability of US companies. The tariffs are meant to protect American jobs from a feared flood of cheap Chinese imports.

Disney is selling its stake in an Indian pay-TV business to Tata, according to a report.

Goverments vow to cooperate against AI risks at Seoul summit

More than a dozen countries and some of the world's biggest tech firms pledged today to cooperate against the potential dangers of artificial intelligence, including its ability to dodge human control, as they wrapped up a global summit in Seoul.

AI safety was front and centre of the agenda at the two-day gathering. In the latest declaration, more than two dozen countries including the Britain, the United States and France agreed to work together against threats from cutting-edge AI, including ""severe risks"".

Such risks could include an AI system helping ""non-state actors in advancing the development, production, acquisition or use of chemical or biological weapons"", said a joint statement from the nations.

These dangers also include an AI model that could potentially ""evade human oversight, including through safeguard circumvention, manipulation and deception, or autonomous replication and adaptation"", they added.

The ministers' statement followed a commitment on Tuesday by some of the biggest AI companies, including ChatGPT maker OpenAI and Google DeepMind, to share how they assess the risks of their tech, including what is considered ""intolerable"".

The 16 tech firms also committed to not deploying a system where they cannot keep risks under those limits.

The Seoul summit, co-hosted by South Korea and Britain, was organised to build on the consensus reached at the inaugural AI safety summit last year.

Yogawear maker Lululemon drops 7pc after key manager departs

The maker of yoga pants told investors that it was ""implementing an updated and more integrated organisational structure, in conjunction with the departure of Sun Choe, chief product officer, who has resigned and will leave the company later this month to pursue another opportunity.""

Bloomberg reported that Ms Choe's departure adds to the ""wall of worry"" in the company's near term, according to a note by Raymond James analyst Rick Patel.

Sales of previously occupied US homes sank last month, pushed down by high mortgage rates and rising prices.

Existing home sales fell 1.9pc to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.14m from a revised 4.2m in March, the National Association of Realtors said.

The average price of previously occupied homes rose 5.7pc to $407,600 -- the tenth straight increase and a record for April.

Lawrence Yun, the association's chief economist, called the sales drop ""a little frustrating.'' Economists had expected sales to come in at 4.2m.

The rate on the benchmark 30-year, fixed-rate loan has risen five of the last six weeks and stands at 7.02pc, up from 6.39pc a year ago.

Would-be homebuyers are also deterred by the high prices, caused partly by a tight inventory of available homes.

Bank of England will cut interest rates in August, says Goldman Sachs

Interest rates will be cut in August, according to major investment banks, even after inflation came in higher than expected last month.

Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs and Paris-based BNP Paribas both said the Bank of England will still begin cutting borrowing costs this summer.

It comes after the consumer prices index tumbled from 3.2pc to 2.3pc in April, its lowest level in nearly three years, after a record decline in energy prices.

However, money markets were spooked by strong services inflation, which is closely watched by the Bank of England and fell less than expected from 6pc to 5.9pc.

As a result, traders have pushed back their expectations for interest rate cuts from as early as June to as late as November - and are only pricing in one reduction this year.

Goldman Sachs and BNP Paribas had both predicted a first cut in borrowing costs in June but said this would now come in August.

Goldman analyst Sven Jari Stehn said this would ""provide two more rounds of

inflation and labour market data, which we expect to show renewed inflation progress"".

Wall Street's main stock indexes were subdued at the opening bell ahead of AI chip leader Nvidia's quarterly results and the Federal Reserve's policy meeting minutes, released later in the day.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat at the open to 39,863.33.

BHP chief executive Mike Henry said the merger offered a ""compelling opportunity"", which would have given would Anglo American shareholders 17.8pc of a new combined venture.

Falling inflation is 'unalloyed good news,' says former minister

Conservative former Treasury minister Sir Robert Syms said the inflation statistics were ""unalloyed good news"" for the country.

He said: ""I think that should be rejoiced by everybody in this House, including people on the other side, who might actually end up in Government, inherit the benefit of some of the things that this government is doing. In truth I'm always a little surprised by, when good news comes along, how miserable the opposition gets.""

Treasury Minister Bim Afolami replied: ""I do disagree with him on one key measure, I must admit, which is the idea that they might inherit this because of course, we are not complete yet.

""We know that the economy still needs to continue to turn. We know that inflation needs to come down. We hope that that will lead in due course to falling interest rates as well, and for the measures that we put in place to come to fruition over the next parliament.""

Conservative former Treasury minister Richard Fuller said Mr Afolami was ""right to make the point that people are continuing to find economic difficulties at this time and that we need to stick with the Prime Minister's plan.

""Right to point out the terrible risks to the economy that the Labour Party's policies on labour markets and on taxes will do, and right to say that there have been external factors and that is different when you tackle external factors that are one offs from what your policies are, looking forward.""

Nasa delays crewed Boeing Starliner launch for third time

The first crewed launch of Boeing's Starliner spacecraft to the International Space Station has again been delayed, according to Nasa, with no new date immediately set.

The postponement of the launch, which had been set for Saturday, marks the third delay this month for the highly anticipated mission.

It would allow Nasa to certify a second commercial vehicle to carry crews to the ISS, beyond Elon Musk's SpaceX.

Earlier this month, the Starliner launch was postponed just hours before liftoff, with the astronauts already strapped in, due to a separate technical issue.

Read how it created turmoil in financial markets.

The German economy is expected to have grown gently in the second quarter after a positive first three months of the year, the Bundesbank said.

The German central bank said in its monthly report that economic output ""is likely to increase slightly again"" during the period.

Europe's largest economy exceeded expectations in the first quarter, when it posted growth of 0.2pc.

The positive figures came as a relief after German output shrunk by 0.5pc in the last quarter of 2023 at the end of a difficult period of high inflation.

An improvement in the services sector was behind much of the rising German growth figures.

Businesses in the sector could see their ""recovery continue"", the Bundesbank said.

Oil prices have slumped towards their lowest level in three months amid signs of rising stockpiles in the US.

Brent crude, the international benchmark, has fallen 0.7pc towards $82 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate has dropped 0.7pc to near $78.

The American Petroleum Institute reported crude stockpiles rose by 2.5m barrels last week, according to Bloomberg.

Brent is around 7pc higher so far this year amid cuts to supply by the Opec+ cartel, but prices have cooled since mid-April.

US stock markets are on track to begin the day lower ahead of AI chip maker Nvidia's quarterly results and the Federal Reserve's policy meeting minutes due later in the day.

All eyes will be on semiconductor bellwether Nvidia's first-quarter results, due after market close. Analysts are keen to see if it can meet the market's sky-high expectations.

Nvidia has emerged as the third-largest US company by market value after a more than 92pc surge in its shares this year and an over three-fold jump in 2023.

The company's shares were down 0.5pc in premarket trading, after rising over 3pc over the past two days.

Market participants are also keenly awaiting minutes from the US central bank's latest policy meeting for more clarity on the timing of rate cuts.

In premarket trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.1pc, the S&P 500 was down 0.2pc, and the Nasdaq 100 had fallen 0.2pc.

Culture Secretary backs Ofcom over GB News impartiality ruling

The Culture Secretary has backed Ofcom after the regulator warned GB News that it could consider fining it or revoking its licence over recent impartiality breaches.

Lucy Frazer was grilled by MPs at the Culture, Media and Sport Committe about a recent finding by the broadcasting regulator, which found that the People's Forum: The Prime Minister broke impartiality rules.

The watchdog said it was starting the ""process for consideration of a statutory sanction against GB News"" following a ""serious and repeated breach"" of the rules and the hour-long programme where Rishi Sunak took questions from the audience.

Ms Frazer said: ""I think that Ofcom is doing its job in terms of making sure that the Broadcasting Code is complied with.""

When asked if the media regulator had been ""tolerant"" of GB News, Ms Frazer appeared to defend Ofcom saying that it has ""found various breaches"" of the channel.

""I would say Ofcom is doing its job,"" she added.

Ms Frazer also said the BBC ""has more work to do"" on impartiality.

Tesla sales drop by quarter in Britain, official figures show

In corporate news, Tesla sales slumped across Europe last month as governments reduced the subsidies offered to buyers of electric cars.

Tesla registrations in Britain fell by a quarter in April and have slumped 14pc in the first four months of the year.

The carmaker registered just 13,951 vehicles in April, the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association said, which was down by 2.3pc from last year and its worst total since January 2023.

It comes despite chief executive Elon Musk previously insisting that he expected the car maker's second quarter results would be ""a lot better"".

Germany and Sweden have been among the major economies to have ceased or reduced subsidies for electric vehicles in recent months, which has put a damper on Europe's sales growth.

BT fined £2.8m for failing to provide contract information to customers

Away from today's inflation news, BT has been fined £2.8m by the industry watchdog after EE and Plusnet failed to provide clear and simple contract information to more than a million customers before they signed up.

Ofcom said that since June 2022, BT's EE and Plusnet businesses made more than 1.3m sales without providing customers with a contract summary and information documents, which affected at least 1.1m customers.

This meant that BT broke the regulator's consumer protection rules, which came into effect in 2022 and are designed to ensure customers get clear, comparable information about the services they are considering buying.

Ofcom said the fine ""reflects the seriousness of this breach"".

Ofcom brought in the rules in June 2022 and said BT had assured it that the group was confident the deadline would be met.

But the watchdog said its investigation found that, from January 2022, BT was aware that some of its sales would not meet the deadline. Ofcom said:

A BT spokesman said: ""We're sorry that some of our pre-contract information and contract summary documents were not available to some of our customers in a timely manner. We apologise for any inconvenience caused and have taken steps to proactively contact affected customers and arrange for them to receive the information and be refunded where applicable.""

He pointed to cost-of-living support the Government had offered, adding: ""The result of those difficult decisions, and they were difficult because in the end we had to put up taxes for those decisions, but the result is living standards have gone up since Rishi Sunak became Prime Minister.""

In a testy exchange, Mr Hunt could earlier be heard to insist ""me too"" when host Emma Barnett said she was interested in people's household finances.

Although traders have reacted strongly to the latest inflation figures, many economists still think summer interest rate cuts remain a possibility.

Suren Thiru, ICAEW economics director, said: ""Lingering concerns over underlying inflationary pressures mean a June rate cut is unlikely.

""However, these figures may convince more rate setters to vote to ease policy, providing a signal that a summer rate cut is still possible.""

Julian Jessop, economics fellow at the Institute of Economic Affairs think tank, said he believed a rate cut in June is ""still in play"".

It notched up an 11.3pc jump in like-for-like food sales over the year, with growth of 5.2pc across its clothing and home arm.

The group said it was upping its cost-cutting target by another £100m to £500m by 2027-28 as it looks to offset rising staff wages.

The company said: ""With continuing cost headwinds, notably from investment in colleague pay, the structural cost programme is critical to our profit progression.""

FTSE 100 slumps as interest rate cuts expected to be delayed

Stock markets have slipped after inflation fell by less than expected, delivering a blow to hopes of a June interest rate cut.

The benchmark FTSE 100 index fell 0.6pc, while the pound strengthened against the dollar and touched a two-month high at $1.275.

The mid-cap FTSE 250 dropped 0.4pc.

It comes as markets are now pegging a mere 16pc chance of a June rate cut by the Bank of England, a dip from the nearly 60pc that was priced in last week.

Despite UK inflation edging closer to the Bank of England's target, its slowdown fell short of expectations, with services inflation proving to be persistent.

Markets also have Nvidia's quarterly results on the radar that is due later in the day, and could spark a $200bn swing in the AI-darling's shares.

In corporate news, Marks & Spencer jumped 8.7pc to the top of the FTSE 100 after the retailer reported a 58pc rise in annual profit, which was ahead of market expectations.

SSE fell 2.3pc after the power generator and network operator posted a lower annual adjusted operating profit.

Responding to the inflation figures, Rishi Sunak told reporters:

There is still ""much more to be done"" to drive down inflation, Labour's Darren Jones has said, pointing to energy measures which could prevent inflationary spikes in the UK in future.

The shadow Treasury minister acknowledged inflation had ""come down a bit"" when speaking to Sky News, but said this was ""largely driven by a drop in the energy price cap"".

He added: ""Core inflation is still around 3.6pc to 3.9pc, which is hotter than the markets were expecting it to be. This is not out of the woods yet. It is in the right direction but there is still much more to be done.""

Mr Jones pointed to Labour's ""securonomics"" agenda, which includes measures to build ""homegrown, secure, renewable energy"".

UK stock markets declined at the open as inflation fell by less than expected at the start of the year.

First interest rate cut not expected until November despite fall in inflation

Hopes of a summer interest rate cut have been dashed for mortgage holders after inflation fell less than expected last month.

The consumer prices index tumbled from 3.2pc to 2.3pc in April - its lowest level in nearly three years - after a record decline in energy prices.

Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said the sharp decline indicated that ""brighter days are ahead"" but economists had expected inflation to drop to 2.1pc.

As a result, traders have pushed back their expectations for interest rate cuts from as early as June to as late as November.

They are also only pricing in one interest rate cut this year, compared to two before the latest inflation figures were published.

Services sector points to 'difficult last mile' on inflation, say analysts

Services inflation, a critical indicator for Bank of England policymakers, dipped slightly from 6pc in March to 5.9pc in April in a blow to hopes for early rate cuts.

The figure was higher than forecasts of a drop to 5.4pc, driven by more volatile aspects of the sector, such as hotels and live music.

Core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, fell from 4.2pc to 3.9pc, which was higher than predictions of a drop to 3.6pc.

The weaker than expected decline in inflation was another example of inflation figures ""developing a nasty habit of coming in hot"", according to analysts.

Britain's deficit balloons to £20.5bn in setback for Hunt's tax cut plans

Public borrowing has overshot forecasts in April, leaving Jeremy Hunt with less room to cut taxes this year in a pre-election giveaway.

The deficit stood at £20.5bn in April, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).

This is £1.2bn more than the £19.3bn forecast just two months ago by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the government's tax and spending watchdog.

Public borrowing in the tax year ending in March has also been revised higher by £0.8bn to £121.4bn, outpacing forecasts by the Government's spending watchdog by £7.3bn.

The figures are a blow to Conservative Party's prospects of narrowing a 27-point poll gap with Labour by wooing voters with further reductions in national insurance.

While public sector receipts from income like taxation was £1.6bn higher in April than a year earlier, spending has grown at nearly twice the pace at £3.1bn.

Alex Kerr at Capital Economics said: ""The Chancellor will be disappointed that April's figures do not provide more scope for tax cuts at a fiscal event later this year.

""Moreover, we expect slower wage growth to dampen tax receipts growth later this year. And the rise in market interest rates since March's Budget alone suggests he may have even less fiscal headroom (perhaps about £6.5bn) for tax cuts than the £8.9bn left over in March.""

Rob Wood, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, added: ""The headroom to cut taxes doesn't exist, but Chancellor Hunt seems likely to go ahead anyway.""

It comes after inflation figures for April were higher than expected, pushing back market expectations of the first interest rate cut.

The dramatic fall in inflation was mainly driven by the lowering of the Ofgem price cap in April, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).

It meant that average household energy bills fell by £238 a year to £1,690 following the shock caused by Vladimir Putin's decision to invade Ukraine.

The ONS said prices of electricity, gas and other fuels fell by 27.1pc in the year to April, the largest fall on record.

Gas prices fell by 37.5pc on the year, compared with a fall of 26.5pc in the year to March 2024, while electricity prices fell by 21pc, compared with 13pc in March.

Inflation has fallen less than expected, official figures show, in a blow for the Prime Minister and mortgage holders.

The consumer prices index dropped in April from 3.2pc to 2.3pc following a record decline in typical energy bills last month, according to the Office for National Statistics.

The drop takes the pace of price growth to its lowest level since July 2021 but it was far short of analyst expectations of a plunge to 2.1pc.

The higher-than-expected reading could derail hopes for a summer cut to interest rates, which would provide relief to mortgage holders grappling with the highest borrowing costs in 16 years.

It is also a blow to Rishi Sunak, who has said he only wants to call a general election when people ""feel that things are improving"".

Derivatives trades on money markets had indicated the Bank of England would reduce borrowing costs twice by the end of the year from 16-year highs of 5.25pc to 4.75pc.

Traders had priced in a first cut by August and more than a 50pc chance of a first cut in June.

Thanks for joining me. We begin the day with the economic news that has been keenly anticipated by mortgage holders and the Prime Minister.

Inflation fell to 2.3pc in April, according to the Office for National Statistics, raising hopes that interest rate cuts will not be far away.

High-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) stands out as a critical nuclear fuel supply for medical isotopes production in the EU, as well as for advanced nuclear reactor development. Against a backdrop of a challenging global geopolitical context and the EU's commitment to energy security and climate ambitions, HALEU could potentially be a game-changer. With the EU designing a comprehensive strategy for the development and deployment of small modular reactors (SMRs), the role of HALEU as a nuclear fuel is attracting attention for its promise of cost-effectiveness and reliability. Concurrently, HALEU already has significance beyond electricity production, particularly in the production of medical supplies in the EU, and their export to global markets. As the EU navigates the complexities of nuclear energy policy, anchored within ongoing geopolitical dynamics and climate imperatives, a thorough examination of HALEU's potential and challenges is paramount for informed decision-making.

A timely STOA workshop was held on 8 April 2024 to further the discussion on the EU's strategic autonomy in nuclear fuel supplies, with a particular emphasis on HALEU use and availability. The event responded to a mounting interest in SMRs and their capacity to address the EU's dual goals of energy security and climate resilience, all while examining the critical production of isotopes crucial for medical diagnostics and cancer treatment.

The event featured opening statements from a panel of distinguished experts in the field. Jon Carmack, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Nuclear Fuel Cycle and Supply Chain at the Office of Nuclear Energy, US Department of Energy, shared insights into the work by the United States on promoting domestic production of HALEU and nuclear fuels in general via a recorded message. He highlighted the partnerships with the private sector within the US HALEU availability programme, which received US$700 million under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.

According to Stefano Ciccarello, the acting Director-General of the Euratom Supply Agency (ESA), the EU acquired around 300 kg of HALEU for non-power applications (i.e. medical isotopes production and research reactors) in 2022, half of which was supplied by Russia and the other half by the US. ESA expects that HALEU needs for non-power applications will be around 700‑1 000 kg/year in 2035. As ESA proposes that these needs are met through domestic production, it therefore launched the preparatory phase for a European production capability to secure a supply of HALEU to fuel European research reactors and the production of medical radioisotopes. Stefano Ciccarello also noted that, depending on the rate of SMR deployment, there is potential competition between the use of HALEU for health applications and energy production.

Ghislain Pascal, policy officer from the European Commission's Directorate-General for Energy, introduced the recently launched European Industrial Alliance on SMRs, including its governance model. The Alliance hopes to provide a framework for coordinating activities, preparing analytical studies, sharing best practices, developing, and conducting joint actions aimed at fostering the deployment of SMRs in Europe.

Navid Samandari, Co-founder and Chief Executive Officer of Seaborg Technologies, highlighted the challenges of the deployment of advanced nuclear reactor technologies in Europe, particularly when compared to the situation in the US. He underscored the critical importance of having a diversified and secure supply chain of nuclear fuels, including HALEU fuel. However, he stated that this is not the case in the EU, prompting his company to pivot towards low enriched uranium (LEU) fuel. This shift inevitably led to increased costs and delays in bringing their advanced modular reactor design to market.

On the other hand, Hidde Baars, Government Affairs Director Netherlands & EU at Urenco, a leading European manufacturer of nuclear fuels, offered reassurance regarding HALEU supply. He affirmed that Urenco is committed to producing all types of fuels required, including HALEU, and ensuring their availability where needed. He stated that at the current level of HALEU demand in the EU, investment in production capacity is not necessary, while showing support for the role of the recently launched European Industrial Alliance on SMRs in bringing together European stakeholders and advancing decision making at the EU level.

A lively Q&A session was opened by former Member Paul Rübig, who mentioned the ongoing work of the European Economic and Social Committee (EESC) on drafting a report on medical isotopes and asked about the quantities of HALEU available and mapping of stockpiles. STOA Panel member Jutta Paulus (Greens, Germany) enquired about the costs and possible economies of scale of SMRs, recent failures of SMR deployment and potential proliferation risks.

Panellists addressed questions from the audience, underlining that EU HALEU production for medical isotopes is in a preparatory stage, but stressing that there are many uncertainties regarding the development of SMRs, in particular the hard-to-estimate future fuel needs. It was also clarified that SMRs can be of third or fourth generation, and that third-generation SMRs (the same generation of conventional nuclear power plants in operation that use LEU) are a mature technology and probably already cost-effective. On proliferation, the importance of the Euratom safeguards legal framework and EU nuclear inspectors was mentioned, as well as the need for international cooperation on the topic in the context of the International Atomic Energy Agency.

In closing the debate, STOA Panel member Pernille Weiss (EPP, Denmark) reiterated the importance of a continuous, comprehensive political discussion based on sound scientific evidence, especially in the context of the need to reduce dependence on Russian gas and fossil fuels in general.

This workshop served as a platform for a much-needed balanced discussion on nuclear energy in the EU, acknowledging both its potential benefits and drawbacks. It provided a comprehensive overview of the latest advances in reactors that use HALEU and contributed to the political discussion in the EU on how this particular fuel could potentially play a role in ensuring a more secure energy supply.",epthinktank.eu,news,European Parliamentary Research Service Blog,,0.4274509803921569,454141923,1,https://i0.wp.com/epthinktank.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/1712589852543_20240408_EP-167781A_GMZ_035.jpg?fit=1200%2C800&ssl=1&w=640,

The European Commission, which is examining the deal, sent a questionnaire to the companies' rivals and customers this month, asking for replies early this week, the person said. EEX is Europe's leading electricity and natural gas exchange, serving 800 participants.

""One dedicated section in the questionnaire is about conglomerate effects,"" the person said, referring to the impact on competition from the merger of two companies in closely related but not competing markets.

""The Commission would like to understand whether the merged entity could use its strong position in one market to increase its market position in markets of similar products,"" the person said.

The questionnaire asked if the merged entity might do this by offering products only as part of bundles for a fixed fee or making the sale of one product conditional on the sale of another related one, the person said.

The Commission, which last year said the merged company could have an incentive to raise trading fees or worsen conditions for market participants, declined to comment.

The questionnaire also asked about the impact of the deal on prices and the barriers for rivals to enter the market, the person said.

EEX and Nasdaq in their response to the Commission last year said the deal posed no significant threat to competition in Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Norway or any other EU country, that it would not eliminate competition between the two companies, and that market reaction had been positive.

Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs and Paris-based BNP Paribas both said the Bank of England will still begin cutting borrowing costs this summer from their 16-year highs.

It comes after the consumer prices index tumbled from 3.2pc to 2.3pc in April, its lowest level in nearly three years, after a record decline in energy prices.

However, money markets were spooked by strong services inflation, which is closely watched by the Bank of England and fell less than expected from 6pc to 5.9pc.

As a result, traders have pushed back their expectations for interest rate cuts from as early as June to as late as November - and are only pricing in one reduction this year.

Goldman Sachs and BNP Paribas had both predicted a first cut in borrowing costs in June but said this would now come in August.

Goldman analyst Sven Jari Stehn said this would ""provide two more rounds of inflation and labour market data, which we expect to show renewed inflation progress"".

In a note to clients, BNP Paribas said it was still forecasting three cuts this year from 5.25pc to 4.5pc, which it expects in August, September and November.

Thanks for joining us today. We'll be back in the morning. In the meantime, do click through to our election coverage here on the day Rishi Sunak called a general election.

The US Federal Reserve has just released minutes from its interest-rate decision body, the Federal Open Market Committee, for their meeting on April 30 to May 1.

They indicate that, despite disappointment over recent inflation readings, rate-setters still had faith price pressures would ease, if only slowly.

The minutes said:

While the policy response for now would ""involve maintaining"" the central bank's benchmark policy rate at its current level, the minutes also reflected discussion of possible further hikes. They say:

The minutes also reflected debate about just how restrictive current monetary policy is given the strength of the economy, an important discussion given the need for policy to be ""sufficiently"" restrictive to cool inflation.

Officials since that meeting have tamped down expectations for imminent interest rate cuts, which investors now see beginning in September.

But even as Fed officials acknowledged the risk of inflation pressures again building in the economy, they largely viewed the data from the start of the year as a temporary setback in the battle to return inflation to the central bank's 2pc target.

The European Space Agency said today that it has selected two companies to develop a vehicle to transport cargo to the International Space Station by 2028, in a move to ensure a European alternative to SpaceX.

The intergovernmental agency, which counts the UK as a member, has recently struggled to find rockets to launch its missions into space, and is following in the footsteps of Nasa by purchasing services from firms rather than developing them itself.

In November, the ESA launched a competition allocating up to €75m (£63.8m) to a maximum of three firms to build a vehicle to take cargo to the ISS and back.

Out of seven proposals, the ESA selected those from Franco-German The Exploration Company and Franco-Italian company Thales Alenia Space, each of which will receive €25m. A third contract award to a division of France's ArianeGroup may also occur, according to the FT, if a revised proposal can be agreed.

The contracts, which run until June 2026, will focus on developing the technology and structure of the vehicles.

European stocks closed at a one-week low today, hurt by a sell-off in carmakers following a report about possible Chinese tariffs on imported cars, while tech stocks ticked higher ahead of US-based Nvidia's results.

European automakers fell 1.4pc to a more than three-month low, with shares of Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Volkswagen falling between 0.7pc and 1.7pc.

China should raise its import tariffs on large gasoline-powered cars to 25pc, a car research body affiliated with the Chinese government told the Asian giant's Global Times newspaper, as the country faces sharply higher US car import duties and possibly additional duties to enter the European Union.

The European Commission launched an investigation in October into whether fully-electric cars manufactured in China were receiving unfair subsidies and warranted extra tariffs. The EU could impose provisional duties in July.

The Europe-wide STOXX 600 index dipped 0.3pc, also pressured by a tick up in sovereign bond yields after data showed UK inflation eased less than expected in April.

Tech stocks were a bright spot, up 0.6pc as investors awaited quarterly results from AI darling Nvidia this evening to gauge if the recent market rally could continue.

Wall Street's main indexes struggled for direction this afternoon as investors kept to the sidelines ahead of AI chip leader Nvidia's quarterly results and minutes of the Federal Reserve's policy meeting, both due this evening.

Eyes will be on whether semiconductor bellwether Nvidia's first-quarter results, due after markets close, can meet sky-high expectations and sustain the bumper gains the company's shares and other AI-related stocks recorded.

Nvidia has emerged as the third-largest US company by market value after a more-than 92pc surge in its shares this year after a large jump in 2023.

The company's shares were down 0.5pc today, after hitting a nearly two-month high on Tuesday.

Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth, said:

Wall Street's recent bull run has carried all three major indexes to record highs this month, driven by a strong earnings season as well as renewed hopes for interest-rate cuts and a so-called soft landing for the US economy.

Raspberry Pi has confirmed aims to list in London next month in a boost to the capital's flagging stock market.

The Cambridge-based firm - known for affordable credit card-sized computers designed to boost coding skills among children - has revealed plans to raise $40m (£31.4m) in new money as part of the initial public offering (IPO) on London's main market.

The IPO is a welcome victory for the London market, which has been hit by a swathe of UK-listed firms being bought out or defecting abroad.

Arm and fellow Raspberry Pi investor Lansdowne Partners have agreed to also buy $35m (£27.5 million) and $20m (£15.7 million) worth of shares respectively as part of the plans.

Raspberry Pi was founded by computer scientist Eben Upton in 2008, before releasing its first product in 2012.

It has since sold more than 60m of its single board computers alone.

It is a subsidiary of the Raspberry Pi Foundation - a UK charity founded when the company was set up in 2008, with the goal of promoting interest in computer science among young people.

As a major shareholder in Raspberry Pi, the foundation has received around $50m (£39.7 million) in dividends since 2013, which has been used to advance its educational mission globally, according to the group.

The FTSE 100 lost 0.6pc today. The top riser was M&S, up 5.2pc, followed by packaging group DS Smith, up 2.6pc. The biggest faller was miner Antofagasta, down 6.4pc, followed by fellow miner Glencore, down 3.4pc.

Meanwhile, the FTSE 250 dipped 0.3pc. The biggest riser was investment platform group IntegraFin, up 11pc, followed by pub operator Mitchells & Butler, up 10pc. The biggest faller was City firm Close Brothers, down 6.7pc, followed by Pets and Home, down 5.9pc.

Some of the steep US tariff increases on an array of Chinese imports, including electric vehicles and their batteries, computer chips and medical products, will take effect on August 1, US officials said on Wednesday.

President Joe Biden will keep tariffs put in place by his Republican predecessor Donald Trump while ratcheting up others, including a quadrupling of import duties on Chinese EVs to 100pc and a doubling of semiconductor duties to 50pc.

The Office of the United States Trade Representative, which advises the president on trade policy and conducts trade negotiations, is seeking comments on the effects of the proposed tariff increases on the US economy, including consumers, and on whether a proposed 25pc duty on medical masks, gloves and a planned 50pc tariff on syringes should be higher.

The United States imported nearly $640m (£503m) of gloves, masks and syringes last year from China that will be affected by the new measures.

The proposed Chinese tariff increases include ""products targeted by China for dominance, or are products in sectors where the United States has recently made significant investments.""

Washington is investing hundreds of billions of dollars in clean energy tax subsidies to develop American EV, solar and other new industries, and has said China's state-driven excess production capacity in these sectors threatens the viability of US companies. The tariffs are meant to protect American jobs from a feared flood of cheap Chinese imports.

Disney is selling its stake in an Indian pay-TV business to Tata, according to a report.

Bloomberg said the transaction valued the service, Tata Play, at about $1bn (£785m), according to stakes. Disney owns 29.8pc of the business.

It comes Disney pushes through a programme of cost cutting under chief executive Bob Iger, who has cut thousands of jobs as part of a plan to strip out $7.5bn of costs.

Disney and Tata have been approached for comment.

More than a dozen countries and some of the world's biggest tech firms pledged today to cooperate against the potential dangers of artificial intelligence, including its ability to dodge human control, as they wrapped up a global summit in Seoul.

AI safety was front and centre of the agenda at the two-day gathering. In the latest declaration, more than two dozen countries including the Britain, the United States and France agreed to work together against threats from cutting-edge AI, including ""severe risks"".

Such risks could include an AI system helping ""non-state actors in advancing the development, production, acquisition or use of chemical or biological weapons"", said a joint statement from the nations.

These dangers also include an AI model that could potentially ""evade human oversight, including through safeguard circumvention, manipulation and deception, or autonomous replication and adaptation"", they added.

The ministers' statement followed a commitment on Tuesday by some of the biggest AI companies, including ChatGPT maker OpenAI and Google DeepMind, to share how they assess the risks of their tech, including what is considered ""intolerable"".

The 16 tech firms also committed to not deploying a system where they cannot keep risks under those limits.

The Seoul summit, co-hosted by South Korea and Britain, was organised to build on the consensus reached at the inaugural AI safety summit last year.

Shares in clothing brand Lululemon took a hit this afternoon after it told investors that a key executive had resigned.

The maker of yoga pants told investors that it was ""implementing an updated and more integrated organisational structure, in conjunction with the departure of Sun Choe, chief product officer, who has resigned and will leave the company later this month to pursue another opportunity.""

Bloomberg reported that Ms Choe's departure adds to the ""wall of worry"" in the company's near term, according to a note by Raymond James analyst Rick Patel.

As traders fret over UK inflation falling less than expected from 3.2pc to 2.3pc, take a look at Lebanon's latest data, where the increase in consumer prices slowed from 70.357pc to 59.67pc in April.

Sales of previously occupied US homes sank last month, pushed down by high mortgage rates and rising prices.

Existing home sales fell 1.9pc to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.14m from a revised 4.2m in March, the National Association of Realtors said.

The average price of previously occupied homes rose 5.7pc to $407,600 -- the tenth straight increase and a record for April.

Lawrence Yun, the association's chief economist, called the sales drop ""a little frustrating.'' Economists had expected sales to come in at 4.2m.

The rate on the benchmark 30-year, fixed-rate loan has risen five of the last six weeks and stands at 7.02pc, up from 6.39pc a year ago.

Would-be homebuyers are also deterred by the high prices, caused partly by a tight inventory of available homes.

Interest rates will be cut in August, according to major investment banks, even after inflation came in higher than expected last month.

Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs and Paris-based BNP Paribas both said the Bank of England will still begin cutting borrowing costs this summer.

It comes after the consumer prices index tumbled from 3.2pc to 2.3pc in April, its lowest level in nearly three years, after a record decline in energy prices.

However, money markets were spooked by strong services inflation, which is closely watched by the Bank of England and fell less than expected from 6pc to 5.9pc.

As a result, traders have pushed back their expectations for interest rate cuts from as early as June to as late as November - and are only pricing in one reduction this year.

Goldman Sachs and BNP Paribas had both predicted a first cut in borrowing costs in June but said this would now come in August.

Goldman analyst Sven Jari Stehn said this would ""provide two more rounds of

inflation and labour market data, which we expect to show renewed inflation progress"".

Wall Street's main stock indexes were subdued at the opening bell ahead of AI chip leader Nvidia's quarterly results and the Federal Reserve's policy meeting minutes, released later in the day.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat at the open to 39,863.33.

The S&P 500 was also little changed at 5,319.28, while the Nasdaq Composite gained a fractional amount to 16,839.02.

Anglo American has rejected a ""final"" offer from Australian rival BHP which valued the miner at £38.6bn.

The board of the London-listed miner, which owns the De Beers diamond empire, said it was confident in the company's ""standalone future prospects"" as it shunned a third bid worth £29.34 per share.

BHP chief executive Mike Henry said the merger offered a ""compelling opportunity"", which would have given would Anglo American shareholders 17.8pc of a new combined venture.

Anglo American chairman Stuart Chambers said:

Conservative former Treasury minister Sir Robert Syms said the inflation statistics were ""unalloyed good news"" for the country.

He said: ""I think that should be rejoiced by everybody in this House, including people on the other side, who might actually end up in Government, inherit the benefit of some of the things that this government is doing. In truth I'm always a little surprised by, when good news comes along, how miserable the opposition gets.""

Treasury Minister Bim Afolami replied: ""I do disagree with him on one key measure, I must admit, which is the idea that they might inherit this because of course, we are not complete yet.

""We know that the economy still needs to continue to turn. We know that inflation needs to come down. We hope that that will lead in due course to falling interest rates as well, and for the measures that we put in place to come to fruition over the next parliament.""

Conservative former Treasury minister Richard Fuller said Mr Afolami was ""right to make the point that people are continuing to find economic difficulties at this time and that we need to stick with the Prime Minister's plan.

""Right to point out the terrible risks to the economy that the Labour Party's policies on labour markets and on taxes will do, and right to say that there have been external factors and that is different when you tackle external factors that are one offs from what your policies are, looking forward.""

The first crewed launch of Boeing's Starliner spacecraft to the International Space Station has again been delayed, according to Nasa, with no new date immediately set.

The US space agency said: ""The next possible launch opportunity is still being discussed.""

The postponement of the launch, which had been set for Saturday, marks the third delay this month for the highly anticipated mission.

It would allow Nasa to certify a second commercial vehicle to carry crews to the ISS, beyond Elon Musk's SpaceX.

Earlier this month, the Starliner launch was postponed just hours before liftoff, with the astronauts already strapped in, due to a separate technical issue.

Europe's most valuable company has been hit by its second fire in a week, this time at its headquarters in Denmark.

Novo Nordisk said production of its Ozempic and Wegovy durgs had not been affected by the blaze outside a building at its site in Bagsvaerd, which then spread to an adjacent office.

A spokesman said that extinguishing the fire ""is expected to last some hours"", with about 100 firefighters at the site.

It comes a week after a fire on the roof of a factory construction site in Kalundborg, where the company is spending more than $8bn (£6.3bn) to boost production.

The decline in inflation has nothing to do with the Government, Telegraph readers have said, after the consumer prices index dropped to its lowest level in nearly three years.

Dutch front-month futures, the continent's benchmark, rose as much as 4.4pc to more than €34 per megawatt hour.

The UK equivalent rose by as much as 4.5pc to more than 83p per therm.

It came as Austrian energy supplier OMV said an unidentified European company had won a court decision to obstruct its payments to Gazprom, potentially halting supplies.

Austrian regulators said it could lead to a ""short-term"" increase in prices.

The German economy is expected to have grown gently in the second quarter after a positive first three months of the year, the Bundesbank said.

The German central bank said in its monthly report that economic output ""is likely to increase slightly again"" during the period.

Europe's largest economy exceeded expectations in the first quarter, when it posted growth of 0.2pc.

The positive figures came as a relief after German output shrunk by 0.5pc in the last quarter of 2023 at the end of a difficult period of high inflation.

An improvement in the services sector was behind much of the rising German growth figures.

Businesses in the sector could see their ""recovery continue"", the Bundesbank said.

Oil prices have slumped towards their lowest level in three months amid signs of rising stockpiles in the US.

Brent crude, the international benchmark, has fallen 0.7pc towards $82 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate has dropped 0.7pc to near $78.

The American Petroleum Institute reported crude stockpiles rose by 2.5m barrels last week, according to Bloomberg.

Brent is around 7pc higher so far this year amid cuts to supply by the Opec+ cartel, but prices have cooled since mid-April.

US stock markets are on track to begin the day lower ahead of AI chip maker Nvidia's quarterly results and the Federal Reserve's policy meeting minutes due later in the day.

All eyes will be on semiconductor bellwether Nvidia's first-quarter results, due after market close. Analysts are keen to see if it can meet the market's sky-high expectations.

Nvidia has emerged as the third-largest US company by market value after a more than 92pc surge in its shares this year and an over three-fold jump in 2023.

The company's shares were down 0.5pc in premarket trading, after rising over 3pc over the past two days.

Market participants are also keenly awaiting minutes from the US central bank's latest policy meeting for more clarity on the timing of rate cuts.

In premarket trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.1pc, the S&P 500 was down 0.2pc, and the Nasdaq 100 had fallen 0.2pc.

Inter Milan have been taken over by US fund Oaktree after the Serie A champions' outgoing owners Suning missed a deadline to repay a €395m (£336.5m) debt.

Chinese conglomerate Suning have relinquished control of Inter to Oaktree three days after the team were officially crowned Italian champions for the 20th time.

The Culture Secretary has backed Ofcom after the regulator warned GB News that it could consider fining it or revoking its licence over recent impartiality breaches.

Lucy Frazer was grilled by MPs at the Culture, Media and Sport Committe about a recent finding by the broadcasting regulator, which found that the People's Forum: The Prime Minister broke impartiality rules.

The watchdog said it was starting the ""process for consideration of a statutory sanction against GB News"" following a ""serious and repeated breach"" of the rules and the hour-long programme where Rishi Sunak took questions from the audience.

Ms Frazer said: ""I think that Ofcom is doing its job in terms of making sure that the Broadcasting Code is complied with.""

When asked if the media regulator had been ""tolerant"" of GB News, Ms Frazer appeared to defend Ofcom saying that it has ""found various breaches"" of the channel.

""I would say Ofcom is doing its job,"" she added.

Ms Frazer also said the BBC ""has more work to do"" on impartiality.

She added: ""I do think the BBC has more work to do on impartiality and I think the BBC absolutely accepts that.""

James Smith, research director at the Resolution Foundation think tank, said:

In corporate news, Tesla sales slumped across Europe last month as governments reduced the subsidies offered to buyers of electric cars.

Tesla registrations in Britain fell by a quarter in April and have slumped 14pc in the first four months of the year.

The carmaker registered just 13,951 vehicles in April, the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association said, which was down by 2.3pc from last year and its worst total since January 2023.

It comes despite chief executive Elon Musk previously insisting that he expected the car maker's second quarter results would be ""a lot better"".

Germany and Sweden have been among the major economies to have ceased or reduced subsidies for electric vehicles in recent months, which has put a damper on Europe's sales growth.

Bond markets slumped after the latest official figures showed inflation remained higher than expected in Britian.

The yield on 10-year UK gilts - which moves inversely to its price - rose by more than nine basis points to 4.22pc, which was its highest level this month.

The coupon on two-year gilts, which are more sensitive to changes in interest rates - has jumped nearly 12 basis points to 4.4pc.

The pound has hit its highest level in two months against both the dollar and the euro as money markets indicated the first interest rate cut by the Bank of England could come as late as November.

Prior to the latest official figures, which showed persistent services inflation, traders had been betting on a 50pc chance of a rate cut in June.

Former Post Office boss Paula Vennells has apologised to subpostmasters and their families as she began giving evidence to the Horizon IT inquiry.

As inflation fell to 2.3pc, shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said:

Average UK house prices increased by 1.8pc in the 12 months to March, according to official figures.

The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said it lifted the average house price across the UK to £283,000.

It represented a recovery in pricing after house prices had fallen by 0.2pc in the 12 months to February.

Meanwhile, the ONS also revealed that UK private rents increased by 8.9pc in the 12 months to April, as house price inflation slowed slightly from 9.2pc growth in the year to March.

Away from today's inflation news, BT has been fined £2.8m by the industry watchdog after EE and Plusnet failed to provide clear and simple contract information to more than a million customers before they signed up.

Ofcom said that since June 2022, BT's EE and Plusnet businesses made more than 1.3m sales without providing customers with a contract summary and information documents, which affected at least 1.1m customers.

This meant that BT broke the regulator's consumer protection rules, which came into effect in 2022 and are designed to ensure customers get clear, comparable information about the services they are considering buying.

Ofcom said the fine ""reflects the seriousness of this breach"".

Ofcom brought in the rules in June 2022 and said BT had assured it that the group was confident the deadline would be met.

But the watchdog said its investigation found that, from January 2022, BT was aware that some of its sales would not meet the deadline. Ofcom said:

A BT spokesman said: ""We're sorry that some of our pre-contract information and contract summary documents were not available to some of our customers in a timely manner. We apologise for any inconvenience caused and have taken steps to proactively contact affected customers and arrange for them to receive the information and be refunded where applicable.""

People do still feel worse off than a few years ago, Jeremy Hunt has acknowledged.

Speaking to ITV's Good Morning Britain, the Chancellor said:

Ministers have called for the Bank of England to cut interest rates as inflation fell to its lowest level in nearly three years.

Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg, the former Tory business secretary, said the Bank of England should have already cut interest rates, which stand at 16-year highs of 5.25pc.

Sir Jacob said: ""Interest rates ought to have been cut already as inflation is a lagging indicator.""

Mark Francois, a Tory former minister, said the Bank of England should now ""actively consider"" cutting the interest rate.

Jeremy Hunt said it was ""nothing to do with me"" when asked if he personally felt wealthier following the cost-of-living crisis.

Asked by BBC Radio 4's Today programme if he felt wealthier, the Chancellor said:

He pointed to cost-of-living support the Government had offered, adding: ""The result of those difficult decisions, and they were difficult because in the end we had to put up taxes for those decisions, but the result is living standards have gone up since Rishi Sunak became Prime Minister.""

In a testy exchange, Mr Hunt could earlier be heard to insist ""me too"" when host Emma Barnett said she was interested in people's household finances.

Although traders have reacted strongly to the latest inflation figures, many economists still think summer interest rate cuts remain a possibility.

Suren Thiru, ICAEW economics director, said: ""Lingering concerns over underlying inflationary pressures mean a June rate cut is unlikely.

""However, these figures may convince more rate setters to vote to ease policy, providing a signal that a summer rate cut is still possible.""

Julian Jessop, economics fellow at the Institute of Economic Affairs think tank, said he believed a rate cut in June is ""still in play"".

Stepping away from inflation for a moment, Marks & Spencer has revealed a better-than-expected surge in annual profits as its turnaround pays off.

The retail bellwether reported a 58pc rise in underlying pre-tax profits to £716.4m for the year to March 30.

It notched up an 11.3pc jump in like-for-like food sales over the year, with growth of 5.2pc across its clothing and home arm.

The group said it was upping its cost-cutting target by another £100m to £500m by 2027-28 as it looks to offset rising staff wages.

The company said: ""With continuing cost headwinds, notably from investment in colleague pay, the structural cost programme is critical to our profit progression.""

It said it was in the ""strongest financial health since 1997"" and was confident of making ""further progress"" over the financial year ahead.

Its shares were last up 8.7pc - leading gains on the FTSE 100.

Stock markets have slipped after inflation fell by less than expected, delivering a blow to hopes of a June interest rate cut.

The benchmark FTSE 100 index fell 0.6pc, while the pound strengthened against the dollar and touched a two-month high at $1.275.

The mid-cap FTSE 250 dropped 0.4pc.

It comes as markets are now pegging a mere 16pc chance of a June rate cut by the Bank of England, a dip from the nearly 60pc that was priced in last week.

Despite UK inflation edging closer to the Bank of England's target, its slowdown fell short of expectations, with services inflation proving to be persistent.

Markets also have Nvidia's quarterly results on the radar that is due later in the day, and could spark a $200bn swing in the AI-darling's shares.

In corporate news, Marks & Spencer jumped 8.7pc to the top of the FTSE 100 after the retailer reported a 58pc rise in annual profit, which was ahead of market expectations.

SSE fell 2.3pc after the power generator and network operator posted a lower annual adjusted operating profit.

Responding to the inflation figures, Rishi Sunak told reporters:

There is still ""much more to be done"" to drive down inflation, Labour's Darren Jones has said, pointing to energy measures which could prevent inflationary spikes in the UK in future.

The shadow Treasury minister acknowledged inflation had ""come down a bit"" when speaking to Sky News, but said this was ""largely driven by a drop in the energy price cap"".

He added: ""Core inflation is still around 3.6pc to 3.9pc, which is hotter than the markets were expecting it to be. This is not out of the woods yet. It is in the right direction but there is still much more to be done.""

Mr Jones pointed to Labour's ""securonomics"" agenda, which includes measures to build ""homegrown, secure, renewable energy"".

The shadow minister said:

UK stock markets declined at the open as inflation fell by less than expected at the start of the year.

The FTSE 100 began the day by falling 0.6pc to 8,363.02 while the midcap FTSE 250 was down 0.4pc to 20,701.53.

Hopes of a summer interest rate cut have been dashed for mortgage holders after inflation fell less than expected last month.

The consumer prices index tumbled from 3.2pc to 2.3pc in April - its lowest level in nearly three years - after a record decline in energy prices.

Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said the sharp decline indicated that ""brighter days are ahead"" but economists had expected inflation to drop to 2.1pc.

As a result, traders have pushed back their expectations for interest rate cuts from as early as June to as late as November.

They are also only pricing in one interest rate cut this year, compared to two before the latest inflation figures were published.

Services inflation, a critical indicator for Bank of England policymakers, dipped slightly from 6pc in March to 5.9pc in April in a blow to hopes for early rate cuts.

The figure was higher than forecasts of a drop to 5.4pc, driven by more volatile aspects of the sector, such as hotels and live music.

Core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, fell from 4.2pc to 3.9pc, which was higher than predictions of a drop to 3.6pc.

The weaker than expected decline in inflation was another example of inflation figures ""developing a nasty habit of coming in hot"", according to analysts.

Rob Morgan, chief investment analyst at Charles Stanley, said

Public borrowing has overshot forecasts in April, leaving Jeremy Hunt with less room to cut taxes this year in a pre-election giveaway.

The deficit stood at £20.5bn in April, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).

This is £1.2bn more than the £19.3bn forecast just two months ago by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the government's tax and spending watchdog.

Public borrowing in the tax year ending in March has also been revised higher by £0.8bn to £121.4bn, outpacing forecasts by the Government's spending watchdog by £7.3bn.

The figures are a blow to Conservative Party's prospects of narrowing a 27-point poll gap with Labour by wooing voters with further reductions in national insurance.

While public sector receipts from income like taxation was £1.6bn higher in April than a year earlier, spending has grown at nearly twice the pace at £3.1bn.

Alex Kerr at Capital Economics said: ""The Chancellor will be disappointed that April's figures do not provide more scope for tax cuts at a fiscal event later this year.

""Moreover, we expect slower wage growth to dampen tax receipts growth later this year. And the rise in market interest rates since March's Budget alone suggests he may have even less fiscal headroom (perhaps about £6.5bn) for tax cuts than the £8.9bn left over in March.""

Rob Wood, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, added: ""The headroom to cut taxes doesn't exist, but Chancellor Hunt seems likely to go ahead anyway.""

It comes after inflation figures for April were higher than expected, pushing back market expectations of the first interest rate cut.

The sharp decline in inflation takes the consumer prices index closer to the Bank of England's 2pc target but may not be enough to trigger an early interest rate cut by its Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), according to economists.

Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, said:

Other economists also signalled their disappointment with the figures:

The pound has risen after the sharp decline in inflation was still higher than analysts had expected.

Sterling rose 0.3pc against the dollar to $1.275 - its highest level since March - after the consumer prices index dropped to 2.3pc in April, which was higher than forecasts of a fall to 2.1pc.

The pound was up 0.2pc against the euro, which is worth a little over 85p.

Inflation is ""back to normal"" and ""brighter days are ahead"", Rishi Sunak has said in response to the latest figures.

The Prime Minister said:

The Office for National Statistics has also published borrowing figures this morning, showing that the Government borrowed £20.5bn last month, which was higher than official forecasts.

The dramatic fall in inflation was mainly driven by the lowering of the Ofgem price cap in April, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).

It meant that average household energy bills fell by £238 a year to £1,690 following the shock caused by Vladimir Putin's decision to invade Ukraine.

The ONS said prices of electricity, gas and other fuels fell by 27.1pc in the year to April, the largest fall on record.

Gas prices fell by 37.5pc on the year, compared with a fall of 26.5pc in the year to March 2024, while electricity prices fell by 21pc, compared with 13pc in March.

Inflation has fallen less than expected, official figures show, in a blow for the Prime Minister and mortgage holders.

The consumer prices index dropped in April from 3.2pc to 2.3pc following a record decline in typical energy bills last month, according to the Office for National Statistics.

The drop takes the pace of price growth to its lowest level since July 2021 but it was far short of analyst expectations of a plunge to 2.1pc.

The higher-than-expected reading could derail hopes for a summer cut to interest rates, which would provide relief to mortgage holders grappling with the highest borrowing costs in 16 years.

It is also a blow to Rishi Sunak, who has said he only wants to call a general election when people ""feel that things are improving"".

Derivatives trades on money markets had indicated the Bank of England would reduce borrowing costs twice by the end of the year from 16-year highs of 5.25pc to 4.75pc.

Traders had priced in a first cut by August and more than a 50pc chance of a first cut in June.

Thanks for joining me. We begin the day with the economic news that has been keenly anticipated by mortgage holders and the Prime Minister.

Inflation fell to 2.3pc in April, according to the Office for National Statistics, raising hopes that interest rate cuts will not be far away.

""Distribution grid investments should increase from an average €33bn to €67bn per year from 2025 to 2050, roughly 20% of what the EU spent on fossil fuel imports in 2023,"" Eurelectric's 'Grids for Speed' study said.

""Getting the grid up to speed will create more than two million jobs, bring greater energy savings and deliver more reliable power supply, while accelerating the decarbonisation of Europe's economy,"" it said.

Eurelectic said good planning could ultimately reduce the EU-wide investment bill of €67bn to €55bn.

""Failure to achieve such investments would jeopardise 74% of prospective connections in key decarbonisation technologies such as electric vehicles, heat pumps and renewables,"" according to the study.

The study suggests Ireland will need to spend €1.1bn a year on its grid from 2030 -- a comparatively large amount in terms of population compared with many other EU countries.

The investment bill compares with €1bn for Greece, Portugal's €800m, Germany's €17.7bn, France's €5.4bn, and the €10.1bn annual investment bill for Italy, according to Eurelectric.

It said France, Germany, and Italy represent 50% of the total required investment for all EU countries through to 2050, which ""is higher than their share of energy consumption, but similar to their GDP"". However, ""investment per capita, is highest in Norway, Denmark and the Netherlands"", according to the report.

Like many EU countries, electricity demand is expected to rise in Ireland from the construction and transport sectors after 2030, but demand from industry is forecast to level off. Total demand for electricity in Ireland, like elsewhere in Europe, is expected to rise sharply through 2050.

Power output from renewable sources, including wind and solar, will increase sharply in Ireland and in other EU countries from 2030, according to the study.

""Futureproofing the grid also depends on the supply chain's capability to scale. Even if the necessary investments are met, current shortages of copper, a talent deficit, extended manufacturing lead times and transformers' costs can hamper infrastructure development,"" Eurelectric said.

""Such bottlenecks must be rapidly addressed through strategic planning, enhanced collaboration between European policymakers and industries as well as new training initiatives to streamline education certificates and ensure a skilled workforce,"" according to the business group.

""Eurelectric calls on policymakers both at national and regional level to secure grid investments, strengthen supply chains and unleash the societal benefits of Grids for Speed,"" it said.",irishexaminer.com,news,Irish Examiner,Eamon Quinn,0.1372549019607843,454094665,4,https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/8253/4126747_3_articlelarge_Power_20Station_20in_20Raffeen_2c_20Cork_2c_20Ireland-2.jpg,eng-9590105

Prime Minister Rishi Sunak today finally put paid to months of speculation by announcing a general election on July 4.

In his speech in Downing Street, a drenched Sunak put his government's economic record at the heart of his message and said that ""only a Conservative government led by me will not put our hard-earned economic stability at risk"".

However, the announcement came on the same day that new data showed inflation had fallen less than expected, dealing a blow to hopes of an early interest rate cut that might have provided a lift for his Conservative party, currently languishing some 21 points behind Labour in the FT's opinion poll tracker.

""The arguments for July are all negative,"" writes UK chief political commentator Robert Shrimsley, suggesting that a surprise election announcement was Sunak's last card. Most ministers had been kept in the dark about his plan to call the poll.

The mood in Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer's office was said to be ""cool, calm and collected"" with the prospect of returning to power for the first time since 2010, representing a remarkable turnaround since the party's drubbing in the 2019 general election.

Chancellor Jeremy Hunt had earlier celebrated the news that inflation had dropped from 3.2 per cent to 2.3 per cent in April as another sign that the UK economy had ""turned a corner"".

The fall, however, was less than expected, leading traders to pare back their bets on the timing and scale of interest rate cuts. Services inflation -- which the Bank of England is watching closely as it gauges when to lower the cost of borrowing -- also overshot expectations.

So far at least, the electorate remains unconvinced that the economy is on the mend, writes political editor George Parker, in large part because the better economic data is failing to pass through to household budgets.

Consumer confidence across the UK has not yet returned to pre-pandemic levels, suggesting that the public is still feeling the effects of the cost of living crisis, a pattern echoed across other rich countries.

The IMF yesterday warned Hunt against further tax cuts, saying that the ""government faces pressing service delivery and investment needs"" in its annual health check on the British economy.

The FT editorial board welcomed the election announcement as an end to uncertainty and drift. ""There is a widespread acceptance that Britain has not been working as it should. This election must provide an opportunity to start putting it right,"" it said.

The oil and gas industry lobby group Australian Energy Producers made the claim, reported in the Australian, pointing to a study carried out by global energy analysts Wood Mackenzie.

AEP's chief executive, Samantha McCulloch, said Australia could become ""a decarbonisation powerhouse"" if governments smoothed the way with favourable policies and more cash handouts to the industry.

But the analysis the statements were based on, and reported uncritically, relied on some heroic assumptions about the size and scale of a future carbon capture and storage (CCS) industry that should come with heavy doses of scepticism.

The statements were based on non-peer reviewed research from Wood Mackenzie and published in AEP's annual journal.

But before we get into that, we should note one thing.

When the Australian reported that ""Australia could generate nearly $600bn in revenue"", what we are actually referring to is revenue for the organisations proposing carbon capture and storage projects. Right now, that's mostly oil and gas companies.

There is clear vested interest here. If fossil fuel companies want to be able to keep selling their product as the world lowers emissions, then pushing carbon capture and storage allows them to continue to sell their oil, gas and coal and then make a return on capturing and storing the waste.

The ""nearly $600bn"" figure was based on Wood Mackenzie's estimate that Australia has enough capacity in depleted oil and gas fields and saline aquifers to store about 9.8bn tonnes of CO2. The analysis then assumed carbon storage projects could get between US$33-39 a tonne of CO2.

So 9.8bn tonnes multiplied by 39 gives an estimate of US$385bn (or $577bn in Aussie dollars).

Wood Mackenzie analyst Stephanie Chiang, who wrote the report, told Temperature Check the revenue figure was ""based on our internal CCS cost model"".

But what should really stop us in our tracks is the gigantic scale of the CO2 storage the headline figure is based on - 9.8bn tonnes.

Right now, there is only one CCS project actually working in Australia (the much-troubled Gorgon CCS plant) and one more under construction (Santos's Moomba project).

According to the government and industry funded research organisation CO2 CRC, there are a further 16 projects being proposed.

If all 18 were up and running by 2030 (forgetting the sizeable engineering and cost challenges carbon capture and storage projects have faced in recent years), this would mean Australian projects could store 33m tonnes of CO2 each year.

If you ran all of those 18 projects continually, it would take almost 300 years to capture 9.8bn tonnes. Even with a dramatic upscaling of capacity, that suggests the ""almost $600bn"" in revenue would take an awfully long time to accrue.

But the Wood Mackenzie analysis also suggests the Australian taxpayer should stump up about $550m to help the industry build three CCS hubs.

That would be added to the estimated $1.3bn of taxpayer cash already given to CCS research and projects since 2003.

Not mentioned in the AEP media release or in the reporting in the Australian was that the Wood Mackenzie analysis also said it ""may be difficult [for Australia] to compete on distance and cost"" when it comes to CCS. Why?

Because according to the research, in a scenario where emitters in Japan and South Korea were looking to transport and store captured CO2, it would cost about US$87 a tonne of CO2 to use an Australian project compared with US$66 to send it to carbon storage projects in Malaysia or Indonesia.

The analysis said: ""This is significant, especially when Japanese and South Korean emitters, such as from the power generation and steel production sectors, would already be facing capture costs of over US$90/tCO2.""

Chiang said: ""But of course, not all CO2 emissions may be captured and not all may be stored in Australia.""

Matthias Raab, chief executive of CO2 CRC, said: ""I don't think that in 10 years' time we will have a $600bn industry. That's too fast. But I do think we have to be open enough as an industry because CCS will take up a larger and larger proportion of our emissions reduction [in the future].""

Political scientist Bjørn Lomborg wrote a column in the Australian last week that attacked solar and wind power and batteries as being too expensive, unreliable and environmentally damaging.

The same column has been running in outlets around the world - from Die Welt in Germany and the New York Post, to outlets in South Africa, Brazil and Malaysia and elsewhere - since early April.

""Despite us constantly being told that solar and wind are now the cheapest forms of electricity,"" wrote Lomborg, ""governments around the world needed to spend $US1.8 trillion on the green transition last year.""

But the BloombergNEF report that Lomborg has referenced for this $1.8tn figure is not solely government spending but, according to a Bloomberg spokesperson, is ""investment from all sources, not just government money. The vast majority will be private sector financing and consumer purchases"".

The spokesperson said the figure should not be characterised as a price tag, but was rather money spent on projects that were ""sufficiently economically viable"" to secure investment.

A spokesperson added: ""It is also worth noting that the $1.8tn number is inclusive of electric vehicles, heat pumps, grid, CCS, hydrogen and other sectors as well - not just wind and solar.""

Lomborg attacked solar and wind for being intermittent, and said if Germany suffered a five-day wind drought in winter ""when solar contributes very little"" then the country would need batteries to back up the grid ""for a minimum of 120 hours"".

Except, what Lomborg does not say is that Germany, to the south of his own native Denmark, is not relying on batteries alone to store electricity from renewables, or to keep its electricity supply reliable as it decarbonises.

The German government last year outlined its strategy for storing renewable energy, pointing to 30 existing pumped hydro facilities with the same power capacity as the country's batteries, most of which (by capacity) are in homes.

But Germany is also building gas plants to sit on standby, and can import electricity from other countries.

Lomborg also complained the cost of recycling ""spent wind turbine blades and exhausted solar panels"" was never considered and that ""thousands of enormous blades"" were overflowing a small Texas town and, in Africa, solar panels and batteries were being dumped.

While it's true there are concerns about the waste streams from renewables, it's also true the industry and governments around the world are working on recycling options.

Columbia Law School's Sabin Center for Climate Change Law has produced a report ""rebutting 33 false claims about solar, wind and electric vehicles"".

That report points to research suggesting that unless recycling options are scaled up, by 2040 there will be about 61m tonnes of solar panel waste and 14m tonnes of turbine blades.

But how does that compare with other waste streams? Research in the journal Nature Physics last year suggested that without decarbonisation, the planet would produce about 45,550m tonnes of coal ash and 70,350m tonnes of municipal waste by the year 2050.

The researchers from the US government's National Renewable Energy Research Laboratory wrote that ""we globally produce and manage approximately the same mass of coal ash per month as the amount of PV module waste we expect to produce over the next 35 years.""

""Compared another way, globally we will generate up to 440-1,300 times more mass of municipal waste than PV module waste by 2050.""",theguardian.com,news,The Guardian,Graham Readfearn,0.1607843137254903,454086698,10,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/533fe36a1db162a55357b19567fe542ea377bcfe/0_170_4796_2876/master/4796.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&s=7d0fb3e455d0f3a1dbaecf0f75a24175,eng-9587835

This new agreement builds on an existing commitment by Microsoft to buy 2.67 million tonnes from Asnæs Power Station, bringing the total purchase under contract to 3.67 million tonnes of CO.

As part of the 'Ørsted Kalundborg CO Hub', Ørsted will establish carbon capture at its wood chip-fired Asnæs Power Station in Kalundborg in western Zealand and at the Avedøre Power Station's straw-fired boiler in the Greater Copenhagen area. The 430,000 tonnes per year of biogenic CO from the combined heat and power plants will be shipped to a storage reservoir in the Norwegian part of the North Sea and stored permanently. The 'Ørsted Kalundborg COHub' is set to become operational by the beginning of 2026.

The new agreement between Ørsted and Microsoft entails that Microsoft will take one million tonnes of carbon removal from the straw-fired unit at Avedøre Power Station starting from 2026. The combined heat and power plant converts locally sourced straw, which is a by-product of agriculture, into electricity and district heating. By capturing the biogenic carbon from biomass-fired combined heat and power plants and storing it underground, it is possible to not only reduce, but also remove CO from the atmosphere, as biogenic carbon from sustainable biomass is part of a natural biogenic carbon cycle. Thereby, you create negative emissions.

The collaboration between Ørsted and Microsoft will play a vital role in developing the 'Ørsted Kalundborg CO Hub', as bioenergy-based carbon capture and storage is still in its early stages. Even though the project was awarded a subsidy from the Danish Energy Agency, the revenue from the sale of carbon removal certificates was included before investment decision and then in the offer submitted through the Danish subsidy scheme, which put great emphasis on competitive offers with the lowest amount of subsidy per tonne.

According to the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) latest report, carbon removal technologies such as BECCS are crucial for limiting global warming. This underscores the importance of projects such as the 'Ørsted Kalundborg CO Hub', which can support companies like Microsoft in achieving its sustainability goals and contribute to achieving the global climate targets.

Ole Thomsen, Senior Vice President and Head of Ørsted's Bioenergy business, says: ""This expanded collaboration with Microsoft is a testament to our shared vision for a sustainable future. By combining Ørsted's expertise in bioenergy carbon capture and storage with Microsoft's commitment to reducing its carbon footprint, we're showcasing how strategic relations can accelerate the transition to a greener economy.""

For Microsoft, the agreement represents another large-scale carbon removal deal towards the company's aspiration to be carbon-negative in 2030.

Brian Marrs, Senior Director of Energy & Carbon Removals at Microsoft, says: ""We're proud once again to announce a landmark offtake agreement with Ørsted, which is pioneering responsible carbon removal development in Denmark while also meeting the needs of a decarbonised energy system. The urgency around climate goals means translating great planning into rapid action - and Ørsted remains a valuable collaborator in bringing big ideas to life. Today's announcement is yet another tangible step towards building the technologies and commercial capabilities towards becoming carbon-negative by 2030.""

Wind power was Britain's largest single source of electricity this winter, with onshore and offshore wind turbines supplying 20 per cent more electricity than gas-fired power plants between last October and March this year, according to a new study published today.

Over the six months between October last year and March 2024, the UK's fleet of wind turbines supplied more electricity than any other power source, the first time they have done so for two consecutive quarters, according to the Imperial College London report.

During the first quarter of this year alone, wind provided 33 per cent of the UK's power mix, just ahead of gas on 28.8 per cent, while imports provided almost 15 per cent, biomass almost seven per cent, and solar 2.5 per cent. Coal provided just 1.4 per cent of electricity between January and March this year.

The researchers also said that, when taking into account further data for this April, wind power on average provided more power than gas over the past year, marking a new milestone for the technology. While gas power supplied the most electricity in the UK between April and October last year, it was lower than the amount provided by wind turbines during the following six months through to April 2024.

Wind also provided more than 70 per cent of UK power demand for the first time on one day in late January, boosted by strong winds in the North Sea, while the first quarter also saw the highest ever share of electricity from clean sources at over 95 per cent on 23 March.

However, nuclear capacity and output fell slightly during the first quarter of this year, and as a result nuclear's share of the UK electricity mix fell to its lowest level since 1965 at just 10.4 per cent, the report shows.

The findings form part of the latest instalment of a quarterly Electric Insights by academics at Imperial College London, commissioned by energy company Drax.

The report includes a league table of the world's 30 largest countries that emit more than 200 million tones of CO2 per year, which places the UK at the top spot for slashing its carbon emissions 52 per cent since the country's emissions peaked in 1971.

That places the UK ahead of any other major country in terms decarbonisation measured against each nation's emissions peak. France sits in second place after cutting its CO2 emissions by almost 45 per cent, while Germany is the only other nation to have achieved emissions reductions of over 40 per cent.

According to the report, a number of other countries have achieved similar or greater internal emissions reductions than the UK, but this is largely due to faltering economies, boundary and population changes, or in the case of Denmark - which has slashed its carbon emissions by more than 60 per cent - being a far smaller nation with a large clean energy sector.

Ukraine's emissions have fallen 81 per cent since the 1970s, , but its population has since fallen by around seven million since becoming independent from the USSR, and it has also more recently been forced to contend with a devastating war with neighbouring Russia.

North Korea and Venezuela have slashed their CO2 emissions by 76 per cent and 61 per cent respectively, but both countries have suffered severe economic crises which have led to significantly reduced economic and industrial activity, the report points out.

Countries' emissions are typically measured against a 1990 baseline as this was when the UN's climate negotiations were established. However, the academics behind today's report said they wanted to construct a ""fairer comparison"" that accounted for the fact that individual country's carbon emissions peaked at different times.

The US, for example, has failed to slash its CO2 emissions at all compared to 1990, but this masks the fact that they have in fact fallen by 18 per cent since their peak in 2005.

Even so, taking this ""fairer"" approach the UK still continued to lead the world on decarbonisation, said the report's lead author Dr Iain Staffell at Imperial College London.

""With governments across the world committed to tackling climate change, it is vital we have a way to track their progress that is both accurate and fair,"" he said. ""By looking at when emissions from a country peaked, we have a fairer way of assessing how seriously countries are taking their commitments to reduce carbon emissions. This will be especially important when looking at the growing Asian economies such as China, India, and Indonesia.""

Staffell argued the UK remained a global leader on decarbonisation even when taking into account the UK's consumption based emissions, which includes emissions generated abroad associated with products and services imported into Britain.

Today's report shows the UK still remains in the top three worldwide for decarbonisation on this measure, with the UK's consumption emissions having fallen by 32 per cent since their 1990 peak, putting the nation just behind Russia and Spain.

""No other major economy has cut its carbon emissions faster than the UK, which is a real achievement,"" said Staffell. ""A large part of the progress made here has been phasing out coal-fired power stations and investing in renewables. However, even with the last remaining coal plant closing in the UK later this year, we will still need to find new ways to meet our 2050 net zero ambitions.""

These hostages represent over 17 nationalities, including five Americans as well as citizens from Argentina, Austria, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Colombia, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Serbia, Spain, Thailand, and the United Kingdom.

Last month, these nations released a joint statement calling for the immediate release of these hostages. But Hamas continues to stall. And given the global geopolitical context, what is Yahya Sinwar's motivation for meeting their demands?

After spending last week in Israel witnessing firsthand the devastation of Oct. 7 and the lasting effects of the ongoing hostage crisis, it is difficult to grasp how U.S. foreign policy is being conducted on this issue.

With each day that passes, the likelihood for the return of these loved ones to their families diminishes. While the vast majority of Americans stand in solidarity with the families who are suffering, the Biden administration's actions to date suggest that securing the release of American victims of Hamas is not a policy priority, which only emboldens Sinwar's position.

What can our leaders do to affect the release of these hostages? The answer is quite simple: Support Israel and pressure Hamas.

First, President Biden should acknowledge his responsibility to the American citizens who are being held hostage. They should be at the top of his policy priority list, not buried in the ninth point of a ten-point White House briefing on policy toward the Middle East, as we saw on May 13.

Second, Biden's actions must align with that priority. The hostages are Sinwar's leverage to survive Israel's justified response to a huge terrorist massacre against civilians. U.S. actions and statements that give Sinwar confidence he may survive, even without giving up hostages, guarantee that Hamas will keep holding our hostages. Why would Sinwar give up his leverage if our own president is willing to help him achieve his objective via unilateral pressure on Israel?

With American hostages as his first responsibility, Biden must unequivocally stand by Israel, not criticize, hamper, and marginalize its effort to bring home all the hostages. Most recently, the U.S. paused the shipment of over 3,500 bombs to Israel and threatened sanctions against a unit of the Israel Defense Force. Public opposition to a campaign to eliminate Hamas infrastructure in Rafah gives Sinwar all the hope he needs to hold out longer.

A clear-eyed view of why Israel is pushing into Rafah and the continuous work they have undertaken to minimize the humanitarian impact of the conflict should be articulated by the Biden Administration. Indeed, the Israeli military has expended tremendous energy coordinating the clearance of hundreds of aid trucks per day, restoring water and electricity across parts of Gaza, only to experience one letdown after another due to Sinwar's bad-faith negotiations.

The latitude for Hamas' disingenuous behavior in negotiations has been fueled by wavering support and open condemnation of Israel by its greatest ally, the United States. President Biden and his Administration have placed election politics and a poor interpretation of the extreme left flank of their party above their responsibility to American citizens. As a result, Sinwar feels emboldened. At the same time, one also must consider the role of social media apps like TikTok whose algorithm is disproportionally propagating messages of support for Palestinians and Hamas and spreading antisemitic disinformation about Israel. The propaganda arm of the CCP continues to weaken societal bonds while promoting false narratives.

Let us never forget that Hamas is a brutal terrorist organization, not a legitimate negotiating partner. A group that tortured and massacred women and children in the most brutal ways possible will never negotiate in good faith.

One viable path for Israel to free the hostages is to maximize pressure on Sinwar by going into Rafah and conducting its operation to eradicate Hamas. Tightening the noose around Sinwar and forcing him back to the negotiating table showed signs of success earlier this week.

Biden needs to look in the mirror and remember who he serves. Americans have been taken hostage by a terror organization during an unprovoked invasion of an allied nation. His job is not an easy one -- it requires courage and moral conviction and clarity, something Barack Obama has publicly asserted as a defining reason for his support of Biden.

Biden must commit himself and his administration to bringing home and returning American hostages to their families by standing by Israel instead of undermining it. The alternative is to keep playing both sides of the issue for political purposes, allowing American hostages to die in Hamas's custody.",thehill.com,news,The Hill,,0.0117647058823529,454073714,1,https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/654ae44867ba39.69604492.jpeg?strip=1&w=640,

It will give users hands-on experience with producing sustainable fuels for ocean-going cargo ships, aircraft, trucks, and heavy industry.

The education and research facility will be located in GreenLab, which houses the world's first green and circular industrial park. Here, DTU and other Danish universities are engaged in developing and demonstrating methods for solving some of the climate challenges faced by Denmark and the rest of the world.

""Getting access to a physical training and research facility in Power-to-X is s a game-changer for both our students and researchers. The facility enables us to create an attractive education and research environment in Skive, where we can equip the engineers of tomorrow to meet global challenges in the green transition. It means that we can help educate more engineers for the whole of Denmark,"" says DTU Senior Vice President Carsten Orth Gaarn-Larsen.

From black to green transport

The education and research facility consists of an advanced electrolysis module from Green Hydrogen Systems, which develops and manufactures electrolysis facilities (electrolysers).

In GreenLab, the electrolysis facility will function in an interaction between electricity generated by wind and solar energy as well as batteries and be a mini version of the future facilities located in Denmark and the rest of the world.

Green fuels like Power-to-X will, in fact, play a significant role in constructing a 100 per cent renewable energy system in the future. The technology can be used to convert electricity from sun and wind into hydrogen or hydrogen-based substances such as ammonia, methanol, and methane.

""Our new Power-to-X facility for testing and training gives DTU's researchers and students a unique opportunity to gain practical hydrogen production experience. Green hydrogen is a key prerequisite for converting heavy transport from black to green, and, at GreenLab, we're proud to be the place where you can gain hands-on experience in new green technologies by testing them in practice,"" says Ebbe Kruse Vestergaard, Research Director at GreenLab.

An important piece in understanding energy systems

Although Power-to-X technology is not new, it is an innovation to integrate the technology in an energy system in a smart approach to up-scaling and cost-effectiveness. With the electrolysis facility in GreenLab, students and researchers can collect data and, among other activities, test how flexible the electrolysis facility is and what the relationship is between electricity, heat, and hydrogen production. This knowledge can be used to find answers to a number of questions, including how best to design and control an electrolysis facility, and how the interaction is between the individual energy system elements.

It is an important piece of the puzzle in understanding our overall energy system. The plant in GreenLab will also supplement DTU's energy laboratory PowerLabDK. Here, students and researchers can use Power-to-X facilities to test how best to link the different parts of the energy system. Jacob Østergaard, Professor at DTU Wind, explains:

""We don't have a sufficient understanding of the Power-to-X technology and its properties. It's therefore essential that we learn more about how an electrolysis facility works as an integrated part of an energy system. Today, we analyse the future energy system based on models of different types of facilities. These models are completely dependent on the data you feed into them. And there are actually only a few of them which are based on realistic facilities with real verified data, making in crucial to have access to a facility like the one in GreenLab.""

Great potential for DTU's students

Søren Linderoth, Head of Department at DTU Energy, also sees great potential in the education and research facility. For example, he envisions that it can be included in the digital education Bachelor of Technology programme, where students work with Power-to-X as a recurring theme.

Another obvious option is a continuing education programme, a so-called flexible Master's programme with focus on Power-to-X. This study programme originates from a wish from the industry and has been composed and prepared by an advisory committee under Danish Center for Energy Storage (DaCES), where DTU collaborates with Aalborg University, Aarhus University, the University of Southern Denmark and companies like Topsoe and Vestas, says Søren Linderoth:

""It will be very exciting if DTU's students are given the opportunity to see, measure, and analyse data, and perhaps even be allowed to change parameters for the functioning facility. Finally, in the short term, we will also have a much higher proportion of part-time MSc graduates who may be able to benefit from using the facility. This could, for example, be in connection with the Master of Science (MSc) programme Sustainable Energy Technology, where it will be both useful and rewarding for the MSc students to test theories and experiments in practice.""

This new agreement builds on an existing commitment by Microsoft to buy 2.67 million tonnes from Asnæs Power Station, bringing the total purchase under contract to 3.67 million tonnes of CO.

As part of the 'Ørsted Kalundborg CO Hub', Ørsted will establish carbon capture at its wood chip-fired Asnæs Power Station in Kalundborg in western Zealand and at the Avedøre Power Station's straw-fired boiler in the Greater Copenhagen area. The 430,000 tonnes per year of biogenic CO from the combined heat and power plants will be shipped to a storage reservoir in the Norwegian part of the North Sea and stored permanently. The 'Ørsted Kalundborg CO Hub' is set to become operational by the beginning of 2026.

The new agreement between Ørsted and Microsoft entails that Microsoft will take one million tonnes of carbon removal from the straw-fired unit at Avedøre Power Station starting from 2026. The combined heat and power plant converts locally sourced straw, which is a by-product of agriculture, into electricity and district heating. By capturing the biogenic carbon from biomass-fired combined heat and power plants and storing it underground, it is possible to not only reduce, but also remove CO from the atmosphere, as biogenic carbon from sustainable biomass is part of a natural biogenic carbon cycle. Thereby, you create negative emissions.

The collaboration between Ørsted and Microsoft will play a vital role in developing the 'Ørsted Kalundborg CO Hub', as bioenergy-based carbon capture and storage is still in its early stages. Even though the project was awarded a subsidy from the Danish Energy Agency, the revenue from the sale of carbon removal certificates was included before investment decision and then in the offer submitted through the Danish subsidy scheme, which put great emphasis on competitive offers with the lowest amount of subsidy per tonne.

According to the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) latest report, carbon removal technologies such as BECCS are crucial for limiting global warming. This underscores the importance of projects such as the 'Ørsted Kalundborg CO Hub', which can support companies like Microsoft in achieving its sustainability goals and contribute to achieving the global climate targets.

Ole Thomsen, Senior Vice President and Head of Ørsted's Bioenergy business, says: ""This expanded collaboration with Microsoft is a testament to our shared vision for a sustainable future. By combining Ørsted's expertise in bioenergy carbon capture and storage with Microsoft's commitment to reducing its carbon footprint, we're showcasing how strategic relations can accelerate the transition to a greener economy.""

For Microsoft, the agreement represents another large-scale carbon removal deal towards the company's aspiration to be carbon-negative in 2030.

Brian Marrs, Senior Director of Energy & Carbon Removals at Microsoft, says: ""We're proud once again to announce a landmark offtake agreement with Ørsted, which is pioneering responsible carbon removal development in Denmark while also meeting the needs of a decarbonised energy system. The urgency around climate goals means translating great planning into rapid action - and Ørsted remains a valuable collaborator in bringing big ideas to life. Today's announcement is yet another tangible step towards building the technologies and commercial capabilities towards becoming carbon-negative by 2030.""

There are several refrigerator market trends which steadily helps to drive the refrigerator market growth and also the refrigerator market demand simultaneously. The demand for smart refrigerators has increased significantly as a result of advancements in home appliance technology. Kitchens are the major producers of food waste and the second largest consumers of electricity in the home. The producers thus improvise to enhance refrigerators by fusing them with smart technologies including Wi-Fi connectivity, monitoring capabilities, built-in hubs and displays, compatibility with smart homes, interior cameras, and the app interface. For instance, companies such as Samsung, LG, GE, and Bosch have integrated Alexa, in-built cameras, and InstaView screens into their products, allowing customers to use refrigerator for different purposes and to peek inside refrigerators without entirely opening them. Moreover, the manufacturers have developed app interfaces, such as the SmartHQ app from GE Appliances, the ThinQ app from LG, the Home Connect app from Bosch, and the Samsung Smart Things app from Samsung, that enable customers quickly monitor the temperature and receive relevant notification alerts. Thus, these factors are significantly driving the refrigerator market share during the forecast period.

The regulations and norms regarding the environment and product quality constantly change, which could be detrimental to the expansion of the refrigerator business. Moreover, outside of the U.S., many countries carefully regulate and manage production-related pollution brought on by the activities involved in making electronic devices such as refrigerators, while they loosely monitor and control environmental degradation issues. Furthermore, additional regulations are put in place for refrigerator manufacturers in order to reduce any negative environmental effects related to production when these companies grow their businesses in emerging countries. For instance, nations such as China, South Korea, and India all have laws governing electronic waste, and these countries increasingly regulate hazardous substances that are toxic in nature. The introduction of tighter energy efficiency standards for refrigerators by the regulating authorities may impede the expansion of the refrigerator market. Producers make greater investments in their processes of production to accomplish these standards, which could increase the cost of production. In addition, producers may increase the cost of their freezers to cover these extra costs, which would ultimately affect customer demand. Furthermore, the increased costs of the products may make it more difficult for certain people to afford or justify buying a new refrigerator, thereby delaying the expansion of the refrigerator market. The expansion of laws and regulations is anticipated to hinder the market for refrigerators in the years to come.

Microgrids are containerised electricity generation and distribution systems for small and remote communities which are difficult or expensive to reach with conventional transmission networks.

Eskom's distribution division launched one of its first microgrids in Swartkopdam in the Northern Cape in July 2023. The deployable system provides complete off-grid electricity to 39 households that previously had no power.

Eskom explained that microgrids provided an effective, reliable, and easily deployable solution for electrifying geographically challenging areas.

""The electricity networks around the area are constrained and practically impossible to extend and connect the area,"" Eskom said.

It had considered a conventional solution to connect Swartkopdam to the national grid by building a 200km 132kV line from Gordonia substation and establishing a substation at Noenieput.

This would have carried an estimated cost of R250 million, or R6.41 million per household. ""This option was considered extremely expensive and was, therefore, not pursued,"" Eskom said.

""The microgrid with battery energy storage capability developed by Eskom Research, Testing, and Development was considered the most suitable solution,"" the utility said.

The Swartkopdam site consists of two containerised microgrids -- one with 32kWp and a second with 60kWp solar PV capacity -- capable of supporting 64kWh or 120kWh of power.

The rollout of the Swartkopdam system followed two pilot projects at Lynedoch in the Western Cape and Ficksburg in the Free State.

Eskom told Engineering News that the high solar irradiation in these areas offered an average of 10 hours of sunlight per day, sufficient to keep battery levels high enough to meet demand 24/7.

According to Eskom group executive for distribution Mondle Bala, these three projects were just the first of many more microgrids to be rolled out by the end of Eskom's last financial year,

""The deployment of the microgrids at Swartkopdam serves as a proof of concept for installing microgrids in remote areas that are difficult to reach or expensive to electrify through conventional means of electrification.""

""Eskom plans to roll out about 100 microgrids across the country by the end of March 2024 as part of the Distribution business strategy,"" Bala said in July 2023.

""We will continue to close the gap of energy poverty by giving everyone a life-changing experience of having electricity.""

MyBroadband asked Eskom for a progress update on the microgrid rollout, but despite more than a week of follow-ups, the utility had not responded to our queries.

The microgrids form part of Eskom's Just Energy Transition (JET) projects, as they also contribute to reducing carbon emissions by relying on renewable power.

It is interesting to note that JET was one of the key focus areas of former Eskom CEO André de Ruyter, who left the utility about four months before the completion of the microgrid in Swartkopdam.

Eskom has also been coy about the cost of the microgrids, but these are presumed to be substantially less costly than expanding transmission capacity to reach targeted communities.

The cost is being carried with a part of the $11.6 billion (R210.35 billion) in funding from developed countries, including Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Norway, the United Kingdom and the United States, to help Eskom transition away from fossil fuel-based generation.",mybroadband.co.za,news,MyBroadband,Hanno Labuschagne,0.0980392156862746,454065808,10,https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Swartkopdam-Eskom.jpg,eng-9586607

This article is part of the Guardian's Euro 2024 Experts' Network, a cooperation between some of the best media organisations from the 24 countries who qualified.

Son of famed Georgian keeper David, young Giorgi started out at the nation's top side, Dinamo Tbilisi, but in four years didn't make a single appearance. Stuck as fourth choice he was then sent off on loan, first to Rustavi where he let in four on his debut, then to Lokomotiv Tbilisi, where he let in another four in his first game. So it hasn't been an easy ride - but his warrior attitude, 1.96m frame and raw talent saw him through. Some solid Europa League displays for Lokomotiv caught the eye, including against Spain's Granada, when Valencia's scouts took notice. Signed by them in 2021 as third choice, he took full advantage when injuries gave him a first-team chance. Today's he's a €35m-rated prospect linked with Premier League clubs.

As a boy Loria fancied himself as a forward, encouraged by his faithful, ever-present dad at matches and training. But a coach saw things differently, put him in goal, and the rest is history. Loria worked his way up to the country's top side, Dinamo Tbilisi, spending 11 successful years there, before setting off on a nine-year career journey through Cyprus, Russia, Germany and back again. Today, despite his veteran status, he's still a regular for Dinamo and the national side. He is rated as a penalty-saving specialist, and always looks to the sky after a save to thank God and his father, who died several years ago. He's also not afraid of getting stuck in, and was sent off, as a substitute, for his part in the playoff final's mass brawl with Greece.

The 25-year-old Gugeshashvili is already playing for his sixth club, and not without success - Qarabag totally dominate in Azerbaijan, and almost knocked Bayer Leverkusen out of the Europa League back in March. His journey to this point began with his first overseas move, from Dinamo Tbilisi to Jagiellonia Białystok in Poland, at the age of just 16, in 2016. He is now firmly established at Qarabag, and will be a reliable back-up for Georgia this summer. His surname is hard to pronounce, so, as a favour to overseas commentators, he sometimes gives them an alternative. During a loan spell at Recreativo Granada in Spain, instead of having his surname on his shirt, he went with Rachveli - meaning a representative of his native region, Racha.

A proper leader, on and off the pitch. In 2017, Kashia, then playing in the Netherlands for Vitesse, wore a rainbow armband to support the nation's Coming Out Day - resulting in a far-right violent protest outside the Georgia FA's headquarters. Georgia fans, media and politicians backed his stance, and, the following year, after Uefa gave him the #EqualGame award, he said: ""I believe in equality for everyone, no matter what you believe in, who you love or who you are ... I will always keep defending equality and equal rights for everyone, wherever I play."" In December 2018, he received the Presidential Order of Excellence from Giorgi Margvelashvili. He also earned applause in the qualification semi-final against Luxembourg when Georgia's former captain Jaba Kankava came on. Kankava hadn't played since 2020 - so Kashia handed over his captain's armband.

Sazonov's mother is Georgian, his father Russia, and he had a dual-nationality upbringing, spending time living in both countries, speaking two languages. When he opted to play for the Georgian Under-21s, then the senior side, some Russian media branded him a traitor. His dad hit back: ""Saba is no traitor! He has two homelands and he simply chose the one of his parents' homelands. I do not see anything criminal in this."" Sazonov was named in the overall best XI after the 2023 Under-21 Euros, and was recognised as the nation's outstanding young talent at the Georgia FA awards that year. He couldn't get to the ceremony due to commitments with Torino, whom he joined from Dynamo Moscow last year - so his mum and dad received it on his behalf.

Kakabadze's uncle Zurab was a well-known handball player in Georgia who went on to become president of the nation's Handball Association - but little Otar was having none of it, much preferring football, whatever his uncle said. ""In my street nobody played handball,"" he said. ""We all just kicked the ball between two stones."" He was a forward back then, scoring freely, and as he grew began to excel down the right and left flanks. But the coach of Georgia's Under-17 side, Vasil Maisuradze, spotted his potential to operate from the back instead, and the switch paid off. A hugely potent attacking threat from right-back, he has played club football in Spain, Switzerland and Denmark, and moved to Poland with Cracovia in 2021.

After spending 12 years at the highest level in Russia and Ukraine, earning interest from Premier League clubs, Solomon ""Saba"" Kvirkvelia left Metalist 1925 Kharkiv in 2022 following the Russian invasion. As a two-time Georgian player of the year his next move raised eyebrows: he opted to return to his homeland and join Gagra, a displaced team from Abkhazia who play in Tbilisi due to the ongoing Russia occupation of their region. He offered to play for them for free, and to help develop their young players too. After a spell there he made a move to Neftchi of Azerbaijan - then landed a lucrative contract with his current side in Saudi Arabia, where he has tested his skills against Ronaldo. A valued member of the squad this summer.

After an outstanding display in the Under-17 Euros in 2013, 18-year-old Dvali was signed by Reading from Latvian club Skonto, but problems with his visa meant he never made a breakthrough in England. He was loaned back to Skonto, then to Turkey's Kasimpasa, managed by Georgian legend Shota Arveladze. After that came moves to German, Polish, Russian and Hungarian clubs before he arrived at Apoel in Cyprus in 2022. His form there has been good, earning him his spot in this summer's squad; key qualities include strength, experience and a handy habit of scoring goals. He converted his penalty in the playoff final shootout win over Greece. When he's happy he likes to express his joy with a Georgian dance. One to watch.

Lochoshvili played so well in the 2017 Under-19 Euros that he earned a five-year deal at Dinamo Kyiv, but, partly due to three big injuries inside one year, he failed to break through in Ukraine. He then spent time back with his first club Dinamo Tbilisi and with Slovak club Zilina before making a big move to Austria with Wolfsberger, which proved to be the springboard to Serie A and Cremonese. He made headlines at Wolfsberger in 2022 when he helped save the life of Austrian player Georg Teigl who was left unconscious after a serious on-field collision, and had swallowed his tongue. Lochoshvili's instinctive intervention earned him a Fifa Fair Play award, and the Dignity Cross from the Carinthia state governor.

One game changed everything for Gocholeishvili. A previously little-known player at Saburtalo Tbilisi, he didn't make many waves, or command much attention, until he stepped out for Georgia's Under-21s against England on 16 November 2021. His sparkling all-round display peaked when, in the 65th minute, he dribbled through the defence at high speed and scored the decisive third goal - later named by the Georgia FA as goal of the year. Scouts and agents took interest and last year he moved to Ukraine with Shakhtar on a five-year deal. In his first Champions League game, against Barcelona in November 2023, he again stood out and assisted the only goal - earning a place in the Champions League Team of the Week.

A multiple title-winning left-back: not bad for a 22-year-old. He has already played for four teams in his short career, becoming a champion at all of them: Dinamo Tbilisi and Dinamo Batumi in Georgia, Red Star Belgrade in Serbia, and now at Shakhtar in Ukraine. The Montenegrin forward Stefan Denkovic, who played at Batumi with Azarovi, told Serbia's MozzartSport: ""Azarovi is the best left-back I've played with in my career. And not only that, he's probably one of the best in that role I've seen in football. He has incredible technique, speed and sharp movements."" Azarovi was named Georgia's best young player in 2021; his future looks bright.

Lobzhanidze was laser-focused on football from the age of four, training with older children, and with his father in the street, always dedicated to honing ""my dribbling and my shooting ... I like those kind of skills"". It paid off: from Dinamo Tbilisi he moved to Randers in Denmark in 2017, then spent three years in Turkey before last year's big move to the MLS with Atlanta. Off-field hobbies include getting tattoos - current ones include an angel, Thor's hammer, his birth year and a lightning bolt - and watching NBA. ""For me, Kobe Bryant is the GOAT. I grew up watching Kobe. Now my favourite player is Jayson Tatum."" In November last year, at Atlanta's stadium, he asked his girlfriend, actor Sali Keratishvili, to marry him. She said yes.

Once dubbed ""the Georgian Messi"". He was a proper prodigy as a youngster, joining top-flight Tbilisi Lokomotiv at the age of 15 and scoring 22 goals in two seasons from the wing. In 2015, aged 17, he moved to Shakhtar Donetsk under Romanian manager Mircea Lucescu and the future looked bright - but when Lucescu left a year later, the new coach, Paulo Fonseca, left him out of the first-team set-up. Despite impressing in the Uefa Youth League, earning the Messi tag, his career has not gone smoothly since: an unsuccessful move to Nacional in Portugal followed by loans in Turkey and Russia, then a return to his homeland, first on loan at Samtredia, then a permanent move in 2022 to Torpedo Kutaisi. He has done well there, though, and Kutaisi's manager, the former Blackburn coach Steve Keane, still tips him for big things. ""If I ever go to a Premier League team, the first thing I'll do is take Arabidze with me.""

Son of the well-known Georgia player Vasil, Shengelia says he always felt destined to become a professional. His dad did everything to make it happen, moving his son from Kutaisi to train in Tbilisi, and spending every spare minute putting him through his paces. Results were rapid: Shengelia soon became an outstanding performer on Dinamo Tbilisi's left-wing, and, after two free-scoring years, he chose to continue his career abroad, first in Turkey, then Belgium, and now with Panetolikos in Greece. He made a huge contribution to Georgia qualifying for this summer's tournament only to suffer a serious-looking leg injury in the decisive playoff match against Greece. Via some intense rehabilitation, he proved himself fit enough to make the cut.

Tsitaishvili's father Klimenti was the youngest player in the history of the Georgian championships - making his top-flight debut at just 14. Giorgi was born in 2000 in Israel, where his father played, but he grew up in Kyiv and went on to play on the wing for Ukraine at every youth level - including scoring the winner against South Korea in the last minute of the 2019 Under-20 World Cup final. But when the time came to choose a senior national team he told the media: ""I promised my grandfather that I would only play for the national team of my ancestors' homeland - Georgia."" At club level, following the Russian invasion he moved to Poland's Wisla Krakow on loan, then to Lech Poznan, and, last year, to Georgia with Dinamo Batumi.

The most talented of three footballing brothers, Kiteishvili's senior career started on loan from Dinamo Tbilisi to his hometown club Metalurgi Rustavi, where life as a pro wasn't quite how he imagined it would be: the club had no money for salaries, and a training ground with no electricity or running water. But he rose above it. Impressive displays there earned him a shot at Dinamo's first team when he returned, and he took it, growing into the side's most impressive talent and captain, and twice winning Georgia's young player of the year, in 2015 and 2016. He moved to Austria with Sturm Graz in 2018, becoming one of several players branded ""the Georgian Messi"" by the press. An experienced creative talent.

A talented teenager who could make an impact this summer. Sigua played at all youth levels for Georgia, was named the nation's top young prospect in 2021, and made his senior Dinamo Tbilisi debut in 2022 aged 17. His displays earned him a five-year deal at Swiss club Basel last year. Injuries and changes of manager have hampered his progress there, but the future still looks bright. He made his international senior debut in March last year in a 6-1 win over Mongolia, and the Georgia manager, Willy Sagnol, made a flattering comparison. ""He's similar to Leon Goretzka in his style: very busy on the field, hardworking and excellent for his age. He will show what he can do.""

27-year-old Altunashvili is a solid, sharp-shooting pick for the squad, having twice been named the best midfielder in the Georgian top-flight. The fact that he has so far only won a handful of caps is mainly down to the quality of competition in midfield. He made his first move to a foreign club last year when he joined Austria's Wolfsberger, and spoke recently about how it felt to qualify with Georgia for this summer's tournament. ""It's actually hard to put into words how much this means to us as players but also as citizens. Georgians are crazy about football."" One thing he is particularly looking forward to in the group stage: ""It will of course be extremely exciting if Ronaldo actually plays against us. But I have to admit, my absolute favourite is Messi.""

Gagnidze has had a dizzying rise: moving up from Dinamo Tbilisi's academy into the first-team at 17, being named Georgia's best young player, and earning a move to Russian giants Dynamo Moscow at the end of season - having also represented his country at every age group. His potential still seems huge. In 2022 he joined Poland's Rakow Czestochowa on loan. Asked by a journalist whether he preferred eating Polish borscht or Russian buckwheat, Gagnidze replied: ""I have issues around buckwheat. As a child I dropped a pot of buckwheat and got a burn on my arm. So I don't like it anymore. You could say that I have a conflict with buckwheat.""

Kochorashvili played only two matches - 44 minutes on the field in total - in the Georgian top-flight with Saburtalo before leaving the country. He first moved on loan to Spanish club Girona, then made a permanent switch to Levante in 2019. Via a loan spell with Castellón he has since established himself as a solid ball-winner and creative influence - and he stood out in the playoffs for Georgia before this summer's tournament. He scored from the spot in the shootout against Greece in the final - and when Georgia won, he was the only player who stood still in the centre of the field, wide-eyed, not quite believing what had just happened.

Chakvetadze was born in Tbilisi into a family of refugees from Abkhazia, and took his first steps in football with Norchi Dinamoeli before entering Dynamo's academy. His talent was obvious and, after a fine display at the 2017 Under-19 Euros, he was a target for a host of top clubs. He moved first to Gent in Belgium, then to Watford, initially on loan, in 2023. At Gent he was given the number 7 shirt, his favourite number because of his hero, Cristiano Ronaldo. There is a photo of Chakvetadze as a boy staring wide-eyed at Ronaldo at the opening of the Dynamo academy in 2013; 11 years later he is set to come face to face with him again, this time on the pitch.

Spurred on by his grandfather's passion, Mekvabishvili's all-energy displays as a boy were spotted in a youth tournament by a Dinamo Tbilisi coach, who invited him to try out at the club. That coach was Suliko Davitashvili, father of Zuriko, who now lines up in the same Georgia squad this summer as Mekvabishvili. In his early days at the academy Mekvabishvili was played at right-back, then tried at centre-back, before being moved up into defensive midfield, where he excelled. He made his way into Dinamo's first team in that position, then moved to Romania with Universitatea Craiova earlier this year. Away from football he is a huge basketball fan.

An outstanding veteran, the nation's second-most capped player, and twice Georgian player of the year. He made his name in Ukraine in eight years with Dnipro, becoming their captain - with his last appearance before a €1.5m move to French club Reims being in their dramatic 3-2 Europa League final defeat to Sevilla in 2015. He was also remembered at Dnipro for helping save Dynamo Kyiv captain Oleg Gusev who swallowed his tongue during a collision; Kankava cleared Gusev's airway, ending up with bleeding fingers after being accidentally bitten. On 21 March this year, after a three-year absence from the national team, Kankava made an emotional return against Luxembourg, and was handed the captain's armband by Guram Kashia.

Nikoloz ""Nika"" Kvekveskiri was born in the Gali district of Abkhazia in Georgia's north. When he was a year-and-a-half old Russia occupied the territory, so his family fled to a refugee settlement in Zugdidi. He grew up there in tough conditions, but, aged five, developed a stubborn determination to play football, always seen dragging a huge bag with him to training. He remembers those who helped him along the way - including once when a bus driver refused to take him home because he was too muddy, and a driver of another bus told him: ""Hey kid, put something down to cover the seat and sit in my bus, I'm leaving soon."" In the years since he has built a title-winning career in Georgia, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and now Poland, and has amassed more than 50 senior Georgia appearances, but no goals. Apart from, of course, one important one: the final, winning penalty in the playoff shootout final with Greece.

When the young attacking midfielder made his debut on loan at Telavi from Dinamo Tbilisi, Moistsrapishvili quickly caught the eye - and his progress in Dinamo's first-team when he returned earned links with several big clubs. A loan spell to Beveren in Belgium last year proved a let-down, though: he played just nine times before the move was terminated in March this year. He has shown enough raw talent, though, to earn himself a spot in this summer's squad, and could be one to keep an eye on if he's given a chance. He has played at Under-19 and Under-21 level, and performed well in the 2023 Under-21 Euros.

Only 23, Davitashvili has already played for eight clubs - starting in Georgia with Dinamo Tbilisi before finding his way to France, via Russia. Always highly-rated, he appeared on several lists of emerging prodigies as a youngster, but has struggled to settle down so far. However his four-year deal at Bordeaux, and his solid form to date, suggests that may have changed. His father Suliko played for clubs including Meranil Tbilisi, where one of his teammates was Badri Kvaratskhelia - whose son Khvicha joins Suliko's boy in this summer's squad. Suliko was known as ""Abreza"", meaning ""short gun"", in honour of his lack of height (5ft 4in) and his lethal finishing.

""Kvaradona"" comes from a big footballing family - not just players but also two Fifa referees and one Uefa Media Officer (the author of these profiles). His grandfather Mamiya was a star for Skuri Tsalenjikha and the master of bicycle kicks; his dad Badri was a multiple title-winner in Georgia and Azerbaijan; and Khvicha himself won Serie A's best player in 2022-23, and Georgia's sportsman of the year for 2024. And none of that could have happened but for his mum Maka taking him training in all weathers while Badri was coaching abroad. Khvicha's little brother, 14-year-old Tornike, is also tipped for success. Kvaratskheliais inspirational too: before the playoff victory he gathered the younger players in the dressing room and told them: ""Boys, we are young, but there are some veterans in our team ... For them this chance is the last one to play in a major tournament ... Let's play for them, let's play for our country and win this match!"" And some key trivia: Kvaratskhelia is one of the country's biggest family names, dating back to when Georgia's best cows were the cows of Kvaratskhelia. After occupation by the USSR in 1921, though, private farms were abolished, and the famous cows disappeared.

Zivzivadze started out at Dinamo Tbilisi, spending four years there mainly stuck in the reserves, despite scoring 47 goals in 50 matches one season, and 23 goals in 21 the next. It took him loan spells in Georgia and Denmark to earn a first-team chance at Dinamo, returning there on loan from Esbjerg, where he scored 28 in all competitions. But the move did not become permanent: he set off again via Torpedo Kutaisi and three clubs in Hungary to end up in Germany's second-tier with Karlsruher. His form there, and scoring instinct, make him a favourite for Willy Sagnol - and two goals in the playoff semi-final win over Luxembourg showed why.

When Georgia's FA, and a vocal media campaign, finally convinced the France-born Mikautadze to choose them as his national side in 2021, his mother wrote an open letter. ""Thank you very much for your support. This is very important for Giorgi and he is proud of the fact that you and your colleagues, relatives, friends and the whole of Georgia are with him."" Giorgi himself said: ""Willy Sagnol called me and we talked. He told me that he has been watching me for some time and likes my game, it made me happy. The whole family is with me. I've dreamed of defending the honour of my country's national team since I was a boy."" He joined Ajax from Metz for a reported €16m last year, but failed to make a real impact. He has recovered his form back on loan at Metz, though. So much so that a string of top clubs have been linked.

As a boy at the Dana Cup, one of the world's biggest youth tournaments, Kvilitaia scored a goal in every game, but Danish scouts didn't think he had enough about him to offer further trials. Instead he continued developing back in Georgia's second-tier with the now-defunct Sasco Tbilisi. At 19 he became the first second-tier player recruited by a foreign club when he moved to Hungary with Gyor. In 2015 he joined Georgia's top club, Dinamo Tbilisi, scoring a goal a game in a prolific season, before moving to Rapid in Austria, Gent in Belgium and Anorthosis in Cyprus. He joined current club Apoel in 2021, becoming captain and producing consistent displays. Now, aged 30, he brings a wealth of experience to this summer's squad.",turkish-football.com,news,Turkish Football,Emre Sarigul,0.3176470588235294,454064941,7,,

Strong Q1 // Odal shortfall covered by warranties Topic: Cloudberry reported strong Q1 figures despite production shortfalls at the Odal wind farm (covered by warranties). A final investment decision for its transformative 175MW PV park in Denmark is expected until the end of the year. Q1 consolidated revenues grew by 89% yoy to NOK 129m, largely in line with our estimates thanks to the strongly increased production volumes of 173GWh (+93% yoy). This should, above all, be carried by the Danish wind portfolio Odin (106MW net to Cloudberry), which was bought at the beginning of June 2023. While the average power price decreased yoy from NOK 118/MWh to NOK 73/MW/h it is largely in line with Q4 price levels of NOK 76/MWh. Q1 consolidated EBTDA jumped by 190% yoy to NOK 58m. This was despite a significant shortfall from the Odal wind farm (reported as income/loss from associated companies) due to severe operational issues (EBITDA decreased from NOK 29m to only NOK 7m). To recap, Odal wind farm uses blades from Siemens Gamesa, which announced severe issues with multiple series. Hence, only 50-60% of the Odal turbines were operational in Q1. The related production shortfall is to be covered by warranties. The claim at the end of Q1 (so far not booked) amounted to EUR 14-17m. With additional stand stills following a blade braking off in Q2, claims should further increase. The Subby windfarm in Sweden was successfully erected ahead of time and has begun generating electricity. Under standard weather assumptions Sundby is seen to produce 89 GWh per annum yielding annual revenues of c. NOK 56m by assuming an avg. power price of c. NOK 640/MWh. Pipeline remains strong. The two projects under construction are progressing according to plan and cost. The 19 MW Munkhyttan wind farm should be erected by the end of the year 2024 and the 8 MW hydro power plant Ovre Kvemma is built and is expected to be connected to the grid in the following weeks. Due to the recent significant price deflation of solar panels, Cloudberry is speeding up development of the planned 175MW PV plant in Denmark. The final investment decision is expected still this year. The total backlog stands at 911 MW. Cloudberry remains a BUY with an unchanged NOK 19 PT based on SOTP - change of analyst -

We have all heard at some point that spinach has much more iron than other vegetables. And perhaps you are also familiar with the famous idea that this is due to a misplaced comma in a work on the amounts of this nutrient in vegetables published in 1870 by Emil Wolff.

Interestingly, Popeye was created because of that mistaken belief and contributed to spinach consumption increasing by a third in the United States. They are myths upon myths, proof that sometimes what we know ""all our lives"" rests on feet of clay.

Wolff's study, which was accepted as good until the 1930s, contained an error in a table, but this affected equally all the foods for which he reported their nutritional value. Thus, the history of the decimal point is a simplification from 1981 that reinterprets other errors when dealing with a few data.

For his part, Popeye did not start eating spinach until 1932, three years after the comic's creation. But not because of iron but because of vitamin A, the same one that was later used - this time deliberately - in the carrot myth.

By then, spinach consumption had already increased because the iron fallacy had become popular, although many children continued to ""suffer"" from a diet rich in spinach thanks to the recommendations of the strict vegetarian sailor.

Another example of a rocky decision based on tenuous data concerns a belief that has an entire industry regulated by law: that frozen foods should be kept at -18°C or colder.

Why precisely this temperature? It would be expected that, as a result of scientific studies or experience in the sector. After all, if this were not the case and a few degrees up or down mattered little, why is it set so rigidly?

First of all, Microbiology tells us that the microorganisms that spoil food stop their growth when cold. But as was demonstrated years ago, keeping products at -12 °C is enough for bacterial growth and activity to stop.

Another scientific discipline, nutrition, explains that some vitamins remain stable at -18 °C for a year, but others can degrade significantly even at -60 °C after a few months without a few degrees above or below changing much. the result.

So, why was the temperature of -18 °C chosen as a reference to achieve the necessary food safety? According to a recent study signed by the director general of the International Institute of Refrigeration (an independent intergovernmental organization that gathers scientific and technical evidence on cooling) and five co-authors, it appears that it was selected in the mid-20th century because within the temperatures considered safe it corresponds precisely at 0 degrees Fahrenheit.

So it would have been a case of easy-to-remember rounding. Engineers would have picked up the gauntlet, routinely designing equipment and processes based on that mythical 0°F temperature, and legislation would have done the rest.

However, if we introduce Ecology into our narrative, we could consider that refrigeration involves heating the sink to which the removed heat goes, which is the environment, as well as consuming energy resources to do so. Although Engineering constantly increases the efficiency of equipment, there are insurmountable physical limits.

All energy consumption translates into an impact on the environment that, today, can very frequently be measured in carbon footprint. But what if it didn't need to cool so much? Would it be possible to keep frozen foods safely at a higher temperature and, in the process, reduce energy consumption? The answer seems to be yes, and it is proposed that it be with the reference of -15 °C so that, in the event of a problem, it takes time to reach the still safe (microbiologically) limit of -12 °C.

The aforementioned report shows that this simple measure would mean almost a 5% reduction in what is consumed to maintain the cold chain at the current temperature. We would save 25 terawatt hours (TWh) per year (one terawatt hour is equivalent to the annual electricity consumption of 150,000 people living in the EU), equivalent to 10 million tons (Mt) of greenhouse gases, or what three million cars, as many as circulate in all of Denmark. It would, therefore, be another reasonable step on the path that takes us in the direction of reducing the human footprint on the environment.

Living sustainably costs, but it will cost more to do so in an unsustainable way. The more the different branches of science help each other to dismantle legends, the sooner we will achieve the objectives of sustainable development that are more necessary than ever.

How 2 debunked accounts of sexual violence on Oct. 7 fueled a global dispute over Israel-Hamas war

JERUSALEM (AP) -- The United Nations and other organizations have presented credible evidence that Hamas militants committed sexual assault during their Oct. 7 attack in southern Israel. But some accounts from that day proved untrue. Two testimonies by volunteers with the Israeli search and rescue organization ZAKA, have been debunked. Still, they have helped fuel a global clash over whether sexual violence occurred during the attack, and on what scale. Some allege the accounts of sexual assault were purposely concocted. ZAKA officials and others dispute that. Regardless, AP's examination of ZAKA's handling of the now-debunked stories shows how information can be clouded and distorted in the chaos of the conflict.

Iran's supreme leader presides over funeral for president and others killed in helicopter crash

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- Iran's supreme leader has presided over a funeral for the country's late president, foreign minister and others killed in a helicopter crash. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei began the service Wednesday at Tehran University. The caskets of the eight killed will then be taken on a procession through downtown Tehran to Freedom Square, where President Ebrahim Raisi gave speeches in the past. Iran's theocracy declared five days of mourning after Sunday's crash and encouraged people to attend the public mourning sessions. Typically, government employees and schoolchildren attend such events en masse, while others take part out of patriotism or to witness historic events. For Iran's Shiite theocracy, mass demonstrations have been crucial for demonstrating the legitimacy of their leadership.

From London to Los Angeles, many Iranians overseas cheer, and fear, after president's death

LONDON (AP) -- Among Iranian communities from London to Los Angeles, few tears are being shed over the death of President Ebrahim Raisi. He killed in a weekend helicopter crash. But there are not always loud cheers, either. Some hope the demise of a powerful figure in Iran's authoritarian Islamic government may bring change. Others fear it could result in more repression. Videos have shown some people celebrating outside Iranian diplomatic missions. But some Iranians abroad are still reluctant to give reporters their names for fear of reprisals. U.K.-based women's rights campaigner Maryam Namazie says ""it's a better world"" without Raisi. But she added that others would take his place.

Russian attacks on Ukraine power grid touch Kyiv with blackouts ahead of peak demand

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) -- Sustained Russian attacks on Ukraine's power grid in recent weeks have forced leaders of the war-ravaged country to institute nationwide rolling blackouts. Without adequate air defenses to counter assaults and allow for repairs, though, the shortages could still worsen as need spikes in late summer and next winter. The airstrikes targeting the grid have brought blackouts to the capital, Kyiv, which hadn't experienced them since the first year of the war. During a trip to a destroyed power facility Tuesday, Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko said there are no quick fixes to the electricity shortages and that Ukraine is appealing to its Western allies for more air defense systems and spare parts to fix its Soviet-era plants.

Accounting for 3 to 4% of the EU's total CO2 emissions, or over 144 million tonnes of CO2 in 2019 alone, the sector has faced increasing pressure to transition towards more sustainable practices. However, recent initiatives within the framework of Interreg projects are showcasing promising strides towards greener maritime transport.

The EfficientFlow Project: Revolutionizing Port Operations

In the Baltic Sea, the ports of Gävle in Sweden and Rauma in Finland have spearheaded a transformative approach to maritime traffic management. Through the EU co-financed Interreg project 'EfficientFlow,' these ports have introduced innovative systems aimed at reducing emissions and enhancing operational efficiency.

At the heart of the 'EfficientFlow' project lies the Port Activity App, a digital tool designed to streamline port operations by enabling real-time updates of ship schedules. This technology facilitates better coordination of port calls, ultimately reducing waiting times for vessels. The result? A significant reduction in fuel consumption and carbon emissions, estimated to reach up to 20%.

Building upon the success of the Port Activity App, the project has also inspired the development of 'Time Slot Gävle,' a queuing management system that further optimizes port operations. By allowing ships to apply for queue tickets well in advance, this system enhances the predictability of port activities, leading to even greater energy and emissions savings.

Scaling Up for Global Impact

The success of the EfficientFlow project in Gävle and Rauma has paved the way for its adoption in over a dozen other ports in Finland. With plans to extend this open-source system to ports worldwide, the project holds the potential for substantial environmental savings on a global scale. Funded primarily by the EU Cohesion Policy's Interreg Central Baltic Programme, the project exemplifies the collaborative efforts needed to drive sustainable change in maritime transport.

Hydrogen-Powered Cargo Ships: A Game-Changer in the North Sea Basin

Meanwhile, in the North Sea Basin, another EU co-financed project from the Interreg North Sea Programme, has achieved a groundbreaking milestone in green shipping. Operating primarily in Denmark and the Netherlands, this project facilitated the creation of the world's first 100% hydrogen-driven cargo ships, named H2 Barge 1 and H2 Barge 2.

These vessels represent a paradigm shift in maritime transport, as they are powered by green hydrogen, produced using electricity from renewable sources. By eliminating emissions from their operations, the H2 Barge 1 and 2 are leading the charge towards a carbon-neutral shipping industry, reducing thousands of tonnes of CO2 emissions annually.

Overcoming Challenges: From Retrofitting to Renewable Energy Integration

The journey towards greener maritime transport has not been without its challenges. Retrofitting vessels from diesel to zero emissions required advanced technological solutions, including the integration of batteries and hydrogen fuel cells. However, the real innovation lay in addressing the energy needs of these vessels with renewable sources.

Within the same Interreg project, the University of Southern Denmark undertook research to develop an intelligent harbour concept on the Danish island of Ærø. By analyzing energy demands, simulating different scenarios, and suggesting incentives to steer demand in the electric grid, the project facilitated the integration of electric ferries into the island's transport system.

Collaboration for a Sustainable Future

The success stories of the Port Activity App project and the H2 Barge project underscore the importance of collaboration in driving the green shift in shipping. By harnessing EU Cohesion Policy funds and partnering with visionary private sector companies, Interreg projects are pioneering innovative solutions that hold the key to a more sustainable future for maritime transport. As these initiatives continue to evolve and expand, they offer hope for a cleaner, greener shipping industry that benefits both the environment and global economy.",ec.europa.eu,news,European Commission,,0.1843137254901961,454058891,4,,

Topic: Cloudberry reported strong Q1 figures despite production shortfalls at the Odal wind farm (covered by warranties). A final investment decision for its transformative 175MW PV park in Denmark is expected until the end of the year.

Q1 consolidated revenues grew by 89% yoy to NOK 129m, largely in line with our estimates thanks to the strongly increased production volumes of 173GWh (+93% yoy). This should, above all, be carried by the Danish wind portfolio Odin (106MW net to Cloudberry), which was bought at the beginning of June 2023. While the average power price decreased yoy from NOK 118/MWh to NOK 73/MW/h it is largely in line with Q4 price levels of NOK 76/MWh.

Q1 consolidated EBTDA jumped by 190% yoy to NOK 58m. This was despite a significant shortfall from the Odal wind farm (reported as income/loss from associated companies) due to severe operational issues (EBITDA decreased from NOK 29m to only NOK 7m).

To recap, Odal wind farm uses blades from Siemens Gamesa, which announced severe issues with multiple series. Hence, only 50-60% of the Odal turbines were operational in Q1. The related production shortfall is to be covered by warranties. The claim at the end of Q1 (so far not booked) amounted to € 14-17m. With additional stand stills following a blade braking off in Q2, claims should further increase.

The Subby windfarm in Sweden was successfully erected ahead of time and has begun generating electricity. Under standard weather assumptions Sundby is seen to produce 89 GWh per annum yielding annual revenues of c. NOK 56m by assuming an avg. power price of c. NOK 640/MWh.

Pipeline remains strong. The two projects under construction are progressing according to plan and cost. The 19 MW Munkhyttan wind farm should be erected by the end of the year 2024 and the 8 MW hydro power plant Ovre Kvemma is built and is expected to be connected to the grid in the following weeks. Due to the recent significant price deflation of solar panels, Cloudberry is speeding up development of the planned 175MW PV plant in Denmark. The final investment decision is expected still this year. The total backlog stands at 911 MW.

Cloudberry remains a BUY with an unchanged NOK 19 PT based on SOTP - change of analyst -

Strong Q1 // Odal shortfall covered by warranties

Topic: Cloudberry reported strong Q1 figures despite production shortfalls at the Odal wind farm (covered by warranties). A final investment decision for its transformative 175MW PV park in Denmark is expected until the end of the year.

Q1 consolidated revenues grew by 89% yoy to NOK 129m, largely in line with our estimates thanks to the strongly increased production volumes of 173GWh (+93% yoy). This should, above all, be carried by the Danish wind portfolio Odin (106MW net to Cloudberry), which was bought at the beginning of June 2023. While the average power price decreased yoy from NOK 118/MWh to NOK 73/MW/h it is largely in line with Q4 price levels of NOK 76/MWh.

Q1 consolidated EBTDA jumped by 190% yoy to NOK 58m. This was despite a significant shortfall from the Odal wind farm (reported as income/loss from associated companies) due to severe operational issues (EBITDA decreased from NOK 29m to only NOK 7m).

To recap, Odal wind farm uses blades from Siemens Gamesa, which announced severe issues with multiple series. Hence, only 50-60% of the Odal turbines were operational in Q1. The related production shortfall is to be covered by warranties. The claim at the end of Q1 (so far not booked) amounted to EUR 14-17m. With additional stand stills following a blade braking off in Q2, claims should further increase.

The Subby windfarm in Sweden was successfully erected ahead of time and has begun generating electricity. Under standard weather assumptions Sundby is seen to produce 89 GWh per annum yielding annual revenues of c. NOK 56m by assuming an avg. power price of c. NOK 640/MWh.

Pipeline remains strong. The two projects under construction are progressing according to plan and cost. The 19 MW Munkhyttan wind farm should be erected by the end of the year 2024 and the 8 MW hydro power plant Ovre Kvemma is built and is expected to be connected to the grid in the following weeks. Due to the recent significant price deflation of solar panels, Cloudberry is speeding up development of the planned 175MW PV plant in Denmark. The final investment decision is expected still this year. The total backlog stands at 911 MW.

Cloudberry remains a BUY with an unchanged NOK 19 PT based on SOTP - change of analyst -

The United Kingdom's first wind turbine -- a windmill intended to generate electricity, rather than merely grind grain -- was built by James Blyth in 1887 to light his holiday home in Marykirk, 30 miles down the east coast of Scotland from Aberdeen. More than a century later, his name would be given to the Blyth Offshore Wind Farm, the first to be found in British waters.

For the past year, and for the first time, wind has been Britain's largest source of electricity generation. Creating 32 per cent of our needs, it narrowly pipped gas, at 31 per cent. Part of this, admittedly, is due to gas's decline, with more electricity now imported directly along cables from France and Denmark.

The strategy seeks to make it easier to install solar panels on commercial properties and find better solutions for solar panels on rooftops in urban areas.

Denmark needs more than double its current electricity in the coming years, and solar panels are a growing contribution to the green energy supply. The number of smaller rooftop installations is steadily increasing, but the development is particularly driven by large production facilities in open land, which supply the collective power grid. Installing solar panels has become a profitable business, and the expansion is market-driven. From 2020 to 2023, the capacity of energy from solar has tripled from approximately 1.1 GW to about 3.5 GW.

Related news: Another record-breaking year for solar and wind power in Denmark

Although the installation of solar panels is rapidly advancing, the government's solar strategy will clarify how even more solar panels can be installed in the future and pave the way for removing barriers that can streamline the installation of solar panels. Additionally, the strategy focuses on elaborating rules and referring to relevant guidelines for the installation of solar panels.

""Green energy from solar is one of the fastest and cheapest ways to achieve green transition, electrification of society, and independence from fossil gas. There is great potential in the installation of solar panels, and this development must continue. We need much more electricity for electric cars, heat pumps, and industry. Therefore, we will now boost new opportunities for more solar on rooftops in urban areas and commercial properties. If, for example, a leasing scheme is a way to overcome a barrier for more solar energy from commercial rooftops, then it is obvious to address it,"" Lars Aagaard, Minister for Climate, Energy, and Utilities.

The government's solar strategy focuses on five key areas for solar expansion in Denmark. Every watt counts in the government's ambition to ensure the framework for a fourfold increase in renewable energy on land by 2030. The solar strategy includes making it easier to install solar panels on the rooftops of commercial properties through financing forms such as leasing. This has been particularly requested by the solar and leasing industry.

The government will also develop a proposal for the allocation of approximately DKK 178 million to renewable energy in less accessible areas - for example, larger rooftop areas in urban buildings, such as housing associations, areas along urban motorways or railways, covered parking areas, etc.

In addition to more speed and better framework conditions for energy parks and solar panels in open land as well as solar panels on rooftops, there is also a focus on creating transparency about existing rules and opportunities for solar panels on public rooftops and for local energy communities. This includes new opportunities for creating local collective tariffs. Together with the existing pool for local energy communities, this should ensure that local energy communities can be expanded and contribute to the green transition. Additionally, the Ministry of Social Affairs, Housing, and Seniors will explore the possibilities for public housing organizations to rent out rooftop areas for the installation of solar panels.",stateofgreen.com,news,State of Green,,0.2784313725490195,454016241,13,https://stateofgreen.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Solar-panels_derek-sutton-rfgsYFb_5ow-unsplash-min-scaled.jpg,eng-9589187

Netherlands-based nuclear energy development company ULC-Energy says a recent study had shown the cost effectiveness of hydrogen produced by a Rolls-Royce small modular reactor (SMR) combined with high temperature Solid Oxide Electrolyser Cell (SOEC) technology produced by Denmark-based Topsoe. The study involved Topsoe, Rolls-Royce SMR and Dutch energy market consultancy, KYOS.

In August 2022, Rolls-Royce SMR signed an exclusive agreement with ULC-Energy to collaborate on deployment of Rolls-Royce SMR NPPs in the Netherlands. In November 2023, ULC-Energy, Topsoe and Rolls-Royce SMR signed an agreement to jointly investigate the production of hydrogen using Topsoe's SOEC technology with power and heat produced by a Rolls-Royce SMR NPP. The study has revealed that the SMR-SOEC combination had a number of advantages:

Hydrogen can be produced by the SMR-SOEC combination for less than €3.5/kg ($3.8/kg). This cost could be reduced to less than €2.00/kg by 2050 by taking into account the value of the flexibility of curtailing hydrogen production and delivering electricity to an increasingly intermittent grid. The study demonstrated that system would produce the highest annual quantity of Hydrogen as a result of higher process efficiency and a high availability.

""The large-scale production of clean hydrogen is an extremely important driver of decarbonisation,"" said Dirk Rabelink from ULC-Energy. ""ULC-Energy has been working closely with Rolls-Royce SMR in the Netherlands since 2022 when it selected Rolls-Royce SMR as its preferred SMR technology for deployment in the Netherlands. The study that is now completed clearly demonstrates the capability of nuclear to deliver low cost, clean hydrogen at an industrial scale. Importantly it also shows the additional value associated with the flexibility to switch between energy markets such as electricity, heat and, in this case, hydrogen. Topsoe SOEC and Rolls-Royce SMR are both highly modularised solutions that are factory manufactured can be scaled rapidly.""

Topsoe's SOEC technology has been under development for over 15 years and in 2023 ground was broken at its 500 MW SOEC manufacturing facility. Sundus Cordelia Ramli, CCO Power to X at Topsoe noted: ""The high capacity factor of nuclear power plant, together with a direct source of heat, makes

""Rolls-Royce SMR believes one of its powerful advantages is that it can produce clean energy cheaply and extremely reliably, but can also direct its output to meet demand,"" said Alan Woods, Rolls-Royce SMR's Director of Strategy & Business Development. ""This operational flexibility will be increasingly valuable as intermittent energy sources, such as wind and solar, expand. We are excited by the results of ULC-Energy's study and look forward to taking next steps.""",neimagazine.com,news,Nuclear Engineering International,,0.4588235294117646,454012218,4,https://www.neimagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2024/05/Electrolyser_SMR_Visualization-1024x577.webp,eng-9587064

What gets far less play is the admittedly boring network of wires and substations -- high-voltage transmission lines and local distribution grids -- that allow all those electrons to flow where they're needed, when they're needed.

However, to meet our net zero goals, and take steps like transitioning to EVs and heat pumps, Canada needs to significantly amp up investment in both clean electricity, as well as that far-flung transmission and distribution network. The cost is a bit of a black box. ""We're going to need two or three times the amount of generation of electricity in order to fulfill our goals,"" says Guy Holburn, a professor of business and economics and founder of the Ivey Energy Policy and Management Centre at Western University. ""We've got some reasonable estimates there of how much that's going to cost. The transmission and distribution side is a little bit harder to accurately quantify the costs.""

Francis Bradley, president and CEO of Electricity Canada, says estimates for the price tag of electrification through to 2050 run from $400 billion to $1.7 trillion. An Ivey study reckons that 23,000 kilometres of new high-voltage transmission lines will be needed, including many that extend far into Canada's North -- a vast undertaking that involves negotiations with First Nations, complex environmental approvals and, increasingly, all the risks posed by raging wild fires. ""Recent work by the RBC Climate Institute essentially says we're probably investing roughly a third of what we need to be investing in this space,"" Bradley says.

Here's one recent example of how renewables and new transmission should be expanding in tandem: a new $6 billion transmission corridor being built by Hydro-Québec. That project pairs with new investments in wind farms as well as additional hydro-electric dams, which can store all that additional renewable power -- that is, the electricity generated by the turbines running the pumps that fill up the reservoirs -- and then dispatch it when the wind isn't blowing. The wrinkle? This line runs into New York State, a long-time Hydro-Québec customer, instead of supplying renewables to other parts of Canada.

Yet, energy policy expert Pierre-Olivier Pineau, a professor of management at HEC Montréal, argues we need more, not less, of this kind of thing. According to a 2020 study he carried out for The Transition Accelerator, a think tank that teams with other research groups, a highly integrated approach to electricity markets in northeastern North America -- one that involves extensive trade in power within a mega-region encompassing New York, New England, the Atlantic provinces, Ontario and Quebec -- could yield billions in savings on new renewable generation, even if consumption grows rapidly.

""More transmission is needed between states and provinces, to allow more hourly and seasonal trade in both directions,"" the report finds. ""Global cost savings, in a 100% decarbonization context, are estimated around $10 billion per year under regional collaboration (and more transmission interconnections), compared to a system without new interconnections.""

The reason? Underutilized renewable power, from large wind and solar farms, or behind hydro-dams, can be used to help meet demand elsewhere within the region. But, as Pineau observes, this future turns on a critical precondition: that all these regions significantly expand the transmission ""interties"" across state, provincial and national borders in order to produce a single grid as opposed to the Balkanized ones that exist now. To get there, their electricity system operators would have to collaborate in ways that are, well, inconceivable at present.

At least in North America. Pineau points to Nord Pool, the 31-year-old renewable electricity wholesale market that began in Norway and is now the system operator for 20 countries, including Sweden, Finland, Denmark and the Baltic states. When there's surplus electricity in one jurisdiction, it can be sold to another where there's demand. The whole enterprise turns on the existence of a regional transmission grid in which the national systems are compatible with one another because policy makers saw it made sense.

Here's the kicker of Pineau's story: ""It's unlike Quebec and Ontario, which are entirely non-compatible in their planning,"" he says. ""There's no harmonization of regulation, rules, systems planning. There's no nothing there. They don't even talk to each other when they plan.""

Indeed, there's mounting evidence that unlike the Nord Pool countries, Canada's transmission and distribution infrastructure isn't growing nearly fast enough to handle the looming surge in electricity demand attributable to EVs, heat pumps, giant data centres, etc.

In fact, a 2022 survey of utility executives conducted by Ivey's Energy Policy centre found they were least optimistic about the investment climate for transmission and distribution lines. In particular, Holburn and Bradley both point to gnarly systemic barriers that stand in the way of raising the capital required to upgrade and expand Canada's local distribution networks in order to meet Canada's ambitious electrification targets.

Exhibit A: every region has a different system. In Quebec and B.C., provincially owned utilities operate the whole show. Alberta's network is market-based. Some regions use lots of natural gas for home heating and others do it all with electricity. In Ontario, electricity is shunted around by Hydro One, which owns the province's transmission lines, as well as dozens of municipally owned local utilities -- many of them sleepy monopolies regulated by the Ontario Energy Board, which limits how much they can invest in their grid infrastructure.

Those barriers may be preventing smaller-scale distributed renewable projects -- some rooftop solar here, some battery storage there -- from accessing local grids, where they would effectively reduce the need for new large-scale generation projects (such as nuclear plants), as well as the upgraded wires required to bring all that new power to the places where it's needed.

""You've got this new conversation that's starting to take place in Canada, but has taken place in a very serious way in other parts of the world, about how do you manage this increasingly distributed system,"" says Evan Pivnick, a program manager at Clean Energy Canada. He says some local utilities are running pilot projects to look for potential solutions. ""Is Canada as a whole moving anywhere nearly fast enough on that? Absolutely not. How far behind we're lagging on the distributed energy resource conversation -- that's a detriment, and holds back the affordability gains we could be making for Canadians.""

Others are more skeptical: ""We'll need decentralized generation that's feasible,"" says Pineau. However, he adds, ""it makes the grid more complex. Overall, we won't be able to avoid large wind farms and large solar farms because especially in cities, the electricity intensity is so big that you cannot have enough rooftop solar panels. You will still need these transmission lines to balance generation and demand and load in different locations.""

Ultimately, he argues, Canada won't reach its electrification targets without adopting a radically new approach to electricity planning -- one that involves the federal government and all the provinces and territories, sitting around the same table and working out an alternative to the status quo, which is Balkanized and counter-productive.

""The real bottleneck,"" Pineau says, ""is that we don't take energy management seriously, so we are not planning accordingly. The federation is itself a problem because the federal government doesn't have jurisdiction over energy and electricity. They are seen as intruders in electricity policies, when ideally they should be seen as a facilitator and a coordinator because we need provinces to coordinate themselves.""",theglobeandmail.com,news,The Globe and Mail,,0.223529411764706,453996785,43,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/resizer/v2/TOAJ3LVFGNFH5AO2UMFEPC3C2A.jpg?auth=2d797c32356e8974ef1a8a2983f5ed8f1931c4615b0c9a5a2b6937094f45db42&width=560&quality=80,

Applications have opened under five project funding pools and are available under the Danish Sea, Fisheries, and Aquaculture program. Funds have specifically come out of the Danish Marine, Fisheries, and Aquaculture Program for 2021-2027, which has been co-financed by E.U. funds from the European Marine, Fisheries, and Aquaculture Fund.

""Danish fishing is in a period of upheaval with several challenges ahead. The marine environment is challenged, which creates difficult conditions for several fish stocks - especially in our inland waters,"" Denmark Minister for Food, Agriculture, and Fisheries Jacob Jensen said in a release. ""We live in a time where it is both expected and a necessity that new green solutions are developed that can reduce the climate footprint and environmental impact in all industries.""

Applicants for the funding must prove they can help Denmark reach its goal of reducing CO2 emissions by 70 percent by 2030 and, by proxy, ensure Denmark is among the leading nations in the green transformation of fishing and aquaculture.

""We must help to support that so that we can develop fishing in a more sustainable direction. Fishing is an important part of our food supply, and at the same time, it contributes to local jobs in waterfront Denmark,"" Jensen said. ""That is why I am also pleased that we are now reopening the support pools so that we can speed up sustainable solutions for both the fishing and aquaculture industries.""

- U.K. non-departmental industry body Seafish launched an online tool designed to support the seafood sector's response to climate change.

The tool, titled the Seafood Carbon Emissions Profiling Tool, can help businesses measure and reduce their carbon footprints and contribute to meeting net-zero emissions targets, the company said in a release.

""The Seafood Carbon Emissions Profiling Tool is an important part of our work to support the U.K. seafood sector transition to net-zero,"" Seafish Head of Responsible Sourcing Stuart McLanaghan said in a release. ""It is aimed at the entire U.K. seafood supply chain, but we envisage that buyers within retail, foodservice, and processing will be among the main users. The tool provides several benefits for industry but will, first and foremost, enable industry to identify carbon footprints for their seafood products and understand the hotspots or risks in their supply chains.""

Seafood businesses can access the tool's online platform to input supply chain data, such as greenhouse gas emissions associated with processing operations, and receive more sustainable solutions.

- The Global Tuna Alliance launched its Module Complémentaire initiative, designed to provide French retail partners tools to their strengthen sustainability efforts. Through comprehensive surveys of canned tuna sourcing, partners can identify and mitigate potential risks in their supply chains, helping them make decisions and strengthen their sustainability practices.

""French retailers demonstrate their serious commitment to sustainability and set a commendable example for others in the industry,"" GTA Executive Director Daniel Suddaby said in a release. ""For France, with its Réunion department in the Indian Ocean, it is heartening to see such significant support as we commence our IOTC campaign, ensuring that our collective efforts will lead to meaningful and lasting impacts in tuna conservation.""

Les Mousquetaires, Système U, Lidl, and Casino, which comprise more than 40 percent of the food and beverage market share in France, have committed to the program.

- Bangkok, Thailand-based Charoen Pokphand Foods (CP Foods) has launched a new initiative to reduce food loss in its operations and repurpose food waste and byproducts into valuable resources such as animal feed, fertilizer, and alternative energy. The company said it has also enhanced the efficiency of its machinery and equipment in its manufacturing plants.

""CP Foods places significant emphasis on food loss and waste management across our value chain,"" CP Foods Head of Corporate Affairs and Investor Relations Kobboon Srichai said. ""We leverage technology and innovation not only to prevent and reduce food loss but also to transform waste into valuable resources. In 2023, we effectively managed food loss during production processes and minimized food waste, reclaiming nearly 80 percent for reuse.""

CP's aquacultural feed development team has also launched a collaborative project with a fishmeal supplier to integrate byproducts into novel feed raw materials. The product offers a sustainable alternative to imported raw materials.

- The Global Sustainable Seafood Initiative (GSSI) has announced a partnership with ocean ecosystem and sustainability organization FishWise.

FishWise, headquartered in Santa Cruz, California, U.S.A., provides seafood companies with expertise on how to improve their business practices in a way that catalyzes fisheries and aquaculture improvements. The partnership is working to enforce sustainability for the oceans and people dependent on them, the organizations said in a release.

""FishWise is happy to join GSSI alongside so many impactful partner organizations around the globe,"" FishWise Social Responsibility Director Kelley K. Bell said. ""We know that engaging with markets is key to improving supply chains, and GSSI is an important avenue for us to advance our work with market actors to promote and protect labor and human rights. We look forward to opportunities for powerful collaboration ahead.""

FishWise also announced a partnership with U.S. grocery chain Hy-Vee, publicly releasing data about the grocer's tuna supply chains. The data is now being run through FishWise's new risk assessment tool: the Vessel Risk Dashboard.

""Our partnership with FishWise continues to provide us with very valuable information about our seafood supply chain, which we know makes a difference for our customers,"" Hy-Vee VP Jason Pride said in a release. ""FishWise's continued efforts, improvements, and insights around vessel name data consistently give us new information to explore as part of our seafood supply chain due diligence strategy.""

- The International Seafood Sustainability Foundation (ISSF) has released a step-by-step guide - the Jelly-FAD Construction Guide - showing commercial tuna fishers how to build fish-aggregating devices (FADs) that utilize almost fully biodegradable and have a non-entangling design.

Approximately 38 percent of the global tuna catch, which totaled 5.2 million metric tons, was hauled in thanks to the use of FADs in 2022, ISSF said.

""The Jelly-FAD Construction Guide shows tuna fishers how to build what we believe is the most sustainable non-entangling FAD to date,"" ISSF Senior Scientist Gala Moreno said in a release. ""The Jelly-FAD represents a new concept in drifting FADs, whose structure and materials have been relatively static for decades. To make Jelly-FADs, you do not need to have unusual materials, special equipment, or advanced carpentry skills. We intend the Jelly-FAD to be as simple and affordable as possible for fishers around the world to build.""

- The Sustainable Aquaculture Innovation Centre (SAIC) has secured GBP 1.5 million (USD 1.9 million, EUR 1.7 million) to support fish health research and development.

Of the total, GBP 500,000 (USD 635,000, EUR 585,000) is coming from the Scottish Government's Marine Fund Scotland and GBP 1 million (USD 1.2 million, EUR 1.1 million) of transitional funding from the Scottish Funding Council (SFC) will allow SAIC to improve health and welfare outcomes for farmed fish, according to SAIC. SAIC is also launching a new funding call for businesses and higher-education institutions for projects exclusively focused on finfish health and welfare.

""SAIC is one of Scotland's success stories, having played a significant role in supporting innovation and development in aquaculture,"" Scotland Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs, Land Reform, and Islands Mairi Gougeon said in a release. ""We are now supporting SAIC to move to a refreshed and updated role that will ensure it and Scottish aquaculture have a bright future. The need to make aquaculture sustainable and the rewards for doing so have never been greater nor more urgent.""

- Derio, Spain-based ocean technology company Zunibal launched testing on its floating and submerged FADs. The project, in partnership with the Spain-based AZTI Technology Centre, aims to create biodegradable materials that lead to more sustainable tropical tuna fisheries.

Phase 1 testing has begun in a tropical, semi-controlled environment at IATTC Achotines Laboratory facilities, headquartered in Panama. Real-condition tests are also underway, the organization said in a release, with 210 devices distributed between the Atlantic and Indian oceans to evaluate effectiveness.

""These two designs eliminate or significantly reduce the need for synthetic canvas and raffia, or flotation components such as foam floats (skittles). In this way, by using materials that improve the characteristics of the FAD, we can minimize its impact on the environment,'"" AZTI Fishing Expert Iker Zudaire.

- Vancouver, Canada-based seafood traceability and processing software company ThisFish has relaunched its consumer-tracing app Tally Trace.

The app allows seafood companies to link raw materials to finished products, tracking yields and costs for increased transparency and traceability efforts. The relaunch allows for the addition of images and marketing descriptions of fish species, products, fishing vessels, and more, the company said.

""More and more consumers are demanding to know where their products come from and that they're socially and environmentally responsible,"" This Fish CEO Eric Enno Tamm said. ""One way to build trust is to be transparent about the prominence of your products through traceability. Tally Trace is our solution.

The program also provides companies with printable QR labeling systems for consumer use.

- Delft, the Netherlands-based biotechnology research company Veramaris increased its supply of alternative sources for omega-3 EPA and DHA by 50 percent year over year in 2023.

""The company has been at the forefront of addressing the market's growing need for sustainable omega-3 EPA & DHA, which has risen in parallel with the global trend toward greater demand for aquaculture and healthy seafood,"" the company said in a release.

A recent environmental report released by the company highlighted that it has also reduced its carbon footprint by 27 percent.

""2023 marks a pivotal year for Veramaris, as we not only achieved a record increase in production volumes but also solidified our market position. We are now poised to scale up sustainably, streamlining our production processes and forging new partnerships,"" Veramaris CEO Gertjan de Koning said.

- Amersfoort, The Netherlands-based Nutreco announced it is taking a new approach toward sustainability reporting.

Starting with its 2023 annual report, the feed company will publish sustainability results and case studies more frequently throughout the year on the company's website. It will also release a concise and compliance-focused report later in 2024, the company said in a release.

The new initiatives will allow Nutreco to provide its stakeholders with more up-to-date, regular, and timely information about the progress it's making on its sustainability roadmap.

""Teams across Nutreco are putting into action initiatives to ensure that we continue to make progress on emissions reduction,"" Nutreco Chief Supply Chain Officer Claudio Cervellati said in a release. ""For example, we have decided not to use coal in any of our factories and are installing solar panels across several business units. We are also investing in green electricity and reducing emissions with new and optimized boilers. I'm very proud of our team's hard work and commitment to helping us achieve our targets.""

- Juneau, Alaska, U.S.A.-based Alaska Seafood Marketing Institute (ASMI) has partnered with cruise line Holland America Line to certify the cruise line's dining and galley team members to better understand fish species, consumption benefits, and responsible fishing practices of the Alaska fishing industry through ASMI's proprietary Seafood U educational course.

Approximately 2,500 shipboard team members across six ships will undergo the training.

""We've shared the thrill of Alaska's glaciers and wildlife with our guests for more than 75 years, and supporting sustainable fishing and local business is an important commitment for us,"" Holland America Line President Gus Antorcha said in a release. ""With this new step, Holland America Line has committed to not only serving fresh, sustainable seafood but ensuring our team has the knowledge to be expert sources to our guests as we cruise Alaska's waters.""",seafoodsource.com,news,seafoodsource.com,,0.1372549019607843,453978683,13,https://divcomplatform.s3.amazonaws.com/www.seafoodsource.com/images/f995b61c793351ca370fa24732cb1ece.png,

Simens Energy entered a strategic partnership last week with state-owned Energinet for comprehensive expansion and renovation of the electricity grid on Funen and in Jutland. In the course of the coming eight years, the electricity grid will be expanded with a large number of 150 kV high-voltage substations. MT Højgaard Danmark is one of several cooperation partners that will contribute to this assignment through the construction, building and renovation of the stations. The activities are estimated to generate revenue of at least DKK 650 million for MT Højgaard Denmark over the eight-year period.

""The partnership agreement with Energinet is aligned with several of our strategic goals. We want to be part of large Danish energy projects, and we want to enter into long-term cooperation agreements with likeminded companies and developers. We look forward to the close collaboration with the other parties, and we are excited to invite local subcontractors to contribute during this project,"" says Carsten Lund, CEO of MT Højgaard Danmark.

MT Højgaard Danmark and Siemens Energy have previously collaborated on critical energy infrastructure projects, most recently the construction of an onshore substation for the Thor wind park.

The agreement does not affect MT Højgaard Holding's 2024 outlook, which is unchanged with revenue expected at DKK 10-10.5 billion and an operating profit (EBIT) of DKK 400-425 million.

Dr. Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma of South Africa became the first woman Chairperson of the African Union Commission and Nigeria's Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala became the first female Director-General of WTO. 34% of the Speakers of Parliament in Southern and East African countries are women and 26% of national legislators are women. The 2023 Gender Parity Index rated Sub-Saharan Africa slightly below the global weighted average score; only better than Southern Asia and the Middle East and North Africa. ILO notes that women have a nearly 85% likelihood to be in vulnerable employment versus 70% likelihood for male. Adult female labor force participation is expected to slightly increase from almost 72% in 2014 to 72.4% in 2018, yet lower than their male counterparts, which is estimated at 87.7% and almost 89% respectively. Closing the wage and employment gender gap would mean an 121% income increase for women, valued at some $0.7 trillion. Although women represent 52% of the agricultural labor force, they have little or no land ownership and are further affected by increasing land-grabbing by foreign companies or countries. Low levels of education and qualification makes it very difficult for the region as a whole and for women specifically to escape the poverty vulnerability cycle.

Presently, the average fertility rate in the region is 5.1 and is not expected to drop below 3 by mid-century. Even though the global maternal mortality ratio has been declined greatly, with 55% of the about 800 maternal deaths per day occurring in sub-Saharan Africa. The region has the world's highest maternal mortality, with some countries' rates as high as 1,000 death per 100,000 live births. In Kenya, every two hours a woman dies in childbirth; that's 4,400 death per year, most of them preventable. About 20% of Kenyan women experienced online harassment. According to Save the Children, Niger is the worst country in which to be a mother. UNICEF reports that 1 in 11 children born in sub-Saharan Africa dies before the age of 5.

Violence against women is widespread and, in most cases unreported. In South Africa, there are an estimated 60,000 cases of sexual assault per year. Rape and sexual assaults are even more acute in the conflict-torn zones, mostly in the DRC, Sudan, and Nigeria (with Boko Haram) and the neighboring areas. Sexual violence is used as a weapon and continues with impunity. In some Muslim communities, mostly in Egypt and Uganda, female genital mutilation and cutting is still practiced, despite increased international opposition. Improved education system and investments for paid-job opportunities (mainly for the youth), increased social spending (in some countries, where only 4 to 6% of the GDP is allocated to social protection benefits); improved infrastructure systems (mainly water, sanitation, and electricity), and enforcement of gender-equity regulations are some basic changes needed to improve the status of women in Africa.

Middle East and North Africa: Women's rights in the MENA region remains critical and even worsening in some countries with the rise of religious extremism and expanded enforcement of the Sharia law. The region has the lowest gender parity of any region. ILO notes that the region's women are much more likely than men to be in vulnerable employment -- at a rate of 55% versus 32% in North Africa and 42% versus 27% in the Middle East. Only the United Arab Emirates has achieved parity at the parliamentary level. Lebanon has the highest parity for ministerial positions with 32% women. Tunisia is the first Arab country to have a woman as head of government (2021), while Israel was the first in the region with a female head of state (1969).

Stoning to death is still used as a legal form of punishment for ""adultery"" in several Muslim countries, and the purdah(female seclusion) and namus (virtue) customs persist in many Arab regions. Sexual harassment, rape, and sexual violence by ISIS (Islamic State) and other extremist groups and security forces across the region have reached intolerable levels. As of 2017, more than 200 million girls and women have been victims of genital mutilation and cutting in Africa and the Middle East where the practice is concentrated. However, these are increasingly being challenged by empowered women, the outcry of the globalsociety, and women's-rights icons such as Malala Yousafzai. In the Arab MENA region, philosophical, ethnic, and ethical assumptions have to change in order to make possible the structural transformations needed to improve the status of women. The international community could use sanctions and conditioned-aid, conditioned-partnership in international organizations and business partnerships to help accelerate the long-due change. Israel (ranked 65) is the best performing country in the region and has closed over 70% of the gender gap.

Asia and Oceania: High incomes and education levels in countries like Japan challenge old family structures. However, women occupy only 14.7% of senior leadership positions in Japan. If women participated in the economy equally to men, Japan's GDP could grow by 16%. Together with the Republic of Korea (where women hold 10% of leadership positions), they launched the Gender Parity Task Force to improve women's career opportunities. According to the Global Gender Gap report, Japan fell from 104 place in 2014 to 116 place in 2022 and 125 place in 2023. Republic of Korea rose from 117 to 107 place in 2023 and China fell from 102 to 107 place in 2023. The region's best performer was New Zealand ranked 4 followed by the Philippines (16), Australia (26th), while the worst performers are Iran (143) and Pakistan (142).

The East Asia and Pacific region have nearly closed enrollment gaps between girls and boys in primary, secondary, and tertiary education, with girls even outperforming boys in some countries. However, in South Asia, only Sri Lanka, the Maldives, and Bangladesh have reached gender parity in primary schools, reports UNESCO. China has closed the gap for primary education, and reached 46.6% parity in the ninth year of schooling. Women in China were 45.17% of the labor force in 2022 (up from 43.5% in 2020). An estimated 19% of executives in China are women compared to the world average of 25%. Only a quarter of researchers in East Asia and the Pacific Rim are women.

Although all countries of South Asia have ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, UNDP reports that gender inequality causes a 60.1% loss in human development in the region, while ActionAid estimates that closing the wage and employment gaps would mean a 73% income gain valued at some $4.3 trillion. Central Asia has closed 69.1% of its gender gap in 2022. WHO notes that the region has about 30% of the world's maternal deaths, the second highest globally. Mainly due to the dual legal civil and religious systems in many parts of Asia early and forced marriage, violence, discrimination with respect to inheritance and land ownership, dowry issues, and honor killings continue to be prevalent and unpunished. In Afghanistan, the criminal law prevents prosecutions for domestic violence, forced and child marriage, and there were calls to overturn the Law on Elimination of Violence Against Women for being counter to Islam. This prejudice against women costs Afghanistan about $1 billion per year. The project ""Engaging Young Men through Social Media for the Prevention of Violence against Women"" aims to end gender-based violence in Asia and the Pacific by using social media.

Bias in favor of sons continues to be of concern in many countries of the region. The sex ratio at birth in India 952 girls per 1,000 boys, due to abortions of female fetuses. China's one-child policy worked to reduce fertility rate, but the Communist Party leadership ended the policy and allowed married couples to have three children as of May 2021. Howevery, if they have more children, women worry about employment discrimination.

About 22% Eastern and South-Eastern Asian legislators are women, Oceania has 20%, Central and Southern Asia has 19%, and Western Asia has 18%. After adopting the political quota system, the share of women in the parliaments of Central Asian countries increased from none to over 20%, although they still have to struggle with the reminiscent patriarchal structures.

Europe: Gender parity is highest of all regions at 76.3%, with 20 out of 36 countries with at least 75% parity. Scotland was the first country to legislate free period products for those in need. Gender parity is an important part of the structural changes in Europe. The highest gender gap by sector is in politics -- on average at 80%. Women represent 37.2% of the members of the European Parliament, while only 8 of the 27 commissioners are women. The Nordic countries -- Iceland, Finland, Norway, and Sweden -- are among the top five ranked by the 2022 Global Gender Gap report, and the countries have closed their gender gap by between 80% to 86%. As of May 2016, across the EU, women account for 29% of national parliaments. Although Poland has passed a law that requires at least 35% of local candidates in general elections to be female, the rate of women in the Parliament after the last election is 27.4% (as of 2016). The inter-institutional women's caucus launched in December 2014 is supposed to address the gap by promoting gender equality in the EU institutions. In May 2016, women's share of board members of the largest publicly listed companies in the EU-28 was 23.3% (up from 11.9% in 2010). A draft EU directive voted by the EU Parliament in 2013 requires publicly-listed companies to have 40% of each sex on their board by 2020, and the Aspire Fund supports female business initiatives. A campaign has begun in Germany to get women in 30% of the management positions in journalism by 2017. Albania has reached a record 70% of women in its cabinet. Fifty percent of the researchers and engineers in Denmark and Norway are female.

In the EU, women represent 60% of university graduates and in 2012, on average 83% of women reached upper secondary school, compared to 77.5% of men. However, women earn on average 16% less per hour than men for the same work, or 31% less per year, since 32.6% of women are part-time workers. This also impacts old age living standards, with 23% of women aged 65 and over being at risk of poverty, compared to 17% of men. Nevertheless, Europe has the best social policies, including child care, maternity leave, and health care. Violence against women remains a concern, with some 33% of women in the EU having experienced physical and/or sexual violence since the age of 15. Some 10% of women complaining of sexual harassment or stalking through new technologies. About 80% of Russian women aged 16 to 60 years are employed and comprise 48.6% of employment. Women account for 43.4% of Russians with a PhD. Turkey, that aspires to join the EU, has yet to address its gender gap. As of July 2017, female representation in its parliament was only 14.6%, ranking 133 by the Global Gender Gap Index, and it has a large gender income gap (estimated income for female earning $10,501 compared to $26,893 for males.)

Latin America: The region continues to progress since 2017, with a 1.7% increase in 2023, bridging 74.3% of its overall gender parity. Women's participation in Latin American parliaments has improved due to the introduction of quotas in many countries. Argentina, Brazil, and Chile elected women heads of state. As of June 2017, 11 countries in the region have achieved more than 30% of women in parliament. In Mexico, 38% of the Chamber of Deputies are women and the President's Reform Initiative recommends that 50% of all political parties' candidates for popular positions should be women. Women held 1.6% of CEO position and 14.5% of corporate broad of directors in 2023. The 2014 Global Gender Gap report indicates that 14 of the 26 countries in the region have closed over 70% of the gender gap, with Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Jamacia being the region's highest ranked, while Guatemala, Belize, and Paraguay are the region's lowest ranked.

More women than men attain tertiary education across the region, but IMF's 2017 paper remarks that female labor participation was just over 50%, compared to 80% of males. Gender pay gaps also remains; women are still earning 26% less than their male peers. Rural and indigenous women work unpaid at least 16 hours a day. Despite economic and political progress, women's well-being continues to be hindered by machismo political and social structures and women easily become victims of organized crime in various forms. At least 4,473 women were killed by their husbands or relatives in 2021 in the region, up from 1,678 in 2014. As a result of restrictive legislation, one in three maternal deaths is due to abortion, and the lifetime risk of maternal death is 0.4%.

North America: The region ranks second behind Europe overall having closed 75% of the gender gap, though it is 1.9% lower than the previous edition, with the US 2.1% and Canada 0.2% declines. Women's share of the total labor force in North America was 46.6% in 2023 (46.5 in the U.S and 47.4% in Canada). Women earn more than their partners in about 10% of dual-earning households in the U.S. and 33% in Canada. As many women have higher education level than men and their number in senior management positions is increasing. However, only 5.8% of women hold CEO positions at S&P companies in the U.S., and 69.9% of mothers with children under age of 18 were working; compared to 92.7% of fathers. Silicon Valley has the largest pay gap in the U.S. with an earnings difference of $40,584 between genders. Women earn 78% of what men earn for comparable work, and the wage gap is worse for women of color. The gap was largest for Hispanic and Latina women who were paid 54% of what white men earned. Based on the trends of the past half-century of progress, the Institute for Women's Policy Research estimates that the U.S. national wage gap will close around year 2058. States vary significantly, with projections to 2038 in Florida and 2159 in Wyoming. The Paycheck Fairness Act (PFA) passed the House of Representatives on April 15, 2021 by a vote of 217-210, but failed in the Senate in June 2021 in a procedural vote.

Women's representation in the U.S. Senate in 2024 is 25% (25 Senators) and 29% (126 of 435) Congressional Representatives. Canada has 30% women in the House of Commons - the highest percent in its history, but only 1 of 13 provincial premiers are women. Both the U.S. and Canadian governments made critical cuts in domestic and international family planning programs for women. Since the Supreme Court Overturned Roe v. Wade, as of May 2024, abortion is banned in 14 states, gestational limit between 6 and 12 weeks in 5 states, limit between 15 and 22 weeks in 6 states, and

abortion is legal beyond 22 weeks in 25 states and D.C. The U.S. is among the countries with the costliest childbirth, most expensive day care, and the shortest parental leave. Among 41 nations, the U.S. is the only country which doesn't mandate national regulations or government-provided paid parental leave. These problems are even more critical as the share of one-parent families in the U.S. has increased; children living with a single mother is the second most common family arrangement. More than half of single mothers are living in extreme poverty.

Canada provides maternity or parental benefits. According to the Employment Insurance Maternity and Parental Benefits policy (except for Quebec Provence), which has its own parental insurance plan), the EI benefits generally pay 55% of one's average insurable weekly earnings, up to a maximum amount. (As of January 2017) Employers must give parents a minimum number of weeks for maternity, parental, and adoption leave. But employers don't have to pay them during such times. More than 40% of new parents surveyed said they could not afford maternity leave, and 81% of those who took the leave and returned to work, would have stayed on leave longer if they could have afforded it. The share of employed mothers with children aged 6 and over increased from 46% in 1976 to almost 80% by 2012, while women with children earn, on average, 12% less than women without children. In the U.S., violence against women was reduced by 55% since the passage of the Violence Against Women Act in 1994.",millennium-project.org,news,millennium-project.org,,0.05098039215686279,453971978,1,,

Join us in this fight.

Humanitarian aid for Ukraine is falling as its need only increases, the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR warned on May 20.

In an interview with AFP, Karolina Lindholm Billing, the UNHCR's representative in Ukraine, said there are 4 million displaced people in the country, including ""some very, very vulnerable people.""

Billing said the situation was only worsening as Russia's full-scale invasion drags into its third year, but funding for international humanitarian aid was slowing down.

The U.N. has a humanitarian plan for Ukraine that requires $3.1 billion this year, including $599 million for the UNHCR.

So far in 2024, both have received only 15% of the required funding. Similar plans for 2023 were 30% at the same time last year, she said.

""It is the most vulnerable (that) will bear the brunt of that reduced funding and support,"" Billing said.

Countries have continued to pledge humanitarian aid packages to Ukraine, most recently Denmark.

The Danish Foreign Ministry announced on May 7 a new 250 million kroner ($33.2 million) package and said about 40% of Ukraine's population is in need of humanitarian aid, citing U.N. data.

""The humanitarian situation in Ukraine is extremely serious,"" said Dan Jorgensen, the Danish development cooperation minister.

""Millions of Ukrainians have been displaced, thousands of homes have been destroyed, hospitals have been bombed, and basic necessities such as water, heating, and electricity are scarce resources for many Ukrainians.""",kyivindependent.com,news,The Kyiv Independent,,-0.1215686274509804,453971905,1,https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-1240568267.jpg,eng-9585894

Corre Energy, the Dublin-listed renewable energy storage developer, said it is looking at going to shareholders to raise cash to fund its short-term needs as it continues to talk to third parties that have signalled an interest in making a ""strategic investment"" in the company.

The Irish-run, but Dutch-based business revealed in its full-year results statement for 2023 on Tuesday that it had €1.08 million of cash at the end of last year, down from €3.43 million a year earlier. The company also raised €18.9 million of funding last year, including equity and loans.

""The company intends to engage with its shareholders further over the coming weeks in relation to potential further funding of short-term working capital requirements ahead of this strategic investment process and long-term fund raise being concluded, based on reasonable expectation by the directors that sufficient short-term funding can be raised from shareholders,"" it said.

Corre, which floated on Euronext Dublin almost three years ago, said last month that it has hired investment bank Rothschild & Co to advise it on approaches it has had ""from multiple parties"" to invest in the company to provide it with additional funding for investment on projects and working capital.

Shares in the company have fallen by more than 80 per cent over the past 12 months. This has been partly down to a slump across the wider green energy sector amid a decline in energy prices and the weight of higher interest rates on this capital-intensive sector.

However, according to observers, it is also down to concerns about Corre having failed to sufficiently spell out the financial details of its various projects to allow investors assess their potential for profit.

Corre's most advanced development is its Zuidwending (ZW1) project in the province of Groningen in the Netherlands.

ZW1 will be capable of supplying up to 320MW of electricity to the grid for of up to 3½ days and is due to come on stream around the end of 2026.

Other key projects include Corre's 320MW Green Hydrogen Hub project in Denmark, another facility in the Netherlands (ZW2) and a plan to develop three compressed air energy storage plants in caverns secured last year in Germany.

Corre also, more recently, targeted the US market, signing a deal in Texas last July, giving it an option to buy a 280MW compressed air energy storage project.

""Our commercial milestones and growth plans were achieved as market demand for our projects continued to rise,"" said chief executive Keith McGrane. ""Our financial position in 2023 is very much in line with expectation for this development stage of our business as we continue to deliver growth and commercial ambition. At a project level we secured further co-investment whilst in parallel we have commenced a process to secure further, substantial investment for the business.""

Shares in Corre were hit in late February - falling below its €1 initial public offering price for the first time - when founding director and big shareholder, Darren Patrick Green, stepped down as an executive director after a Singaporean company ultimately owned by him was named by UK tax authorities in relation to an alleged tax-avoidance scheme.

Mr Green told The Irish Times that he was ""absolutely astonished"" by the news and had not been a director of - or been involved in the running of - that company for years. He said he remains committed to the 38 per cent stake he owns in Corre. But it is perceived by the market as an overhang.

Corre swung into a profit of €5.64 million last year from a €30.1 million loss for 2022, with the difference largely relating to the revaluation of stock options that had been granted to funding provider, Italian private equity fund Fondo Italiano per L'Efficienza Energetica (FIEE).",irishtimes.com,news,The Irish Times,,0.223529411764706,453971814,1,https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/_guoNBTURg0nMZ20oeRLOBkXgw8=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/irishtimes/B337UNETIXTQMZZPZVKBRN7RTY.jpg,

Corre concentrates on the development, construction and future operation of grid-scale underground renewable energy storage facilities, as well as the production and sale of green hydrogen. It has projects in the Netherlands, Denmark and Germany.

During the year the Ahaus project in Germany was added to its portfolio, which doubled the size of its current European portfolio.

The company said its operating losses for the year were in line with management expectations, helped by prudent cost and cash controls.

Corre said it raised €8.9m of equity last February and €10m in September through combined equity, funding drawdown and loan agreement and added that it has a supportive shareholder base which has supported its working capital needs effectively so far.

Keith McGrane, CEO of Corre Energy, said that 2023 was about accelerating the company's operational performance following the key achievements of reaching commercial close at two of its projects in the Netherlands and Denmark.

""Added to that is the doubling of our European portfolio with the addition of a new development in Germany which has paved the way for a successful second partnership with Eneco as offtaker and investor, announced earlier in 2024. We've achieved this while cementing our partnership with Siemens Energy by signing a Global Collaboration Agreement to underpin our growth,"" the CEO said.

""Our commercial milestones and growth plans were achieved as market demand for our projects continued to rise. The global transition to a renewables-based electricity system is precisely why we're focused on storage hubs anchored by our multiday technology,"" he added.

In 6 years, half of all cars in Denmark are expected to run on electricity as part of Denmark's effort to reduce CO2 emissions. That's 1.5 million electric and hybrid cars that will strain the power grid.

Along with the technology company IBM and the platform provider Spirii, which develops solutions for electric vehicle charging, a team of researchers at DTU has collected data from 1400 electric vehicles in Denmark to investigate how electric vehicle batteries can contribute while charging.

""We have found that each electric vehicle owner can save 6-10% on their bill by, to some extent, making the consumption of their chargers flexible while charging their cars. This is relevant when the power grid is exposed to extreme imbalances - it doesn't happen so often, but it does happen. In return, system operators can provide a more stable power supply even with increased integration of the more unpredictable wind and solar energy sources,"" says DTU Associate Professor Jalal Kazempour.

As part of the 'Investment Model for Power Flexibility Services' project, this research team affiliated to DTU and IBM examined the business potential of leveraging access to electric vehicle batteries to increase the share of renewable energy in the power supply.

""Each electric vehicle owner can save money by contributing to maintaining a stable power supply and at the same time increasing the share of green energy in our electricity consumption because it is a key service for system operators,"" he explains.

Existing technical solution

The technological solution already exists, enabling electric car chargers to provide a grid service called frequency containment reserve for disturbances (FCR-D). When the power grid faces an extreme operational situation under a significant imbalance between power supply and demand, electric car chargers providing FCR-D services will automatically be activated to adjust their consumption. They will increase or decrease their consumption depending on the grid's need, helping the grid to restore the balance immediately.

The Nordic system operators have so far offset the imbalance by purchasing FCR-D services from, for example, conventional power plants that generate energy using gas or other fossil fuels. However, this contributes to increasing CO2 emissions, which Denmark has committed to reducing by 70% by 2030 compared to 1990. More flexible resources will be needed to balance the power grid.

Denmark only covers about 50% of its annual electricity consumption through wind and solar energy. That figure is challenged by sustainable energy sources behaving stochastically according to the wind or sunshine. And an investment in a massive capacity of batteries to store renewable energy is very expensive.

The electric car chargers are already part of the infrastructure that can help reduce the need for FCR-D services from fossil fuels and increase the share of renewable energy. Furthermore, adjusting consumption during an electric car's charging does not emit more CO2.

This nation stands out not only for its rich heritage but also as the world's foremost carbon-negative country, setting the standard for environmental stewardship. Contrary to traditional economic measurements, Bhutan's Gross National Happiness (GNH) index prioritizes the spiritual, physical, and social well-being of its citizens, alongside cultural and environmental conservation. This philosophy is enshrined in the constitution, mandating that at least 60% of its land remains forested for future generations - a natural advantage for carbon sequestration.

Bhutan's vast forests, carpeting 72.3% of its land, serve as ecological and biodiversity havens, and crucially, massive carbon sinks. These verdant expanses absorb more carbon dioxide (CO2) than the country emits, making Bhutan a carbon-negative nation. Forests hold immense spiritual and economic significance here, revered as sacred places and contributing to a circular economy through resources like timber and non-timber forest products, while offering vital ecosystem services. Showcasing its unwavering commitment, Bhutan etched its name in the Guinness World Records in 2015 when a dedicated team of 100 volunteers in the capital city, Thimphu, planted an astonishing 49,672 trees in just one hour.

The country's abundant rivers generate low-carbon hydroelectricity which it exports generously to neighbouring countries, significantly reducing regional emissions. In 2021, Bhutan produced nearly 11,000 GWh of electricity and exported over 80%, projecting to offset 22.4 million tons of CO2 emissions in the region by 2025 through hydroelectricity exports. Bhutan's commitment to sustainability is evident in its embrace of renewable energy technologies, including grid-tied solar projects like the one at the UN House in Thimphu. These initiatives not only showcase the viability of solar energy but also enhance Bhutan's energy security by diversifying its energy sources, potentially reducing dependence on climate-vulnerable hydropower.

Bhutan's innovative approach to technology and innovation fosters accurate, efficient, secure and transparent carbon markets, aligning with Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. Rooted in Buddhist beliefs, Bhutan's unique conservation strategy emphasizes harmony with nature and respect for all living beings, driving its unwavering commitment to preserving natural resources. Bhutan's success in achieving carbon negativity has inspired global emulation, catalyzing a movement towards sustainability. However, the world still grapples with the challenge of excessive CO2 emissions, with China, the United States, India, Russia, and Japan leading as top emitters, while even countries like Pakistan contribute to this pressing issue.

However, amidst the progress made by countries like Iceland, Costa Rica, Denmark, Sweden, Morocco, and Singapore in adopting renewable energy solutions, Pakistan faces substantial hurdles. Positioned 30th on the global carbon index, its heavy reliance on fossil fuels, particularly in electricity generation and agriculture, exacerbates air pollution and climate vulnerabilities. This reliance not only contributes to environmental degradation but also exposes the country to intensified flooding and economic strain due to erratic rainfall patterns. The urgency to address these challenges is underscored by the need for Pakistan to transition towards sustainable energy sources and implement robust climate adaptation measures. Without prompt action, the country risks facing increasingly severe environmental and socio-economic consequences.

Learning from Bhutan's success in forest conservation and eco-tourism can bolster Pakistan's carbon sinks and advance sustainable development. Leveraging its vast hydropower potential can diminish fossil fuel reliance and enhance energy security. Engaging local communities through conservation efforts and education fosters environmental stewardship. Individual actions such as using public transport, renewable energy, and adopting a plant-based diet contribute to emission reduction. Collective efforts, coupled with clear targets like achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, pave the way for a sustainable Pakistan. Encouraging businesses to adopt sustainable practices is crucial. Implementing these strategies at all levels can foster a healthier planet and a more sustainable future for all.

Jesper Boie Rasmussen, CEO of the company Nerve Smart Systems, has set out to make that dream come true.

""I'm absolutely convinced that we will accelerate the green transition. We've developed a technology that enables us to set up high-power chargers in many more places in Denmark without overloading the electricity grid. In fact, they are able to help the electricity grid when it's under pressure,"" he says.

The high-power charger solution, which is a combination of a high-power charger and a battery, provide charging of electric vehicles in record time without straining the electricity grid. Depending on the capacity of the car, the charging time typically corresponds to a coffee break. Meanwhile, the price is kept down through, for example, high-power charging with stored electricity from the battery when the electricity grid prices are high. Finally, the battery can act as a buffer for the existing electricity grid when the demand for renewable energy is higher than the production.

""The pressure on the electricity grid is growing because more and more of the conventional power plants are being replaced by wind turbines and solar cells. Wind and solar energy depends on the wind blowing and the sun shining, so when production drops, it is difficult to match the demand for electricity. The battery is brilliant at filling that gap,"" explains Jesper Boie Rasmussen.

He believes that supplementing with batteries can constitute an alternative to an otherwise costly upgrade of the existing electricity grid. While the charging station operator can make money by supplying renewable energy to the electricity grid from the batteries, society can save some of the DKK 110 billion that an upgrade of the electricity grid will cost, according to the latest analysis from Ramboll.

The high-power charger from Nerve Smart Systems has not yet been rolled out on a large scale, but it has been fully developed, thoroughly tested, and supplied to the first customers in Denmark, including the energy company OK. Looking back, Jesper Boie Rasmussen would not have succeeded without help.

""I will be the first to admit that it has been a long journey. But we're now in a place where the product is good, and this is not least thanks to a number of joint projects we've had with DTU,"" he says.

For example, DTU has contributed with thorough testing of the solution in the University's experimental energy laboratory PowerLabDK. Here, the high-power charger battery has been connected to a model of the energy system, and, by testing the response of the battery to various electricity grid conditions, such as fluctuations in voltages and frequency, DTU's researchers have been able to identify faults and deficiencies.

""We've used our equipment and knowledge to perform all the tests necessary to obtain an approval to connect to the electricity grid and supply energy. In the end, Energinet, which owns the electricity grid in Denmark, was able to rubberstamp the solution and say yes, now you have the right to operate the battery system,"" says Mattia Marinelli, Head of Section and Associate Professor at DTU Wind.",indiaeducationdiary.in,news,"India Education,Education News India,Education News  | India Education Diary",,0.2705882352941176,453921359,46,https://indiaeducationdiary.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/denmark.jpg?w=640,eng-9589358

Those concerns are fully justified, as those data centers consume as much as 1.5% of all the electricity generated in the world today. That number could increase dramatically if the use of artificial intelligence expands as expected. There is a secondary concern associated with data centers, namely what to do with the heat created by all those chips, microprocessors, and servers? Google announced this week that it will send the waste heat from its data center in Hamina, Finland, to that community's district heating system.

The company says it expects the exported heat will provide 80% of the warmth needed to keep the homes and offices in Hamina cozy in the winter. The Google facility in Hamina gets 97% of its electricity from renewable sources, which means that captured heat will also be 97% carbon free. According to Ilari Soosalu, the mayor of Hamina: ""Google and the city of Hamina have a long and flourishing history together. Google is an excellent example of a company with strong sustainable future orientation. It feels good to be the hometown of Google in Finland.""

Here's a helpful video put together by Google to explain how the heat sharing system will work.

To date, the heat from Google's Hamina data center has been captured and recovered to heat the offices and buildings onsite. Starting next year, the warm temperature coming from the data center will be recovered to optimize the district heating network's energy efficiency and carbon emissions footprint. Google is aiming to achieve net zero emissions across all of its operations and value chain by 2030, supported by an ambitious clean energy goal to run all its offices and data centers on 24/7 carbon-free energy. This project helps bring it closer to achieving this goal while also supporting Finland's long standing commitment to environmental sustainability and technological innovation.

Google, Amazon, & Waste Heat

Why isn't Google doing this in more places? Primarily because many communities do not rely on district heating systems, which distributes heat from where it is created to where it is needed. Typically, those systems use the heat to warm a fluid -- usually water -- which is then pumped through insulated underground pipes to where it is needed. There, the warmed fluid is used to heat the ambient air, which is then distributed throughout a home or commercial space. The whole process is not particularly energy efficient, but it is far better than letting that heat escape into the atmosphere.

District heating tends to be used primarily in colder regions where communities are densely populated. The whole concept is not all that different from the days when living quarters and barns were combined so the heat of the animals would help keep the inhabitants warm. Google is not the only company that relies on huge server farms to keep track of all the information its business creates. Amazon is another one that has a voracious appetite for electricity to run its data centers. That means it also has a lot of excess heat it needs to get rid of.

Last year, in cooperation with Codema, the energy agency for Dublin, Ireland, Amazon participated in a project to upgrade the local district heating system in part of the city. Now students at Technological University Dublin and residents of the nearby Dublin County Council housing facility are being kept warm in part by waste heat from the Amazon data center in Dublin. The new facility replaces many of the old methane-fired boilers that used to heat those buildings. ""It's essentially a plug and play replacement for gas boilers,"" says John O'Shea, who leads the heat and electricity division at Codema. ""It operates at similar temperatures, so they don't need to undergo massive fabric upgrades or change radiator sizes. They can just take advantage of it.""

O'Shea and his team at Codema estimate the project is saving 1,400 tons of CO2 emissions every year, which equals a reduction of about 60% compared to the previous system of individual onsite boilers. Once fully operational, the system is expected to heat 47,000 square meters of local public buildings, 3,000 square meters of commercial buildings, and 135 apartments. Several other residential developers have also expressed interest. By 2050, O'Shea says 87% of buildings in Dublin County could be eligible for similar district heating systems.

The Amazon project in Dublin is just one of a growing number of district heating systems that use waste heat from data centers. That excess heat is a problem for companies like Google and Meta because it requires them to use more electricity to keep their servers cool. But to others, waste heat is a renewable energy source. ""You're basically reusing something that's currently being dumped, so there's no additional climate impact to it,"" O'Shea said.

Meta claims its data center in Odense, Denmark, delivers enough hot water to heat 6,900 local homes. Amazon's headquarters in Seattle has used excess heat from a data center in the Westin Building Exchange since 2019. In March of last year, Microsoft and Fortum, the Finnish energy company that maintains the Dublin system, announced that is was developing a system that would deliver heat to 100,000 Helsinki residents, saving 400,000 tons of carbon dioxide every year.

The Takeaway

Efficiency will be a key consideration in the quest to keep the Earth habitable. We simply no longer have the luxury of driving cars and trucks that waste 70% or more of the energy contained in a gallon of gasoline. Doing so is simply insanity. You wouldn't buy a bottle of expensive champagne and pour most of it down the drain. You wouldn't buy a lobster and throw the tail away. You wouldn't spend good money for a slice of prime rib and throw most of it in the garbage. So why do people think it is OK to waste the majority of the energy they buy with their hard-earned money?

Capturing waste heat makes so much sense, it's amazing more municipalities and companies aren't doing it. My old Irish grandmother used to say, ""One person's trash is another person's treasure."" We humans need to amend our profligate ways to use the energy we have more wisely. Google, Amazon, and others are leading the way, but the rest of us must soon follow or face the consequences. Researchers at the University of New South Wales have calculated that human activity has added heat equivalent to 25 billion atomic bombs to the environment. There is no possible way to argue that such wasteful practices are good for the long term health of our planet.",cleantechnica.com,news,CleanTechnica,Steve Hanley,0.192156862745098,453918129,16,https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Google-data-center-Finland.jpg,eng-9583763

Carbon is one of the most important elements in the world. From providing energy to being in the very food that sustains us, it is abundant everywhere. However, when providing us with energy or materials, we also produce carbon emissions that change our climate.

The 2050 net zero carbon targets are, therefore, vital to humanity's continued existence, and to mitigating the damage that we have already started to cause our planet.

As such, there are many initiatives, programmes, and innovations aimed at reducing carbon emissions. Yet, not as many focus on being completely carbon neutral.

A consortium comprised of nineteen partners in academia and industry, ConsenCUS is a project in Carbon Capture, Utilisation, and Storage (CCUS) that aims to achieve true net zero carbon technologies and make them widely available for industry everywhere.

The locations of these partners include: The Netherlands, Denmark, United Kingdom, Romania, Greece, China, and Canada. They have come together with €13m of funding over four years under the Horizon 2020 programme.

They aim to achieve this by ConsenCUS: CarbOn Neutral cluSters through Electricity-based iNnovations in Capture, Utilisation and Storage.

An example of this is their net-zero Carbon Cluster approach, planning for regions that employ CCUS technologies and bringing together industries, users, storage, and local communities to not only reduce carbon emissions, but bring them down to net zero. The core ingredients of these Clusters will be as follows:

Using environmentally friendly chemicals and, crucially, renewable electricity, carbon emissions will be captured in industry, such as within factories. Water-soluble potassium hydroxide will be used as a sorbent to capture carbon dioxide molecules, and will be easy to separate again using a 'pH swing.'

From there, the carbon dioxide molecules can be electrochemically converted into much more useful and less harmful chemicals, such as potassium formate. Potassium formate can be used as a preservative, or can be used in protein or fuel production.

Using (renewable) electricity for both the CO2 capture and conversion process allows for an overall net-zero carbon process, which does not rely on residual or fossil heat like competitive technologies.

With the amount of carbon dioxide currently being produced, it is unlikely that all of it will be able to be converted into more useful things. This is what makes carbon storage important, as it still cannot just simply be released into the atmosphere.

The subsurface is under investigation to make storage areas for carbon dioxide, and is showing promising results. ConsenCUS is modelling whether certain types of rock may be suitable for permanent, but also temporary carbon dioxide storage, in case there will be a need for it in the future.

All these aspects will be connected safely and efficiently via secure transportation networks between the emitters, users, and communities, utilising pipelines, trucks or ships. Planning such infrastructure for two clusters (North-West and South-East Europe) is one of the key activities in ConsenCUS.

To understand what citizens within the Net Zero Carbon Clusters think about CCUS as a technology, an array of community events are being organised in the Netherlands, Denmark, the UK, Greece, and Romania.

The goals of the community events are to understand the awareness, concerns, and needs of community members concerning the ConsenCUS project's industrial innovations and CCUS developments more generally. Furthermore, insights and knowledge of community members will help better understand what social, economic, and environmental benefits, risks, and impacts CCUS can have for communities.

To learn from and understand different communities' perspectives about CCUS, one of the methods used is a conversation game called PlayDecide. The game is useful when introducing and discussing complex issues and technologies with groups of people who do not have in-depth technical information about a topic.

In 2023, the ConsenCUS demonstration plant was opened at Aalborg Portland's cement factory in Aalborg, Denmark. This demonstration plant is designed to capture up to 100kg of CO2 per hour and has already shown that carbon dioxide emissions can successfully be captured and converted into formate or formic acid, all through using renewable electricity. This monumental achievement shows that this technology is not only viable, but also has the potential to be scaled up.

More optimisation will be done on this plant, as it moves to two more sites within two different industries that need to get to net-zero emissions: The oil refinery site of OMV Petrom near Ploiesti, Romania, and Grecian Magnesite in Yerakini, Greece, who along with Aalborg Portland, have all committed to developing and utilising these techniques for a better, carbon-neutral future. The focus for the second and third demonstration campaigns is to reach competitive specific energy consumption (again, with electricity rather than heat-based), the proposed scale, and to demonstrate versatility with respect to the flue gas of different industries.

The information from this demonstration plant will also inform engagement with local communities and the impact of CCUS upon them.

Also in 2023, the first Policy Paper was published based on the findings so far. This paper goes over the preliminary outcomes of the ConsenCUS project, and discusses the considerations to be made when deploying CCUS technologies throughout the EU. These considerations are as follows:

These considerations show a commitment to both net zero carbon technologies, but also ensuring that the people and environment in surrounding areas are happy and involved with ConsenCUS' work.

The ConsenCUS project is in its final stages now, and with an active demonstration plant and developing policies, is confident that it can lead the way in CCUS technology and make the world a better place.

The Agrotunnel vertical farm provides optimum growing conditions monitored by AI, and meets electricity needs with proprietary solar panels.

We've seen a bunch of kitchen growing devices over the years, designed to produce crop after crop of fresh greens throughout the year. Many of these have been crowdfunders, but there have also been startups and household names getting in on the indoor farming idea.

The Agrotunnel project is aiming for food production at larger scales, stacking rows of produce inside a large unit in a similar fashion to vertical farms in Denmark, Dubai and France among others.

This time Western University professor Dr. Joshua Pearce and the Free Appropriate Sustainable Technology (FAST) research group are looking to solve year-round berry production issues caused by climate change and severe weather.

As well as moving the farm indoors for year-round harvests of berries from hybrid vertical aeroponic and hydroponic systems, the team is also tapping into the power of the sun to meet electricity needs.

The Agrotunnel features a fiber-reinforced polymer shell that encloses a fully sealed chamber, and is topped by proprietary semi-transparent photovoltaic panels developed by Dr. Pearce's WIRED (Western Innovation for Renewable Energy Deployment) initiative.

More panels have been installed around the university's Environmental Sciences Field Station where the project is based, which also help shield outdoor plants from extreme weather. All up, the electricity provided by the PV panels is sufficient to power the optimized LED grow lights, water pumps, heat pumps and the AI-powered monitoring hardware so that the experimental farm can operate without drawing energy from the grid.

""Our moveable Agrotunnel, Better Grow Lights and aeroponic/hydroponic growing system, combined with Dr. Pearce's unique agrivoltaics system, creates an energy efficient, climate-controlled growing space that can handle severe climate and Canadian weather,"" said Kim Parker, president and CEO of Food Security Structures Canada. ""This project addresses food insecurity by empowering individuals and communities to grow their own food locally, year-round, regardless of climate or location."" Parker told CBC that the company is looking to deploy Agrotunnels throughout Canada at some point in the future, assuming all the experimental data matches expectations.

Five types of berry are being grown indoors and outdoors - strawberries, blueberries, honeyberries, gooseberries, boysenberries. The outdoor crops will be tested ""under different strengths of solar cells to find optimal conditions for outdoor growth as compared to indoors.""

The setup is reported to be ""modular, scalable and adaptable to various locations and extreme climate conditions,"" and could potentially provide fresh produce to remote communities throughout the year without the need to transport goods over long distances by road.

The Agrotunnel/Agrivoltaics project is part of the Homegrown Innovation Challenge launched in 2022 by the Weston Family Foundation, where 11 teams were each given CAD 1 million to test concepts for extending the growing seasons of berries in Canada.

A quarter of all webpages that existed at one point between 2013 and 2023 are no longer accessible, as of October 2023. In most cases, this is because an individual page was deleted or removed on an otherwise functional website.

For older content, this trend is even starker. Some 38% of webpages that existed in 2013 are not available today, compared with 8% of pages that existed in 2023.

This ""digital decay"" occurs in many different online spaces. We examined the links that appear on government and news websites, as well as in the ""References"" section of Wikipedia pages as of spring 2023. This analysis found that:

* 23% of news webpages contain at least one broken link, as do 21% of webpages from government sites. News sites with a high level of site traffic and those with less are about equally likely to contain broken links. Local-level government webpages (those belonging to city governments) are especially likely to have broken links.

* 54% of Wikipedia pages contain at least one link in their ""References"" section that points to a page that no longer exists.

To see how digital decay plays out on social media, we also collected a real-time sample of tweets during spring 2023 on the social media platform X (then known as Twitter) and followed them for three months. We found that:

* Nearly one-in-five tweets are no longer publicly visible on the site just months after being posted. In 60% of these cases, the account that originally posted the tweet was made private, suspended or deleted entirely. In the other 40%, the account holder deleted the individual tweet, but the account itself still existed.

* Certain types of tweets tend to go away more often than others. More than 40% of tweets written in Turkish or Arabic are no longer visible on the site within three months of being posted. And tweets from accounts with the default profile settings are especially likely to disappear from public view.

...We found that 25% of all the pages we collected from 2013 through 2023 were no longer accessible as of October 2023. This figure is the sum of two different types of broken pages: 16% of pages are individually inaccessible but come from an otherwise functional root-level domain; the other 9% are inaccessible because their entire root domain is no longer functional.

Rio Grande do Sul, a state home to almost 11 million people, has witnessed the most extensive climate catastrophe in its history and one of the greatest in Brazil's recent history.

Over the course of 10 days at the end of April and beginning of May, the region recorded between a third and almost half of the yearly rainfall predicted - between 500 and 700 millimetres, depending on the area, according to measurements by Metsul Meteorologia.

The storm caused the Taquari, Caí, Pardo, Jacuí, Sinos, and Gravataí rivers - tributaries of the Guaíba - to overflow.

According to the Civil Defence, there are more than 100 people dead, more than 130 missing, and nearly 400 people injured in 425 affected municipalities.

At least 232,125 people have left their homes: 67,542 are in shelters, and 164,583 are homeless or temporarily staying with family or friends. Cities such as Eldorado do Sul, Roca Sales, and Canoas were partly flooded, and villages such as Cruzeiro do Sul were devastated in what the state governor, Eduardo Leite, described as ""the greatest catastrophe of all"".

Porto Alegre, the state capital and one of Brazil's largest urban centres, is one of the worst-affected cities. On 5 May, the level of the Guaíba River, which runs through the city, reached a record of 5.35 meters, surpassing the 4.76 meters reached during the historic floods of 1941.

Neighbourhoods close to the river were submerged. The airport closed, and power and water-treatment plants went down, causing electricity and drinking water shortages in several areas. A dam in a northern suburb failed and flooded a large portion of the city.

Viewed from an army helicopter, the neighbouring city of Eldorado do Sul looks like a set of canals stretching along narrow strips of land and buildings. About 90% of the city is underwater. Along the BR-290 highway, one of the most critical roads in the country's south, hundreds of people are waiting for transport to shelters.

everything comes at a price, and the one attached to the GLP-1 agonist drugs is enormous. Indeed, the more effective they turn out to be in treating a variety of chronic and life-shortening ailments, the higher the looming costs to health insurers and governments. Battles about the prices of innovative drugs are nothing new, but this one is on another financial scale.

The drugs are now testing the rule that no product can be too successful. If they were as cheap and convenient as blood pressure pills and statins, they might soon be routinely prescribed. But they are far from it: Wegovy's list price in the US is $15,600 per year, although insurers obtain discounts. There is a widening gulf between benefit and affordability.

Bernie Sanders, the democratic socialist US senator, this week released a study that claimed these drugs had ""the potential to bankrupt Medicare, Medicaid and the entire [US] healthcare system"". He wants Novo Nordisk to reduce the US price of Wegovy to the much lower one in Denmark but, even there, the government only provides limited coverage for severe obesity.

It was easier for governments and insurers to hold the financial line before studies showed benefits beyond simply curbing obesity. But the US Food and Drug Administration approved Wegovy for heart disease risk in March, opening coverage for older Americans under Medicare. If it does what trials show, cost alone may become the chief obstacle to mass adoption.

Still, the fact that something is useful does not make it worth the price. It is extremely valuable to an individual to avoid a heart attack that debilitates or kills them, but that does not mean a government should provide the same treatment more widely to limit the risk to millions of people. There is a hard financial calculation to be made.

...The potential cost of prescribing such drugs to all obese Americans could exceed $1tn, [economics professor Jonathan] Gruber has estimated. Yet obesity also has high costs, not just to healthcare systems but to societies and economies.

In July last year, OpenAI announced the formation of a new research team that would prepare for the advent of supersmart artificial intelligence capable of outwitting and overpowering its creators. Ilya Sutskever, OpenAI's chief scientist and one of the company's cofounders, was named as the colead of this new team. OpenAI said the team would receive 20% of its computing power.

Now OpenAI's ""superalignment team"" is no more, the company confirms. That comes after the departures of several researchers involved, Tuesday's news that Sutskever was leaving the company, and the resignation of the team's other colead. The group's work will be absorbed into OpenAI's other research efforts.

Sutskever's departure made headlines because although he'd helped CEO Sam Altman start OpenAI in 2015 and set the direction of the research that led to ChatGPT, he was also one of the four board members who fired Altman in November. Altman was restored as CEO five chaotic days later after a mass revolt by OpenAI staff and the brokering of a deal in which Sutskever and two other company directors left the board.

Hours after Sutskever's departure was announced on Tuesday, Jan Leike, the former DeepMind researcher who was the superalignment team's other colead, posted on X that he had resigned.

Neither Sutskever nor Leike responded to requests for comment. Sutskever did not offer an explanation for his decision to leave but offered support for OpenAI's current path in a post on X. ""The company's trajectory has been nothing short of miraculous, and I'm confident that OpenAI will build AGI that is both safe and beneficial"" under its current leadership, he wrote.

Entrepreneur and Andreessen Horowitz partner Chris Dixon recently released a book espousing the benefits of the blockchain, NFTs, and web3, entitled Read Write Own -- and it's getting mixed reviews.

From the highly critical Molly White complaining that ""Dixon fails to identify a single blockchain project that has successfully provided a non-speculative service at any kind of scale,"" to the more commendatory by David Z. Morris calling it ""an optimistic read,"" it's safe to say Dixons literary efforts are dividing opinion.

However, regardless of how you feel about a16z, Dixon, or the future of web3, what's clear is that the book did some serious numbers in its first week on bookshelves and via ebook sales. Indeed, the nonfiction title sold more copies this week than Britney Spears' autobiography, The Woman in Me, and slightly fewer than bestselling author Donald L. Miller's Masters of the Air, landing at number nine on the New York Times (NYT) Best Seller list.

Unfortunately, the revered ranking comes with a very serious caveat, namely that the NYT itself suspects that the title managed to get ranked by gaming the system.

The list only adds a 'dagger' to titles it believes have, in some way, attempted to present more sales than real demand, a concept a16z is extremely familiar with.

...The NYT states that including a dagger on the Best Seller list implies ""institutional, special interest, group or bulk purchases,"" and that such a dubious distinction only comes after ""proprietary vetting and audit protocols, corroborative reporting and other statistical determinations.""

The high upfront costs and burden on consumers of adding nuclear to Australia's energy mix have been confirmed in an independent review.

Building nuclear reactors would cost six times more than wind and solar power firmed up with batteries, according to the independent report released on Saturday by the Clean Energy Council.

""We support a clear-eyed view of the costs and time required to decarbonise Australia and right now, nuclear simply doesn't stack up,"" the industry body's chief executive Kane Thornton said.

Taxpayers needed to understand the decades of costs if they were forced to foot the bill for building a nuclear industry from scratch, Mr Thornton warned.

The analysis prepared by construction and engineering experts Egis also found nuclear energy had poor economic viability in a grid dominated by renewable energy.

Renewable energy will provide 82% of the national electricity market under current targets for 2030, which is at least a decade before any nuclear could theoretically be operational.

Further, nuclear power stations are not designed to ramp up and down to align with renewable energy generation.

Adding to the cost challenges, Australia has no nuclear energy industry because it is prohibited under commonwealth and state laws, which would all need to be changed.

Oliver Johnson on avian flu mortality rates in human:

""

Take COVID for example. If I go to the UKHSA dashboard then I will see that the latest figures are 2,343 cases and 92 deaths in a week. Crudely dividing one by another suggests a case fatality rate of about 5%. Doing a better estimate, taking into account lags and rising and falling trajectories, the most recent deaths probably relate to a time around early April when cases were perhaps half that. So we could perhaps even argue for a case fatality rate in the 8-10% region.

And yet ...pre-vaccine the COVID infection fatality rate was much lower than this (perhaps of the order of 1%). Now, it's likely that the true value is perhaps somewhere in the 0.01-0.05% range. In other words, our dashboard-derived case fatality rate estimate is something like 200 to 500 times too high.

There's a simple explanation for this: nobody is testing any more! The vast majority of reported cases arise at the hospital admissions stage, so are hugely skewed to the most serious infections and the most vulnerable people. People for whom COVID is somewhat like a case of flu don't tend to show up in the data - even those who do take an lateral flow test don't have an easy mechanism for reporting the result.

So, returning to bird flu, I believe that it's likely that similar things are going on (as Whipple suggested). Looking again at the WHO table you can see that the vast majority of the reported cases (861 out of 888) took place before 2014, the majority of them in countries like Indonesia, Vietnam and Egypt which locally reported a very high case fatality rate at the time. While this data is valid in a sense, it's not clear to me that an estimate which is heavily weighted to decade-old estimates of a healthcare-dependent quantity (dominated by these kinds of countries) is representative of what the experience might be in the UK now.

Indeed, [Times science editor Tom] Whipple suggests that the estimate might be lower if we did surveillance of all farm workers, rather than just picking up the most serious cases. But that has been happening! For example, the most recent UKHSA surveillance report describes four cases picked up by random sampling: three did not even show symptoms, and one reported a sore throat and myalgia. While four people is a small sample, and so random chance will play a role, it seems hard to reconcile these numbers with a true fatality rate of the claimed 50%.

...So it's definitely right that we take bird flu seriously, and that infectious disease experts should be planning ahead to mitigate the risks. But equally I don't think it helps anyone to be routinely quoting a science fiction sounding fatality rate, without at least thinking a little bit about what that means and how it is derived.

after almost 500 articles in The Wall Street Journal, one thing I've learned from covering the tech industry is that failures are far more instructive. Especially when they're the kind of errors made by many people.

Here's what I've learned from a decade of embarrassing myself in public -- and having the privilege of getting an earful about it from readers.

1. Disruption is overrated

Why are three of the most valuable companies of 2014 -- Microsoft, Apple, and Google -- bigger than ever? How is Meta doing so well even as people have for years been abandoning Facebook, its core product? Why is Twitter still chugging along, no matter what its new owner gets up to?

The short answer is that disruption is overrated. The most-worshiped idol in all of tech -- the notion that any sufficiently nimble upstart can defeat bigger, slower, sclerotic competitors -- has proved to be a false one.

It's not that disruption never happens. It just doesn't happen nearly as often as we've been led to believe. There are many reasons for this. One is that many tech leaders have internalized a hypercompetitive paranoia -- what Amazon founder Jeff Bezos called ""Day 1"" thinking -- that inspires them to either acquire or copy and kill every possible upstart.

Economic historians have been picking apart the notion of business-model disruption for a long time, and yet hardly a day goes by when a startup, investor, or journalist -- including yours truly -- doesn't trumpet the power of a new technology to completely upend even the biggest and most hidebound of industries.

Don't believe it. In a world in which companies learn from one another faster than ever, incumbents have an ability to reinvent themselves at a pace that simply wasn't possible in the past.

That's only the first; he has four more (human factors, we lie to ourselves about tech's potential, bubbles can be useful, we need to take charge of tech). [The link should be free to read.]

Alan Cowen, CEO of Hume AI, is a former Meta and Google researcher who's built AI technology that can read the tune, timber, and rhythm of your voice, as well as your facial expressions, to discern your emotions.

As you speak with Hume's bot, EVI, it processes the emotions you're showing -- like excitement, surprise, joy, anger, and awkwardness -- and expresses its responses with 'emotions' of its own. Yell at it, for instance, and it will get sheepish and try to diffuse the situation. It will display its calculations on screen, indicating what it's reading in your voice and what it's giving back. And it's quite sticky. Across 100,000 unique conversations, the average interaction between humans and EVI is ten minutes long, a company spokesperson said.

""Every word carries not just the phonetics, but also a ton of detail in its tune, rhythm, and timbre that is very informative in a lot of different ways,"" Cowen told me on Big Technology Podcast last week. ""You can predict a lot of things. You can predict whether somebody has depression or Parkinson's to some extent, not perfectly... You can predict in a customer service call, whether somebody's having a good or bad call much more accurately.""

Hume, which raised $50m in March, already offers the technology that reads emotion in voices via its API, and it has working tech that reads facial expressions that it has yet to release. The idea is to deliver much more data to AI models than they would get by simply transcribing text, enabling them to do a better job of making the end user happy. ""Pretty much any outcome,"" Cowen said, ""it benefits to include measures of voice modulation and not just language.""

...To program 'emotional intelligence' into machine learning models, the Hume team had more than 1 million people use survey platforms and rate how they're feeling, and connected that to their facial expressions and speech. ""We had people recording themselves and rating their expressions, and what they're feeling, and responding to music, and videos, and talking to other participants,"" Cowen said. ""Across all of this data, we just look at what's consistent between different people.""

The present study is part of the ""Tolérance Immunitaire et Paludisme"" (TOLIMMUNPAL) project, conducted from January 2010 to June 2013 in the Beninese district of Allada (Sékou and Attogon health centres), a Southern semi-rural area, where the P. falciparum malaria is hyperendemic with an average of 20.5 infected anopheles bites/person/year [19]. The TOLIMMUNPAL project is a continuation of two other studies: i) a large project called ""Malaria in Pregnancy Preventive Alternative Drugs"" (MiPPAD) and ii) the ""Anemia in Pregnancy: Etiology and Consequences"" (APEC) study. MiPPAD was a clinical trial encompassing 4,749 pregnant women from Benin, Gabon, Mozambique, and Tanzania [20, 21], of whom, 1,005 Beninese women participated. The study evaluated the efficacy and safety of intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy (IPTp) with three arms: a single dose of Mefloquine (MQFD for Full Dose of Mefloquine), a split dose of Mefloquine over 2 days (MQSD for Split-Dose of Mefloquine) and a dose of Sulfadoxine-Pyrimethamine (SP). Four-hundreds of these Beninese pregnant women participated in the APEC study. The study was designed to follow-up the consequences of maternal anaemia on clinical and biological features of their children along the first year of life [22, 23]. The participants of this study were recruited from April 9th 2010 to June 14th 2011. In the TOLIMMUNPAL project, the infants of the APEC study were followed-up for an additional year until the age of 24 months to assess the clinical, genetic, immunological, and environmental determinants of malaria [24]. The study population encompassed only HIV-negative pregnant women and their offspring. Twin pregnancies, pregnancies complicated by stillbirth, or fetal abnormalities were excluded.

Mother-child follow-up

The details of studied sample and the procedures of data collection are described elsewhere [22] [24]. Briefly, 400 pregnant women, receiving their first IPTp at the first antenatal visit (ANV1, at gestational age ≤ 28 weeks), were followed-up until delivery. They received the second dose of IPTp at the second antenatal visit (ANV2, at least one month later). At both ANVs and at delivery, women underwent a clinical examination when thick blood smears (TBS) were collected. Throughout the follow-up, malaria infections were detected with a passive surveillance: women were invited to attend the health centre in case of any complaints. When an axillary temperature was greater than or equal to 37.5 °C, a TBS was performed. Clinical data (gravidity, gestational age), sociodemographic data (age, schooling, and ethnic group) as well as socioeconomic data (possession of a bicycle, a refrigerator, a television, having electricity, having a gainful activity) were collected. At birth, newborn's sex and weight were recorded and gestational age was evaluated using the Ballard score [25]. From birth to 12 months of age, infants were examined at three scheduled visits at 6, 9 and 12 months. During this period, symptomatic malaria cases were also detected at the health centre. Then, from 12 to 24 months, children were actively followed-up with a home visit twice a month. In case of axillary temperature greater than or equal to 37.5 °C (or a history of fever in the preceding 24 h), a rapid diagnosis test (RDT) and a TBS were performed. A scheduled home visit was planned once a month. During each scheduled visit, infants were clinically examined, a TBS was performed to identify asymptomatic infections, and information about the use of mosquito nets was collected. Throughout follow-up, women were invited to bring their children to the health centre for any health concern, where all medications were prescribed free of charge. According to the recommendations of the Beninese National Malaria Control Programme, all malaria cases were treated with artemether-lumefantrine.

Sample collection

From the pregnant women, 5 mL peripheral blood sample (EDTA) from each time point (at ANV1, ANV2 and Delivery) and 5 mL of the cord blood were collected for further analyses. The plasmas were collected for the measurement of Ab levels. The diagnosis of placental malaria (PM) was performed using a placental blood smear stained with Giemsa [20]. From the newborn, 5 mL peripheral blood (EDTA) were drawn during scheduled visits at 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months of age and plasma was collected for the measurement of Ab levels.

Ethical committee.

The institutional review boards of the Comité Consultatif de Déontologie et d'Éthique from the Institut de Recherche pour le Développement (France), the Ethic Committee of the Faculty of Health Sciences (University of Abomey-Calavi, Benin) and the Human Research Ethics Committee of the University Hospital of the Ribeirão Preto Medical School of the University of São Paulo (Brazil) approved all study protocols included in this paper. Before inclusion, the study was explained and written informed consent of women was obtained in the presence of a witness, with thumbprints provided if women could not read and/or write.

Prediction of the environmental risk by entomological and geographical variables

Mosquito exposure was evaluated using a previous developed predictive model taking into account entomological (mosquito captures), geographical (village, distance from a watercourse), climatic (season, rainfall between two monthly visits, number of rainy days in the 10 days before the visit), and environmental data (type of roof and wall of the house, characteristics of its immediate surroundings, normalized difference vegetation index) collected throughout the follow-up [26]. The mosquitoes were caught during two consecutive nights by month in the house of 180 out of the 400 infant's bedrooms, using Centre for Disease Control light traps, from April 2011 to February 2013. The selection of 180 bedrooms was made on the basis of homogeneous geographical distribution. This predictive model allowed the estimation a quantitative risk of mosquito exposure for each child once a month, at the date of each scheduled visit. A high level of this variable indicates a high mosquito exposure.

Measurement of antibody concentrations

IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgM concentrations against candidate P. falciparum asexual vaccine antigens (AMA-1, MSP-1, MSP2-3D7, MSP2-FC27, MSP-3, GLURP-R0 and GLURP-R2) were measured using ELISA, as proposed by the African Malaria Network Trust (AMANET), using plasma collected at ANV1, ANV2, and delivery for the mothers and at birth, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months of age for the infants. The recombinant AMA1 antigen (residues 25-545, obtained through Pichia pastoris) was provided by the Biomedical Primate Research Centre (Rijswijk, The Netherlands). The MSP-1 antigen was produced in Paris by Institut Pasteur through a Baculovirus/insect cell system and was composed by two peptides (amino acids 1-43 and 1615-1723, Uganda-Palo-Alto strain). The MSP2 antigens (3D7 and FC27, without the secretion signal and the GPI anchor) were produced at the University of La Trobe (Melbourne, Australia). MSP3 (amino acids 212-380, F32 strain), GLURP-R0 (amino acids 25-514, F32 strain) and GLURP-R2 (amino acids 705-1178, F32 strain) were obtained through Escherichia coli by the Statens Serum Institute (Copenhagen, Denmark). The selection of these antigens including in AMANET network is in order to use a standardized protocol to facilitate result comparison between different teams.

Briefly, the 96 well plates (Nunc MaxiSorp, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Roskilde, Denmark) were coated with 1 μg/mL of the vaccine candidate antigen in PBS and incubated at 4◦C overnight. Plates were washed using buffer (PBS with 0.1% Tween-20 and 0.5 M NaCl) and the reaction was blocked for one hour using 3% powdered-milk with 0.1% Tween 20 and PBS. Diluted plasma samples (1X PBS with 1% powdered-milk, 0.1% Tween-20 and 0.2% NaN3) were added, followed by two hours of incubation at room temperature. Maternal samples and cord blood were diluted 1/100 for all antigens, except AMA-1, for which the dilution was 1/2000, while in children plasma samples, the dilution was 1/50 for all antigens, except AMA-1, which was 1/1000. After washing, the peroxidase conjugated sheep anti-human IgG1 (The Binding Site, 330372A) in dilution buffer (1:5000), sheep anti-human IgG2 (The Binding Site, 326,187) in dilution buffer (1:2000), sheep anti-human IgG3 (The Binding site, 327,290) in dilution buffer (1:5000), goat anti-human IgM (The Binding Site, 1111791C) in dilution buffer (1:3000) were added to the plate and incubated for one hour at room temperature. The reaction was revealed with the use of TMB (3, 30, 5, 50 tetramethylbenzidine, Kem-En-Tec, Copenhagen, Denmark) as substrate and stopped with 0.2 M H2SO4.

Purified human IgG1, IgG2, and IgM proteins with well-known concentrations (pg/mL) served as standards, starting from 500; 250; 125; 62.5; 31.3; 15.6; 7.8 to 3.9 pg/mL, while for IgG3 the concentrations started from 100; 50; 25; 12.5; 6.25; 3.13; 1.56 to 0.78 pg/mL. ODs were measured at 450 nm and analysed with ADAMSEL FLP b039 software (http://www.emvda.org/portfolio/project-index/optimalvac-project completed) for determination of Ab concentrations. The samples were re-evaluated when the coefficient of variation between the discordant duplicates exceeded 15%.

Statistical analyses

All statistical analyses were performed using the R [27] and the Rstudio v 1.0.153 softwares [28]. Prior to analyses, data regarding Ab concentrations were log-transformed except for the analysis of Ab transfer, which was evaluated as the ratio between the neonatal and maternal Ab concentrations. After log-transformation, Ab concentrations exhibited a Gaussian distribution. For all analyses, the threshold value for statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.

Antibody dynamics analyses

Anti-asexual stage Ab concentrations were analysed considering different time points and different settings of the follow-up, including the following comparisons: i) At ANV1, ANV2, and delivery to evaluate the dynamics of Ab response along gestation, ii) At delivery (peripheral blood for the mother and cord blood for the newborn) to evaluate the transfer of Ab from mother to the newborn, iii) At different time points (at 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months) to evaluate the production of Abs during the first two-years of life. Paired t-tests were used to perform a comparison of Ab concentrations between mothers and infants at delivery, whereas a linear mixed model was used to make a pairwise comparison of Ab concentration at several time points during pregnancy and during infancy. Using the packages lme4 [29] and emmeans [30], the linear mixed model allowed to determine the differences between time-points, and the significance of the pairwise differences was evaluated with the Tukey method. The correlations between Ab concentrations of the peripheral blood (mother) and the cord blood (newborn) were also performed using the Pearson correlation coefficient.

Analyses of maternal antibody transfer

The transfer of maternal Abs was estimated by the ratio between the Ab concentrations observed in the cord blood (newborn) and in the peripheral blood (mother). Non-parametric tests were used to compare the Ab transfer between IgG subclasses for each antigen and between antigens for each subclass. In order to identify the factors influencing the maternal Ab transfer, a multiple linear regression was used after exclusion of atypical values exhibiting a ratio > 2. The following factors that may influence the maternal Ab transfer were: the age of the mother (in four 5-years groups), ethnic group, Ballard score, gravidity (primigravidae versus multigravidae), the concentrations of anti-asexual stage Abs at ANV2 and at delivery, the transmission season at ANV2, the presence of a malaria infection during pregnancy, the number of infections during pregnancy, the presence of an infection between ANV2 and delivery, placental malaria, and the arm of IPTp clinical trial. Univariate analyses were performed for each of the 28 Ab responses studied (three subclasses of IgG and IgM measured against seven antigens). Afterwards, a multivariate model was defined by type of Ab response (IgG1, IgG2, and IgG3). Factors included in multivariate models were those exhibiting a p < 0.05 in the univariate analyses for at least one of the seven antigen responses. Multicolinearity in the multivariate model was checked using the variance inflation factor (VIF).

The protection of antibodies against malaria infection

The protective association conferred by antibodies is defined here as a correlation between the control of malaria susceptibility risk (delay in the occurrence of first P. falciparum infection, decrease in episodes of malaria over a period of time or placental malaria) and the concentration of specific antibody responses. In all analyses, Ab concentrations were considered as a quantitative variable. The effect of the concentration of each Ab response was tested in a multivariate model including the covariates associated with the risk of malaria infections. The covariates considered in the multivariate analyses and the statistical methods used for these analyses are detailed in Additional file 1. Environmental risk was taken into account in the analysis of the protective role of antibodies in mothers and infants, but in different manner. For mothers, the analyses were adjusted for the season of transmission at ANV2, while for infants, the analyses were adjusted for the risk of environmental exposure, as described above, and the season of transmission (rainy season of 2010, 2011 and 2012).

The protective role of maternal Abs during pregnancy was evaluated against peripheral infections, between ANV2 and delivery, and against placental infection detected at delivery. To assess protection against peripheral malaria infections, the number of days after ANV2 until reinfection was the dependent variable in the model. A Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to evaluate the effect of Ab concentrations in P. falciparum reinfection. The R package survival [31] was used to perform Cox regressions and to check the proportional hazards assumption. The protective role of maternal Abs was assessed at ANV2, because at this time: i) all women had received a second dose of IPTp as part of the clinical trial, abrogating the influence of a putative ongoing malaria infection, and ii) more infections occurred between ANV2 and delivery when compared to ANV1 and ANV2. To assess whether concentrations of maternal Abs protect against placental infection (a binary outcome), a logistic regression was used.

Malaria infections were classified as symptomatic or asymptomatic. A symptomatic infection was defined as the presence of fever (or a history of fever) and a positive RDT and/or a positive TBS. An asymptomatic infection was defined as a positive TBS without fever (or a history of fever) and without the diagnosis of a symptomatic malaria episode within the next three days. The effect of Ab response concentrations was evaluated on the time to occurrence of the first malaria infection (symptomatic or asymptomatic), using a Cox-proportional hazards regression model. In addition, the protective effect of maternal Abs was analysed using a negative binomial regression, counting the number of symptomatic malaria episodes up to the age of 18 months and counting the number of symptomatic episodes on the entire follow-up. After each malaria episode, an exclusion period of 14 days was defined because infants were not at risk due to the anti-malarial treatment.

The protective effect of Ab concentrations, detected at 12 and 18 months of age, was evaluated analysing the time to infection during the six-month periods after blood sampling using a Cox proportional hazards regression model. Thus analyses were performed between 12 and 18 months (for blood collection at the age of 12 months), and between 18 and 24 months (for blood collection at the age of 18 months). Children harbouring malaria infection on the day of blood collection or 14 days before were not included in the analysis to avoid influence on the immunological data.

The protective role of infant' Abs was assessed in different subgroups: 1) malaria exposed infants; 2) exposed infants with at least one malaria infection before blood collection, and 3) exposed infants with one recent malaria infection (in the last three months). Malaria exposed infants were defined as those experiencing at least two malaria infections during the entire follow-up [32]. The Ab protective effect was investigated in infants infected before blood collection based on the assumption that infants without malaria infection were unable to develop their own Abs.

For the analyses regarding the protection of antibodies against malaria infection, 28 hypotheses were tested, corresponding to the 28 Ab responses studied. Results were not corrected for multiple testing as this study was considered as explanatory, designed to generate new hypotheses [33]. Furthermore, applying Bonferroni or Benjamini-Hochberg corrections would be over conservative, leading to a significant reduction in the study's ability to assess true differences. Indeed, computations of these corrections assume that the multiple tests are independent. However, Ab concentrations of the different antigens are correlated, as are the Ab concentrations of IgG subclasses (mainly IgG1 and IgG3). The results highlighted were those exhibiting multiple lines of evidence (among the Ab responses or among the outcomes studied).",malariajournal.biomedcentral.com,news,BioMed Central,,0.0980392156862746,453834552,7,https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1186%2Fs12936-024-04970-7/MediaObjects/12936_2024_4970_Fig1_HTML.png,

Statkraft, Europe's largest renewable energy producer, said this month that it was reviewing its annual targets for new renewables capacity, while Portuguese energy company EDP is cutting back its plans, citing high interest rates and lower power prices.

At the same time, Denmark's Ørsted -- the world's largest offshore wind developer -- has slashed its renewable targets for 2030 by more than 10GW, enough to supply potentially millions of homes, after it was forced to abandon two large projects in the US because of rising costs.

""We are seeing continued growth [of renewables], but at a slower pace,"" Birgitte Ringstad Vartdal, chief executive of Statkraft, which is owned by the Norwegian state, told the Financial Times.

Spanish energy giant Iberdrola said in April it would adopt a more ""selective"" approach to renewables and increase its focus on electricity grids. It no longer has an 80GW renewables target for 2030, but highlights its pipeline of 100GW.

Italian utility Enel announced in November that it would cut its investment in renewables, from €17bn between 2023 and 2025 to €12.1bn between 2024 and 2026. However, the company said it planned to continue increasing renewables capacity with partners to reach its target of 73GW by 2026.

""There has been a big reality check around renewables growth,"" said Norman Valentine, head of renewables research at consultancy Wood Mackenzie. ""There's been a huge change in the cost environment.""

The picture is not universal: Germany's RWE significantly increased its renewables target in November last year, from 50GW by 2030 to 65GW.

There is a growing political focus on the need to develop renewables, with countries agreeing at the COP28 climate summit in November to work towards tripling capacity to 11,000GW by 2030.

However, rising interest rates over the past few years have pushed up the costs of financing new projects, creating difficulties for some developers. Raw material costs have also risen, while in some markets, electricity prices have fallen. The often slow process of regulatory approval also creates challenges.

Some companies, including Enel, have said they want to invest more in upgrading electricity networks, which will be vital in the transition from fossil fuel to clean electric power. Iberdrola is planning to spend about 60 per cent of a planned €41bn of investment in the electricity grid.

Ralph Ibendhal, head of Emea energy transition at RBC Capital Markets, noted that high interest rates meant renewables developers had to compete harder for investors.

""A 7-9 per cent return at project level looks less attractive when base rates are 5 per cent,"" he said. ""Many utilities also have opportunities to invest in other areas of their business (such as regulated networks) instead.""

Deepa Venkateswaran, head of utilities at Bernstein, said that companies were investing more in networks in the expectation of improved returns given their importance to the energy transition.

Iberdrola and French utility Engie have also recently cut or delayed targets for producing ""green"" hydrogen -- a potential replacement for fossil fuels in several industries that is heavily dependent on subsidies. Iberdrola said it was ""still waiting for funds to come through"" for projects.

Despite the current challenges, Vartdal at Statkraft said she was confident the economics of projects would improve. Ibendhal, at RBC, agreed.

That might change with the help of President Joe Biden's climate law.

Ammonia production is a carbon-intensive process that uses fossil fuels to make the pungent-smelling chemical, which is often used to make fertilizers. But some companies think it could also as a carbon-free fuel for cargo ships or to generate electricity.

Its climate stakes are massive. But so is its potential for clean energy -- because it doesn't release any carbon emissions at the point of use.

A Danish company named Topsoe is planning to build a factory in Virginia that will produce electrolyzers, a device that can make clean hydrogen when powered by solar or wind energy. The electrolyzers will be installed at a new plant in Texas that plans to use the hydrogen to make ""green ammonia,"" which will be sold to a German power company. The Inflation Reduction Act is driving the investments for both facilities by offering billions of dollars through advanced energy programs.

Ammonia production accounts for roughly 2 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. That alone could make the greening of ammonia a massive climate prize. But some experts see bigger solutions: In addition to decarbonizing ammonia for fertilizer, it could also be used to nearly eliminate emissions from oceangoing cargo ships and to replace natural gas and coal in electricity generation.

""We are seeing remarkable progress on these things,"" said Julio Friedmann, an expert on green ammonia and chief scientist at Carbon Direct, which advises companies about reducing their emissions. ""Fundamentally, companies and governments are taking this stuff very seriously. It is across the board.""

The Inflation Reduction Act, with its $370 billion in climate funding, has put the U.S. on the front lines of cleaning up the ammonia industry. A New York-based startup called First Ammonia initially planned on building its first green ammonia plant in Europe. But it changed course after Russia invaded Ukraine and Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act, in 2022.

The company settled on Texas for its first facility, thanks to the state's abundance of renewable energy and its industrial infrastructure along the Gulf of Mexico. It's set to break ground at the Port of Victoria later this year on a plant that can produce 300,000 tons of ammonia annually. The company announced a partnership last year to sell ammonia to Uniper, a German power company.

The operation has been made possible in large part due to the Inflation Reduction Act's clean energy tax credits.

""It significantly reduces the price point at which we need to sell our ammonia to be able to be productive,"" said First Ammonia CEO Joel Moser in an interview. ""So it's a huge step.""

The company sees maritime shipping and electricity generation as growth markets for ammonia, fueling cargo ships and supplementing wind and solar in the power sector.

""That's an ideal future, a future where we've electrified all that we can and the things we can't we're using hydrogen application, specifically ammonia,"" Moser said.

Roughly 180 million tons of ammonia is sold globally every year for more than $100 billion. About 70 percent of it is used for fertilizers, according to the International Energy Agency.

Ammonia, a compound of nitrogen and hydrogen, is historically carbon intensive, and the production of hydrogen is particularly dirty. It relies on using natural gas or coal and accounts for more than 90 percent of the emissions associated with ammonia production, according to a 2022 paper by the Innovation for Cool Earth Forum. By the IEA's estimate, ammonia production is about two times as emission intensive as producing crude steel.

Green hydrogen has emerged as a key to cleaning up ammonia. Electricity is used to split a water molecule into hydrogen and oxygen. If wind or solar technologies are used to supply that power, it is considered ""green"" hydrogen. It has a variety of potential uses, but ammonia production is among the most promising. The consulting firm Wood Mackenzie estimates that roughly 39 percent of announced green hydrogen projects globally would be used to make ammonia, though the firm thinks many of those projects won't be built.

That is where Topsoe, the Danish industrial company, comes in. While not a household name in the U.S., Topsoe is a major player in the chemical industry. The company estimates that a third of global ammonia is made using its technologies. Nearly all of that was traditionally done by using fossil fuels.

But the company is starting to pivot. Armed with a $136 million Inflation Reduction Act tax credit from the Energy Department, Topsoe is planning to build a $400 million electrolyzer factory in Chesterfield, Virginia. Its plans are subject to completing a DOE certification process that can take up to two years. First Ammonia is the company's first customer.

The move to build electrolyzers is a part of a wider shift for Topsoe. Cleaner technologies like biodiesel now account for about a fifth of its revenue, up from nothing four years ago, said Topsoe CEO Roeland Baan. The company is also building a second electrolyzer facility in Denmark.

""We have this enormous portfolio of products and technologies that are useful for the energy transition, and so we decided to make a big pivot,"" Baan said in an interview. ""And we set our vision to be recognized as a leader in decarbonization technologies.""

Green ammonia producers have several factors working in their favor. A global network of ports, ships and pipelines already exist to ship ammonia. The gas is considered a clean fuel because it lacks carbon molecules.

Japan has committed to using green ammonia to help decarbonize its power sector by co-blending it with coal. The government hopes to reach 100 percent ammonia electricity generation by midcentury. The move has encountered resistance from environmental groups, which say using ammonia could extend the life of coal plants.

An even bigger prize may be the marine shipping industry, which releases 2 percent of global emissions. Shipping companies are experimenting with new vessels that burn a blend of diesel and ammonia. Maersk, the international shipping giant, recently ordered four ammonia-fueled vessels with the potential to buy six more. Trafigura, another large shipper, recently ordered six ships.

But hurdles remain. Ammonia has a high ignition temperature; that's one reason it is often blended with another fuel. It is also corrosive. Green ammonia remains more expensive to produce than its fossil fuel-made counterparts. And while burning ammonia doesn't emit carbon dioxide, controls are needed to curtail emissions of another air pollutant, nitrogen oxide.

Current and former Biden administration officials said the tax credits awarded to Topsoe reflect a shift in the government's approach on those issues. DOE has long supported early stage technological research. But the department under Biden is providing additional assistance to companies that are trying to make the jump from the laboratory to the marketplace.

Topsoe was one of 35 projects that received $1.93 billion in tax credits under DOE's Advanced Energy Project Credit. The credits are part of a multifaceted approach, said Costa Samaras, a former Biden administration official who now leads the Institute for Energy Innovation at Carnegie Mellon University.

The credits to Topsoe are aimed at reducing the price of building a manufacturing facility, like the company's electrolyzer plant. Other sources of Inflation Reduction Act money are available to companies like First Ammonia through the Clean Hydrogen Production Tax Credit, to help stimulate demand for climate-friendly products.

""We're now on this glide path to net-zero in 25 ½ years,"" Samaras said. ""So we need the types of clean manufacturing supply chain to deliver the speed and scale of clean equipment, so that we're realizing the emissions reductions within the time frame that we have.""",scientificamerican.com,news,Scientific American,Benjamin Storrow,0.2156862745098038,453820391,13,https://static.scientificamerican.com/dam/m/466a547d8e47e4e0/original/GettyImages-98732175_WEB.jpg?w=1200,eng-9583243

Here are some of the key incentives: Guaranteed pricing for electricity generated from solar power, making it more attractive for homeowners to invest in solar systems. Just imagine, tax exemptions, low-interest loans to homeowners, and subsidies to reduce upfront cost of Solar Home Systems (SHS), net metering.

Picture this: making Green Energy funds available to provide financial support for residential solar projects. Microfinance programmes, making funding available for R&D projects aimed at improving home solar technology. New buildings are now required to include solar panels in their design to obtain utility connections. Yes, rural electrification programmes to promote solar power in rural areas. Is the government of Pakistan going in the opposite direction?

In India, the finance minister, in her Interim Budget 2024-25, has made a commitment to enable one crore households up to 300 units of free electricity through rooftop solarisation. This is what the government of India along with various state governments are implementing: Imagine, up to 40 per cent subsidy on solar panels for residential users under the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) scheme.

One-time capital subsidy for installing rooftop solar systems, net metering, tax benefits, generation-based incentives, zero interest loans, and tax exemptions. Homeowners generating solar power can earn and trade Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) for additional revenue. Solar bonds to raise funds for residential solar projects, community solar programmes, and state renewable purchase obligations. Solar Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs), long-term agreements to buy solar power at predetermined rates, ensuring financial stability for homeowners.

Yes, financial incentives for battery storage, obligations for utilities to purchase a certain percentage of their power from renewable sources, indirectly benefiting residential solar producers. Mandatory solar installations, regulations requiring new residential buildings to include provisions for solar power installations. Is the government of Pakistan going in the opposite direction?

Here's a partial list of countries where their respective governments are incentivizing installation of home solar systems through a whole host of schemes, policies and financial incentives: Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Ghana, Myanmar, Rwanda, Nepal, Bolivia, Zambia, Cameroon, Sudan, Senegal, Uzbekistan, Haiti, Nicaragua, Libya, Malawi, Botswana, Bhutan, Fiji, Panama, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Jordan, El Salvador, China, India, Bangladesh, Brazil, Mexico, Morocco, Columbia, Vietnam, Tunisia, Uruguay, Peru, Philippines, Argentina, Kenya, South Korea, Turkey, Chile, Egypt, Malaysia, Indonesia, Israel, Thailand, Australia, Japan, the UK, Canada, France, Spain, Italy, Sweden, Singapore, Ireland, Poland, Denmark, and New Zealand.

All these governments have three things in mind: to ensure energy security, promote renewable energy and reduce carbon emission. What does the government of Pakistan have in mind? Is the government of Pakistan going in the opposite direction? Governments around the world are reducing financial barriers to adopt solar power making it more accessible and attractive to residential users.

Three questions: Is the government of Pakistan really preparing to take a divergent path? What are the real factors leading the government of Pakistan to pursue a contrasting course from the rest of the world?

A month before the European Parliament elections, many of Europe's industries are fighting to survive. But rather than make the difficult decisions needed to reverse the European Union's industrial decline, leaders have often settled for the status quo. Some populist leaders even oppose plans to modernise Europe's industrial base - effectively deceiving the public in the process.

Europe's manufacturing sector has faced a series of unprecedented challenges in recent years. The Covid-19 pandemic and the Ukraine war laid bare Europe's reliance on others for critical goods and dealt serious blows to manufacturing by disrupting supply chains and triggering energy and cost-of-living crises.

The embrace of short-termism by corporations - reflected in their preference for dividends and share buybacks over reinvestment of profits - has further undermined the EU manufacturing sector's dynamism and resilience. Compounding all these challenges is the biggest crisis of them all - climate change - which is generating rapidly increasing financial and human costs.

The impact on European industry is already apparent. In 2022, the EU's trade deficit reached a staggering €432bn ($465bn), driven by both higher spending on energy imports and manufacturing losses linked to the energy crisis. In February 2024, industrial production fell by 6.4% in the euro area and by 5.4% in the EU year on year.

Unless the EU reverses its industrial decline, Europeans could end up without industries that have, for decades, provided quality jobs to countless workers, who gained not only economic security, but also a sense of purpose, community, and identity. And it is not at all clear how that void would be filled.

The world's other major economic powers are already committed to industrial modernisation. Two decades of aggressive industrial strategy have given China a dominant position in most of the clean-technology supply chains. Recently, the United States has responded with an industrial policy of its own, the CHIPS and Science Act and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). If European industries are to remain competitive in this environment - and if Europe is to achieve its goal of ""strategic autonomy"" - the EU will have to follow suit.

The good news is that we already have a roadmap for sustainable industrial modernisation: the European Green Deal, a wide-ranging set of policies aimed at transforming the EU into a modern, resource-efficient, and competitive economy. Unfortunately, it hardly represents an easy fix, and we are a long way from delivering on it. To get there, European policymakers will have to deliver unprecedented levels of investment fast and ensure that industries and workers in all member states are included.

The Green Deal's investment demands are considerable. With electricity consumption projected to rise by around 60% by 2030, the European Commission estimates that €584bn will be needed this decade to modernise our grid alone. This calls for a comprehensive EU-wide investment strategy that both sustains existing heavy industry and incentivises clean-tech innovation.

For nearly 20 years, the EU has favoured the emissions-trading ""stick"" over carrots, or positive incentives for decarbonisation. To be sure, the European Emissions Trading System - which effectively establishes a carbon price by forcing companies to acquire enough permits, or ""allowances"", to cover their carbon dioxide emissions - has helped to curb emissions from electricity generation. But it has also increased pressure on European industry's competitiveness - pressure that the IRA is now compounding.

Europe has attempted to ease that pressure through carbon border taxes and foreign subsidy regulation. But these are partial measures. EU leaders must go much further, devising a broader industrial strategy that both addresses investment shortfalls and mitigates the risks associated with the production of more expensive net-zero goods in a fiercely competitive global market.

Unfortunately, the EU's new fiscal rules - agreed by the European Parliament and Council in February - will undermine the bloc's ability to invest in green technology and industrial upgrading, and deepen disparities among member states. According to research by the European Trade Union Confederation, only three countries (Denmark, Ireland, and Sweden) can meet their social- and green-investment needs under the EU's new fiscal rules. To bridge the gap across the rest of the EU, an additional €300-420bn annually will be needed. If that funding is not delivered, the EU's internal market risks fragmentation, which would accelerate deindustrialisation.

Moreover, support for working communities - provided through strong social conditionalities on all public-funding, public-procurement, and lead-market initiatives - is needed to boost economic growth, create jobs, and protect the environment, all of which is essential to win public trust. Exceptional times demand innovative solutions, not more of the same failed policies. Approaches like austerity, labour-market flexibilisation, and privatisation will only exacerbate the problems we face.

Similarly, short-sighted populism is no substitute for the holistic industrial strategy Europe needs to match those of its competitors - an approach that accounts for all dimensions of the challenges ahead. For example, a one-dimensional focus on strict environmental criteria risks producing unaffordable green products, which would stall progress in electric vehicles and other critical industries.

The choices we make in the coming years will determine whether European industry - integral to the EU's social fabric - has a long-term future. That is why the next European Parliament must make implementing a renewed European Green Deal, complemented by initiatives to bolster industry and attract broad public support, a top priority.

The report breaks down the role of advanced nuclear technology to meet decarbonisation goals and notes that various regions and governments are including the technology in core policy objectives. The report also offers an overview of the trends and challenges that face the nuclear supply chain, spanning from extraction and processing to end-use applications and waste management.

CRA's report, titled: 'Advanced Nuclear Reactor Technologies: A Tailwind for Nuclear Energy Revival' further says: ""The renewed prominence of nuclear in the energy transition reflects the growing emphasis on energy security and decarbonization among policy makers. Alongside the repowering of existing nuclear plants, advanced nuclear technologies are now also under the spotlight as they hold the promise of shorter construction timelines, lower overhead costs, and cross-industry applications.""

The report highlights that given some of the biggest challenges to infrastructure investing are inflation and regulation, including permitting and licensing, taxation, and safety standards, investors require certainty.

Meera Kotak, Associate Principal at CRA and co-author of the report, points to the recent collapse of Nuscale's Idaho National Laboratory scheme as an example of the challenges advanced reactors face when considering deployment: ""The Nuscale news really does show how difficult it can be for developers to line up all the different components in the macro context of high inflation and high interest rates. If you are a developer that started back when the rates weren't what they are today, you are going to be hit by them even if you're grounded in the best technological positions.""

Kotak points to some relatively simple solutions though: ""In the first instance, the industry needs government support to drive projects forward in the first of a kind development. The industry would also benefit from a coherent regulatory framework that crosses borders.""

Indeed, Kotak tells NEI that alongside sustained policy support, a better regulatory framework is needed for advanced reactors to deliver on their potential: ""The technology can be mature, the customers can be ready and we are seeing a lot of market demand there, but having those government policy and regulatory markers to incentivise investment is still needed. The central mechanisms aren't yet in the place that they need to be to enable the advent and progression of advanced reactors.""

Nonetheless, she does pick up on some positive signs of change: ""There is an element of sharing on the fundamentals across borders. There have been some examples with the US and Canada in terms of exchanging learnings on the regulatory processes that they're undertaking.""

However, Kotak notes that much of the regulatory structure was developed around large conventional reactors that has a knock-on impact on, for example, how insurance products for small reactors are set up and delivered. This in turn has an impact on how the private sector perceives advanced reactors as an attractive investment prospect. ""The regulatory system needs to evolve as the products evolve; investors seem interested in the promise of advanced and small reactors relative to conventional, but it's very much hinged on policy sentiment."" Kotak highlights the Inflation Reduction Act rolled out earlier this year in the US as an example of positive sentiment that could serve as a model for wider advanced reactor deployment: ""The tax credits that we saw in the US with the IRA, has been very promising given the wave of new developments and progress that occurred as a result. Given the nascency of these new technologies, the role of government and the introduction of supportive policy has shown to be important in navigating the uncertainty that comes with innovation.

Kotak also identifies a number of other challenges that must be addressed if advanced reactors are to be deployed at scale. ""Whilst there are nuances across the different technologies, considerations do need to be made with regards to the supply chain, and labour and skills capacity. Public sentiment towards nuclear is also part of the challenge and needs to be overcome, given the benefits, and passive safety features, that small and advanced reactors bring relative to conventional designs.""

Indeed, the report argues that under certain circumstances, the economic viability of advanced nuclear technologies is notable, offering some advantages relative to other energy sources, including renewable and storage portfolios. This distinction is particularly noticeable at high levels of renewable penetration when contributions to capacity from renewables starts to decline.

Kotak adds: ""It's exciting that there are so many different options on the table and each have distinct points that they're working through, but equally opportunities to offset. Whilst there might be a supply chain obstacle for one design, it might also enable it to advance because of other factors that are impeding a different design get solved first.""

Advanced nuclear can also offer a more appealing proposition for off-takers or utility buyers, as demonstrated by the evaluation of the value-adjusted levelised cost of electricity (VALCOE), which considers the relative contribution of the technology to the electricity system in terms of energy, capacity and flexibility services.

The report notes that the case for additional advanced nuclear capacity is reinforced by the fact that long-term operation of nuclear power plants has the lowest levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) among all other technologies, including newly built solar and offshore wind. However, larger reactors often have extended construction timelines and conventional nuclear reactors (Generation I, II and III) typically feature high levels of fuel expenditure, with most of the construction activities occurring at the reactor site. As Kotak says: ""Advanced reactors such as the molten salts, the micro reactors, they're all being predicated on the fact that they're trying to offset the challenges that the large reactors bring for example trying to offset those cost overruns that appear to be inherent with traditional designs. Each has a USP and each of them is trying to target or offset a problem that has been in the industry and that's a positive.

A recently published report on behalf of EPRI and conducted by CRA titled, shows how across 1000 Monte Carlo simulations, a first of a kind (FOAK) small modular reactor (SMR) has an overall average capital cost that is 16% less than a conventional light water reactor (LWR), primarily driven by lower financing costs resulting from shorter construction durations. This could ultimately result in lower total project costs for smaller reactors compared to their larger counterparts when considering both overnight and financing expenses.

Additionally, when integrated with thermal storage, advanced nuclear technologies can provide enhanced flexibility in the delivery of ancillary services, further underscoring their intrinsic advantages compared to conventional alternatives.

The report says that merits of advanced nuclear technologies present a strong case for potential investment opportunities. While external influences, such as government and industry, play a major role in de-risking investment, the role of the investor itself is critical in bridging the investment gap needed to enable the transition towards second-of-a-kind reactors and achieve commercial returns.

""There is an argument to say that it is not which design will win, but which one will be able to be deployed first. There's a variety of market policy and regulatory factors, skills factors, supply chain and fuel factors that must be addressed, but at the end of the day, you need that customer demand and you need the funding to be able to get it not just to first of a kind, but to commercial return, which requires Nth of a kind deployment. This is where the returns that make it economic can be seen. The industry needs enough funding for it to get to not just one, but perhaps four, seven, reactors that enable Nth of a kind projections. At this point, the economic benefits align and compound the otherwise existing inherent benefits of small reactors, such as the ability to power remote locations and offset grid infrastructure problems, and the modular construction and factory build approach that is poised to offset costs,"" she says.

The report highlights a number of examples of policies encouraging private sector engagement, noting for example, that Canada and the US have consistently supported nuclear as part of their energy mix. Both countries have extensive governmental backing for the advancement of nuclear technologies.

Canada's introduction of a clean technology investment tax credit of 30% explicitly focuses on SMR technology. Canada also recognises nuclear energy as a 'fundamental and necessary component' of the low-carbon energy system.

In addition, the development of SMRs is supported at both the national and provincial levels. The federal government released its SMR Roadmap in 2018 and SMR Action plan in 2020, supporting the development, demonstration and deployment of SMRs for various uses domestically and internationally. Canada's federal budget for 2023, announced in March, provided a 15% refundable investment tax credit for clean electricity, including nuclear. This credit is separate from the clean technology investment tax credit introduced in the 2022 federal budget, which provided a tax credit of up to 30% for non-emitting electricity generation technologies, including SMRs. On March 28, 2022, the provinces of Ontario, New Brunswick, Saskatchewan and Alberta released a plan outlining a path forward for SMRs as a deliverable under the provincial SMR memorandum of understanding (MoU). Ontario Power Generation (OPG), Bruce Power, New Brunswick Power and SaskPower have been working collectively to develop three streams of SMR project proposals. On September 21, 2023, the province of Alberta announced the allocation of US$5m in funding (C$7m) towards a multi-year research initiative aimed at assessing the techno-economic feasibility, as well as considerations for safety behind implementing SMRs within oil sands operations.

As Kotak says: ""Such policy measures would give confidence to investors that this is a technology that we are going to support and it is not going to be dropped and lose your investment. Similar to what was done with wind and solar. It's only at the price it is today because of that level of support to drive innovation and driving new supply chains. Private investment has come in now because of the amount of subsidies that went into it from the outset.""

The report also emphasises the growing role of the private sector, noting that in July 2023, OPG announced its collaboration with the provincial government to plan and license three additional SMRs, for a total of four SMRs at OPG's Darlington New Nuclear Project.

Earlier in January, OPG, GEH, SNC-Lavalin and Aecon signed the first commercial contract for a grid-scale SMR in North America. The six-year partnership seeks to finalise the construction of a BWRX-300 SMR at the Darlington site by the end of 2028, with plans to commence power supply to the grid in 2029. This comes in the wake of the Canadian Infrastructure Bank commitment of US$713m (C$970), announced in October 2022, to finance the first phase of OPG's Darlington New Nuclear Project. In 2021, OPG selected GEH's BWRX-300 SMR for the project.

Kotak picks up on these developments: ""It's great to see different vendor-utility or customer partnerships that are driving for clusters or multiples of reactor units that still reach the required output.""

The report notes that Europe is also seeing both public and private sector engagement, highlighting that the market is divided in its views on the role of nuclear energy in the future energy mix. Some countries, including Germany, Italy and Lithuania, have phased out nuclear power; Austria, Denmark, Germany, Luxembourg and Portugal signed a joint declaration, opposing the inclusion of nuclear in the EU Green finance taxonomy. In contrast, France, the European leader in nuclear power, has brought together a 'Nuclear Alliance' consisting of 11 countries. This alliance will work towards strengthening cooperation in nuclear energy as an important component of Europe's energy goals.

In a bid to cement its leadership in civilian nuclear energy, France, in 2022, announced its plans to build six new next-generation nuclear reactors by 2050, with a possibility of deploying an additional eight. This plan was catalysed by Parliament's recent approval of the Government's nuclear investment plan, allocating €52bn to the construction of new reactors. While the project work is yet to begin, EDF Energy plans to commission its first two facilities in 2035 and a third in 2040. France's ambition to deploy its first SMR by 2030 contributes to the government vision for nuclear to account for more than 50% of the country's electricity mix.

The report further notes that in Poland, energy-intensive companies such as Synthos and PKN Orlen, established a joint venture to deploy an SMR fleet, GEH's BWRX-300. In addition, ENEA Group, one of the largest power companies in Poland, is collaborating with Last Energy to develop SMRs.

Other countries, including UK, Romania and the Czech Republic that have historically been dependent on coal to meet their energy needs, are increasingly turning to advanced nuclear technologies as a means of decarbonising their energy systems.

""We're seeing the private sector engage in Eastern Europe, Poland, Romania, the Czech Republic, with high-wealth individuals exploring options with small and advanced reactors. Bill Gates' TerraPower has shown what private investment can do to propel a new reactor design,"" says Kotak.

Kotak also points to a broader economic benefit to those nations that do successfully deploy advanced reactor technology: ""Once that first of a kind small reactor is identified and can be commercially developed, there could be significant export potential for a market."" She adds: ""The timeliness, limitations and opportunities of all clean energy resources - nuclear, CCUS, hydrogen, geothermal - need to be considered.""

The report says that the nuclear energy sector challenge is exacerbated by the imminent retirement of the current nuclear workforce. A multi-year, multi-unit build-up of nuclear reactors will require addressing the labour shortage at various stages, including education, recruitment for entry-level positions and the identification of highly skilled master tradespeople.

""From a vendor developer perspective, business models are set up with the intention to build more than one reactor, given the level of infrastructure, supply chain, manufacturing capabilities and people required. The repeatability is the USP. If the modular construction, factory build, and ability to just repeat orders isn't taken up on, it could miss a key opportunity. The report notes that designs are planned for modules to be built at factories and then transported to the main reactor site, reducing the total construction time required. Microreactors take this concept a step further and are designed such that the entire reactor can be transported at once,"" says Kotak.

Nonetheless, Kotak is optimistic, she says: ""Advanced nuclear technology could play a pivotal role in the decarbonisation of our energy systems. I am positive because fundamentally, regardless of what design gets chosen, it has a role to play as a clean energy source, and to enable the pathway to net zero. I think, ultimately, we need to be reminded that all COP nations or signatories have all signed up to this to reduce emissions and to reach those net zero goals."" As Kotak concludes: ""As the costs become more secure, the investment returns become more clear and that regulatory and policy structures are in place to give that confirmation of returns, I think we will see more private investment, as we've seen with other energy sources.""",neimagazine.com,news,Nuclear Engineering International,,0.3333333333333333,453699639,16,https://www.neimagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2024/02/Double_Unit_2_8K_1440x810.webp,eng-9584248

Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh has emphasised the need to diversify resources for social housing development, from the State, the public, society and financial institutions, in order to provide support for both sellers and buyers.

PM Chinh made this call while chairing a meeting with ministries and agencies in Hanoi on May 17 to discuss solutions to social housing development, as part of a project aiming to construct at least 1 million social housing units for low-income earners and industrial zone workers in the 2021-2030 period.

He acknowledged that key hurdles relating to land allocation, administrative procedures and real estate regulations have been largely resolved, saying that the laws on land, housing, real estate business and credit institutions have been issued, and what matters now is how to put them into practice.

The localities were urged to proactively engage in specific programmes, plans and projects while procedures and conditions for borrowers seeking social housing must be simplified, he said.

The leader also urged building and issuing a resolution allowing the Land Law, Housing Law and Real Estate Business Law to take effect early from July 1, 2024, and the early enforcement of preferential policies for social housing projects.

The PM assigned specific tasks to relevant ministries, local authorities and investors to ensure the successful implementation of the project.

Currently, Vietnam now has 503 underway social housing projects, providing a total of 418,200 apartments./.

Vietnam, AFD strengthen cooperation, promote energy transition

Vietnam wants to deepen the traditional reliable relations and strategic partnership with France, particularly the French Development Agency (AFD), said Deputy Prime Minister Tran Hong Ha while receiving AFD Deputy Director General Marie-Hélène Loison in Hanoi.

During the reception, Ha appreciated the results of AFD's activities in Vietnam as well as changes in its organisational apparatus for wider and more effective access to new development fields.

Ha said that besides institutionalising mechanisms and policies on green transition and just energy transition, Vietnam needs advice on techniques, institutional improvement, technology selection, governance models, and financial resources in the fields of energy, transportation, agriculture, and urban areas.

Such advice will help Vietnam to determine actual needs, and plans for effective use of domestic resources, loans, and sponsorship sources, Ha said.

He noted that AFD's studies on green transition, climate change response, and energy transition will provide ""solution packages"" for investment, science and technology, and technical infrastructure development in Vietnam.

Regarding green transition and just energy transition, the Deputy Prime Minister said that the Government of Vietnam is discussing with partners to soon pilot several offshore wind power projects, adding the country also promotes the participation of the private sector in renewable electricity production.

""AFD's research results can also support French businesses to find investment and business cooperation projects in Vietnam,"" Ha said.

For her part, Marie-Hélène Loison affirmed that AFD and its partners are always ready to provide technical advice and support for Vietnam to improve the legal framework, find financial sources to implement important socio-economic development programmes and projects in Vietnam, especially in the fields of energy transition, climate change response, and green transition.

Since 2019, AFD has coordinated with the Vietnamese side to implement a project to research the socio-economic impacts of climate change in Vietnam and the climate change adaptation strategy. The two sides have launched Phase 2 of the project with priority given to assessing the socio-economic impacts of the energy transition process in Vietnam./.

65th anniversary of Ho Chi Minh Trail marked in Quang Binh

A ceremony to mark the 65th anniversary of the Truong Son - Ho Chi Minh Trail (1959 - 2024) took place in Bo Trach district, the central province of Quang Binh, on May 17, highlighting the significance of the legendary road in the country's resistance war against the US and today's socio-economic development.

The event was attended by 200 delegates, including former pioneering youths and members of youth unions from the provinces of Nghe An, Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thua Thien - Hue, and Quang Nam in the central region, Dak Lak, Gia Lai, Kon Tum and Dak Nong in the Central Highlands, and Binh Phuoc in the south, which the trail traversed.

In his remarks, Secretary of the Ho Chi Minh Communist Youth Union Central Committee Ngo Van Cuong said the Ho Chi Minh Trail, also called Truong Son Trail, went down in the country's history as a legendary route and a miracle, and became a symbol for educating today's young generation about the revolutionary ideal and the spirit of overcoming challenges.

It also holds practical significance in the current national construction and defence, he noted.

Sixty-five years ago, to carry out the Party Central Committee and the Central Military Commission's policy on opening a route to deliver support to the revolution in the South, thanks to extraordinary efforts and the determination of reunifying the nation, forces built a strategic transportation route from rudimentary trails along the majestic Truong Son Mountain Range.

The Truong Son - Ho Chi Minh Trail spanned nearly 17,000km, including five vertical routes along the Truong Son Range and 21 horizontal ones connecting strategic areas, fuel pipelines, and communication lines, among many others. The system of arteries served as not only a strategic military transportation and logistics network but also a fierce battlefront, vividly demonstrating the solidarity in combat among Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia.

As part of the activities commemorating the trail's 65th anniversary, between May 15 and 17, representatives of the former pioneering youths and youth union members held a programme in the provinces to express gratitude to the war veterans and former pioneering youths who once performed duties along the legendary trail./.

Nam Dinh border guard force works hard to prevent IUU fishing

Along with increasing patrol on waters under its management, the border guard force of the northern province of Nam Dinh has strictly managed the movement of local fishing vessels to ensure that no vessel without enough documents and equipment can go offshore, thus preventing illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing.

Major Vu Chi Cong, head of the border post at Hai Thinh Port said that along with combating all kinds of criminals in the sea border area, the post has sent officials and soldiers to local vessels to educate fishermen on IUU fishing prevention and control regulations.

As a result, the majority of local fishermen have thoroughly understood the regulations and have not violated regulations, Cong said.

Nguyen Van Tuan, the captain of a local fishing boat, said that thanks to communications efforts of the border guard force of Nam Dinh, he and local fishermen have understood legal regulations related to offshore fishing, thus avoiding violations to foreign waters.

Lieutenant Colonel Pham Van Truong, head of the Border Guard Station at Hai Thinh Port Border Gate said that in 2023 and the first four months of 2024, the provincial border guard force has inspected about 20,000 vehicles and 60,000 people, while conducting more than 10 patrols to protect the national sovereignty over sea areas in the Bac Bo (Tonkin) Gulf in association with IUU prevention and control.

Nam Dinh currently has about 1,760 operating fishing vessels, including 531 vessels with a length of 15m and above, of which 97% have installed VMS devices, and the remaining are out of use.

Since the beginning of this year, local authorities have sanctioned over 20 administrative violations with total fine of over 230 million VND (9,037 USD).

Colonel Cao Xuan Thuy, Deputy Political Commissar of the Border Guard Command of Nam Dinh said that in order to join the whole country's efforts in removing the European Commission's ""yellow card"" on Vietnamese fisheries sector, the provincial border guard force will continue strengthening communications and patrol activities, promptly detecting and handling violations on IUU fishing, and intensifying law enforcement measures to absolutely prevent fishing vessels that fail to show necessary documents from going to sea./.

Addressing the ceremony, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Le Thi Thu Hang, who is also Chairwoman of the State Committee for Overseas Vietnamese (OV) Affairs thanked the Royal Family and Government of Thailand, the government and people of Kanchanaburi province for their support of the Vietnamese community, helping them integrate into the host society while preserving their cultural identity and the Vietnamese language.

The Vietnamese diplomat, who led a delegation of SCOV on a working visit to Thailand, emphasised that Vietnamese pagodas are both venues for cultural and religious activities and for overseas Vietnamese to convey their feelings for their homeland, maintaining long-standing customs and traditions associated with the community, educating the young generation about the roots and cultural beauties of the homeland.

On the occasion, the Deputy FM had a working session with Thotsapon Chaikomin, Governor of Kanchanaburi province and Khanh Tho Pagoda Board of Directors, and met with representatives from Vietnamese associations in Thailand./.

U19 footballers summoned to prepare for Southeast Asian championship

Vietnam's U19 football team will start their first training camp this year on May 17 to prepare for the 2024 Southeast Asian U19 championship and the 2025 continental U20 tourney qualification, said the Vietnam Football Federation (VFF).

New head coach Hua Dien Vinh has called up 29 players for the camp, including many from the U17 squad competing at the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) U17 Asian Cup 2023 in Thailand and the friendship tournament of U18 Seoul Eou Cup in the Republic of Korea (RoK) also last year.

Some of the footballers used to receive training at the clubs playing at J. League of Japan under the VFF's cooperation with the Japan Football Association.

However, the training camp has yet to gather all the best U19 players as many are still playing at their clubs at domestic tourneys.

The first training session will take place at the Vietnam Youth Football Training Centre on May 17 morning.

The team are scheduled to leave for China on June 2 to play at the international U19 tournament held by the Chinese Football Association.

Apart from hosts China, this event will also see the participation of the teams from Uzbekistan and the RoK. It is considered a test for the Vietnamese players before competing at the ASEAN Football Federation (AFF) U19 Youth Championship 2024 and the AFC U20 Asian Cup 2025 qualification./.

Phú Yên authority searching for missing construction workers

Local authorities in Phú Yên Province are searching for two construction workers who went missing while traveling by boat on the Ba River on Wednesday night.

According to the Phú Hòa District Police Office, at around 7 p.m. on Wednesday, six male construction workers working on a sub-project of the Chí Thạnh - Vân Phong section of the North-South Expressway project took a boat from Vĩnh Phú hamlet in the district to Tây Hòa District.

When they reached the construction site for the Đà Rằng Bridge, the boat collided with the bridge and capsized.

Three individuals survived: Mai Chí Thành, 45, Nguyễn Văn Huê, 32, and Lê Kim Vàng, 29.

Three others drowned: Nguyễn Cửu Đồng, 34, Nguyễn Mạnh Nguyên, 31, and Lê Đức Cường, 46. Nguyên died after being taken to Phú Yên Provincial General Hospital for treatment. The other two individuals remain missing.

Late on Wednesday night, Cao Thị Hòa An, Permanent Deputy Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, and Lê Tấn Hổ, Permanent Vice Chairman of the Provincial People's Committee, visited the scene and ordered search and rescue forces to continue searching for the missing victims throughout the night.

A Vietnam News Agency correspondent reported that heavy rains hit the province early Thursday morning, causing water levels in the Ba River to rise significantly, making the search for the missing victims more difficult.

Da Nang's health care service to go digital

The central city has approved the 'smart' health care development project in 2025-30, promising all hospitals and health care centres we go digital in procedures, examinations and treatments.

The city said the project will be receiving total fund of VNĐ488.95 billion (US$19.56 million) for building data and infrastructure.

By 2025, all hospitals and health centres will be using digital medical records and cashless payment, offering online medical check-ups and examinations and medical consultancy or using database of patients and national database-connected ID cards.

The 'smart' health system will provide facilities for doctors giving medical consultancy to patients with online medical examination and treatment.

It also includes global positioning system (GPS) tracking of ambulances for doctors providing first aid instructions on the way to hospital.

Deputy director of the city's health department Võ Thu Tùng said the city's health data will be connected with the national health data centre, supporting doctors with patient's medical records nationwide.

The 'smart' health care system would start using AI Robot in treatment and examination in 2030 as well as medical training, he said.

Tùng said doctors will use digital images or online photos instead of checking films in examination of patients.

Last year, the city put into operation the first Intelligent Operation Centre (IOC), starting the first service of the 'smart' city plan, allowing local people and businesses to apply for paperwork from home via the city's online public one-stop service.

The system has helped speed up the procedure schedule, saving $44.2 million and cutting 20 per cent of other costs in manpower payment.

A total fund of VNĐ2.14 trillion ($95 million) has been allocated for the 'smart' city plan in 2030-45, in which information technology and communication will play a key role in the digitalisation process.

The central hub has targeted becoming the first in Việt Nam to join the ASEAN 'smart' city network by 2030.

A report from the city's information and communication department said 16 health centres and hospitals have been using digital records

Đà Nẵng, in co-operation with the military-owned telecommunications group Viettel, and FPT Group have been jointly developing a 5G network, an Internet of Things (IoT) service, a digital database centre, cyber security services and digital transforming.

Việt Nam-Denmark cooperate for a sustainable agriculture

The Danish Minister for Food, Agriculture and Fisheries, Jacob Jensen, is leading a high-level delegation to visit Việt Nam on 14-16 May 2024.

Together with a group of Danish agri-food companies with advanced technology and know-how on sustainability and green transition, the aim of the minister's visit is to intensify high-level policy dialogue with Vietnamese counterparts with a focus on a more sustainable food production and a resource efficient supply chain.

Việt Nam and Denmark have developed a close and long- term bilateral relation on food safety. Since 2017, the bilateral cooperation has concentrated on facilitating co-operation within feed and food safety. The co-operation is a crucial part of the Green Strategic Partnership launched by the two Prime Ministers last November, where the two countries have committed to promote green transition and green growth, supporting Việt Nam in building a green economy and fulfilling the country's commitment to achieve net-zero emission by 2050.

The SSC Food programme between Việt Nam and Denmark has been implemented by the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration (DVFA) and the Vietnamese Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD). The first phase of the programme focused on improving framework conditions for animal feed production through capacity development of government officials and on the legislative framework for prudent use of veterinary drugs. In phase 2, which ran from April 2020 to April 2024, the main themes of cooperation are enhancing capacity across various stages of the food chain from farm to fork, combating anti-microbial resistance (AMR), feed control and traceability and recall of unsafe food.

During his visit, Minister Jensen has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Vietnamese Minister for Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) Lê Minh Hoan extending the government-to-government co-operation. For the coming years, the co-operation will have increased focus on the green transition of food and agricultural production, aiming to promote a more sustainable and resilient food system.

Jensen said: ""Denmark's green transition in sustainable food production has led to the development of strong, innovative methods and approaches throughout the value chain, which boost production yield and improve product quality but at the same time consume less water and energy.

""We look forward to sharing these insights and inspire further collaboration with our Vietnamese partners. Our agreement is a strong testament to our fruitful cooperation where the two ministries do not only share common needs and interests but more importantly a common goal and vision: a sustainable and resilient food system.""

During his visit, the Danish Minister for Food, Agriculture and Fisheries also made a keynote speech at a workshop on Antimicrobial Resistance in agriculture and aquaculture. Antimicrobial resistance is a big threat to public health and human health nowadays. Therefore, this has been an important track of the Strategic Sector Co-operation Food programme.

The minister's visit to Việt Nam this time, the second Danish high-level visit within just two months, has been also accompanied by a group of Danish companies and producers who own world leading's solutions in food production and processing, storages, optimising the use of food and agriculture resources, drainage and water techniques.

Việt Nam is an attractive destination for Danish businesses in the agricultural sector. At present, Denmark has been one of the EU countries with the highest export per capita to Việt Nam and the agri-food sector constitutes approximately half of the total Danish exports to Việt Nam.

""Việt Nam has become an important and attractive market for Danish businesses and investors,"" Jensen said.

""Although Việt Nam and Denmark are geographically very far from each other, we are facing many of the same challenges and we have to continue working together to find ways to use resources effectively. In a smart way to increase competitiveness and sustainability.""

During his visit in the South of Việt Nam, the minister will visit Food Bank Vietnam, an important partner for the efforts to combat food waste and food loss. He will also pay site visits to a catfish aqua-farm in Tiền Giang and an aqua-feed factory in Bến Tre, where close partnerships between Vietnamese and Danish research institutions and companies promotes the use of new green technologies and solutions for a sustainable aquaculture production in Việt Nam.

On his last day of the visit, he will deliver a keynote speech at the seminar on ""Sustainable agri-food production - Danish innovative technologies and financing opportunities"". The seminar will provide a forum to connect and facilitate exchange of experiences, technologies, financing and business opportunities between authorities, local decision-makers, sector managers as well as Danish and Vietnamese entrepreneurs.

20-year-old woman arrested for running fraudulent charity scheme

A 20-year-old woman from Cà Mau Province has been arrested for allegedly operating a fraudulent charity scheme using fake social media accounts.

Huỳnh Phương Thủy was nabbed in Đồng Nai Province by the Đồng Tháp Province police on Thursday.

She admitted to using multiple fake Facebook accounts with different names to solicit donations.

She would post in various groups, claiming to be raising funds for charitable causes but pocketed all the money, she said.

She collected VNĐ140 million and used the money for her personal expenses, according to investigators.

Đồng Tháp authorities have recently found several cases involving fake charity appeals on social media.

The police recommend that people should verify the legitimacy of donation requests to avoid scams.

Basket, brocade weaving of S'tiêng people recognised as National Intangible Cultural Heritage

Basket weaving and brocade weaving of the S'tiêng people has been included in the National Intangible Cultural Heritage list by the Ministry of Culture, Sports, and Tourism in 2023 and 2024.

Bình Phước Province Department of Culture, Sports, and Tourism on May 15 held a ceremony at Bù Gia Mập National Park to announce the inclusion of the traditional crafts of basket weaving and brocade weaving of the S'tiêng people in the National Intangible Cultural Heritage list.

Bình Phước is known as a region where many ethnic groups live together. Among them, the S'tiêng people are the second-largest ethnic group in the province, with nearly 97,000 people residing in 11 districts, towns, and cities of the province.

With this population size and long history, the S'tiêng community has created its own unique and distinctive cultural identity, including the traditional crafts of basket weaving and brocade weaving.

The basket weaving and brocade weaving crafts of the S'tiêng people are traditional crafts accumulated and developed over many generations, demonstrating the skill and creativity of S'tiêng artisans.

To create baskets and brocade products, the artisans must have talent, skills, and a thorough understanding of techniques.

Additionally, they must know how to identify and properly exploit natural materials such as tree leaves and bark to create dyeing materials and weaving patterns.

These techniques and knowledge reflect the accumulation, creativity, and refinement over time to produce unique products of the S'tiêng people in Bình Phước Province.

At the announcement ceremony, Nguyễn Khắc Vĩnh, deputy director of the Department of Culture, Sports, and Tourism of Bình Phước Province, said that the inclusion of the basket weaving and brocade weaving crafts of the S'tiêng people in the National Intangible Cultural Heritage list not only honours the historical and cultural values of these traditional crafts but also recognises the efforts of local authorities and the dedication of the S'tiêng artisans and community in preserving and promoting the value of these crafts.

Vĩnh suggested that relevant authorities should continue protecting and promoting the intangible cultural heritage value of basket weaving and brocade weaving.

The provincial museum should continue researching and collecting more information to clarify the value and significance of these crafts, providing documentation and guidance to local communities, which are the heritage bearers, to effectively preserve and promote the cultural heritage.

Localities should promote traditional craft training, improve skills, create high-quality products rich in cultural identity, prioritise access to funding for households maintaining the craft to expand and develop production.

Policies should encourage and support skilled basket weavers and brocade weavers, establish craft villages as community tourism sites and form basket weaving and brocade weaving cooperatives to promote and introduce products to a broader audience of tourists.

One correction from last night: Putin and his entourage went to Beijing. I wrote that Xi had gone to Moscow.

As I begin writing tonight's update - at 7:30 PM EDT - air raid alerts are up from Sumy, Kharkiv, and Poltova Oblasts in the northeast through Kirovohrad Oblast in central Ukraine to Mykolaiv and Odesa Oblasts in southern Ukraine. An air raid alert has just gone up - 7:50 PM EDT - for Vinnytsia Oblast.

Russia has continued bombarding Kharkiv and Sumy Oblasts, as well as other parts of Ukraine.

Russian forces are also continuing to commit crimes against humanity. I'm not embedding it, but Ukrainian aerial reconnaissance has captured video of a Ukrainian in a wheelchair killed on the grounds of a hospital in the Russian occupied portion of Vovchansk. The Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor's Office is treating this as an execution of a civilian trying to flee the Russian occupation. Do NOT go looking for the video or the still imagery!!! You don't need to see it!!!

17 May 2024 - 19:47

Dear Ukrainians!

A brief summary of this day.

Our military. The Commander-in-Chief reported on the situation at the front. The Kharkiv directions: Vovchansk, Lyptsi, Kupyansk. We are deterring Russian pressure. I thank each brigade, each unit. We also continue to focus on the Donetsk directions, first of all, the Pokrovsk one -- where the situation is the most difficult, with the highest number of battles. In fact, the entire Kharkiv operation of the occupier is aimed at weakening our overall forces along the front, and, at the same time, it is an attempt to strengthen its propaganda -- propaganda aimed also at world leaders. Russia wants to show that they are the ones who determine what happens next in the war. Our task is to thwart Russia's attempt to expand the war and to prevent the occupier from breaking both the frontline and our diplomacy -- our way of bringing a just peace closer.

I have just had a long meeting on the preparations for the first Peace Summit to be held in Switzerland in June. This is the first real opportunity to bring a just end to this war closer. The Office team, our international experts, and all those involved in working with partners on the Summit were present at today's meeting. We have almost a month to go before the Summit, a month of our work. We already have the confirmations of states from all the continents to participate in the Summit. We will definitely continue to work at all levels to make the event effective. I will continue my communication with the leaders, the team will keep working at the level of national security advisors, as well as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Parliament, civic leaders... And we also use our informal ties with partners. Ukraine and many other countries have already been through so many Russian meannesses and deceptions -- Russian violations of agreements and promises, that only the world majority together can ensure that Russia is effectively forced to respect the UN Charter, the international law, and real peace.

And there was another important meeting today. We had a very detailed and long conversation about the protection and restoration of our energy sector, and the situation in the energy industry in general. Prime Minister Shmyhal, the Minister of Energy, the military, and the representatives of energy companies. Now, after the Russian strikes, our energy sector has lost a significant part of its production. Time is needed to restore it. Much effort is needed to further develop the energy sector -- the new energy sector, which will be able to function despite the threats of Russian terror. In addition, we are already preparing for the next heating season, which includes, in particular, scheduled repairs and preparation of nuclear generation. Therefore, there is a need for a very rational, thoughtful consumption of electricity again. Both at the Government level and at the level of regional and local authorities, as well as at the level of energy companies, we need to ensure that the public is fully informed about how power cuts happen now, when there is a peak load, and why we need everyone to be conscious of their consumption. Of course, we are working to provide Ukraine with more air defense protection. We are working with all our partners on a regular basis, and we are convincing them.

And one more thing.

Russian terror will never remain unpunished. Step by step, we are making sure that the Russian state feels the consequences and the price of its evil. I thank everyone who works for this, who produces our drones, our weapons. And everyone who uses them -- and uses them accurately. Thank you!

Glory to Ukraine!

Here's the details on the energy shortages and rationing:

Ukraine will uphold restrictions on energy supply for industrial users due to the damage caused by recent Russian attacks against the Ukrainian energy system, the state-owned energy operator Ukrenergo announced on May 17.

Moscow has recently intensified its missile and drone strikes against Ukraine's critical infrastructure, destroying several thermal power plants across the country. This included the Trypillia plant, the main electricity supplier to Kyiv, Zhytomyr, and Cherkasy oblasts.

Russia carried out another large-scale attack on May 8 against Poltava, Kirovohrad, Zaporizhzhia, Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk, Kyiv, and Vinnytsia oblasts, mainly targeting energy infrastructure. At least two hydroelectric power plants had to be decommissioned as a result of attacks.

Limitations for industrial users will be applied from 7 p.m. to midnight local time on May 18, while restrictions for domestic users are not forecasted for the same day, according to Ukrenergo.

Ukrenergo also warned that power shutdowns can still occur in the region if the limit of power usage is exceeded.

The schedules of the potential shutdowns can be found on the personal online accounts of energy supply users, as well as on the website or social media of the regional energy operator.

Ukrenergo previously implemented rolling blackouts in all of the Ukrainian regions for both industrial and domestic users on May 15.

""The capacity of Ukrainian power plants is not enough due to the consequences of five missile and drone attacks carried out by Russia on Ukraine's energy system since March 22,"" the statement read.

There is another frontline in the war in #Ukraine.

Between #energy workers who heat homes and light streets and russian #missiles that destroy power stations and bring only darkness.

After relentless russian attacks in the last two months, Ukraine's energy workers face a race against time. They need the world's help to protect our skies and find equipment to restore the energy system, before winter arrives.

President @ZelenskyyUa:

""russia has not stopped terrorizing our people for a single week in more than two years of this war.

russia tries to expand the war while consistently making empty statements about peace. We must use all available means to force russia to make a real and just peace. Our defense against russian assaults and strikes is critical in this regard.

I am grateful to everyone who defends Ukraine!

I thank all the countries that help us!""

""For the first time since the start of the war, none of the brigades complain that there are no artillery projectiles. And this has been happening for the last 2 months. However, we still have to work a lot. The Czech initiative will go ahead. We are negotiating with all partners about money,"" Zelenskyi said.

https://rbc.ua/rus/news/front-zbroya-kadrovi-rotatsiyi-ta-mir-golovni-1715931411.html

From RBC-Ukraine:

President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy addressed the media, outlining the Russian objectives in the Kharkiv region, his vision for the withdrawal of Russian troops, the stance of international partners and their fears, and commenting on personnel rotations within the Cabinet and the Presidential Office.

Situation in Kharkiv region

Speaking about the situation in the Kharkiv region, the head of state noted that he had a substantive meeting with Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi, commanders of Operational Strategic Group Khortytsia, Yurii Sodol, and Operational Tactical Group Kharkiv, Mykhailo Drapatyi, as well as border guards including State Border Guard Service head Serhii Deineko and National Police representatives.

According to Zelenskyy, Ukrainian Defense Forces have ""stabilized the Russians where they are now."" The deepest advancement of the occupiers is 10 kilometers. In some brigade directions, the enemy has made no progress at all.

""We have very powerful brigades, I am grateful to them. We have reinforced several directions with individual battalions, reallocating from reserves and other directions. The crossing of the border by the Russians is due to a lack of air defense. They operate with aerial bombs and artillery where they have an advantage... 8 months of partners delaying decisions made it difficult for our troops,"" explains the president.

Regarding fortifications, Zelenskyy said that no one has reached the concrete defense line, dismissing claims as nonsense.

""The enemy reached the first line. The first line is not the border, it is impossible to build there because of the weapons used by the Russians, which caused our people to die. That is approximately where they are now. The first line was built during the war, under constant fire, by our military. The second line is also built by the military, and the third line, constructed by local authorities, is the strongest -- not because they are better than the military, but simply because it is farther from the weapons, shells, and shelling,"" said Zelenskyy.

According to the head of state, the Russian goal is Vovchansk. Beyond that, they want a 10-kilometer zone and aim to develop any success they achieve. However, for now, the situation is stabilized by our Defense Forces, said Zelenskyy.

Permission for using Western weapons on Russian territory

Regarding Ukraine's use of Western weapons to strike Russian territory, the president does not believe there should be any prohibitions ""because this is not about the Ukrainian army's offensive using Western weapons on Russian territory.""

""This is defense. It is like the preventive sanctions we spoke of before the full-scale invasion. It is the same. It is a warning. Moreover, they have the same 'gray' zone. They also have evacuation areas. There are almost no civilians on their border for understandable reasons,"" emphasized Zelenskyy.

Blinken's visit

As the president recounted, the visit of the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to Ukraine had several objectives.

""Firstly, a $2 billion aid package. Secondly, US proposals for security guarantees. A draft Treaty on Security Guarantees already exists. Thirdly, we discussed our vision for the NATO Summit. They heard our vision, accepted the information, and will return with feedback,"" Zelenskyy shared.

However, he stressed that the main issue is air defense.

""At what stage is the dialogue with this or that country that has the relevant systems. Where we see them, where our partners see them, when it might happen, and what needs to be done for this,"" Zelenskyy added.

Negotiations with Russia

During his conversation with journalists, the president also emphasized that Western partners are not pushing Ukraine to sit at the negotiating table with Russia.

""Partners are not pushing us. Although I think there is such an atmosphere in the world. And here we need to be very firm and strong. The correct platform has been chosen today where we have the initiative -- the Peace Summit,"" Zelenskyy believes.

Goals for peace summit

Speaking about the Global Peace Summit in Switzerland (to be held on June 15-16, 2024) and its goals, the head of state said that Kyiv aims to achieve a communiqué.

""We want to achieve energy security, including nuclear one. Because I believe everyone is interested in this, and it could allow us to forecast another winter. We want to achieve free navigation. Any cargo through Ukrainian waters without risk. This is also the safety of people in Odesa and the South in general. Because they hit ports -- this affects infrastructure, the sea, and the economy. We also want to make a serious step towards prisoner exchange. In the humanitarian aspect, prisoner exchange is a double issue, as with energy. Energy is nuclear safety, which everyone supports. I think where there is nuclear safety, we can talk about the overall security of the energy system. Regarding exchange. Where there is a prisoner exchange, there is the return of children. That is what we want to achieve,"" Zelenskyy explained.

Withdrawal of Russian troops

President also outlined how he sees the mechanism of withdrawing Russian troops from Ukraine. According to him, it is important to involve a large number of countries in this issue.

""If we have a serious number of countries and there is a corresponding communique, I believe this will be our diplomatic advantage. After that, we can organize platforms in various countries where each of these points will be technically worked out. And then this plan can be presented to the representatives of Russia. It's like it was with the grain initiative: we agreed on a plan with the UN and Türkiye, and then they separately agreed on this plan with Russia, the first corridor,"" he said.

Zelenskyy emphasized that ""it is important that there are not just 2 countries, but many countries.""

""Otherwise, the Russians will jump out, as was the case with the grain corridor, and we had to build another corridor. It was very difficult. And that's why we have such a plan on these 3 points. If we succeed, it definitely opens the way to the next meeting, where all other important matters should be addressed,"" the president said.

According to him, the Ukrainian government has such a vision: before talking to Russia, there must be a detailed plan that is approved by the entire world.

""We are working on different fronts. I speak with leaders. Diplomats Andrii Yermak is dealing with. Yesterday he presented an analytical document on Ukraine to NATO with Rasmussen in Denmark. In Brussels, he and our team met with many ambassadors, including China and the Global South, regarding the summit,"" the president added.

Ukraine's accession to EU and NATO

Speaking about accession to the European Union and NATO, the head of state expressed the opinion that the Ukrainian side has done everything possible so far.

""It's only about politics now. That is, instrumentally and operationally, we have done everything to open negotiations with the EU for Ukraine in June. I think everything will work out there. Even difficult partners today have become a bit simpler. We have actively worked with them,"" Zelenskyy said.

Government and Presidential Office rotations

He briefly commented on personnel matters in the Cabinet of Ministers and the Presidential Office, stating that it ""needs to be resolved.""

""We talked about it with the prime minister. Today we have acting duties in several ministries. This needs to be addressed,"" Zelenskyy said.

Situation with weapons and Czech initiative

The president assured that progress is being made even with the Czech initiative concerning artillery ammunition.

""For the first time in years of war, none of the brigades complain that there is no artillery shell. And this has been happening for the past 2 months. However, much more work still needs to be done. The Czech initiative will go on. We are negotiating money with all partners,"" he informed.

According to Zelenskyy, an initiative is now being opened where partners will provide funds for the production of our drones - EW systems specifically in this particular direction. He added that the technical indicators of Ukrainian drones are improving.

""We are starting to produce a lot of them, but there is not enough money for them. We are capable of producing more than there is money,"" the president said.

Partners' positions and fears

In Zelenskyy's opinion, partners fear the defeat of the Russian Federation in this war.

""They would like Ukraine to win so that Russia does not lose. Because it will be an unpredictable defeat and unpredictable geopolitics. I believe that this does not work that way. For Ukraine to win, we need to give it everything that winners have,"" he said.

Macron's idea of Western troops in Ukraine

Zelenskyy also commented on French President Emmanuel Macron's statement regarding the possible deployment of foreign troops to Ukraine.

""Training in Ukraine is logical, we have already talked about this. It's faster than going, for example, to France or even to Poland. And then there is cooperation on demining, and we can create a hub for repairing French equipment in Ukraine, so that it doesn't have to be sent to France. I look at this very positively, to be honest. All this could be a step that would push other countries as well. That is, it opens a new page in this war,"" the president believes.

Ceasefire during Olympics and potential duration of war

The President of Ukraine said that he does not yet believe in a ceasefire with Russia during the summer Olympic Games.

""We have had a ceasefire already. But it doesn't work very well with this enemy. Besides, there is a risk - who will make sure that their forces won't approach us during the ceasefire? Ceasefire doesn't prevent them from getting closer with equipment and then launching an offensive. That is, I don't understand the details. For me, it still sounds like a dead story,"" Zelenskyy said.

The president believes that Russian dictator Vladimir Putin is not interested in dialogue with the whole world because even China will tell him: ""Explain the occupation of territories!""

""Because China stands for the territorial integrity of any state. Today there should be grounds for Putin to seek a way out of this situation. Because now he has no discomfort. Because where are we shooting? What can we attack? With what? How will they help us economically? Will sanctions put enough pressure on them or not? Will there be a tribunal or not? We need to answer to each of these questions. And work and advance on each of these fronts every day,"" the president summed up.

If Tatarigami's take regarding President Zelenskyy's statement on ammunition availability is correct, then this is a major CIV-MIL problem:

Illia Ponomarenko writes about the two wars that Ukraine is fighting:

There's one thing that one should keep in mind as he or she follows the developments in Ukraine.

The people of Ukraine are actually fighting two wars at the same time. Apart from the Russian invasion, the largest war of aggression in Europe since Adolf Hitler, there's another war -- a domestic war of our people against so many things that undermine us from within.

It's about corrupt officials, it's about incompetent and populistic decision-makers, it's about those who embezzle our money allocated on fortifications and defenses, it's about those who give exemptions from military conscription to sports-betting firms (with very murky tax records), and don't it to charity foundations providing the military with fast and vital aid.

It's also, for instance, about entire departments of the SBU security service spying on anti-corruption investigating journalists during the war with Russia.

It's a war against so many things that try to drag us back to what we used to be - a weak and corrupt informal Russian colony.

Just like the ""military"" war with the foreign invader, this internal war for saving this country from its own dark side has had its victories and setbacks.

Every time high-profile malpractice is exposed in the open, it is fought daily, triggering a scandal and a public uproar.

And these two wars are interconnected.

A favorable outcome of the war against Russia's aggression is not possible without significant victories in this domestic war of ours.

That's our life and the struggle for national survival in the last... ten years!

And I must say that sometimes I look through the news, I can't help but keep thinking about the fact that so many of those insolent pen-pushers in high cabinets don't deserve to even hold a candle to all our men and women who save this country every single day and do the impossible on the fronts of Russia's war.

Meet ""Juice"", the warrior from the Rubizh Brigade.

She is from Kramatorsk, Donetsk region. During the first months of the full-scale invasion, she actively volunteered, and when enemy shelling destroyed her home, she did not hesitate and joined the ranks of the AFU. Now she is engaged in remote mining.

Tatarigami and his Frontelligence Insight team have a new assessment of the battlespace across a number of oblasts. From the Thread Reader App:

If you were wondering what Putin's justification for the invasion of Kharkiv Oblast is:

When this man finally goes, I would highly recommend having his brain checked for worms. RFK may have a few ideas. He's making some sort of a ""sanitary zone"". God knows what this even means. Sends a couple of thousand Russians to certain death and doesn't even blink an eye. Nothingburger. Just numbers.

I'm not even mentioning his statement about the shelling of civilians. This is said by the man who placed the murderers from Bucha next to him during the victory parade.

This person is absolutely inadequate, he is sick. He cannot be trusted to manage a pub, let alone the country.

Here's the machine translation of Sternenko's tweet:

2 Russian tanks were destroyed at once in the Kursk region 💥

Yesterday afternoon, the Russians pulled a couple of tanks to our state border near Sumy region. At first, artillery worked on them, not quite successfully.

Then the operators of Wings to Hell 103 OBrTRO took up the case.

With the help of your drones, both tanks were burned 🔥

russians have intensified assaults around Bakhmut area.

a big mechanized assault around Chasiv Yar - Ivanivske was stopped today. See the image for more details, you will also see more videos soon.

Also, infantry assaults are not stopping for the past 3 days around Ivanivske and Klishiivka. Enemy comes in much larger groups than before. Our defenders stand strong, but they are very exhausted.

""We reiterate our opposition to a full-scale military operation in Rafah that would have catastrophic consequences on the civilian population,"" read the appeal, sent by the countries' foreign ministers to their Israeli counterpart Israel Katz and made public.

The signatories were Australia, Britain, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea and EU member states Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Sweden.

The ministers welcomed recent measures adopted by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's cabinet to improve the flow of international aid into Gaza, but called for ""further steps"".

""We urge the Government of Israel to let the humanitarian aid enter into the Gaza strip through all relevant crossing points, including the one in Rafah,"" they said.

They called on Israel to take ""concrete action for the protection of civilians, international and local humanitarian aid workers and journalists"".

The appeal also called for ""a sustainable ceasefire"".

The ministers urged Israel to ""open all possible overland supply routes into Gaza"" for aid, to ""resume electricity, water and telecommunication services"", and boost significantly ""the supply of critically needed goods... particularly medical supplies"".

Finally, they called on Israel to ""facilitate further evacuations by issuing exit permits for all our citizens, eligible persons, and Palestinians admitted to relocate for humanitarian or medical reasons abroad"".

Eight months after the start of the war, Israel is vowing to intensify its ground offensive in Rafah despite international concerns for the hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians in the southern city.

The Israeli siege of Gaza has brought dire shortages of food as well as safe water, medicines and fuel for its 2.4 million people.

The arrival of occasional aid convoys has slowed to a trickle since Israeli forces took control last week of the Gaza side of the Rafah crossing.

The war broke out after the October 7 attack on southern Israel which resulted in the deaths of more than 1,170 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.

Out of 252 people taken hostage that day, 128 are still being held inside Gaza, including 38 who the army says are dead.

According to analysts, the plan to build ships with mobile nuclear power sources would raise tensions with its neighbours and pose risks to the environment.

Chinese media reports described the marine nuclear power platforms as small plants inside ships that would act as mobile ""power banks"" at sea for stationary facilities and other ships, VOA reported.

However, Beijing had suspended the project a year ago over safety and effectiveness concerns, according to the South China Morning Post.

But this month, the outgoing commander of the US Indo-Pacific Command and State Department Admiral John Aquilino said that China is still building the floating reactors to supply power to disputed islands, the Washington Post reported.

Although the US officials said that the deployment of such reactors would take several years, Admiral John Aquilino said their development would undermine regional security and stability, VOA reported.

Following this, last week, the Philippines echoed those concerns.

Philippines National Security Council Assistant Director General Jonathan Malaya said that China would use its floating reactors to power military bases it has built on artificial islands, including those within the Philippines' exclusive economic zone.

He added that China's nuclear plants would further militarize disputed areas of the South China Sea.

""Anything that supports their military presence in those islands is technically a threat to our national security and against our interests,"" he said, adding that Australia and the US would be among Manila's allies conducting joint patrols in the South China Sea, as reported by VOA.

According to Beijing's claims, they have control over almost the entire South China Sea, putting it in dispute with Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam.

Moreover, China has already built artificial islands with airport runways to strengthen its claims.

The analysts said that Beijing's floating reactors would not only strengthen its military presence in the area but also give it an excuse to extend its reach through security actions, VOA reported.

Song Yanhui, director of the International Law Society of the Republic of China, Taiwan, said that the current military security zone for China's artificial islands is a radius of 500 meters (1,640 feet), which means, other aircraft and ships that enter this radius can be legitimately expelled.

Song continued that if China deploys a floating nuclear power plant in the South China Sea, it could use the excuse of protecting the environment from radioactive pollution to drive away ships from a larger area or to take defensive measures.

For Beijing, he said, ""It kills two birds with one stone. It is a win-win strategy. It can strengthen its military presence, civilian use and claim to sovereignty.""But the potential for radiation leaks is a real concern, analysts said, reported VOA.

Pankaj Jha, dean of research at the School of International Affairs of India's Jindal Global University, highlighted that China's lack of experience in operating such floating reactors could spell disaster.

""It is a threat because it will contaminate water and also surrounding areas,"" he said. ""Any radiation leak would make the island uninhabitable and might also impact fishermen from the South China Sea.""In the event of a conflict with China, the analysts further noted that the floating reactors could also become military targets, reported VOA.

China has deployed radars, anti-ship and anti-aircraft missiles, and fighter jets, among other weapons, on the disputed territories of Mischief Reef, Subi Reef and Fiery Cross, the three largest artificial islands in the Spratly Islands.

Richard Fisher, senior fellow with the International Assessment and Strategy Center, stressed that floating nuclear power plants could also one day extend China's weapons capabilities.

""If they were protected, these nuclear power plants could also potentially power future energy weapon devices,"" Fisher said. ""Laser weapons that could knock down missiles and aircraft or very powerful microwave weapons could also disable missiles and aircraft that would get within their range.""Notably, China is not the first country to think of building floating nuclear reactors.

The US took the lead in proposing the concept in 1970 but due to safety concerns, they did not quickly pursue development, reported VOA.

Meanwhile, Russia is the only country that has brought a floating nuclear power plant to fruition, with the Akademik Lomonosov plant producing electricity and heating since 2020 from a harbour in Pevek, a town in the Arctic Circle.

Earlier in November last year, the International Atomic Energy Agency at a forum in Vienna expressed concern about the development of floating nuclear reactors, particularly when they cross international borders or operate in international waters.

""The IAEA is working with our member states to determine what further guidance and standards might be needed to ensure the safety of floating nuclear power plants,"" IAEA Deputy Director General Lydie Evrard said in a press release.

The IAEA further noted that Canada, China, Denmark, South Korea, Russia and the US are each working on marine-based ""small modular reactor designs."" (ANI)",industriesnews.net,news,industriesnews.net,,-0.207843137254902,453668212,1,https://cdn.bignewsnetwork.com/ani1715932774.jpg,

All countries belonging to the Group of Seven (G7) major democracies, apart from the United States, have signed the letter, Reuters reports, along with Australia, South Korea, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden and Finland.

The five-page letter comes as Israeli forces bear down on the southern Gaza city of Rafah as part of Israel's drive to eradicate Hamas, despite warnings this could result in mass casualties in an area where displaced civilians have found shelter.

It also reiterates the countries' ""outrage"" at the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel which triggered the conflict.

Israel denies blocking humanitarian aid to the territory, and says it needs to eliminate Hamas for its own protection.

The Western nations say in the letter they are opposed to ""a full-scale military operation in Rafah"" and called on Israel to let humanitarian aid reach the population ""through all relevant crossing points, including the one in Rafah"".

""According to UN estimates, an intensified military offensive would affect approximately 1.4 million people,"" the letter says, underscoring the need ""for specific, concrete and measurable steps"" to significantly boost the flow of aid.

The letter recognises Israel has made progress in addressing a number of issues, including letting more aid trucks into the Gaza Strip, the reopening of the Erez Crossing into northern Gaza, and the temporary use of the Port of Ashdod in southern Israel.

But it called on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government to do more, including working towards a ""sustainable ceasefire"", facilitating further evacuations and resuming ""electricity, water and telecommunication services"".

The ABC has reached out to Foreign Minister Penny Wong's office for comment.

Since Hamas's October 7 attack, Israel's Gaza offensive has killed more than 35,000 Palestinians, local health officials say.

Hamas-led gunmen killed some 1,200 people and abducted 253 in their attack on Israel, according to Israeli tallies.

Trucks carrying badly needed aid for the Gaza Strip rolled across a newly built US pier and into the besieged enclave for the first time on Friday, as Israeli restrictions on border crossings and heavy fighting hindered the delivery of food and other supplies.

The shipment is the first in an operation that American military officials anticipate could scale up to 150 truckloads a day, all while Israel presses in on the southern city of Rafah.

But the US and aid groups warn that the floating pier project is not a substitute for land deliveries that could bring in all the food, water and fuel needed in Gaza.

Before the war, more than 500 truckloads entered the territory on an average day.

The operation's success also remains tenuous because of the risk of militant attacks, logistical hurdles and a growing shortage of fuel for the trucks to run due to Israel's blockade of Gaza since Hamas's October 7 attack.

Aid agencies say they are running out of food in southern Gaza and fuel is dwindling, while the US Agency for International Development and the World Food Program say famine has already taken hold in Gaza's north.

Troops finished installing the floating pier on Thursday, and the US military's Central Command said the first aid crossed into Gaza at 9am Friday.

It said no American troops went ashore in the operation.

""This is an ongoing, multinational effort to deliver additional aid to Palestinian civilians in Gaza via a maritime corridor that is entirely humanitarian in nature, and will involve aid commodities donated by a number of countries and humanitarian organisations,"" the command said.

The Kuwaiti Speciality Hospital is one of the few places in Rafah the wounded or dying can turn for care, but that may change if Israel launches a full-scale advance into the southern Gaza city, doctors there say.

Staff at the hospital say they fear such an assault would produce a crush of new patients that would overwhelm exhausted doctors, who already complain of shortages of medicine and proper equipment.

""We have been here from the start of the war until now, and I do hope they will not target us, they will not threaten us,"" said doctor Jamal al-Hams.

""I do hope the whole medical team will continue to present its services to the injured people, to the critically ill patients, to the people who have chronic diseases.""

Gaza's medical system has virtually collapsed under Israel's bombardment began in October.

Doctors complain they have to perform surgery, including amputations, with no anaesthetics or painkillers.

Palestinian Abdelilah Farhat, a patient at the hospital, said he had survived a brush with death while he was out looking for a grocery store that was open.

""Thank God, he had it fated that I would get injured, and he saved me. The rocket fell only one metre away from a man,"" he said.

Witnesses and medical professionals said Israeli troops have attacked hospitals, blockaded them and killed doctors and other civilians there. Israel denies such allegations and says it goes to great lengths to protect civilians.

It says hospitals in Gaza are used by Hamas as bases, and has released videos and pictures supporting the assertion.

The U.S. took additional measures to help shield the domestic solar manufacturing sector from what the Biden administration calls unfair trade practices by China.

This week, the Biden administration said it would eliminate a tariff exemption for imported bifacial solar panels, which are commonly used in utility-scale solar projects.

The White House also said it would end on June 6 the 24-month waiver on tariffs for certain solar panels imported from Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam as the U.S. ramps domestic solar panel production. In addition, the Department of Commerce is mandating that panels imported duty-free must be installed within 180 days to prevent stockpiling.

""The U.S. Trade Representative, the Department of Energy and the Department of Commerce will closely monitor import patterns to ensure the U.S. market does not become oversaturated and will explore all available measures to take action against unfair practices,"" the White House said in a statement May 16.

And, incentives made available in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) have played a big part in many solar manufacturers' decisions to expand in the U.S. as solar's share of growth in U.S. electricity generation soars.

However, anticompetitive subsidization and trade practices in China has led to a dumping of ""artificially cheap modules and components onto the global market and circumventing trade enforcement measures in an attempt to put other countries' manufacturers out of business,"" according to the White House.

The Commerce Department also announced it would take up an antidumping and countervailing duties (AD/CVD) petition filed recently.

The petitions concerning crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells were filed by the American Alliance for Solar Manufacturing Trade Committee, according to Washington D.C.-based law firm Wiley Rein LLP, which represents the group. The petitioning companies claim mainly China-headquartered companies operating in Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam are flooding the U.S. market with panels believed to be sold at prices below the cost of production.

The actions by the Biden administration are intended to help strengthen the U.S. solar sector.

Here's a look at other renewable energy news this week.

Dairy digester developer Maas Energy Works has partnered with Clean Energy Fuels Corp. to develop nine renewable natural gas (RNG) production facilities at dairy farms in seven states across the U.S., the companies said May 14.

With a combined herd size of about 35,000 cows, the facilities will capture methane emissions from manure using Maas Energy's lagoon cover digesters to help produce up to about 4 million gallons of RNG annually. Clean Energy plans to use the RNG as transportation fuel for its network of RNG stations.

""If the markets for renewable fuels are clear and consistent, then American's biogas industry will deliver,"" said Maas Energy Works CEO Daryl Maas. ""We will soon be capturing fugitive manure emissions and turning them into carbon-negative truck fuel with our partners at Clean Energy.""

Use of RNG, which is less carbon intense than fossil fuels, is seen as a way to help lower emissions. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, agriculture accounts for about 10% of greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S., while transportation accounts for 28%.

Construction of the facilities is expected to be complete in 2026. The companies said they plan to construct the production facilities in Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Nebraska, New Mexico and South Dakota.

Waste management firm WM is exploring a sale of its RNG business that could be worth about $3 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.

The Houston-based company is working with JPMorgan Chase & Co. to gauge interest from potential buyers, which could include energy companies and private equity firms, the sources said, requesting anonymity as the discussions are confidential.

WM is planning to offload the rights to develop RNG operations on 115 landfills that it owns, the sources said, adding that the company would retain ownership of the landfills. RNG is methane captured from biological waste and converted into electricity or fuel.

If the deal talks conclude successfully, it would mark one of the biggest asset sales in the nascent U.S. RNG industry. The largest sale was BP's $4.1 billion takeover of Archea Energy in 2022.

""We are always looking for ways to maximize the value of our renewable energy business for our shareholders, which may range from organic growth initiatives to partnerships or monetization through a sale,"" WM said in a statement.

JPMorgan declined to comment.

WM had planned to invest about $1.2 billion between 2022 and 2025 to grow the RNG business. The firm now wants to spend that capital in other areas, the sources said.

GTI Energy spinout SunGas Renewables and A.P. Moller-Maersk-owned C2X have entered a partnership to jointly develop, own and operate green methanol production facilities in North America, according to a May 14 news release.

C2X, which also invested in convertible preferred stock issued by SunGas, is working to scale green methanol production for multiple industries. SunGas looks to develop projects and sell its gasification equipment systems to customers building and operating renewable fuels production facilities, the release states.

The companies said the investment will support the Beaver Lake Renewable Energy green methanol project SunGas is developing in central Louisiana. The facility will have a capacity to produce more than 400,000 tons per year of green methanol when it becomes fully operational in 2028.

Natural gas service provider NW Natural and Modern Hydrogen are producing hydrogen and capturing solid carbon in Oregon as part of a three-year pilot project exploring potential hydrogen applications.

The hydrogen is produced via methane pyrolysis, which uses heat to separate hydrogen and carbon from methane. Generated at NW Natural's Central Resource Center in southeast Portland, the hydrogen is blended with natural gas and delivered via existing infrastructure, NW Natural said May 16 in a news release.

As part of the process, solid carbon is collected and used to create Modern Hydrogen asphalt products, which are used in applications such as paving and road repair projects.

""Over the years, we have held to our core values of safety and service, while embracing new technologies and better ways of doing things,"" said NW Natural CEO David Anderson. ""Today we're looking to renewable natural gas, clean hydrogen, carbon capture and other ways to decarbonize our system. People are eager for solutions that can be put into action today, and we're proud to play our part.""

NW Natural and Modern Hydrogen recently marked the official unveiling of the project.

Spanish energy company Cepsa has selected Thyssenkrupp Nucera as the preferred supplier of a 300-megawatt (MW) electrolyzer for Cepsa's green hydrogen plant in Spain.

The company plans to use 15 of Thyssenkrupp Nucera's standardized scalum electrolyzer units with a capacity of 20 MW each, the electrolyzer manufacturer said in a news release May 13. The electrolyzers will be powered by solar and wind energy.

In addition, Thyssenkrupp Nucera will help in the design and engineering of the hydrogen plant until a final investment decision on the project is reached.

Cepsa plans to produce up to 47,000 tons of green hydrogen per year as part of a bigger plan --

Andalusian Green Hydrogen Valley -- to develop 2 gigawatts of green hydrogen capacity in Spain by 2030, according to the release. The first phase of Cepsa's green hydrogen project in Spain is located at the company's energy park in Huelva.

The U.S. Treasury Department issued new rules on how clean energy project developers can qualify for a tax credit meant to incentivize the use of U.S. equipment.

The 10% domestic content bonus is in addition to a 30% credit for renewable energy facilities included in President Joe Biden's landmark climate change law, the Inflation Reduction Act.

Treasury first unveiled guidelines for claiming the bonus credit a year ago, but project developers complained that the complex rules made it difficult to use.

To qualify, the IRA specifies that 40% of the cost of a project's so-called manufactured products must be made in the U.S. Those products could include solar panels, inverters or battery packs. But determining the cost of labor and materials for products built with components from multiple suppliers -- often in different parts of the world -- proved challenging.

Under the new rules, the Treasury will allow project developers to use default cost percentages determined by the Department of Energy to qualify for the credit.

The Treasury said it was still considering additional rules that would help offshore wind developers qualify for the domestic content bonus. It is also evaluating ways to incentivize manufacturing of solar wafers, the building blocks for solar cells.

Qcells, a division of Korea's Hanwha Corp. investing $2.5 billion in U.S. solar factories, said the Biden administration's measures were ""critical to creating tens of thousands of jobs in America.""

The first turbine foundation has been installed for the Ørsted and Eversource-owned Revolution Wind project offshore Rhode Island and Connecticut, according to a May 15 news release.

When the offshore wind farm becomes fully operational in 2025, it is expected to generate 400 MW of energy for Rhode Island and 304 MW for Connecticut.

""America's offshore wind industry is scaling up, and the first steel in the water at Revolution Wind is a tremendous milestone for Rhode Island and Connecticut's clean energy journey,"" said David Hardy, Group executive vice president and CEO Americas at Ørsted. ""We're building on our successful track record with the Block Island Wind Farm and South Fork Wind, and Revolution Wind can generate more than four times as much power as those two projects put together, demonstrating the enormous economic opportunity of offshore wind.""

With the first turbine foundation installed, the project's offshore construction phase moves forward with work to install the remaining foundations, two offshore substations, inter-array and export cables and wind turbines, the release states.

Europe's largest utility Iberdrola will keep betting on offshore wind in the coming years, roughly tripling the value of its assets in the sector to 17 billion euros ($18 billion), Iberdrola Executive Chairman Ignacio Sanchez Galan told shareholders on May 17.

In the past couple of years, the Spanish firm has shifted its focus to upgrading and expanding power grids while taking a more selective approach to renewables that favors investments in offshore wind.

In the next three years, offshore wind projects will get more than 50% of the planned 15.5 billion-euro investment in renewables, under a new plan presented in March.

The company currently has a project in Germany and two in Britain-including a partnership with Denmark's Ørsted -- in operation. Including the partnership, the projects account for around 6 billion euros in investments.

It is now building projects in the U.S., Britain, France and Germany.

""Once finished, there will be 17 billion-euro assets in this sector, which also have guaranteed income,"" Sanchez Galan said, since production is already sold through long-term contracts.

""Our commitment to offshore wind will continue,"" he said.

Iberdrola is currently bidding for new offshore wind farm auctions in Britain and the U.S., the chairman said.

""We have recently been awarded a new project in Japan and an offshore site for future construction in Australia,"" said Sanchez Galan, adding there was an ""excellent outlook"" for the technology.",hartenergy.com,news,Hart Energy,,0.2862745098039217,453666903,4,https://www.hartenergy.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_650x650/public/image/2024/05/et-roundup_0.jpg?itok=wJmtyrgu,eng-9566425

'We reiterate our opposition to a full-scale military operation in Rafah that would have catastrophic consequences on the civilian population,' read the appeal, sent by the countries' foreign ministers to their Israeli counterpart Israel Katz and made public.

The signatories were Australia, Britain, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea and EU member states Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Sweden.

The ministers welcomed recent measures adopted by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's cabinet to improve the flow of international aid into Gaza, but called for 'further steps'.

'We urge the Government of Israel to let the humanitarian aid enter into the Gaza strip through all relevant crossing points, including the one in Rafah,' they said.

They called on Israel to take 'concrete action for the protection of civilians, international and local humanitarian aid workers and journalists'.

The appeal also called for 'a sustainable ceasefire'.

The ministers urged Israel to 'open all possible overland supply routes into Gaza' for aid, to 'resume electricity, water and telecommunication services', and boost significantly 'the supply of critically needed goods... particularly medical supplies'.

Finally, they called on Israel to 'facilitate further evacuations by issuing exit permits for all our citizens, eligible persons, and Palestinians admitted to relocate for humanitarian or medical reasons abroad'.

Eight months after the start of the war, Israel is vowing to intensify its ground offensive in Rafah despite international concerns for the hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians in the southern city.

The Israeli siege of Gaza has brought dire shortages of food as well as safe water, medicines and fuel for its 2.4 million people.

The arrival of occasional aid convoys has slowed to a trickle since Israeli forces took control last week of the Gaza side of the Rafah crossing.

The war broke out after the October 7 attack on southern Israel which resulted in the deaths of more than 1,170 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.

Out of 252 people taken hostage that day, 128 are still being held inside Gaza, including 38 who the army says are dead.

Israel vowed in response to crush Hamas and launched a military offensive on Gaza, where at least 35,303 people have been killed since

But when President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan hosted Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis in Ankara this week, it was almost a routine talk between neighbours.

The meeting was their fourth in 10 months as the two leaders try to put an end to decades of mutual animosity by focusing on trade, tourism, energy and repairing cultural ties, among other areas.

""In the critical area of migration, the cooperation between our two countries and especially between the police and the coast guard is paying off against illegal flows and against the wretched traffickers, who take advantage of desperate people's pain,"" said Mitsotakis in a common press conference.

""This cooperation must continue and be intensified.""

There are still areas where both sides have agreed to disagree, but it's good to see one old trouble spot in Europe sort of fading, especially as another trouble spot reignited big time this week.

Thousands of protesters in Georgia rallied near the parliament building in Tbilisi - again - just hours after lawmakers gave the final approval to the controversial foreign influence law, modelled on a Russian version passed more than a decade earlier.

Lawmakers passed the law despite EU warnings that it would undermine Georgia's path to EU membership.

Yet, the official reaction in Brussels was muted.

Speaking in Denmark, EU Council President Charles Michel said: ""I had a phone call a few days ago with the Prime Minister and I told him that I am disappointed and that I sincerely hope that Georgia will find a way to stick to the democratic principles and also meet the expectations of the population.""

Meanwhile, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development released its latest economic outlook. The numbers for Georgia, which is part of the area where the EBRD operates, were rather sobering.

In general, the forecast also contained some encouraging news.

To learn more, we spoke to Beata Javorcik, chief economist of the EBRD.

Euronews: So, your latest report is appropriately called ""Taming Inflation"" - and when I look at the numbers, inflation in the EBRD regions came down from a peak in October 2022 of 17.5 percent to an average of 6.3 percent last March. Explain that number for us, what is behind such a huge drop?

Javorcik: What has helped bring the inflation down was to a large extent, the developments in the international markets. We have seen a sharp drop in the prices of natural gas in Europe, declines in prices of agricultural commodities, and oil prices have remained moderate. But, of course, inflation in our regions of operations still remains above the level before the pandemic, as is the case in advanced economies.

Euronews: Can you breathe a sigh of relief now or are there still important inflation risks remaining?

Javorcik: Not all central bankers can consider their job done. If you look at cumulative inflation, that is inflation since February 2022 up until now, it has exceeded 30% in several countries. Notably in Egypt, in Turkey, in Hungary and Kazakhstan, Moldova and Ukraine. So, that means that in the absence of wage increases, people in those countries would have lost a third of their purchasing power.

Euronews: Let's talk about the growth outlook in the EBRD's EU regions - do you see positive signs going forward?

Javorcik: This year is going to be much better than last year for the Eastern European EU member states, in particular Poland and Croatia, stand out with expected growth of 3%. Hungary will do well, too. We see real wages increasing. We see fiscal policy helping out and the EU funding, the New Generation EU, also stimulating economic activity.

Euronews: I can't release you without a word on Ukraine. How is their economy doing in the third year of the war?

Javorcik: The heavy bombings in the last two months mean that the ability of Ukraine to generate electricity has been severely diminished. Electricity production is at 40% of what it used to be before the bombings. And this capacity cannot be easily repaired.

Washington: The US military warned that China is moving forward with developing floating nuclear reactors in the South China Sea to hold up its claim to the disputed maritime territory, a development, which analysts have stressed would pose risks to the environment, reported Voice of America (VOA).

According to analysts, the plan to build ships with mobile nuclear power sources would raise tensions with its neighbours and pose risks to the environment.

Chinese media reports described the marine nuclear power platforms as small plants inside ships that would act as mobile ""power banks"" at sea for stationary facilities and other ships, VOA reported.

However, Beijing had suspended the project a year ago over safety and effectiveness concerns, according to the South China Morning Post.

But this month, the outgoing commander of the US Indo-Pacific Command and State Department Admiral John Aquilino said that China is still building the floating reactors to supply power to disputed islands, the Washington Post reported.

Although the US officials said that the deployment of such reactors would take several years, Admiral John Aquilino said their development would undermine regional security and stability, VOA reported.

Following this, last week, the Philippines echoed those concerns.

Philippines National Security Council Assistant Director General Jonathan Malaya said that China would use its floating reactors to power military bases it has built on artificial islands, including those within the Philippines' exclusive economic zone.

He added that China's nuclear plants would further militarize disputed areas of the South China Sea.

""Anything that supports their military presence in those islands is technically a threat to our national security and against our interests,"" he said, adding that Australia and the US would be among Manila's allies conducting joint patrols in the South China Sea, as reported by VOA.

According to Beijing's claims, they have control over almost the entire South China Sea, putting it in dispute with Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam.

Moreover, China has already built artificial islands with airport runways to strengthen its claims.

The analysts said that Beijing's floating reactors would not only strengthen its military presence in the area but also give it an excuse to extend its reach through security actions, VOA reported.

Song Yanhui, director of the International Law Society of the Republic of China, Taiwan, said that the current military security zone for China's artificial islands is a radius of 500 meters (1,640 feet), which means, other aircraft and ships that enter this radius can be legitimately expelled.

Song continued that if China deploys a floating nuclear power plant in the South China Sea, it could use the excuse of protecting the environment from radioactive pollution to drive away ships from a larger area or to take defensive measures.

For Beijing, he said, ""It kills two birds with one stone. It is a win-win strategy. It can strengthen its military presence, civilian use and claim to sovereignty.""

But the potential for radiation leaks is a real concern, analysts said, reported VOA.

Pankaj Jha, dean of research at the School of International Affairs of India's Jindal Global University, highlighted that China's lack of experience in operating such floating reactors could spell disaster.

""It is a threat because it will contaminate water and also surrounding areas,"" he said. ""Any radiation leak would make the island uninhabitable and might also impact fishermen from the South China Sea.""

In the event of a conflict with China, the analysts further noted that the floating reactors could also become military targets, reported VOA.

China has deployed radars, anti-ship and anti-aircraft missiles, and fighter jets, among other weapons, on the disputed territories of Mischief Reef, Subi Reef and Fiery Cross, the three largest artificial islands in the Spratly Islands.

Richard Fisher, senior fellow with the International Assessment and Strategy Center, stressed that floating nuclear power plants could also one day extend China's weapons capabilities.

""If they were protected, these nuclear power plants could also potentially power future energy weapon devices,"" Fisher said. ""Laser weapons that could knock down missiles and aircraft or very powerful microwave weapons could also disable missiles and aircraft that would get within their range.""

Notably, China is not the first country to think of building floating nuclear reactors.

The US took the lead in proposing the concept in 1970 but due to safety concerns, they did not quickly pursue development, reported VOA.

Meanwhile, Russia is the only country that has brought a floating nuclear power plant to fruition, with the Akademik Lomonosov plant producing electricity and heating since 2020 from a harbour in Pevek, a town in the Arctic Circle.

Earlier in November last year, the International Atomic Energy Agency at a forum in Vienna expressed concern about the development of floating nuclear reactors, particularly when they cross international borders or operate in international waters.

""The IAEA is working with our member states to determine what further guidance and standards might be needed to ensure the safety of floating nuclear power plants,"" IAEA Deputy Director General Lydie Evrard said in a press release.

The IAEA further noted that Canada, China, Denmark, South Korea, Russia and the US are each working on marine-based ""small modular reactor designs.""

All countries belonging to the Group of Seven (G7) major democracies, apart from the United States, have signed the letter, Reuters reports, along with Australia, South Korea, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden and Finland.

The five-page letter comes as Israeli forces bear down on the southern Gaza city of Rafah as part of its drive to eradicate Hamas, despite warnings this could result in mass casualties in an area where displaced civilians have found shelter.

It also reiterates the countries' ""outrage"" at the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel which triggered the conflict.

Israel denies blocking humanitarian aid to the territory, and says it needs to eliminate Hamas for its own protection.

The Western nations say in the letter they are opposed to ""a full-scale military operation in Rafah"" and called on Israel to let humanitarian aid reach the population ""through all relevant crossing points, including the one in Rafah"".

""According to UN estimates, an intensified military offensive would affect approximately 1.4 million people,"" the letter says, underscoring the need ""for specific, concrete and measurable steps"" to significantly boost the flow of aid.

The letter recognises Israel has made progress in addressing a number of issues, including letting more aid trucks into the Gaza Strip, the reopening of the Erez Crossing into northern Gaza, and the temporary use of the Port of Ashdod in southern Israel.

But it called on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government to do more, including working towards a ""sustainable ceasefire"", facilitating further evacuations and resuming ""electricity, water and telecommunication services"".

The ABC has reached out to Foreign Minister Penny Wong's office for comment.

Since Hamas's October 7 attack, Israel's Gaza offensive has killed more than 35,000 Palestinians, local health officials say.

Hamas-led gunmen killed some 1,200 people and abducted 253 in their attack on Israel, according to Israeli tallies.

Trucks carrying badly needed aid for the Gaza Strip rolled across a newly built US pier and into the besieged enclave for the first time on Friday, as Israeli restrictions on border crossings and heavy fighting hindered the delivery of food and other supplies.

The shipment is the first in an operation that American military officials anticipate could scale up to 150 truckloads a day, all while Israel presses in on the southern city of Rafah.

But the US and aid groups warn that the floating pier project is not a substitute for land deliveries that could bring in all the food, water and fuel needed in Gaza.

Before the war, more than 500 truckloads entered the territory on an average day.

The operation's success also remains tenuous because of the risk of militant attacks, logistical hurdles and a growing shortage of fuel for the trucks to run due to Israel's blockade of Gaza since Hamas's October 7 attack.

Aid agencies say they are running out of food in southern Gaza and fuel is dwindling, while the US Agency for International Development and the World Food Program say famine has already taken hold in Gaza's north.

Troops finished installing the floating pier on Thursday, and the US military's Central Command said the first aid crossed into Gaza at 9am Friday.

It said no American troops went ashore in the operation.

""This is an ongoing, multinational effort to deliver additional aid to Palestinian civilians in Gaza via a maritime corridor that is entirely humanitarian in nature, and will involve aid commodities donated by a number of countries and humanitarian organisations,"" the command said.

The Kuwaiti Speciality Hospital is one of the few places in Rafah the wounded or dying can turn for care, but that may change if Israel launches a full-scale advance into the southern Gaza city, doctors there say.

Staff at the hospital say they fear such an assault would produce a crush of new patients that would overwhelm exhausted doctors, who already complain of shortages of medicine and proper equipment.

""We have been here from the start of the war until now, and I do hope they will not target us, they will not threaten us,"" said doctor Jamal al-Hams.

""I do hope the whole medical team will continue to present its services to the injured people, to the critically ill patients, to the people who have chronic diseases.""

Gaza's medical system has virtually collapsed under Israel's bombardment began in October.

Doctors complain they have to perform surgery, including amputations, with no anaesthetics or painkillers.

Palestinian Abdelilah Farhat, a patient at the hospital, said he had survived a brush with death while he was out looking for a grocery store that was open.

""Thank God, he had it fated that I would get injured, and he saved me. The rocket fell only one metre away from a man,"" he said.

Witnesses and medical professionals said Israeli troops have attacked hospitals, blockaded them and killed doctors and other civilians there. Israel denies such allegations and says it goes to great lengths to protect civilians.

Published in Energy Supply, May 2024.

Some say we should conduct research into new technologies that will be able to meet tomorrow's energy requirements and also stop climate change. I understand that it may be comforting to believe that a new technology can save us. But for every new technology that sees the light of day, the question is no longer just whether it works and is sufficiently inexpensive to use. With the speed at which the climate crisis is developing, the question is also how quickly the new technology can install the first gigawatt in the electricity grid.

We emit too much CO2 into the atmosphere. We have known this for 130 years. If we are to believe the five-year forecast issued by the International Energy Agency (IEA), we need to install just as much renewable energy globally as we have done in the past 20 years. The electricity grid must also be expanded correspondingly. Otherwise, we will not only fail to meet the 1.5°C goal that the world has proclaimed as a target, but also the 2°C goal.

Loads of renewable energy available

Fortunately, there is no need for a new miracle technology. We already have all the technology we need. We have technologies that can harvest wind, sun and hydropower, and, in combination, if they are installed in the right way and with the necessary volumes, we already have a solution to the problem.

There are also abundant volumes of renewable energy waiting to be harvested. The sun constantly sends 175,000 terawatts towards the Earth. In comparison, the global electricity requirement is approximately 3.4 terawatts. If we harvested solar energy in the Sahara Desert on an area equivalent to Zealand and Funen, this alone could cover the world's electricity consumption.

There will also be sufficient renewable energy available by harvesting the wind. This alone can generate about 68 terawatts on land. If this did not mean in practice that the wind turbines would block each other, it would be sufficient to cover the world's electricity consumption if wind turbines were installed back-to-back in the entire North Sea.

Existing technology is profitable

What we need is more industrialization. It is far cheaper to scale existing technology than to invent new technology.

The production of wind turbines and solar cells has been industrialized, making the technologies economically available. Both solar cells and wind turbines onshore and offshore are already cheaper to invest in than coal-fired power. And much cheaper than nuclear power.

According to OurWorldInData, electricity from solar cells has, for example, gone from costing DKK 2.62 per kilowatt hour (kWh) in 2010 to costing as little as DKK 0.16 per kWh at best in 2019. In comparison, the price of coal was DKK 0.75 per kWh in 2019.

Unlike coal, the price of solar cells and wind turbines continues to fall. According to the American think tank Lazard, a kWh from solar and wind energy cost at best DKK 0.17 per kWh last year. This corresponds to DKK 765 for a Danish family's annual electricity consumption of 4,500 kWh before adding grid tariffs and taxes.

Connect the technologies is the challenge

Individual technologies can and must still be improved and industrialized. But we have the technologies needed. The real task lies in integrating all these technologies in a large cohesive system so that a stable green electricity supply can match the demand and so that the demand can adjust to the supply. And this requires development.

It requires that we work to connect technologies so that they can supplement each other.

We are already doing this: When the wind blows so much in Denmark that the wind turbines harvest more energy than needed, we send electricity to Norway. When there is no wind, we buy electricity from the hydropower plants in Norway. With this kind of exchange, Denmark has days when the share of energy from renewable energy sources exceeds 120 percent.

But if we are to make the 100-percent mark throughout the year, and not just on selected high-wind days, we must be able to transport energy from multiple technologies simultaneously via the existing electricity grid. And here hybrid power plants are part of the solution. A hybrid power plant has installed several technologies at the same grid connection point, as opposed to, for example, a wind turbine, solar power plant, or a coal-fired power plant.

Hybrid power plants part of the solution

So far, the demand has driven a large part of the development of wind turbines to the current level. With countries such as South Africa, whose existing coal-fired power plants are so run down that they are facing massive investments in their energy system, there are also prospects of high demand for hybrid power plants -- the so-called energy parks.

In Korea, there is an example of how the existing electricity grid infrastructure -- currently one of the two major bottlenecks globally -- can be reused. They have built a large plant with floating solar cells handled by the existing hydroelectric power plant.

At DTU, we are currently working on connecting solar power and wind energy. In DTEC, which is a partnership between TotalEnergies and DTU, the first sod was cut this year for the construction of a test hybrid power plant connected to the electricity grid, which will contribute to our ability to utilize and store renewable energy across energy sources such as wind, sun, and hydrogen in the future. A floating solar plant is also being constructed in Roskilde Fjord near Risø.

The hybrid power plant will be part of the NEST Facilities research infrastructure, which is a national collaboration project across test facilities in Denmark: two in Risø, two in Aalborg, and one in Aarhus. These facilities produce electricity in different ways and can also store the electricity and convert it into new molecules, such as hydrogen, methanol, or ammonia.

The tests we can perform will bring us a big step closer to ensuring 100 percent renewable energy. We do not need to be saved by miracle technologies. Investing in the existing technologies and getting them to interact will undoubtedly help us save ourselves.

In November last year, ULC-Energy announced it had signed an agreement with Denmark's Topsoe, the UK's Rolls-Royce SMR and Dutch energy market consultancy KYOS to jointly investigate the production of hydrogen using Topsoe's Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cell (SOEC) technology with both electricity and heat produced by a Rolls-Royce SMR nuclear power plant.

The joint investigation was to include a valuation of the operational flexibility of the Rolls-Royce SMR in combination with Topsoe's proprietary SOEC technology in the future energy market.

ULC-Energy has now announced the results of the study, saying the study had revealed significant advantages of the SMR-SOEC combination: a Rolls-Royce SMR power plant can operate 24/7, with 95% availability; SOEC electrolysis can produce more hydrogen per total power input when compared with conventional electrolyser technologies; steam can be supplied directly from the nuclear power plant heat exchangers; and hydrogen production can take place off-grid.

The results revealed that hydrogen can be produced this way for less than EUR3.50 per kilogram and that this cost can be driven down to less than EUR2.00 per kilogram by 2050 ""by taking into account the value of the flexibility to curtail hydrogen production and deliver electricity to an increasingly intermittent grid"".

The study also demonstrated that the SMR-SOEC combination produces the highest annual quantity of hydrogen as a result of higher process efficiency and a high availability.

""The large-scale production of clean hydrogen is an extremely important driver of decarbonisation,"" said ULC-Energy CEO Dirk Rabelink. ""At ULC-Energy we believe strongly that nuclear can and will play a major role to produce clean hydrogen and derivative clean fuels.

""The study that is now completed clearly demonstrates the capability of nuclear to deliver low-cost, clean hydrogen at an industrial scale. Importantly, it also shows the additional value associated with the flexibility to switch between energy markets such as electricity, heat and, in this case, hydrogen. Topsoe SOEC and Rolls-Royce SMR are both highly modularised solutions that are factory manufactured and can be scaled rapidly.""

Rolls-Royce SMR's Director of Strategy and Business Development Alan Woods added: ""Rolls-Royce SMR believes one of its powerful advantages is that it can produce clean energy cheaply and extremely reliably, but can also direct its output to meet demand. This operational flexibility will be increasingly valuable as intermittent energy sources, such as wind and solar, expand. We are excited by the results of ULC-Energy's study and look forward to taking next steps.""

In August 2022, Rolls-Royce SMR signed an exclusive agreement with ULC-Energy to collaborate on the deployment of Rolls-Royce SMR power plants in the Netherlands. ULC-Energy - established in 2021 and based in Amsterdam - aims to accelerate decarbonisation in the Netherlands by developing nuclear energy projects that efficiently integrate with residential and industrial energy networks in the country.",world-nuclear-news.org,news,World Nuclear News (WNN),,0.4352941176470588,453648362,7,,eng-9583641

The EU's gross domestic product (GDP) remained stable, registering just a small increase (0.2% in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared with the same quarter of 2022).

This information comes from data on quarterly estimates for greenhouse gas emissions by economic activity published by Eurostat today. Quarterly estimates of greenhouse gas emissions complement quarterly socio-economic data, such as GDP or employment. This article presents a handful of findings from the more detailed Statistics Explained article on quarterly greenhouse gas emissions.

In the fourth quarter of 2023, the economic sectors responsible for the largest reductions compared with the fourth quarter of 2022 were electricity and gas supply (- 17.2%) and manufacturing (-3.1%). Emissions by households remained almost stable.

Greenhouse gas emissions down in 22 EU countries

In the fourth quarter of 2023, greenhouse gas emissions are estimated to have decreased in 22 EU countries, when compared with the same quarter of 2022.

The largest reductions in greenhouse gases are estimated for Estonia (-23.0%), Bulgaria (-17.0%) and Finland (-9.0%).

Out of the 22 EU members that are estimated to have decreased their emissions, 10 also recorded a decline in their GDP (Estonia, Finland, Sweden, Germany, Austria, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, The Netherlands and Luxembourg). Hungary maintained the GDP at the same level while decreasing emissions. The other 11 EU countries (Bulgaria, Belgium, Czechia, Denmark, Italy, Spain, France, Poland, Portugal, Romania and Croatia) are estimated to have managed to decrease emissions while growing their GDP.

Finally, they called on Israel to ""facilitate further evacuations by issuing exit permits for all our citizens, eligible persons, and Palestinians admitted to relocate for humanitarian or medical reasons abroad"".

Eight months after the start of the war, Israel is vowing to intensify its ground offensive in Rafah despite international concerns for the hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians in the southern city.

The Israeli siege of Gaza has brought dire shortages of food as well as safe water, medicines and fuel for its 2.4 million people.

The arrival of occasional aid convoys has slowed to a trickle since Israeli forces took control last week of the Gaza side of the Rafah crossing.

They have been on the roads of the capital since March 2024, supporting campus operations between King's College London sites at Denmark Hill, Guy's, Waterloo and Strand.

With a range of 180 to 200 miles on a full charge - which is typical performance for one of the new vans - the switch will help decrease King's long-term carbon footprint in line with its Climate & Sustainability Action Plan.

In addition, the vans are wrapped in a fully recyclable self-adhesive film and liner, and after their lifespan the liveries will be fully recycled.

Nick O'Donnell, Director of Estates and Facilities, said, ""We are delighted to have introduced our new electric vehicle fleet for use on and around our campuses.

""These new vehicles represent another positive step toward reducing our carbon footprint at King's.

""We have worked to source and wrap the new vehicles using fully recyclable self-adhesive film and liner which will now be seen across our campuses in their vibrant green branding showcasing King's sustainability in action.""

Arduously suppressing their morning smoker's coughs, with briefcases full of sandwiches, with bread bags dangling from their shoulders, with thermoses of coffee in their jacket pockets, the workers, columns of them -- tides that barely part before the honking, trundling cars -- cross the factory grounds, immediately filling the changing rooms, where the ruckus sets in, the clatter of the locker doors, the voices greeting stragglers with mockery so shrewd even at this early hour -- the workers' irrepressible sense of humor (Friedrich Engels) -- and one last time, at 5:25, a disconcerting smell spreads in the changing rooms: bed warmth that the bodies still seem to give off, effortfully ignored by the workers who, at 5:30 sharp, amid the howling of sirens, flood back into the factory halls, whose doors crash shut, and it begins, what the word arduous at last describes truthfully: the unleashed work of all the workers.

1.

That work whose perfectly calculated architecture of activity and rest is acoustically mirrored in a firmament of noise beneath the glass roof . . . so compelling, in the hours before the breakfast break, that the workers soon find a symbolic form for their multifarious actions' subjugation to a higher power, and head off signs of weariness, by striking up choruses to the rhythm of the hammer blows, so that the engineering teams in their glass observation posts, monitoring the interplay of operations with a visible edge to their gaze, at last relax their furrowed faces, perceiving that their compositions will merge to yield a symphony in which all instrumental phrases complete one another.

2.

Are the workers really these flattened monsters of tonality. --

Before the siren sounds for the morning break, all the sounds merge into a ponderous chorus that plumbs the last, still-dark corners of the factory halls and summons the hiddenmost things into the daylight. At this hour, the stokers emerge from the boiler rooms; each with the handle of a wooden crate hooked in the crook of his arm, shuffling, their faces already blackened by coal dust -- trickling drops of sweat have cleared just a few streaks from the temples down the cheeks -- they head to the tool store with empty milk bottles lined up in their crates to be exchanged for full bottles. Leaning on the ledge outside the service window, patiently awaiting their allotment of milk, they gaze down the halls, interior opening onto interior, and the noise streams into their ear canals as though through layers of cotton wool. Those ears are not responsive to the symphony's harmonies. As an outsider, the first things to strike the stoker are the musical breakdowns that seem latent in the orchestra's performance, catastrophic breakdowns that, if they came to pass, would cause entire phrases to collapse; the sudden, over-harsh whine of a grinding machine's magnetic table swiveling at the end of its trajectory yanks his gaze in that direction; the shriek of a spiral drill, lapsing into an alarming crackle, nearly makes him run for cover lest the shattering tool send shards in all directions; but the coolant emulsion boiling off in stale-smelling vapors seems to hide the origin of the barrage, there's not much the stoker can see amid the bewildering welter of men and machines, the work-related precautions and safeguards that strike him as superfluous, untenable, mutually exclusive, theses posted on the walls in the most unsuitable places. The crane's warning horn makes him dodge to the side, he watches as several coffee ladies, pushing an urn on a two-wheeled cart, are brushed aside like chaff before his eyes, and the persistent horn seems bent on chasing him away as well, but then, somewhere else entirely, he sees the gigantic bed of what will become a lathe being set down with a dull, grinding crunch; the workers guarding it yell commands not meant for the stoker, and the dissonant chime with which the retreating crane hook swings one last time against the hollow cast-iron form elicits their loud curses. Once the rust-colored monster is finally at rest and the workers are safe from the crane, once they're standing around it in silence, their left hands resting on its iron ribs, the stoker perceives the deadly fear that fills them in their speechlessness, in their lack of guidance before the work begins, the work that towers before them with incoherent, frantically manifold demands, that's required to make the hammer-textured green of a new machine blossom from the rugged bed; that work is still dormant, holed up unchosen and unrecognized in their left hands on whose palms the cold metal seeks to freeze the sweat of resistance; their faces are pale, their gazes turned grimly inward. The stoker beholds the workers in a minute-long state of burnout, impervious to the menacing edge returning to the eyes of the engineers, whose facial furrows, growing sterner, are visible again behind the glass of their observation posts; they've raised their heads. Meanwhile the workers' previous piece of work is boxed in a shell of pale-yellow planks in the dispatch area, where the thunder of the hammers, their stormy echo, is still heard; the workers' creation that they'd come to love and tenderly care for has become a commodity; somewhere in Morocco, Haiti, or Denmark the machine will perform some unknown, perhaps shameful task, poorly oiled, ruthlessly run into the ground, surrounded by implacable timekeepers with stopwatches, and in the end perhaps even spat on by an exasperated, badly trained, badly paid lathe operator.

The stoker could have been one of those workers, but the economy's mechanical consciousness would have crushed him; now and then he'd have intuited a mental lapse in the language of the economy, but without being able to identify it. If a visitor from Mars had asked him what the people here were doing, he'd have replied that these people, known as workers, were producing machines to manufacture machine parts for assembling machines to manufacture other machines, which in turn, under the workers' aegis, manufactured machine parts to construct machines for machine parts, finally ending up with machines for manufacturing the oil cans required to oil the machines. -- Questioned as to his own position, following a protracted elucidation of his function, he would have explained that stokers aren't described as workers; their services serve the work of the workers. The workers claim, clearly with good reason, that their work's existence generates the genuine economic utility, i.e. money, that makes the stokers' services necessary in the first place. -- The stokers object that as contributors toward decent working conditions, which include the maintenance of a certain level of warmth as documentable by energy bills, they are the ones who actually enable the celebrated results of the work of the workers. -- Then you're nothing but contributors, you admit it yourselves, retort the workers, feeling secure in their decent working conditions, and they cite a lesson from labor history that makes the stoker think anachronistic thoughts. If a strike were to transpire in the dead of winter, so the workers claim, the stokers would be exempted to keep the factory buildings in working order for the aftermath of the strike; otherwise the walkout would, as a rule, take place in summer, when temperatures are such that stokers are notable by their absence; and in that situation they'd be redundant, the first ones to get thrown out by the strikes' warring parties. -- But that means, say the stokers, that in a labor struggle, at least in winter, we might be the ones to tip the scales. -- No, the workers reply; we'd tolerate the ones who want to contribute, but on condition that they ensure, to the extent possible, the factories' continued operation in the event, you see, that we should seize control of them.

3.

The workers' implacable thoughts drive the stoker away, he takes his milk bottles back to his workplace; the fires in the boilers have sunk alarmingly low but the siren has summoned the workers to their break, and for now he sits down at the dust-covered table. Sensing that he hasn't been able to conclude his thoughts yet. -- When the break is over and the workers return, they'll feel the warmth fading, nearly dissipated; the stoker can't guess whether they'll complain to the engineers or whether the engineers themselves are monitoring the temperature in the halls; ultimately the stoker can't believe that the workers would complain about him, ultimately they ought to feel closer to the stokers than the engineers. Should the engineers happen to inspect the boiler room, they'd find the stoker working away, the second siren that ends the break having punctured the lull in the boiler room and made him jump to his feet; they'd behold the stoker sweating and irate, hurling coal into the furnaces, his face displaying outrage, as though he can't explain how the loss of heat occurred. Wordless but grim-faced, the engineers depart, visibly incredulous, declining to concede the innocence that shines upon the stoker's sweat-covered brow, perhaps already devising punishments should another such incident occur, and upstairs they tell the workers: the stoker's firing the boilers again, in just a few minutes the heat will come through. -- By then the stoker is back at his table, damp brow propped on black fist; it's true, he hasn't been able to conclude his thoughts yet, no doubt about that, it's as though he sent the missing phrases into the flames along with the coal, there's a void behind his brow, above him is the grinding weight of things thought long ago, the sense of the economy's towering edifice bearing down upon him.

And, all alone in the basement of this tower, he can't visualize the motion of the two classes above him interacting . . . or should he say, the motion of the workers and engineers interlocking . . . is this motion a battle, or is it mutual understanding. -- The engineers are his enemies, that seems indisputable, proven each time they poke their heads into his boiler room . . . if it were a battle, then, that moves those two classes, it would be manifest that only a misunderstanding, an accident of language, makes the stoker appear not to belong to the workers. -- If it's a battle, as certain things suggest, then, however monstrous the thought, the workers and the engineers must have a mutual understanding that this battle exists . . . but that it never really gets underway, for it's a battle between the engineers' speech and the workers' speechlessness. The battle lies in the reluctance with which the silence of the workers fills up with the engineers' language material; that is all there is to it. The work of the workers is a thing absolutely dominated, actually brought into existence by the language of the engineers; the abolishment of that language, the development of an autonomous language, would simultaneously abolish the status of the workers. -- But the work of the stoker is mental work, harboring in all its steps the germ of an autonomous language . . . should the speechlessness of the workers seize control of the factory, he, the stoker, could not be dealt with other than in the language of the engineers; the lacunae in his thoughts would once more go unfilled.

Mental lapses persist in the stoker's appraisal, terrible lapses; perhaps the reason lies in the existence of the factory management. That practically anonymous group whose heads he can barely name. Whose physical appearance seems unimaginable, as none of them ever descends from the glass suites at the very top of the tower, and certainly not all the way to the squalid boiler rooms. There lies the lapse in the ruminations that he can't conclude . . . of course his fires have long since subsided. The subterranean sun that supplies the tower with warmth has ceased to shine, the flow of steam has died in the upward-shooting pipes. Heads are raised on all the tower's levels, listening warily as the water drains from the radiators' ribs, windows are slammed shut when the iron starts to radiate cold, even the lighting seems to darken. The stoker sits motionless, his gaze aimed upward as though he could see through the basement ceiling, through all the tower's floors and corridors; up there above him is where guilt sits enthroned, the guilt for his exhaustion, his mental lapses, his cursed fate as a non-worker, the guilt for the dying of the sun in his furnaces. It's only fair that the coldest place right now should be up there, amid the flicker of a frosty winter sky, the chief, upward-tapering office is one he can but dimly imagine, the walls of glass, double glazed, as though with water flowing through them, the barely discernible wire filigree of the electric security system in the glass. All the offices below are visibly chilly, hands are reaching for the phones to declare war on the stoker, and he waits in his musty basement with its sheen of frost and damp, back turned to the fire whose remains have fed his wrath, angrily he sits where he is, a dusting of ash on his half-closed lids; as the last light strikes his brow he watches his shadow collapsing on the wall. His shadow moves and multiplies as though he wished to rise up in polymorphous form, but the tower's weight holds him down on the chair, the thoughts in his head resemble the darkly glowing, caving coal, sparks fly up, ah, right beneath the tower of authority, in the basement is where the insurgents forge their plans, twisting and turning words that sound menacing and symbolic as political slogans. --

The workers are in full agreement with the engineers; it's cold; though the doors of the factory have long since closed, winter is seeping into their uniforms. --

The engineers' secretary came down to the boiler room. The woman's appearance in the doorway -- she was about forty-five, stoutly feminine, even the youngest workers described her as quite good-looking; though she'd pulled on a white cardigan, her arms were crossed and she seemed to be shivering -- made the stoker start up in alarm; he had no idea how long she'd been standing there, observing his frozen crouch, the no-doubt hideous mental movements in the mirror of his face; in his surprise he rose and approached her, brow furrowed in exaggerated attentiveness, unsure how to ask what she wanted -- later his expression struck him as exaggerated, his movement toward her pointless, since she was already heading for his table -- he knew the workers called the secretary by her first name, but he'd never tried to find out if the same right applied to him; on the other hand, it would have seemed outlandish to use formal language with a woman whom everyone in the factory addressed familiarly. He stopped a step away from her, and she was an inch or two taller; to ease the tension in his face, he feigned a yawn while pressing the back of his hand to his open mouth, and she looked down at him with slightly protruding eyes, the fine creases of the lids daubed with a touch of mild green eyeshadow, an earnest look, but he felt it was marred by a glimmer of revulsion; revulsion, he felt, that might portend a sudden transformation into love; if the basement's crumbling ceiling had suddenly let a shower gush down on the stoker, instantly washing the stinking clothes from his body, the woman would have grasped the extraordinary ease with which water and fragrant soap washed the crusts of filth from his skin, that turnaround to love could have happened in the blink of an eye. -- I brought you your money, sir, the woman said, brushing past him and marching to the table. As he knew, women never set foot in the boiler room; it wasn't just that the stokers were likely seen as cranky and menacing, it was more due to the huge, bulging scabs of plaster that seemed about to crash down any moment. The secretary, known as a spirited person who could defend herself if necessary, was the only woman who strictly disregarded the taboo, yet she showed up in the basement just twice a month, on payday. The stoker, still inhibited but reassured that she'd come for mundane reasons, followed her to the table; the woman waited, bravely ignoring the dust on the table until the stoker had taken the money and signed the pay envelope; grasping the envelope by one corner, but still catching some dust from the tabletop on the painted nail of her index finger, she said as she turned to go: What a day we're having up there again, do you have any idea . . . -- Yes, I do, said the stoker, which was a complete falsehood, he didn't know, because she didn't necessarily mean the poor heating; with one simple question he could have kept the woman there with him for the time it took her to explain. She left and, as she climbed up the stairs and out of view, he asked himself, as always, whether she'd looked back at him before vanishing. -- In any event, the secretary was one of the phenomena that united the workers with the engineers. The secretary knew what kind of a day they were having, in utter contrast to him, the stoker. In the disputes that broke out afresh each payday at the long tables set up expressly for the purpose beneath the glass windows of the hall manager's office, where the workers sat smashing their fists down in the spaces between the coffee cups and the crimson-faced engineers stood -- never availing themselves of the chairs provided for the meeting -- and tried to talk above the workers' complaints with a muffled edge to their voices, it was the secretary who assumed the role of arbiter between the workers' speechless raging and the engineers' argot. Several times, when those meetings led to arguments over the inadequate heat in the factory halls and accusations were voiced against the stoker, it had been the secretary who defended him, albeit from an apparent misconception of the true situation; her case rested on what she regarded as the lack of decent working conditions in the boiler room, which silenced the accusers. Working conditions was one of the phrases that united the workers and the engineers, so the secretary met with no objections; these conditions were something for which the engineers were responsible, and simultaneously the status quo in which the workers operated, but since this factory's workers enjoyed good conditions, they were ones on which no agreement could be reached with the stokers. --

This, perhaps, was where the missing conclusion of his thoughts lay, the lapse in the sense of a gap: because the stokers' working conditions were known to be poor, probably even unacceptable, they were not referred to as workers.

Today, because the money came, I realize how money is a surrogate for language, a dull, worn coin for each gleaming word.

And my pockets are filled with money, despite my poor work under poor conditions; money compensates me for the conditions of work and silence.

In the stokers' silence about their working conditions, the workers sense a language far below the level of their speechlessness, the infinitely wretched, standpoint-free language of machines that have already been discharged from their love.

Money created the logic of these relationships, and there has been no attempt to break out from that language, to break out from the conditions of the language of that thinking, from the basement of that language, to blow the basement of that thinking sky-high. In that basement of exhausted symbols. In which those exhausted, pinned-down words writhed. In which those clichés, like revolting body segments, joined to form endless slithering pythons . . . but no, if only they were snakes, instead they're heaps of wretched, branded words, gigantic heaps of verbal stock that's bought and paid for, machine words, spare parts of words from which machine words, word machines are assembled . . . to produce yet more words, old words that distort thinking, seemingly new words that are stale metamorphoses of old words . . . the attrition proceeds inexorably, and these are all the words there are. -- All the same, the secretary, that language's secretary, had pointed the way to a fresh start over which the word dignity resounded; but no one had followed her lead. -- Climbing the stairs, the stoker poked his head out of the boiler room and saw that the tired words of the meeting, kneaded to bits, had quashed the arguments; it was quiet, and the victors, the engineers, were back behind the glass of their offices. Amid the scattered papers on the tables, pay envelopes, diagrams, plans, the workers sat hunched over their cold coffee dregs, their voices muted, reduced to an incomprehensible rasp, and scraps of symbols, briefly whirled up from their desolate, disorderly heaps, sank wearily back into place. The workers had plainly been told to go back to work, and in a moment they would, clearly lacking any choice in the matter . . . the stoker on the stairs, his head just above the hall's cement floor, felt the cold, the real cold that he himself had caused, the cold of the winter that had seeped into the factory. That was the sole subject that his language was supposed to address, the winter that loomed in the red midday light outside the factory doors, the winter that he had to cope with, because that was his work. Silenced, he went downstairs to the basement: whether I'm just a contributor or, like any other worker, a fighter of this factory, it makes no difference, pondering the question has no point, it just whirls up those old words again. The standpoint of the engineers, my superiors, is that I'm supposed to cope with the winter; that's the language that's been forced on me, and in keeping with that language I will return to the operation of work . . . like all the workers up there. With or without mental lapses: if the only option left is to operate from the standpoint of the engineers, that either means that we, the workers, are utterly without rights, without the right even to our own standpoint, one belonging to us, the workers; or, as seems sufficiently proven by the fate of our thinking, it means that the standpoint of the engineers, that is, the standpoint of the operation, is also our standpoint, the only standpoint possible for us, and that would mean that we, the workers, are nothing other than this operation . . . which we could understand, even accept, if only our brains were capable of converting this entirety, which appears as such a vivid fact before our eyes, into the standpoint of our, the workers', success, allowing us to stand as free men, upright at last, in the midst of all the work.

And to finish, an attempt to describe the end of the day, the way home. But the way home is no good for anything but the reuse of those old, worn thoughts. Anyway, it's the mirror image of the path taken in the morning, and that morning path -- assuming you already inhabit the language of those final reflections -- is the real way home. -- The way back remains an irresolute path on which you're crushed by exhaustion, a treacherous path beneath the winter sun that you don't see, but in whose light you yearn to escape from everything, from the exhaustion of logic, from the operation, from your thoughts. From your clothing and at last, like Judas, from your own skin, against which your filled pockets burn.",thebaffler.com,news,The Baffler,,0.3803921568627451,453645049,1,https://thebaffler.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/cropped-Hilbig-social.jpg,

Siemens Energy has been chosen by Energinet to deliver transformers and switchgears for high-voltage substations to expand the electricity grid in the country.

The agreement focuses on the Western part of Denmark, where approximately 50 new or reinforced 150 kV high-voltage substations are planned to be built or expanded over the next 8 years. The first four years of the agreement is estimated to be worth up to 800 million euros (DKK 6 billion) to accelerate the energy transition. The new substations will be automated and include state-of-the-art grid technologies from Siemens Energy.

With Denmark aiming to reach a target of net zero emissions by 2045 through renewable energy, the race is on to decarbonise the Danish grid. By 2030, the country must quadruple its electricity generation from wind and solar power as electricity consumption is multiplied by the switch to electrical vehicles, heat pumps, and converting solar and wind power to hydrogen and green fuels for industries. These shifts require massive investment and expanding electricity grids to ensure the future electrification of Danish society.

""There is no energy transition without transmission, and that can only happen with the availability of switchgears and transformers"" said Tim Holt, Member of the Executive Board for Siemens Energy. ""Grid investments are accelerating dramatically in Europe and worldwide, and customers are competing for manufacturing slots. This agreement enables Siemens Energy to plan its capacities, which will benefit both Danish and European energy infrastructure. We are excited to be trusted to deliver on the grid acceleration in Denmark.""

As renewable energy becomes a bigger part of the electricity mix, grids need to adjust how to transport that electricity. Unlike with conventional generation, wind and solar are often not available where they are consumed, which means the electricity needs to be transported over longer distances, usually at high voltages to minimise loss. Power transformers are a crucial link in this chain, as they enable both that long-distance transport, as well as the conversion between high-voltage for transporting and lower-voltage for consumers.

""We need external suppliers to ensure rapid and significant expansion of the electricity transmission grid"" added Henrik Riis, CEO of Energinet Electricity Transmission. ""The task is enormous. In the coming years, several high-voltage substations on the 'high-ways' of the Danish electricity grid are needed to secure that renewable electricity can be connected to the grid and transported around the country. We are incredibly pleased that with Siemens Energy we get a long-term, strategic partnership, thus ensuring that we can keep up with the dramatic development in Denmark.""

The new agreement is the continuation of a long-standing partnership between Siemens Energy and Danish Energinet, the independent public enterprise owned by the Danish Ministry of Climate, Energy and Utilities which owns, operates, and develops the transmission systems for electricity and gas in Denmark. This includes the recently inaugurated Viking Link, the world's longest interconnector between Denmark and the UK.

The five-page letter comes as Israeli forces bear down on the southern Gaza city of Rafah as part of its drive to eradicate Hamas, despite warnings this could result in mass casualties in an area where displaced civilians have found shelter.

""In exerting its right to defend itself, Israel must fully comply with international law, including international humanitarian law,"" the letter said, reiterating ""outrage"" for the Oct. 7 Hamas raid into Israel which triggered the conflict.

Israel denies blocking humanitarian aid and says it needs to eliminate Hamas for its own protection.

The Western nations said they were opposed to ""a full-scale military operation in Rafah"" and called on Israel to let humanitarian aid reach the population ""through all relevant crossing points, including the one in Rafah"".

""According to U.N. estimates, an intensified military offensive would affect approximately 1.4 million people,"" the letter said, underscoring the need ""for specific, concrete and measurable steps"" to significantly boost the flow of aid.

The letter recognises Israel made progress in addressing a number of issues, including letting more aid trucks into the Gaza Strip, the reopening of the Erez crossing into northern Gaza and the temporary use of Ashdod port in southern Israel.

But it called on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government to do more, including working towards a ""sustainable ceasefire"", facilitating further evacuations and resuming ""electricity, water and telecommunication services"".

Since Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, Israel's Gaza offensive has killed more than 35,000 Palestinians, local health officials say. Hamas-led gunmen killed some 1,200 people and abducted 253 in their attack to Israel, according to Israeli tallies.

Analysts say the plan to build ships with mobile nuclear power sources would raise tensions with its neighbors and pose risks to the environment.

Chinese media reports described the marine nuclear power platforms as small plants inside ships that would act as mobile ""power banks"" at sea for stationary facilities and other ships. Beijing had suspended the project a year ago over safety and effectiveness concerns, reported the South China Morning Post.

But the outgoing commander of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command and State Department officials this month said China is still building the floating reactors to supply power to disputed islands, the Washington Post reported.

Although U.S. officials told the Post the deployment of such reactors would take several years, Admiral John Aquilino said their development would undermine regional security and stability.

The Philippines last week echoed those concerns.

Philippines National Security Council Assistant Director General Jonathan Malaya said China would use its floating reactors to power military bases it has built on artificial islands, including those within the Philippines' exclusive economic zone. He told local media that China's nuclear plants would further militarize disputed areas of the South China Sea.

""Anything that supports their military presence in those islands is technically a threat to our national security and against our interests,"" he said, adding that Australia and the U.S. would be among Manila's allies conducting joint patrols in the South China Sea.

Beijing claims control over almost the entire South China Sea, putting it in dispute with Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam. China has already built artificial islands with airport runways to strengthen its claims.

Analysts say Beijing's floating reactors would not only strengthen its military presence in the area but also give them an excuse to extend its reach through security actions.

Song Yanhui, director of the International Law Society of the Republic of China, Taiwan, told VOA the current military security zone for China's artificial islands is a radius of 500 meters (1,640 feet), meaning other aircraft and ships that enter this radius can be legitimately expelled.

Song said that if China deploys a floating nuclear power plant in the South China Sea, it could use the excuse of protecting the environment from radioactive pollution to drive away ships from a larger area or to take defensive measures.

For Beijing, he said, ""It kills two birds with one stone. It is a win-win strategy. It can strengthen its military presence, civilian use and claim to sovereignty.""

But the potential for radiation leaks is a real concern, say analysts.

Pankaj Jha, dean of research at the School of International Affairs of India's Jindal Global University, told VOA China's lack of experience in operating such floating reactors could spell disaster.

""It is a threat because it will contaminate water and also surrounding areas,"" he said. ""Any radiation leak would make the island uninhabitable and might also impact fishermen from the South China Sea.""

Analysts note in the event of conflict with China, the floating reactors could also become military targets.

China has deployed radars, anti-ship and anti-aircraft missiles, and fighter jets, among other weapons, on the disputed territories of Mischief Reef, Subi Reef and Fiery Cross, the three largest artificial islands in the Spratly Islands.

Richard Fisher, senior fellow with the International Assessment and Strategy Center, told VOA floating nuclear power plants could also one day extend China's weapons capabilities.

""If they were protected, these nuclear power plants could also potentially power future energy weapon devices,"" Fisher said. ""Laser weapons that could knock down missiles and aircraft or very powerful microwave weapons could also disable missiles and aircraft that would get within their range.""

Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, would not comment on the concerns expressed about China's plans to move forward with the floating nuclear power plants.

""I am not aware of the particular case you have shared with us, thus could only reply in principle,"" he told VOA in an emailed response May 14. ""China's position on the South China Sea issue is clear and consistent. We will stay committed to properly handling disputes through dialogue and consultation with countries concerned, and would like to work with ASEAN [Association of Southeast Asian Nation] countries to fully and effectively implement the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea, advance the consultation on a code of conduct in the South China Sea and jointly safeguard peace and stability in the region.""

China is not the first country to look at building floating nuclear reactors.

The United States took the lead in proposing the concept as early as 1970 but due to safety concerns did not quickly pursue development.

Russia is the only country that has brought a floating nuclear power plant to fruition, with the Akademik Lomonosov plant producing electricity and heating since 2020 from a harbor in Pevek, a town in the Arctic Circle.

The International Atomic Energy Agency at a November forum in Vienna expressed concern about the development of floating nuclear reactors, particularly when they cross international borders or operate in international waters.

""The IAEA is working with our member states to determine what further guidance and standards might be needed to ensure the safety of floating nuclear power plants,"" IAEA Deputy Director General Lydie Evrard said in a press release.

According to analysts, the plan to build ships with mobile nuclear power sources would raise tensions with its neighbours and pose risks to the environment.

Chinese media reports described the marine nuclear power platforms as small plants inside ships that would act as mobile ""power banks"" at sea for stationary facilities and other ships, VOA reported.

However, Beijing had suspended the project a year ago over safety and effectiveness concerns, according to the South China Morning Post.

But this month, the outgoing commander of the US Indo-Pacific Command and State Department Admiral John Aquilino said that China is still building the floating reactors to supply power to disputed islands, the Washington Post reported.

Although the US officials said that the deployment of such reactors would take several years, Admiral John Aquilino said their development would undermine regional security and stability, VOA reported.

Following this, last week, the Philippines echoed those concerns.

Philippines National Security Council Assistant Director General Jonathan Malaya said that China would use its floating reactors to power military bases it has built on artificial islands, including those within the Philippines' exclusive economic zone.

He added that China's nuclear plants would further militarize disputed areas of the South China Sea.

""Anything that supports their military presence in those islands is technically a threat to our national security and against our interests,"" he said, adding that Australia and the US would be among Manila's allies conducting joint patrols in the South China Sea, as reported by VOA.

According to Beijing's claims, they have control over almost the entire South China Sea, putting it in dispute with Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam.

Moreover, China has already built artificial islands with airport runways to strengthen its claims.

The analysts said that Beijing's floating reactors would not only strengthen its military presence in the area but also give it an excuse to extend its reach through security actions, VOA reported.

Song Yanhui, director of the International Law Society of the Republic of China, Taiwan, said that the current military security zone for China's artificial islands is a radius of 500 meters (1,640 feet), which means, other aircraft and ships that enter this radius can be legitimately expelled.

Song continued that if China deploys a floating nuclear power plant in the South China Sea, it could use the excuse of protecting the environment from radioactive pollution to drive away ships from a larger area or to take defensive measures.

For Beijing, he said, ""It kills two birds with one stone. It is a win-win strategy. It can strengthen its military presence, civilian use and claim to sovereignty.""But the potential for radiation leaks is a real concern, analysts said, reported VOA.

Pankaj Jha, dean of research at the School of International Affairs of India's Jindal Global University, highlighted that China's lack of experience in operating such floating reactors could spell disaster.

""It is a threat because it will contaminate water and also surrounding areas,"" he said. ""Any radiation leak would make the island uninhabitable and might also impact fishermen from the South China Sea.""In the event of a conflict with China, the analysts further noted that the floating reactors could also become military targets, reported VOA.

China has deployed radars, anti-ship and anti-aircraft missiles, and fighter jets, among other weapons, on the disputed territories of Mischief Reef, Subi Reef and Fiery Cross, the three largest artificial islands in the Spratly Islands.

Richard Fisher, senior fellow with the International Assessment and Strategy Center, stressed that floating nuclear power plants could also one day extend China's weapons capabilities.

""If they were protected, these nuclear power plants could also potentially power future energy weapon devices,"" Fisher said. ""Laser weapons that could knock down missiles and aircraft or very powerful microwave weapons could also disable missiles and aircraft that would get within their range.""Notably, China is not the first country to think of building floating nuclear reactors.

Under the agreement, Siemens Energy will deliver transformers and switchgears for around 50 new or upgraded 150kV high-voltage substations over the next eight years.

The initial four-year phase of the project is valued at up to €800m and is integral to Denmark's energy transition strategy.

Siemens Energy executive board member Tim Holt said: ""There is no energy transition without transmission, and that can only happen with the availability of switchgears and transformers. Grid investments are accelerating dramatically in Europe and worldwide, and customers are competing for manufacturing slots.

""This agreement enables Siemens Energy to plan its capacities, which will benefit both Danish and European energy infrastructure. We are excited to be trusted to deliver on the grid acceleration in Denmark.""

Denmark is on a path to achieve net-zero emissions by 2045, with a significant increase in renewable energy production from wind and solar power anticipated by 2030.

To support this shift, substantial investments are being made to expand and decarbonise the electricity grid, ensuring it can handle the future electrification needs of Danish society.

Energinet Electricity Transmission CEO Henrik Riis said: ""We need external suppliers to ensure rapid and significant expansion of the electricity transmission grid.

""The task is enormous. In the coming years, several high-voltage substations on the 'high-ways' of the Danish electricity grid are needed to secure that renewable electricity can be connected to the grid and transported around the country.

""We are incredibly pleased that with Siemens Energy we get a long-term, strategic partnership, thus ensuring that we can keep up with the dramatic development in Denmark.""

The integration of renewable energy sources into the electricity mix necessitates a reconfiguration of the grid system.

Wind and solar power generation often occurs far from consumption points, requiring efficient, high-voltage transportation to minimise energy loss.

Siemens Energy's power transformers are expected to play a vital role in facilitating such long-distance electricity transmission and in converting voltages for end-user consumption.

In February this year, Siemens Energy announced plans to produce transformers in the US from 2025 to keep up with rising electricity demand.

The company will invest $150m to expand its power manufacturing facility in Charlotte, North Carolina, and will develop its first transformer production facility there.

According to analysts, the plan to build ships with mobile nuclear power sources would raise tensions with its neighbours and pose risks to the environment.

Chinese media reports described the marine nuclear power platforms as small plants inside ships that would act as mobile ""power banks"" at sea for stationary facilities and other ships, VOA reported.

However, Beijing had suspended the project a year ago over safety and effectiveness concerns, according to the South China Morning Post.

But this month, the outgoing commander of the US Indo-Pacific Command and State Department Admiral John Aquilino said that China is still building the floating reactors to supply power to disputed islands, the Washington Post reported.

Although the US officials said that the deployment of such reactors would take several years, Admiral John Aquilino said their development would undermine regional security and stability, VOA reported.

Following this, last week, the Philippines echoed those concerns.

Philippines National Security Council Assistant Director General Jonathan Malaya said that China would use its floating reactors to power military bases it has built on artificial islands, including those within the Philippines' exclusive economic zone.

He added that China's nuclear plants would further militarize disputed areas of the South China Sea.

""Anything that supports their military presence in those islands is technically a threat to our national security and against our interests,"" he said, adding that Australia and the US would be among Manila's allies conducting joint patrols in the South China Sea, as reported by VOA.

According to Beijing's claims, they have control over almost the entire South China Sea, putting it in dispute with Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam.

Moreover, China has already built artificial islands with airport runways to strengthen its claims.

The analysts said that Beijing's floating reactors would not only strengthen its military presence in the area but also give it an excuse to extend its reach through security actions, VOA reported.

Song Yanhui, director of the International Law Society of the Republic of China, Taiwan, said that the current military security zone for China's artificial islands is a radius of 500 meters (1,640 feet), which means, other aircraft and ships that enter this radius can be legitimately expelled.

Song continued that if China deploys a floating nuclear power plant in the South China Sea, it could use the excuse of protecting the environment from radioactive pollution to drive away ships from a larger area or to take defensive measures.

For Beijing, he said, ""It kills two birds with one stone. It is a win-win strategy. It can strengthen its military presence, civilian use and claim to sovereignty.""But the potential for radiation leaks is a real concern, analysts said, reported VOA.

Pankaj Jha, dean of research at the School of International Affairs of India's Jindal Global University, highlighted that China's lack of experience in operating such floating reactors could spell disaster.

""It is a threat because it will contaminate water and also surrounding areas,"" he said. ""Any radiation leak would make the island uninhabitable and might also impact fishermen from the South China Sea.""In the event of a conflict with China, the analysts further noted that the floating reactors could also become military targets, reported VOA.

China has deployed radars, anti-ship and anti-aircraft missiles, and fighter jets, among other weapons, on the disputed territories of Mischief Reef, Subi Reef and Fiery Cross, the three largest artificial islands in the Spratly Islands.

Richard Fisher, senior fellow with the International Assessment and Strategy Center, stressed that floating nuclear power plants could also one day extend China's weapons capabilities.

""If they were protected, these nuclear power plants could also potentially power future energy weapon devices,"" Fisher said. ""Laser weapons that could knock down missiles and aircraft or very powerful microwave weapons could also disable missiles and aircraft that would get within their range.""Notably, China is not the first country to think of building floating nuclear reactors.

The US took the lead in proposing the concept in 1970 but due to safety concerns, they did not quickly pursue development, reported VOA.

Meanwhile, Russia is the only country that has brought a floating nuclear power plant to fruition, with the Akademik Lomonosov plant producing electricity and heating since 2020 from a harbour in Pevek, a town in the Arctic Circle.

Earlier in November last year, the International Atomic Energy Agency at a forum in Vienna expressed concern about the development of floating nuclear reactors, particularly when they cross international borders or operate in international waters.

Jesper Boie Rasmussen, CEO of the company Nerve Smart Systems, has set out to make that dream come true.

""I'm absolutely convinced that we will accelerate the green transition. We've developed a technology that enables us to set up high-power chargers in many more places in Denmark without overloading the electricity grid. In fact, they are able to help the electricity grid when it's under pressure,"" he says.

The high-power charger solution, which is a combination of a high-power charger and a battery, provide charging of electric vehicles in record time without straining the electricity grid. Depending on the capacity of the car, the charging time typically corresponds to a coffee break. Meanwhile, the price is kept down through, for example, high-power charging with stored electricity from the battery when the electricity grid prices are high. Finally, the battery can act as a buffer for the existing electricity grid when the demand for renewable energy is higher than the production.

""The pressure on the electricity grid is growing because more and more of the conventional power plants are being replaced by wind turbines and solar cells. Wind and solar energy depends on the wind blowing and the sun shining, so when production drops, it is difficult to match the demand for electricity. The battery is brilliant at filling that gap,"" explains Jesper Boie Rasmussen.

He believes that supplementing with batteries can constitute an alternative to an otherwise costly upgrade of the existing electricity grid. While the charging station operator can make money by supplying renewable energy to the electricity grid from the batteries, society can save some of the DKK 110 billion that an upgrade of the electricity grid will cost, according to the latest analysis from Ramboll.

DTU tests have led to approval

The high-power charger from Nerve Smart Systems has not yet been rolled out on a large scale, but it has been fully developed, thoroughly tested, and supplied to the first customers in Denmark, including the energy company OK. Looking back, Jesper Boie Rasmussen would not have succeeded without help.

""I will be the first to admit that it has been a long journey. But we're now in a place where the product is good, and this is not least thanks to a number of joint projects we've had with DTU,"" he says.

For example, DTU has contributed with thorough testing of the solution in the University's experimental energy laboratory PowerLabDK. Here, the high-power charger battery has been connected to a model of the energy system, and, by testing the response of the battery to various electricity grid conditions, such as fluctuations in voltages and frequency, DTU's researchers have been able to identify faults and deficiencies.

""We've used our equipment and knowledge to perform all the tests necessary to obtain an approval to connect to the electricity grid and supply energy. In the end, Energinet, which owns the electricity grid in Denmark, was able to rubberstamp the solution and say yes, now you have the right to operate the battery system,"" says Mattia Marinelli, Head of Section and Associate Professor at DTU Wind.

According to analysts, the plan to build ships with mobile nuclear power sources would raise tensions with its neighbours and pose risks to the environment.

Chinese media reports described the marine nuclear power platforms as small plants inside ships that would act as mobile ""power banks"" at sea for stationary facilities and other ships, VOA reported.

However, Beijing had suspended the project a year ago over safety and effectiveness concerns, according to the South China Morning Post.

But this month, the outgoing commander of the US Indo-Pacific Command and State Department Admiral John Aquilino said that China is still building the floating reactors to supply power to disputed islands, the Washington Post reported.

Although the US officials said that the deployment of such reactors would take several years, Admiral John Aquilino said their development would undermine regional security and stability, VOA reported.

Following this, last week, the Philippines echoed those concerns.

Philippines National Security Council Assistant Director General Jonathan Malaya said that China would use its floating reactors to power military bases it has built on artificial islands, including those within the Philippines' exclusive economic zone.

He added that China's nuclear plants would further militarize disputed areas of the South China Sea.

""Anything that supports their military presence in those islands is technically a threat to our national security and against our interests,"" he said, adding that Australia and the US would be among Manila's allies conducting joint patrols in the South China Sea, as reported by VOA.

According to Beijing's claims, they have control over almost the entire South China Sea, putting it in dispute with Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam.

Moreover, China has already built artificial islands with airport runways to strengthen its claims.

The analysts said that Beijing's floating reactors would not only strengthen its military presence in the area but also give it an excuse to extend its reach through security actions, VOA reported.

Song Yanhui, director of the International Law Society of the Republic of China, Taiwan, said that the current military security zone for China's artificial islands is a radius of 500 meters (1,640 feet), which means, other aircraft and ships that enter this radius can be legitimately expelled.

Song continued that if China deploys a floating nuclear power plant in the South China Sea, it could use the excuse of protecting the environment from radioactive pollution to drive away ships from a larger area or to take defensive measures.

For Beijing, he said, ""It kills two birds with one stone. It is a win-win strategy. It can strengthen its military presence, civilian use and claim to sovereignty.""

But the potential for radiation leaks is a real concern, analysts said, reported VOA.

Pankaj Jha, dean of research at the School of International Affairs of India's Jindal Global University, highlighted that China's lack of experience in operating such floating reactors could spell disaster.

""It is a threat because it will contaminate water and also surrounding areas,"" he said. ""Any radiation leak would make the island uninhabitable and might also impact fishermen from the South China Sea.""

In the event of a conflict with China, the analysts further noted that the floating reactors could also become military targets, reported VOA.

China has deployed radars, anti-ship and anti-aircraft missiles, and fighter jets, among other weapons, on the disputed territories of Mischief Reef, Subi Reef and Fiery Cross, the three largest artificial islands in the Spratly Islands.

Richard Fisher, senior fellow with the International Assessment and Strategy Center, stressed that floating nuclear power plants could also one day extend China's weapons capabilities.

""If they were protected, these nuclear power plants could also potentially power future energy weapon devices,"" Fisher said. ""Laser weapons that could knock down missiles and aircraft or very powerful microwave weapons could also disable missiles and aircraft that would get within their range.""

Notably, China is not the first country to think of building floating nuclear reactors.

The US took the lead in proposing the concept in 1970 but due to safety concerns, they did not quickly pursue development, reported VOA.

Meanwhile, Russia is the only country that has brought a floating nuclear power plant to fruition, with the Akademik Lomonosov plant producing electricity and heating since 2020 from a harbour in Pevek, a town in the Arctic Circle.

Earlier in November last year, the International Atomic Energy Agency at a forum in Vienna expressed concern about the development of floating nuclear reactors, particularly when they cross international borders or operate in international waters.

""The IAEA is working with our member states to determine what further guidance and standards might be needed to ensure the safety of floating nuclear power plants,"" IAEA Deputy Director General Lydie Evrard said in a press release.

Minister Ryan said a multilateral approach ""is the only way to address Europe's collective climate responsibilities,"" and made the point that the most effective way to take advantage of Ireland's offshore wind potential is to put in place infrastructure that allows it to access other markets.

Minister Ryan continued, ""Increased electricity interconnection is key as we continue to grow our use of renewable energy. One of the best characteristics of renewable energy is that it is, firstly, home grown and accessible to every country. A second key characteristic is that it works best if it can be shared. When we have excess offshore wind capacity in Ireland, for example, it makes sense that we utilise and store what we need but we can also share our surplus supply with our neighbours through international co-operation and interconnection. It reduces costs, through sharing surplus energy, through sharing reserves and by ensuring the most competitive power sources are used first.""

Minister van der Straeten said, ""One year after the North Sea Summit in Ostend, the new co-operation we are exploring today is another step forward in achieving the goal set by the nine participating countries who met and pledged to make the North Seas - including the Atlantic North Seas - as the wind powerhouse for Europe. Our future energy security is renewable but above all, our future energy security is shared renewable.

""Princess Elisabeth Island will unlock Belgium's second offshore wind zone. It will also serve as a landing point for future hybrid interconnectors. With this partnership, Ireland, the UK and Belgium are realising the ambitions set out at the North Sea Summit in Ostend a year ago: to make the North Sea the largest sustainable power plant in Europe.

""The key now is to implement the actions to follow through on those ambitions and power our green future. Thanks to this Joint Statement, we can explore a promising opportunity for interconnection between our three countries. This is a valuable addition to the interconnections Belgium is already exploring, such as with the UK, Norway and Denmark, after which we will be able to select the best options for our country.""

UK Minister for Nuclear and Renewables Andrew Bowie said, ""The North Sea has the potential to be a renewable energy powerhouse. We will always look to collaborate with our neighbours to explore how we can make the most of it. Not only do we share seas with our Belgian and Irish allies, but we share a common interest in cutting emissions and powering our homes with cheaper, cleaner and more secure energy.""

Responding to the signing of the agreement, WindEurope chief executive Giles Dickson said it was ""An excellent example of the sort of innovative cross-border hashtag collaboration Europe needs to deliver the energy transition.

Curbs on new data centres are pushing big projects away from Ireland to other European countries, according to an industry group which is seeking Government intervention to tackle constraints on the State's power and gas systems.

Three years after national grid manager EirGrid curbed electricity access in Dublin and two years after gas connections were stopped, the data centre operators say significant policy issues ""risk unravelling the strength behind the Ireland Inc brand"" in the global arena.

The restrictions followed concerns about the risk of electricity blackouts after surging data centre demand for power added the equivalent of 140,000 households to the grid in each of the four years to 2021. Minister for Enterprise Peter Burke was advised on his appointment last month of a need to ""ration"" electricity connections for data centres because Irish renewable energy availability will be ""insufficient"" to meet the sector's demands up to 2030.

Digital Infrastructure Ireland (DII) said this ""continued uncertainty is already driving investment to other European markets, particularly those with clear, enabling and incentivising policy environments"".

Tech giants such as Microsoft and Google, which use Ireland as their EU hub, have this year announced a series of investments in other European countries. Research by consultants Bitpower, an adviser to DII, shows Microsoft investing more than €7 billion in new data centre and artificial intelligence projects in Germany, Spain and the UK. New Google projects in Belgium and Norway are worth some €1.2 billion, while Digital Realty, a DII member, has signalled new investments in France and Denmark.

The need to meet climate targets is at the forefront of Irish energy policy, but data centre promoters argue other EU member states have facilitated the sector while facing similar challenges.

DII has called on Minister for Communications Eamon Ryan to establish a working group to allow the Government, regulators, utilities, State agencies and the data centre industry to confront barriers facing the sector. The group includes operators such as CyrusOne, EdgeConneX, EngineNode and Equinix. DII says its 10 members have collectively spent more than €10 billion in Ireland and could invest another €3 billion around Dublin ""if the policy climate permits"".

[ Renewable energy 'insufficient' to meet data centre demands with need to 'ration' connections to them, Minister told ]

Data centre operators are increasingly unhappy with the lack of progress on power generation and the absence of clarity on connection agreement policy for large energy users.

""Without swift and direct action on this uncertainty, Ireland's position as a welcoming hub for foreign direct investment and a global technology leader is at risk, just as investment in AI is scaling around the world,"" said DII chairman Peter Lantry. ""If the uncertainty continues, particularly in the Dublin metro area, it will reshape Ireland's standing as a choice destination for prominent global projects.""",irishtimes.com,news,The Irish Times,,0.02745098039215677,453618720,10,https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/gdIA7c66Ky1sXKY7q9gK09EIu34=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/irishtimes/TNDDKF7ZXBCXBDRIWCBOHNSKH4.jpg,

Comparable EBIT is expected to be EUR 110-130 million.

TOKMANNI GROUP'S PRESIDENT AND CEO MIKA RAUTIAINEN

Strong growth due to Dollarstore, fixed costs had a negative impact on earnings

In the first quarter of 2024, Tokmanni Group's revenue grew by 42.4% to EUR 339.2 million. This significant growth is due to the acquisition that took place in August last year. Like-for-like revenue increased by 1.7% (2.7%). Growth in sales of grocery products of 4.7% boosted like-for-like sales. Customers' purchasing power and confidence in their own finances remained low, and our customers were increasingly attracted by low prices and interesting promotions.

The Tokmanni and Dollarstore integration is progressing according to plan. The main focus is on the consolidation of purchases at Group level. Our target is to achieve annual synergies of more than EUR 15 million by the end of 2025. The synergies achieved by the end of March are already 6.7 million euros on an annual basis.

Tokmanni segment's revenue grew by 4.2% to EUR 248.1 in the first quarter. Like-for-like revenue grew by 1.7%. Comparable customer visits increased slightly on the previous year, while the comparable average basket size increased by 1.2%. The good sales development was driven by the timing of Easter, which was at the end of March this year, whereas in the comparison period it was in early April. Comparable gross margin was 32.8% (31.7%). Comparable EBIT was EUR -1.7 million (-1.9).

Dollarstore segment's revenue was EUR 91.1 million in the first quarter. Like-for-like revenue increased by 1.8% in local currencies. Comparable customer visits decreased slightly from the previous year, while the comparable average basket size increased by 3.4%. Comparable gross margin was 37.4%. Comparable EBIT was EUR -2.8 million.

The first quarter is the weakest quarter of the year in terms of sales and profitability for both Tokmanni and Dollarstore. However, both segments performed reasonably well in the current market environment.

The start of the second quarter has been affected by events in the Red Sea and political strikes, among other things. At Tokmanni, this was reflected as clear shortages in shelf availability and additional costs. The spring season, which is Tokmanni's second most important sales period, only started properly at the beginning of May in southern Finland.

Key figures (Dollarstore included in from 1 August 2023 onwards)

* Rolling 12 months comparable EBITDA

Dollarstore financials have been included in Tokmanni Group financials starting from 1 August 2023. Dollarstore consists of the Dollarstore and Big Dollar stores. Tokmanni consists of the Tokmanni, Miny, Click Shoes and Shoe House stores, as well as the Tokmanni and Click Shoes online stores. Based on refined preliminary calculations the impact of Dollarstore purchase price allocation on Tokmanni Group figures is the following: The preliminary fair valuation of Dollarstore immaterial rights and owned assets will add EUR 47.0 million to the balance sheet, which will be depreciated and amortised in accordance with Tokmanni Group's accounting principles over periods varying from 15 to 20 years. The annual impact of these amortisations and depreciations is around EUR 2,5 million per year on Tokmanni Group's EBIT. The impact of inventory fair valuation will be reported in items affecting comparability and will not impact comparable EBIT but will impact EBIT and earnings per share. The fair valuation is EUR 3.2 million and it was recorded as an expense over six months starting from August 2023.

Tokmanni Group reports EBITDA and EBIT as its key performance indicators and makes adjustments to improve comparability and provide a better view of Tokmanni Group's operational performance. EBITDA is not a key indicator according to IFRS accounting standards and it represents operating profit before depreciation and amortisation. Comparable EBITDA and EBIT represent the same indicators excluding items that Tokmanni Group's management considers to be exceptional and non-recurring. The items include changes in the fair value of electricity and currency derivatives, which are adjusted by Tokmanni Group as they are unrealised gains or losses related to Tokmanni Group's open cash flow hedge positions, and hence not related to Tokmanni Group's operational performance during the review periods. In addition, other non-recurring costs related to acquired businesses and companies are included in the items affecting comparability.

Tokmanni Group's management uses the comparable EBITDA margin and comparable EBIT margin as key performance indicators when evaluating Tokmanni Group's and its segments' underlying operational performance.

Adjustments affecting comparability

According to the statistics of the Finnish Grocery Trade Association FGTA (www.pty.fi), the total sales of department store and hypermarket chains increased by 4.5% in the first quarter of 2024. Grocery sales increased, while non-grocery sales decreased. It is important to note that the statistics compiled by the FGTA only cover part of the market relevant for Tokmanni segment.

According to the statistics of the Swedish Food Retailers' Federation (https://www.svenskdagligvaruhandel.se/), the Food Retail Index increased by 6.4% in the first quarter of 2024. Sales of brick-and-mortar stores increased by 6.5% and online sales by 4.8%. The Food Retail Index measures sales growth in the grocery trade and does not include specialised food stores or service trade. It is important to note that the statistics compiled by the Swedish Food Retailers Federation only cover part of the market relevant for Dollarstore segment.

At the end of March 2024, Tokmanni Group had a total of 372 stores (31 December 2023: 372). In Finland Tokmanni Group had 201 Tokmanni, 28 Click Shoes, 2 Shoe House and 6 Miny stores. In Sweden Tokmanni Group had 131 Dollarstore stores and in Denmark 4 Big Dollar stores.

More information about Tokmanni Group's store network is available on the Group's website at https://ir.tokmanni.fi/en.

Reporting structure

Tokmanni Group consists of Tokmanni and Dollarstore segments as well as Group functions and eliminations. Tokmanni segment consists of the Tokmanni stores, Miny stores, Click Shoes stores and Shoe House stores, as well as the Tokmanni and Click Shoes online stores. Click Shoes' and Shoe House's financials have been included in Tokmanni Group financials starting from 1 March 2023. Dollarstore segment consists of the Dollarstore and Big Dollar stores. Dollarstore financials have been included in Tokmanni Group financials starting from 1 August 2023. Due to Dollarstore's unusual accounting period and lack of IFRS financial statement reporting, Tokmanni Group does not publish figures for Dollarstore's comparison period, with the exception of revenue growth and certain operational figures.

Seasonality

Tokmanni Group's business is subject to seasonality, which has a significant effect on its revenue, profitability, and cash flow. In general, Tokmanni Group's revenue, profitability and cash flow are lowest in the first quarter and highest in the fourth quarter due to Christmas sales.

Revenue

* Dollarstore financials have been included in Tokmanni Group financials starting from 1 August 2023.

January-March 2024

In the first quarter Tokmanni Group's revenue grew by 42.4% (4.7%) to EUR 339.2 million (238.2).

Profitability

* Dollarstore financials have been included in Tokmanni Group financials starting from 1 August 2023.

January-March 2024

In the first quarter of 2024, Tokmanni Group's gross profit amounted to EUR 115.4 million (76.0), and the gross margin was 34.0% (31.9%). Comparable gross profit was EUR 115.4 million (75.5), corresponding to a comparable gross margin of 34.0% (31.7%). The Group's gross profit in the first quarter was boosted above all by Dollarstore's gross profit, but Tokmanni segment's improved gross profit also supported the overall growth.

Tokmanni Group's operating expenses in the first quarter were EUR 89.4 million (59.4), or 26.4% (24.9%) of revenue. The increase in operating expenses resulted mainly from the integration of Dollarstore's operating expenses into Tokmanni Group's consolidated figures. Expenses were also increased by higher property costs and personnel expenses. Personnel expenses represented EUR 53.1 million (33.5), or 15.7% of revenue (14.1%). Comparable operating expenses were EUR 89.4 million (59.2), or 26.4% of revenue (24.9%).

The Group's EBITDA in the first quarter totalled EUR 26.9 million (17.4), corresponding to an EBITDA margin of 7.9% (7.3%). Comparable EBITDA totalled EUR 26.8 million (17.2), and the comparable EBITDA margin was 7.9% (7.2%).

Tokmanni Group's depreciation amounted to EUR 31.9 million (19.5). The growth mainly reflected the impact of IFRS 16 due to the growth of the store network. Depreciation excluding preliminary depreciation of tangible and intangible assets (PPA) arising from the acquisitions amounted to EUR 31.1 million. EUR 0.7 million was recognised for preliminary depreciation of tangible and intangible assets (PPA) arising in the acquisitions.

The Group's EBIT in the first quarter totalled EUR -5.0 million (-2.0), corresponding to an EBIT margin of -1.5% (-0.8%). Comparable EBIT was EUR -5.1 million (-2.2), and the comparable EBIT margin was -1.5% (-0.9%). The increase in operating expenses reduced the EBIT.

Tokmanni Group's net financial items totalled EUR -9.1 million (3.3). The result before taxes was EUR -14.1 million (-5.3). Taxes for the period amounted to EUR 2.1 million (1.0). The net result was EUR -12.1 million (-4.3). The main reasons for the weaker result compared with the previous year were the increase in operating expenses, the increase in depreciation and higher finance costs.

Consolidated cash flow from operating activities amounted to EUR -40.0 million (-12.9) in the first quarter of 2024. The development in the cash flow from operating activities was affected especially by the change in the value of inventories year-on-year. The company had a total of EUR 211.0 million (139.6) in credit facilities, consisting of loan agreements with financial institutions and a commercial paper programme. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to EUR 18.8 million (4.2), and the Group's financial position is solid.

The remainder of the liabilities mainly consist of lease agreement liabilities reported under IFRS 16. The Group's net debt without lease liabilities was EUR 235.3 million (147.1). The figure increased mainly due to acquisitions and investments in store sites.

Tokmanni Group's ratio of net debt to comparable EBITDA excluding the impact of IFRS 16 was 2.3 at the end of March 2024 (1.6). Tokmanni Group's target is to maintain an efficient capital structure. The long-term goal is to keep the ratio of net debt to comparable EBITDA, excluding the impact of IFRS 16, below 2.25 at year-end.

Consequently, the sum of individual figures can deviate from the presented sum figure. The figures in the financial statement release are presented in millions of euros.

Seasonality

Tokmanni Group's business is subject to seasonality, which has a significant effect on its revenue, profitability, and cash flow. In general, Tokmanni Group's revenue, profitability and cash flow are lowest in the first quarter and highest in the fourth quarter due to Christmas sales.

The preparation of the Business Review in accordance with IFRS requires the management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amount assets and liabilities on the balance sheet, the reporting of contingent assets and liabilities, and the amounts income and expenses. Although the estimates are based on the management's best knowledge of current events and actions, the actual results may differ from the estimates.",news.cision.com,news,News Powered by Cision,,0.2392156862745098,453618473,7,,eng-9567158

What action is the UK undertaking to reach these targets? What lessons could Vietnam learn from the UK?

The UK was the first country to bring in a legally binding emissions reduction target with the UK Climate Change Act back in 2008. The act not only created targets, but also put in place a framework to ensure the UK government acts on those targets from now until 2050. This law covers both reducing greenhouse gases and adapting to climate change impacts. This legislation provides an important reference point for governments of all countries, including Vietnam - long-term thinking and action is needed for a challenge as big as climate change.

The UK's action on climate change includes significantly investing in renewables like wind and solar. Last year, those power sources contributed over 36 per cent of generation to our electricity grid. Thanks to this, we are due to fully phase out coal in the power sector later this year - this is remarkable given the history of the UK, the birthplace of the coal-powered Industrial Revolution.

Another important lesson from the UK experience is involving the private sector. The Climate Change Act and our net-zero target send a strong signal to businesses that they will need to innovate and reduce their emissions over the coming decades. We directly incentivise industries to reduce their emissions by putting a price on carbon via our Emissions Trading System. The UK is also a centre for green finance, which is helping to mobilise private finance towards sustainable projects through innovations like green bonds.

The UK is proud to co-lead Vietnam's Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP) with the EU, alongside our partners Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Norway, the United States, and 11 international Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero banks.

The aim is for the JETP to mobilise $15.5 billion to support Vietnam's energy transition. We hope that by also supporting policy reform and the enabling environment, it will unlock even more green finance, enabling Vietnam to achieve its ambitious net-zero goals.

The JETP is now in an exciting phase. Its Resource Mobilisation Plan was released in December, and the UK is supporting the JETP Secretariat to implement the plan through our UK Partnering for Accelerated Climate Transitions (UK PACT) programme. Our priority now is to identify the first projects to get JETP funding, which could be things like improving the energy grid in a province or building solar farms.

The UK PACT programme is also working on green finance with the Ministry of Planning and Investment and the State Securities Commission. We are supporting the development of a new environmental, social and governance framework so that businesses can understand and report their climate-related financial risk more effectively. We will be expanding UK PACT in Vietnam over the next few years, with further work in the energy, agriculture, and green finance sectors.

Another interesting UK programme is the Climate Finance Accelerator. This initiative helps low-carbon businesses attract investment through training from green finance experts. So far, we have worked with 20 businesses in Vietnam, and we hope the lessons learned will enable more Vietnamese businesses to roll out their innovative ideas and secure private investment.

The climate risks in the Lower Mekong Delta are huge - the World Bank estimates that if we do nothing, 40 per cent of it could disappear underwater by 2050. This would obviously have devastating social, economic, and environmental impacts for Vietnam. To take meaningful action we need international partners, the national government, provinces, communities, and farmers to work together. Coordination between everyone can be challenging, but it is essential.

The World Bank's Mekong Delta Working Group involves various government and international partners, and this has the potential to be a crucial tool in tackling the coordination challenge in the Lower Mekong region. Nevertheless, more needs to be done to pool resources, share knowledge, distribute and align work, and track progress against our goals. The UK would be a very supportive member of further coordination efforts for this region.

The countries of Southeast Asia share common challenges in terms of climate adaptation, as the temperature goes up they all face extreme heat, rainfall, and sea-level rise. As fast-growing economies, meeting their emissions reductions commitments will also be challenging. However, the changes needed to build a resilient and low-carbon future have huge benefits for health, nature, and businesses. The climate transition also offers opportunities for the countries of Southeast Asia.

Tackling this challenge - and realising this opportunity - will require significant action in every sector, so it is hard to prioritise. However, energy is a big emitter in the region, so transitioning to low-carbon sources is extremely important. Infrastructure and buildings will be key to this, with green investments now paying off over the decades ahead.

Low-carbon public transport also comes to mind, as it can have a triple benefit by improving people's health, lifestyles (with less time spent commuting), and reducing emissions. And we should not forget the land that underpins all economies - promoting sustainable agriculture and forestry practices can reduce emissions while also providing natural solutions to the impacts of climate change like flooding, landslides, and droughts.

To help with the challenge in the region, the UK is working closely with ASEAN, having signed the ASEAN-UK Plan of Action in 2022. The £110 million ASEAN Catalytic Green Finance Facility supports the development of sustainable and resilient infrastructure, such as renewable energy, clean transportation, or urban infrastructure.

We are now developing plans for a new multi-year climate programme, which will build on previous UK support around issues such as green finance and energy demand to support a green transition in ASEAN, including Vietnam.",vir.com.vn,news,Vietnam Investment Review - VIR,Vietnam Investment Review,0.2392156862745098,453604297,1,https://vir.com.vn/stores/news_dataimages/2024/052024/14/17/in_social/iain-frew-british-ambassador-to-vietnam-20240514175933.jpg?randTime=1715908263,

On the latest episode of the long-running BBC cooking series, the five remaining amateur chefs were challenged to undertake live fire cooking.

Taken deep into the ancient forests near Amersham for a challenge 'like no other', they arrived at Nomadic, a wilderness dining experience based in Chalfont St Giles.

Cooking under the guidance of Swedish chef Niklas Ekstedt, they were asked to present dishes without electricity and instead simply use an open flame.

But when it came time for each to explain the dishes they were preparing, those watching at home were shocked by what Chris, 44, shared.

As the camera cut to him carving up a slab of meat, he exclaimed: 'What a great piece of meat to be cutting.'

It was then explained he was 'butchering down a whole saddle of Highland red deer'.

Given one of Niklas' dishes, Chris had to make a lion juniper smoked venison with a reindeer blood pudding, fire roasted beetroot and beetroot sauce.

'I'm really keen on Scandinavian cooking with my boyfriend being from Denmark and we do have an obsession with Nordic food,' Chris said.

Niklas then explained the inspiration behind the pudding.

'The reindeer blood pudding is a dish I learnt from my son in France, and they make on the mountains when they take a reindeer down. They take the reindeer and immediately make a blood pudding over the fire,' he said.

However, viewers weren't as convinced.

'Reindeer blood? Gross. Not doing it for me this week,' Maisy posted on X.

'Reindeer blood?? That was an awful episode imo,' user melkay shared.

'Utterly disgusting, reindeer blood ffs,' bobbleyone added.

Under the watchful eye of Niklas' head chef Baxter, Chris had to blend the blood with flour, Port of Madeira and melted butter and then cook it at exactly 58 degrees over hot coals seasoned with juniper to set properly.

Chris said he was 'looking forward' to tasting the final product, and when it came time to plate up, things looked promising.

Judge John Torode said Chris had done a 'good job', while Gregg Wallace said the final dish 'looks and tastes fabulous'.

Analysts say the plan to build ships with mobile nuclear power sources would raise tensions with its neighbors and pose risks to the environment.

Chinese media reports described the marine nuclear power platforms as small plants inside ships that would act as mobile ""power banks"" at sea for stationary facilities and other ships. Beijing had suspended the project a year ago over safety and effectiveness concerns, reported the South China Morning Post.

But the outgoing commander of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command and State Department officials this month said China is still building the floating reactors to supply power to disputed islands, the Washington Post reported.

Although U.S. officials told the Post the deployment of such reactors would take several years, Admiral John Aquilino said their development would undermine regional security and stability.

The Philippines last week echoed those concerns.

Philippines National Security Council Assistant Director General Jonathan Malaya said China would use its floating reactors to power military bases it has built on artificial islands, including those within the Philippines' exclusive economic zone. He told local media that China's nuclear plants would further militarize disputed areas of the South China Sea.

""Anything that supports their military presence in those islands is technically a threat to our national security and against our interests,"" he said, adding that Australia and the U.S. would be among Manila's allies conducting joint patrols in the South China Sea.

Beijing claims control over almost the entire South China Sea, putting it in dispute with Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam. China has already built artificial islands with airport runways to strengthen its claims.

Analysts say Beijing's floating reactors would not only strengthen its military presence in the area but also give them an excuse to extend its reach through security actions.

Song Yanhui, director of the International Law Society of the Republic of China, Taiwan, told VOA the current military security zone for China's artificial islands is a radius of 500 meters (1,640 feet), meaning other aircraft and ships that enter this radius can be legitimately expelled.

Song said that if China deploys a floating nuclear power plant in the South China Sea, it could use the excuse of protecting the environment from radioactive pollution to drive away ships from a larger area or to take defensive measures.

For Beijing, he said, ""It kills two birds with one stone. It is a win-win strategy. It can strengthen its military presence, civilian use and claim to sovereignty.""

But the potential for radiation leaks is a real concern, say analysts.

Pankaj Jha, dean of research at the School of International Affairs of India's Jindal Global University, told VOA China's lack of experience in operating such floating reactors could spell disaster.

""It is a threat because it will contaminate water and also surrounding areas,"" he said. ""Any radiation leak would make the island uninhabitable and might also impact fishermen from the South China Sea.""

Analysts note in the event of conflict with China, the floating reactors could also become military targets.

China has deployed radars, anti-ship and anti-aircraft missiles, and fighter jets, among other weapons, on the disputed territories of Mischief Reef, Subi Reef and Fiery Cross, the three largest artificial islands in the Spratly Islands.

Richard Fisher, senior fellow with the International Assessment and Strategy Center, told VOA floating nuclear power plants could also one day extend China's weapons capabilities.

""If they were protected, these nuclear power plants could also potentially power future energy weapon devices,"" Fisher said. ""Laser weapons that could knock down missiles and aircraft or very powerful microwave weapons could also disable missiles and aircraft that would get within their range.""

Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, would not comment on the concerns expressed about China's plans to move forward with the floating nuclear power plants.

""I am not aware of the particular case you have shared with us, thus could only reply in principle,"" he told VOA in an emailed response May 14. ""China's position on the South China Sea issue is clear and consistent. We will stay committed to properly handling disputes through dialogue and consultation with countries concerned, and would like to work with ASEAN [Association of Southeast Asian Nation] countries to fully and effectively implement the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea, advance the consultation on a code of conduct in the South China Sea and jointly safeguard peace and stability in the region.""

China is not the first country to look at building floating nuclear reactors.

The United States took the lead in proposing the concept as early as 1970 but due to safety concerns did not quickly pursue development.

Russia is the only country that has brought a floating nuclear power plant to fruition, with the Akademik Lomonosov plant producing electricity and heating since 2020 from a harbor in Pevek, a town in the Arctic Circle.

The International Atomic Energy Agency at a November forum in Vienna expressed concern about the development of floating nuclear reactors, particularly when they cross international borders or operate in international waters.

""The IAEA is working with our member states to determine what further guidance and standards might be needed to ensure the safety of floating nuclear power plants,"" IAEA Deputy Director General Lydie Evrard said in a press release.

The IAEA noted Canada, China, Denmark, South Korea, Russia and the U.S. are each working on marine-based ""small modular reactor designs.""",voanews.com,news,VOA Voice of America,,-0.04313725490196074,453575807,1,https://gdb.voanews.com/1BA15C78-439A-4581-94D4-070C1C0449CA.jpg,eng-9576234

On an overcast day earlier this month, Mark Morrell was standing on Kingsley Road in Silverstone, Northamptonshire, surrounded by a film crew and pointing to a stretch of the street that has been repaired so many times it resembles a cross between a patchwork quilt and a lunar landscape.

It was all in a day's campaigning for the former utility engineer, who is widely known as Mr Pothole and has been making as much noise as possible about the parlous state of Britain's roads for the best part of 12 years. But this time there was a twist.

Morrell's crusade began when his then-teenage daughter, who had just passed her test, became worried drivers were swerving towards on-coming traffic to avoid a pothole near their home. Morrell complained to the council, got nowhere and eventually informed the police, ""which is, in reality, the only way you're going to get an emergency repair done these days,"" he says.

He started small with a Facebook page but clearly has a gift for publicity: early on he baked a birthday cake for a pothole that hadn't been fixed by the local council for more than a year. The stunt caught on elsewhere in the country and Morrell's national profile grew as the state of Britain's roads deteriorated.

But this time the film crew was from state-owned FranceTV, our cross-Channel neighbour's equivalent of the BBC. That's right, the utterly calamitous state of Britain's roads is no longer merely a national embarrassment; the humiliation is about to go global.

Perhaps the only surprise is that it took other countries so long to notice. The UK's road quality ranks just 37th in the world - a bit better than Lithuania, a bit worse than Slovenia. But those French television producers clearly know a good metaphor for modern Britain when they drive over one (and top marks for irony to the producer who decided to film the segment in the town that hosts the British Grand Prix).

Our most visible crisis

Britain can boast cutting-edge capabilities in areas such as artificial intelligence, pharmaceutical innovation, finance, filmmaking and even some aspects of car manufacturing. And yet this country doesn't build enough houses and its roads are falling apart; modern Britain is an advanced society that is immiserating itself through poor land use and inadequate infrastructure.

A lot of the UK's problems - long NHS waiting times and crumbling schools, for example - are huge issues for those directly affected but can be somewhat abstract to the general public. There is, however, no hiding the state of Britain's crumbling roads. Michèle Dix, a former managing director for planning at Transport for London and now a commissioner at the National Infrastructure Commission (NIC), says the state of the UK's roads highlights broader neglect of our transport links. Too often the focus and funding gets directed at building something new rather than maintaining something old, she argues.

Potholes have always been with us; some historians believe the term dates back to potters digging out the clay that formed the base of Roman roads. But the situation has never been worse. There was a 62 per cent increase in the number of potholes recorded by councils in Britain last year, according to analysis conducted by the pressure group Round our Way based on Freedom of Information requests.

The AA dealt with more than 630,000 pothole-related incidents in 2023, up 16 per cent on the previous year. The damage to cars is estimated to have added up to nearly £480 million last year alone. The Asphalt Industry Alliance's (AIA) aptly acronymed Annual Local Authority Road Maintenance survey calculated that the amount of money needed to fix the backlog of problems on local roads has now reached a cool £16.3 billion, a 16 per cent increase from last year.

Public ire

No wonder the nation's road users are so angry. Photos of stony-faced motorists pointing at asphalt cavities have become a mainstay on the front pages of local newspapers. Politicians gather around in high-vis jackets, stroking their chins and staring into grimy puddles as if they are font of all human knowledge. Last year the bonfire society in Lewes, East Sussex, famous for its topical effigies, burned ""Pothole Pete"", who was dressed as ""an indistinguishable civil servant"", on Guy Fawkes night.

A few months earlier, Sir Rod Stewart was spotted raking gravel after struggling to drive his Ferrari down a road near his house in Harlow, Essex. In many parts of the country local residents have started putting down their own traffic cones to warn drivers about the most dangerous potholes. In Lostwithiel, Cornwall, a ""phantom filler"" has started taking matters into his own hands and is fixing roads under the cover of night.

""People have had enough,"" says Morrell. ""There's long been plenty of anger about potholes, but now it's reaching boiling point. People spend a fortune on fuel duty and road tax but the problem just gets worse.""

The issue was brought into sharp focus earlier this month when it emerged that police were investigating whether an accident that resulted in the death of a 74-year-old Porsche driver was caused by the man swerving to avoid a pothole, near the Sussex village of Petworth. Elsewhere, residents of Charlton-All-Saints near Salisbury, Wiltshire have been left with only one way in and out of their hamlet after a pothole the length of a double-decker bus opened, rendering a road unusable.

All this ire is a particular problem for the Conservatives. Many of the party's traditional supporters live in the countryside and rely on cars to get around. Scores of Northern ""Red Wall"" seats the Tories won in the 2019 election are located in some of the most pothole-blighted parts of the country. The state of Britain's roads has become a key issue on the doorstep and Labour was punching the bruise in the lead up to the local elections, with claims there are 100 times more potholes on British roads than craters on the Moon.

The Tories have long been alive to the danger. Three years ago Rishi Sunak promised to fill in 50 million potholes. Last year, he earmarked £8.3 billion of the money saved from scrapping the northern leg of HS2 to fix roads. Esther McVey recently said this was ""the biggest ever funding increase"" for road improvement. ""We've given councils the cash to fix potholes,"" the minister without portfolio/for common sense wrote in The Telegraph. ""Now they need to get on with it.""

Scale of the problem

Clearly, £8.3 billion is a lot of money and motoring groups are broadly agreed it will make a big difference. But they also say it must be put in context. By McVey's own admission, the extra HS2 money will only pay to resurface around 5,000 miles of road, which is just 3 per cent of all council-managed roads in England, and will be dripped out over the course of 11 years. The trouble is, the AIA believes that around 107,000 miles of roads, about 53 per cent of the total network, will reach the end of their structural lives within the next 15 years.

""The scale of the problem now facing councils is truly gargantuan,"" says Simon Williams, the RAC's head of policy. ""The status quo is not sustainable. The longer the Government fails to grasp this reality, the bigger the eventual cost to the public purse."" When it comes to this nation's roads, the UK failed to fix a stitch in time and is now left holding a bill for nine.

It's still worth doing though. The UK's pothole epidemic is costing the economy £14.4 billion a year, according to the first analysis of its kind conducted by the Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR). This took into account the damage to vehicles, accidents, extra emissions and more than 1.3 billion hours in additional journey time as the result of bad roads.

Douglas McWilliams, the economist who conducted the research for the CEBR and recently completed the Peking-to-Paris car rally, says: ""My take is that our roads are now worse for potholes than anywhere on that rally, apart from the far west of China and Mongolia, and notably worse than in both Russia and Kazakhstan - let alone western Europe.""

How did it get this bad?

We motorists tend to think of roads as horizontal. But from an engineering point of view they are very short and extremely wide vertical structures. Take a cross section of your local road and you'd see three distinct layers. At the bottom is the compacted subgrade soil. The middle layer, or road base, is graded gravel that will likely have been mixed with cement. On top is a covering of permeable asphalt.

That all sounds relatively simple, but there can be quite large variation in both the quality of the materials and techniques used to build the roads. And, according to Dr Benyi Cao, a research fellow at the Royal Academy of Engineering, the UK has quite the reputation for scrimping on both compared with other European countries.

For example, after compacting the subgrade level, road builders will conduct quality control for water content to ensure that the base is neither too wet nor too dry. But there's a big difference in testing every few hundred metres, which Cao says would be considered best practice, and every mile or so, as sometimes happens. Similarly, if the road base isn't thick enough it will be more prone to flexing, resulting in cracks quickly appearing on the surface. Lower quality bitumen will become brittle more quickly.

Morrell, who worked in the utilities industry for 25 years before becoming a campaigner, has seen first-hand how road-building standards have slipped. ""When I had to dig up roads in London that were built 50 or 60 years ago it would break my heart. Those guys knew how to build roads that would last.""

Potholes start to develop because fatigue cracking, ageing asphalt and/or poor drainage results in water entering and remaining in the subgrade and base layers. The weather obviously presents its challenges. As you may have noticed, it rains a lot in the UK. Surface flooding is getting worse because of ""urban sprawl"", poorly maintained drains and climate change. The temperature also bounces around 0C (32F) for months at a time, creating a continuous freeze-thaw cycle during which water will repeatedly expand and contract, forcing cracks farther apart.

British roads are also among the busiest in the world. Lots of freight travels by lorry or van because the rail network is so unreliable. We're buying increasing numbers of SUVs and electric cars, which are heavier and therefore put more stress on the roads. Research by University College London suggests that the increasing reliance on satnavs is resulting in heavier traffic on minor country roads and urban ""rat runs"".

The UK also has more ducts and pipes carrying our gas, electricity, water and broadband laid under the roads than in other countries. Frequent excavations by utility companies and their poor-quality repairs further diminish the integrity of the carriageway. Some 55 per cent of all potholes in urban areas are caused by utilities digging up the roads.

Responsibility shifted to utility firms

Part of the issue is a little-known change in the law in 1991. Prior to this, companies had to pay highway authorities to repair roads after they'd been dug up. Westminster council charged £120 per square metre for this work. But under the New Roads and Street Work Act of 1991, utilities could reinstate their own openings. Costs dropped to an estimated £40 per square metre.

In theory the savings should have resulted in lower bills (or fatter margins for the utility companies). But the change in the law clearly had a number of unintended consequences. First, utility companies became less hesitant about digging up roads. Second, it was clearly in their interests to repair the damage they caused as cheaply as possible. And, third, the councils lost an important source of revenue that many in the industry believe was subsidising their other road maintenance work.

Politicians are now having to deal with the fallout. When he was transport secretary, Chris Grayling promised to make utilities put their pipes under pavements rather than roads - until it was quietly pointed out that utilities would love to do that, because it would vastly improve access, but unfortunately there's not enough space. Grant Shapps, one of Grayling's successors, threatened to slap companies that bodge their repairs with financial penalties. But this relies on councils having enough inspectors to assess the work. And, because of budget cuts, many don't.

Funding shortfalls

Successive governments have been squeezing local authority budgets for decades. Statistics from the Covid years can be fairly misleading. But the trends from before the pandemic tell a clear tale. Central government grants to local authorities have collapsed from £46.5 billion in 2009/10 to £28 billion in 2019/20 in today's prices, according to the Institute for Government.

Part of this 40 per cent drop was offset by increases in council tax. But even when this is taken into account, local authorities are staring down the barrel at an average funding shortfall of nearly 18 per cent. Many have understandably prioritised schools and children's social care, meaning the axe has fallen particularly hard on things such as road maintenance.

""Roads don't collapse dramatically, they just progressively get worse and worse, so it is easier to kick the can down the road a bit farther when times are hard,"" Rick Green, the chairman of the AIA, told The Telegraph last year. This is precisely what's happened.

Recent analysis by the Local Government Association (LGA) found that this reduction in funding to repair local roads was bigger than in almost every other country in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development club of wealthy nations, resulting in the UK falling from ""top to almost bottom of the league"" over two decades, according to Shaun Davies, the chairman of the LGA. Only Italy and Ireland had cut their budgets by a similar amount over that time, while the United States, Japan, New Zealand, Sweden and Denmark had all increased theirs by more than half.

There are various ways to crunch the numbers on this. Despite the Government's claim that the £8.3 billion diverted from HS2 would pay for the resurfacing of 5,000 miles of road, we know that just 1,123 miles of road were resurfaced in the 2021/22 financial year, compared with 1,588 miles in 2017/18, according to research conducted by the RAC based on government data. That's a drop of 29 per cent. Multiply that by 11 and you get 5,115 miles - more than the HS2 money will pay for.

Or you can look at the combined annual funding shortfall in the road maintenance budgets of local authorities in England and Wales. This now adds up to £1.3 billion, according to the AIA. If you again multiple that number by 11 you get to a figure of £14.3 billion. So, even with the HS2 money added to the pot, there's still a £6 billion gap.

""The Government is pushing this narrative of record investment in our roads,"" says one transport expert. ""But it doesn't make up for the cumulative cuts in funding that have been made over the years.""

Inadequate fixes

The result has been an over-reliance on patching potholes and making repairs rather than resurfacing roads, says Dix. Again, this can be done badly or well. The quickest and cheapest method involves shovelling cold-lay Tarmac into a hole, which workmen then, in the words of Morrell, ""tread down with their size nines"". Using hot Tarmac is marginally better. Cutting out a section of the road and then compressing hot Tarmac into the neat hole is best.

But if a pothole has formed, it almost certainly means the integrity of the road surface is already compromised. It will therefore only be a matter of time before the repair wears out or a new hole appears close by. The AIA likens patching to ""icing a rotten cake"". Edmund King, the president of the AA, says: ""Currently we often have a vicious circle of pothole formed, damage caused, pothole patched, pothole reappears with more damage caused - when what we need are more permanent repairs.""

What's to be done? The NIC has recommended councils outside London receive five-year budgets for road maintenance and that total funding be increased from £6.5 billion a year to £8 billion. The RAC has also been calling for a fundamental overhaul in how road maintenance is funded, perhaps by ring-fencing a proportion of the money the Treasury raises from fuel duty. Both proposals would provide councils with the longer-term certainty needed to better plan programmes rather than having to cope with ""boom and bust"" funding cycles.

New technology

Researchers are working on innovative solutions to our pothole problems. Rubberised asphalt, for example, adds shredded tyres to the bitumen mix in order to make the road surface more elastic and stop it cracking so easily. Some councils are already experimenting with adding a graphene-based material to asphalt. This is about a fifth more expensive but lasts twice as long.

A company called Roadmole makes a remote-controlled contraption that cuts circular sections out of the road surface around potholes rather than the usual squares, whose corners can become weak points for water seepage. The JCB Pothole Pro can fix a pothole in just eight minutes at a cost of £30. Stoke-on-Trent City Council's highways team is the first in the country to use this bit of kit and is already exceeding its repair targets.

The Nu-phalt Thermal Road Repair heats up a damaged patch of the road to recycle existing macadam and ensure it bonds better with new material. Then there's the Kiely Multipatcher from Australia, which needs only one person to operate it, combines pothole repair with small-scale surface dressing, and can mend about 100ft of road in under three minutes.

More Tomorrow's World solutions include a ""self-healing"" asphalt with steel fibres and epoxy capsules infused in the materials that repairs itself when heat is applied. Capsules containing bacteria can also be added to cement-based road materials. When they crack, the bacteria are released and start producing calcite (a form of limestone) as a natural byproduct of their metabolism.

Cao is experimenting with using ground-source heating and cooling systems to help regulate the temperature of the road surface to stop it melting in the summer and to break the freeze-thaw cycle in the winter.

However, Dix warns that the authorities need to remain mindful of more basic fixes. ""There are lots of things we can do [to prevent potholes], but digging drains by the side of the road should be first on the list,"" she says.

Whether the solutions are cutting edge or more rudimentary, they all cost money. There's not a lot of that to go around at the moment. But the alternative is, well, just take your car for a drive, your bike for a ride, or tune in to French television, to see what systematic under-investment looks like.

16.03pm: FTSE 100 to close flat

Britain's top stocks are set to close Thursday out a tick lower after Sage Group and easyJet experienced sharp falls, along with a horde of companies going ex-dividend.

easyJet tumbled around 4.5% after it announced its chief executive would be leaving after seven years.

Johan Lundgren will step down early next year and will be succeeded by current finance chief Kenton Jarvis, who joined the low-cost carrier in February 2021.

Sage Group led the FTSE 100 fallers after it dropped 8%, having warned that future profits may be weaker-than-expected, despite strong growth in its half-year.

Kathleen Brooks at XTB said: ""Sage's profit downgrade highlights how markets are priced for perfection. Sage's stock price made a record high at the end of April, and a weak outlook obviously could not sustain this elevated valuation.""

BT was the index's star performer today, rising 15.5% after it nudged its dividend higher and said it had ""now reached the inflection point on our long-term strategy"".

The telecom giant said that the inflection was triggered by the company passing the peak point of its capital investment into its fibre broadband rollout and achieving its £3 billion cost-cutting programme a year early.

15.40pm: Burberry woes to extend into 2025

Burberry shares have lifted more than 2.5% today, helping offset the 4.5% drop it suffered on Wednesday after reporting a 34% drop in profits.

The luxury fashion house warned that slowing luxury demand was expected to continue in the coming months.

However, analysts believe the group's woes will continue beyond the next few months, spilling into 2025.

""With limited evidence in the financials of any improvement in sales or gross margin, we have to turn to the operating cost management lever as the main highlight,"" Deutsche Bank analysts stated.

""In our view, if we are talking about cost savings as an important reason for investors to look at the stock we are likely to have missed the major issue.

""It is a challenge to navigate a brand turnaround but with a tough market backdrop and an ongoing cost-cutting programme the mountain looms even higher.""

15.20pm: Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) site catches fire

Europe's largest company by market cap Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) suffered a fire at a construction site it was planning to expand to help with the rise in demand for its weight loss drug.

The Ozempic and Wegovy maker said the fire at its site in Kalundborg, Denmark had been extinguished and nobody had been injured.

Shares in the Danish company initially dropped 3.1% as reports of the fire broke, but it has since recovered and is flat on Thursday.

14.30pm: US stocks flat as job market cools

Wall Street opened flat on Thursday after fresh unemployment data revealed that layoffs have remained at a historically low level.

All three indexes opened flat, experiencing low single-digit point drops.

Jobless claims for the week to May 11 dropped by 10,000 to 222,000, the US labour department revealed.

Last week's unemployment data reached its highest point in around 9 months, but still remains at historically low levels since the pandemic saw a surge of layoffs.

In April, only 175,000 new jobs were created, marking the weakest growth in six months and highlighting that the labour market may be cooling.

14.07pm: Microsoft workers asked to leave China

Microsoft has asked hundreds of staff members to leave China, according to reports, as tensions continue to grow between the US and the West.

Some employees were offered an ""optional internal transfer opportunity"", a Financial Times-cited source said on Thursday.

Between 700 and 800 people in Microsoft's China-based cloud-computing and artificial intelligence wing were asked to leave, another report from the Wall Street Journal said.

Sources added Microsoft would continue to operate in China, where it has about 9,000 employees, though the move comes days after the White House tightened controls on exports from the country.

On Wednesday, the Biden administration said it would be placing a 100% US import tariff for Chinese EVs.

The US also upped import tariffs on other green technology components such as solar panels, semiconductors and battery components.

13.45pm: Tesco recalls product as it may contain glass

Tesco shares have slipped more than 1.5% today after it went ex-dividend, however, a share price slide may be the least of management's worries.

The UK's largest supermarket has been forced to recall its sandwich pickle over the possibility it may contain glass in it.

The 295g jars of Tesco Sandwich Pickle part of batch 3254 and with a best-before date of 11 September 2025 were recalled due to concerns over traces of glass.

""This product may contain pieces of glass which makes it unsafe to eat,"" the Food Standards Agency warned.

Last year, the group was forced to recall sausage rolls and steak pies after it was warned they may contain pieces of metal and/or plastic.

13.26pm: Wall Street to hold at record highs

US stocks are expected to open flat on Thursday, coming off a strong Wednesday which saw both the Nasdaq and S&P 500 reach record highs as inflation data came in lighter than expected.

Now, futures for both indexes are indicating they will open higher, with the S&P 500 at 5,335 and the Nasdaq at 18,709.

In equities, Walmart pushed 6.5% higher in premarket trading after it posted its largest earnings beat in three years.

Both sales and profits soared at the retailer after a strong turnaround from its advertising operations and a rise in demand from high-income consumers.

13.06pm: UK business minister to meet with Royal Mail boss

Britian's business minister Kemi Badenoch is set to meet the chief executive of Royal Mail's owner IDS to discuss the takeover offer from Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky.

""[Badenoch] is meeting the chief executive officer of Royal Mail's parent company to discuss this and other matters,"" a spokesperson for Rishi Sunak explained.

Reports this morning revealed the UK government had not planned to intervene in the sale.

However, the government may be able to block the deal under the National Security and Investment Act, which a Whitehall representative said was being monitored ""very closely"".

12.45pm: Oil prices slip as supply grows

Oil prices have slipped on Thursday as stockpiles across the world continue to grow.

Brent crude oil fell as much as 0.4% to US$82 per barrel, writing off much of the 0.5% gains experienced on Wednesday.

It comes after data revealed global oil stockpiles rose by 34.6 million barrels in March, according to the International Energy Agency.

Additional data from the Opec cartel identified that several countries which are supposed to reduce their oil outputs have actually increased production ahead of quotas.

Middle East supply chain concerns have also eased as hopes grow that the conflict in the region can move closer to a resolution.

12.23pm: Chevron to sell last assets in North Sea

Oil giant Chevron says it is preparing to sell the last of its assets in the North Sea, leaving the region for the first time in 55 years.

A sale will involve the group's divestment of its 19.4% stake in the Cair oilfield, the BP-operated site located to the west of the Shetland region.

It is the largest oilfield in the North Sea, producing an average of 120,000 barrels per day.

Chevron is currently preparing for its US$53 billion acquisition of rival Hess and has pencilled in the sale of US$20 billion worth of its assets to support the move.

12.05pm: Bitcoin holds onto yesterday's stellar gains

Bitcoin (BTC) soared more than 7.5% against the US on Wednesday, making for the strongest single-day session for the world's largest cryptocurrency in nearly two months.

The rally brought the BTC/USD pair to its strongest point in three weeks and the bulls have managed to hold onto these gains in early Thursday trades.

Bitcoin's solid performance follows a softer-than-expected consumer inflation read for April which ""lit a fire under equities once again"", said IG analysts.

Bret Kenwell, analyst at eToro, equated the consumer inflation print to a ""Goldilocks report"" for equities, with the optimist evidently filtering through to the cryptocurrency markets.

11.45am: Reality stars charged for promoting sham trading scheme

A horde of reality TV stars have been charged by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) for promoting an unauthorised foreign exchange trading scheme via Instagram.

Geordie Shore's Scott Timlin, multiple The Only Way is Essex stars and Love Island contestants such as Rebecca Gormley and Eva Zapico were all found to have been involved in the scheme.

The FCA charged Emmanuel Nwanze for running an unauthorised investment programme which saw advice given on buying and selling contracts for difference, which it was not permitted to do.

The 'fiinfluencers' were accused of promoting the Instagram account which issued the unauthorised advice and will stand before Westminster's Magistrate Court in June.

11.27am: Thames Water shareholder quits board

Thames Water's largest shareholder has withdrawn its representative from the embattled water provider's board as the company continues to struggle with its £18 billion debt pile.

Michael McNicholas, the managing director at Omers Infrastructure, the Canadian pension fund, confirmed he will no longer be a non-executive director for Thames Water.

Kemble, the parent company of Thames Water, is expected to see several other resignations in the coming days from board members who represent connected companies.

It comes after an equity funding round was shelved after Ofcom refused to allow the swingeing price increases that the shareholders demanded in return for their participation.

11am: Japan economy shrinks, but weightloss drugs boost Denmark GDP

Some gross domestic product figures were reported today for two notable economics.

Japan's economy shrank faster than expected in the first quarter, with GDP contracting 2% compared to the same quarter last year, worse than the 1.5% drop in forecast.

Compared to the fourth quarter, GDP was down 0.5%, as households and companies cut back.

Denmark meanwhile nearly doubled its growth forecast for this year to 2.7% thanks to weight-loss drugmaker Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) boosting the economy.

The economy ministry in Copenhagen raised its forecast from 1.4% in December as Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) ramps up production of its blockbuster drug, which is branded Ozempic for diabetes and Wegovy for weight loss, resulting in forecast export growth of 7% from 4.2% previously.

""It's an absolute rarity that the government makes such a significant upward adjustment of the forecast,"" Tore Stramer, chief economist at the Danish Chamber of Commerce, told media.

10.43am: European markets subdued, but Roche jumps on weightloss drug news

The FTSE 100 is not the only European benchmark in the red this morning, not able to sustain the upbeat vibes from the record setting session yesterday.

While London's leading index is down 0.33%, Germany's DAX has dropped 0.22%, France's CAC 40 is 0.54% lower and Spain's IBEX 35 has slipped 0.23%.

One exception is Italy's FTSE MIB, up 0.11%, led by banks BPER and Banca Monte Paschi Siena, with Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) in the green too.

The wider Euro Stoxx 600 index is down 0.17% and the blue-chip Euro Stoxx 50 is down 0.38%.

""After a sparkling session on Wall Street last night amid hopes that the latest inflation data raises the chances of a US interest rate cut, European markets didn't share the joy,"" says Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.

Swiss drug giant Roche is under the Mould microscope, having jumped 4%.

""Weight-loss drugs remain a hot topic and investors are latching on to any positive news in the broader space. Roche is the latest name to turn heads after reporting positive early-stage trial data for an obesity drug. Big share price gains have already been recorded with weight-loss champions Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) and Eli Lilly so investors are keen to find new ways to play the theme.""

10.15am: Royal Mail - analysts sceptical, government 'looking closely'

After Royal Mail owner International Distributions Services PLC (LSE:IDS) received a revised takeover proposal from 'Czech Sphinx' Daniel Kretinsky's EP Group yesterday, some analysts are sceptical that the deal will go through.

As the IDS board has indicated it is minded to recommend an offer at this level, ""it appears the remaining obstacles to a board recommendation are the undertakings and contractual commitments required to try to secure government approval"", says analyst Gerald Khoo at Liberum Capital.

""We remain highly sceptical on the prospects of government clearance, especially if it falls to a potential future Labour government to decide,"" says Khoo...read more here.

But government ministers do not plan to try and block the deal, reports from the Daily Mail have revealed.

IDs shares are up 2% this morning, 12% over the week.

9.40am: Mixed weekly economic data from ONS

The Office for National Statistics has released its spangly new weekly economic activity and social change data, which show mixed activity.

UK spending on credit and debit cards was down 1% compared with the previous week, while UK retail footfall was broadly unchanged.

The week to 5 May saw higher average fuel prices year-on-year for the second consecutive week at 1%.

The total number of online job adverts last Friday, 10 May, was broadly unchanged from the level in the previous week, but was 18% lower than in the equivalent week of 2023, according to data supplied by Adzuna.

On inflation, compared with the previous calendar month, 27% of businesses reported a rise in the price of goods and services that they bought in April, while 13% reported an increase in the price of goods and services they sold.

The data also includes electricity system prices and flight numbers.

9.19am: UK rally 'has plenty further to go'

Another view from the City, this time Panmure Gordon's chief economist Simon French, who reckons the UK rally has the potential to go on a lot longer.

""A series of all-time highs for the FTSE100 index - twelve closing highs in the last month which is a record since the index was launched in 1984 - have led to a flurry of questions on where this has left UK equity market valuations,"" he says in a note to clients this morning.

""The good news for those worrying they have missed the boat is that all-time highs in indices tell us very little about underlying valuations.

""UK valuations remain deeply subdued compared to their historic norms on both a relative and absolute basis. There has been a slight narrowing from the 19% discount we estimated in Q4 2023, with that discount closing to 17%.""

However, French says, ""there is still plenty to go for"", particularly further down the spectrum among the UK's mid-caps and small caps.

We'll have more of his thoughts in a separate story soon.

9.05am: Some market commentary

Let's hear what some market commentators think of the action so far.

""European markets have opened mixed with the DAX trading flat while the FTSE 100 is in the red,"" says Victoria Scholar, head of investment at Interactive Investor, noting the drag from Sage and easyJet plus many big stocks going ex-dividend today.

BT is on track for its biggest one-day gain since November 2021, she notes, with free cash flow beating analysts' expectations and new upbeat guidance for significantly further increases.

""BT struck a positive tone towards the broadband market saying it will recover over the medium term. BT also said it enjoyed strong Openreach customer demand for FTTP (fibre to the premises) in the fourth quarter.

""Allison Kirkby took to the helm as CEO in February 2024 and appears to be trying to win over shareholders, attempting to boost its struggling share price with a better-than-expected free cash flow performance, a focus on cost savings, and by increasing the company's dividend payout.

""She's been facing a tough battle since a lot of major investors have been shorting the stock - investors placed a record £300m bet against BT, according to an FT report this week, which will be getting squeezed today,"" Scholar adds.

Sophie Lund-Yates, lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says: ""The FTSE 100 has shed points after setting another record on Wednesday. The investor confidence boost from Wednesday's encouraging inflation data in the US is being partially offset by wider thoughts on a busy day for company earnings.

""The overall mood remains bright though, with losses relatively minimal. That's thanks to that inflation data - while the path to disinflation was never going to be without bumps, this latest indicator suggests things are moving in favour of Federal Reserve interest rate cuts this year - albeit this can change at short notice.""

One such piece of news is that easyJet's CEO is stepping down after seven years in the captain's seat.

""This is a natural time for Lundgren to step away, with a strong tenure under his belt and the post-Covid heavy lifting complete,"" says Lund-Yates, also pointing to airline booking momentum ""coming off the boil slightly, but overall, the outlook looks robust"".

8.53am: Blue-chips down, mid-caps up

While the Footsie is on its heels, down 28 points or 0.33%, its mid-cap sibling is on the front foot.

The FTSE 250 is up 27 points or 0.13% at 20,802.80

Driving the mid-cap index higher are three double-digit share price gains at Future, Watches of Switzerland and Auction Technology Group.

Future PLC (LSE:FUTR) is up 18.3% (good news for my Christmas tip!) as while first-half revenue declined 2% organically or 3% on a reported basis, the online and magazine publishing company returned to 3% organic growth in the second quarter.

Watches of Switzerland Group PLC (LSE:WOSG) is up 15% after a year-end trading update that reveals the fourth quarter completed a solid end to the year in the US and a good showing in jewellery and Rolex pre-owned business.

FY25 guidance from WoS looks encouraging, ahead of existing consensus.

Auction Technology Group PLC (LSE:ATG) was bid 11% higher as seven out of its eight marketplaces performed well.

8.37am: Sage numbers good but not good enough

First-half numbers from The Sage Group PLC (LSE:SGE) seemed pretty much in line with expectations but the shares are down over 8%, though this might reflect overlying optimistic expectations, having risen almost 50% over the past year and recently hit an all-time high.

Underlying revenue grew 10% to £1.15 billion, while organic growth of 9% was just shy of the consensus 9.5% forecast and recurring revenue growth of 11% was in line with expectations.

Underlying earnings per share came in at 18.2p, up 23% and in-line with forecasts.

CEO Steve Hare said demand for its accounting, HR and payroll products from small and mid-sized businesses ""remains robust"" and looking forward, ""despite the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty, I am confident that Sage's proven strategy, underpinned by continued investment, will enable us to deliver further efficient growth"".

The company expects organic revenue growth for the full year to be in line with the first half.

Analyst Damindu Jayaweera at Peel Hunt said this ""implies a slight nudge down"" to organic growth and the lack of an upgrade to this ""will likely hit sentiment today"".

8.15am: FTSE falls at open

The FTSE 100 more fell out of the gate rather than the expected spring higher, as some stocks went ex-dividend and the departure of easyJet's CEO and results from Sage Group seemed to disappoint.

In initial trades, the index dropped over 22 points to 8423, a fall of 0.27%.

Almost all of this is from the ex-dividend adjustments of 20.58 points as some big names including Shell, BP, GSK, Tesco, Unilever and Kingfisher PLC trade without the value of their next dividend payment, lowering their share prices temporarily.

Elsewhere, BT Group PLC (LSE:BT.A) rose 8.35% on the back of its mixed results, with earnings disappointing but dividend hiked and a cash flow ""inflection"" boasted.

EasyJet PLC (LSE:EZJ) fell 7.66% as its CEO heading for the departure gate overrides a pretty positive set of numbers.

Accounting software maker Sage Group PLC (LSE:SGE) also dropped 8.53% on the back of their results, while water company United Utilities Group PLC (LSE:UU.) leaked 0.94% lower.

7.54am: easyJet CEO set to disembark, H1 results look good

Budget airline easyJet PLC (LSE:EZJ) reported a smaller first-half loss than expected and announced that chief executive Johan Lundgren will step down early next year.

After seven years in charge, Lundgren will be succeeded by current finance chief Kenton Jarvis as CEO.

Jarvis, who joined the low-cost carrier in February 2021, will continue in the role of CFO during the transition period and a search for his successor ""will commence shortly"".

As for the results, revenue of £3.27 billion in the six months to end-March was slightly ahead of forecast (£3.24bn), while a headline pre-tax loss £350 million was down £61 million on a year ago and less than the £357 million than City analysts estimated.

Lundgren outlined a positive outlook for the full year, with third-quarter airline revenue per seat (RPS) expected to be ""slightly up"" on a year ago, with the Easter peak falling into March.

The EasyJet Holidays business is expected to deliver at least a 40% profit growth to £170 million-plus.

7.32am: BT earnings fall short, but dividend lifted

BT Group PLC (LSE:BT.A) results look a little shy of expectations, but the dividend has been nudged higher, which may override the rest of the numbers for many investors.

New boss Allison Kirkby said that as the telco has passed the point of peak investment into its full-fibre broadband rollout and achieved its £3 billion cost cutting programme a year ahead of schedule, ""we've now reached the inflection point on our long-term strategy"".

With the plan now to more than double free cash flow over the next five years, she says this means the dividend is being hiked, well a 3.9% increase, with a final dividend of 5.69p per share making a total of 8.0p for the past year.

Kirkby has also set a new £3 billion target of gross annualised cost savings to be reached by the end of March 2029.

As for the results for the year to March 2024, revenue of £20.8 billion was slightly below the average City analyst's forecast and adjusted EPS down 16% to 18.5p, versus the consensus EPS forecast of 19.2p.

On the outlook, revenue is guided to growth between 0% and 1% and EBITDA just above flat to around £8.2bn (forecasts are currently at around £8.3 billion).

7.11am: FTSE 100 to jump out of the gate

The FTSE 100 is heading for a smooth start again on Thursday, with another day full to the brim with corporate results, including BT Group, easyJet, Future, Sage Group, Premier Foods and United Utilities.

Spread-betters have called London's blue-chip benchmark 22 points higher ahead of the open, after the index notched another record intraday day high (8,474.41) and all-time closing high, up almost 18 points yesterday to 8,445.8.

Shares going ex-dividends will hold the Footsie back by around 20 points today though.

Overnight, the three major US stock indices all closed at new record highs too, as softer inflation report strengthened rate cut expectations.

The Nasdaq gained 1.4% and the S&P 500 added 1.2%, while the Dow Jones rose 0.9%.

11am: Japan economy shrinks, but weightloss drugs boost Denmark GDP

Some gross domestic product figures were reported today for two notable economics.

Japan's economy shrank faster than expected in the first quarter, with GDP contracting 2% compared to the same quarter last year, worse than the 1.5% drop in forecast.

Compared to the fourth quarter, GDP was down 0.5%, as households and companies cut back.

Denmark meanwhile nearly doubled its growth forecast for this year to 2.7% thanks to weight-loss drugmaker Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) boosting the economy.

The economy ministry in Copenhagen raised its forecast from 1.4% in December as Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) ramps up production of its blockbuster drug, which is branded Ozempic for diabetes and Wegovy for weight loss, resulting in forecast export growth of 7% from 4.2% previously.

""It's an absolute rarity that the government makes such a significant upward adjustment of the forecast,"" Tore Stramer, chief economist at the Danish Chamber of Commerce, told media.

10.43am: European markets subdued, but Roche jumps on weightloss drug news

The FTSE 100 is not the only European benchmark in the red this morning, not able to sustain the upbeat vibes from the record setting session yesterday.

While London's leading index is down 0.33%, Germany's DAX has dropped 0.22%, France's CAC 40 is 0.54% lower and Spain's IBEX 35 has slipped 0.23%.

One exception is Italy's FTSE MIB, up 0.11%, led by banks BPER and Banca Monte Paschi Siena, with Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) in the green too.

The wider Euro Stoxx 600 index is down 0.17% and the blue-chip Euro Stoxx 50 is down 0.38%.

""After a sparkling session on Wall Street last night amid hopes that the latest inflation data raises the chances of a US interest rate cut, European markets didn't share the joy,"" says Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.

Swiss drug giant Roche is under the Mould microscope, having jumped 4%.

""Weight-loss drugs remain a hot topic and investors are latching on to any positive news in the broader space. Roche is the latest name to turn heads after reporting positive early-stage trial data for an obesity drug. Big share price gains have already been recorded with weight-loss champions Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) and Eli Lilly so investors are keen to find new ways to play the theme.""

10.15am: Royal Mail - analysts sceptical, government 'looking closely'

After Royal Mail owner International Distributions Services PLC (LSE:IDS) received a revised takeover proposal from 'Czech Sphinx' Daniel Kretinsky's EP Group yesterday, some analysts are sceptical that the deal will go through.

As the IDS board has indicated it is minded to recommend an offer at this level, ""it appears the remaining obstacles to a board recommendation are the undertakings and contractual commitments required to try to secure government approval"", says analyst Gerald Khoo at Liberum Capital.

""We remain highly sceptical on the prospects of government clearance, especially if it falls to a potential future Labour government to decide,"" says Khoo...read more here.

But government ministers do not plan to try and block the deal, reports from the Daily Mail have revealed.

IDs shares are up 2% this morning, 12% over the week.

9.40am: Mixed weekly economic data from ONS

The Office for National Statistics has released its spangly new weekly economic activity and social change data, which show mixed activity.

UK spending on credit and debit cards was down 1% compared with the previous week, while UK retail footfall was broadly unchanged.

The week to 5 May saw higher average fuel prices year-on-year for the second consecutive week at 1%.

The total number of online job adverts last Friday, 10 May, was broadly unchanged from the level in the previous week, but was 18% lower than in the equivalent week of 2023, according to data supplied by Adzuna.

On inflation, compared with the previous calendar month, 27% of businesses reported a rise in the price of goods and services that they bought in April, while 13% reported an increase in the price of goods and services they sold.

The data also includes electricity system prices and flight numbers.

9.19am: UK rally 'has plenty further to go'

Another view from the City, this time Panmure Gordon's chief economist Simon French, who reckons the UK rally has the potential to go on a lot longer.

""A series of all-time highs for the FTSE100 index - twelve closing highs in the last month which is a record since the index was launched in 1984 - have led to a flurry of questions on where this has left UK equity market valuations,"" he says in a note to clients this morning.

""The good news for those worrying they have missed the boat is that all-time highs in indices tell us very little about underlying valuations.

""UK valuations remain deeply subdued compared to their historic norms on both a relative and absolute basis. There has been a slight narrowing from the 19% discount we estimated in Q4 2023, with that discount closing to 17%.""

However, French says, ""there is still plenty to go for"", particularly further down the spectrum among the UK's mid-caps and small caps.

We'll have more of his thoughts in a separate story soon.

9.05am: Some market commentary

Let's hear what some market commentators think of the action so far.

""European markets have opened mixed with the DAX trading flat while the FTSE 100 is in the red,"" says Victoria Scholar, head of investment at Interactive Investor, noting the drag from Sage and easyJet plus many big stocks going ex-dividend today.

BT is on track for its biggest one-day gain since November 2021, she notes, with free cash flow beating analysts' expectations and new upbeat guidance for significantly further increases.

""BT struck a positive tone towards the broadband market saying it will recover over the medium term. BT also said it enjoyed strong Openreach customer demand for FTTP (fibre to the premises) in the fourth quarter.

""Allison Kirkby took to the helm as CEO in February 2024 and appears to be trying to win over shareholders, attempting to boost its struggling share price with a better-than-expected free cash flow performance, a focus on cost savings, and by increasing the company's dividend payout.

""She's been facing a tough battle since a lot of major investors have been shorting the stock - investors placed a record £300m bet against BT, according to an FT report this week, which will be getting squeezed today,"" Scholar adds.

Sophie Lund-Yates, lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says: ""The FTSE 100 has shed points after setting another record on Wednesday. The investor confidence boost from Wednesday's encouraging inflation data in the US is being partially offset by wider thoughts on a busy day for company earnings.

""The overall mood remains bright though, with losses relatively minimal. That's thanks to that inflation data - while the path to disinflation was never going to be without bumps, this latest indicator suggests things are moving in favour of Federal Reserve interest rate cuts this year - albeit this can change at short notice.""

One such piece of news is that easyJet's CEO is stepping down after seven years in the captain's seat.

""This is a natural time for Lundgren to step away, with a strong tenure under his belt and the post-Covid heavy lifting complete,"" says Lund-Yates, also pointing to airline booking momentum ""coming off the boil slightly, but overall, the outlook looks robust"".

8.53am: Blue-chips down, mid-caps up

While the Footsie is on its heels, down 28 points or 0.33%, its mid-cap sibling is on the front foot.

The FTSE 250 is up 27 points or 0.13% at 20,802.80

Driving the mid-cap index higher are three double-digit share price gains at Future, Watches of Switzerland and Auction Technology Group.

Future PLC (LSE:FUTR) is up 18.3% (good news for my Christmas tip!) as while first-half revenue declined 2% organically or 3% on a reported basis, the online and magazine publishing company returned to 3% organic growth in the second quarter.

Watches of Switzerland Group PLC (LSE:WOSG) is up 15% after a year-end trading update that reveals the fourth quarter completed a solid end to the year in the US and a good showing in jewellery and Rolex pre-owned business.

FY25 guidance from WoS looks encouraging, ahead of existing consensus.

Auction Technology Group PLC (LSE:ATG) was bid 11% higher as seven out of its eight marketplaces performed well.

8.37am: Sage numbers good but not good enough

First-half numbers from The Sage Group PLC (LSE:SGE) seemed pretty much in line with expectations but the shares are down over 8%, though this might reflect overlying optimistic expectations, having risen almost 50% over the past year and recently hit an all-time high.

Underlying revenue grew 10% to £1.15 billion, while organic growth of 9% was just shy of the consensus 9.5% forecast and recurring revenue growth of 11% was in line with expectations.

Underlying earnings per share came in at 18.2p, up 23% and in-line with forecasts.

CEO Steve Hare said demand for its accounting, HR and payroll products from small and mid-sized businesses ""remains robust"" and looking forward, ""despite the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty, I am confident that Sage's proven strategy, underpinned by continued investment, will enable us to deliver further efficient growth"".

The company expects organic revenue growth for the full year to be in line with the first half.

Analyst Damindu Jayaweera at Peel Hunt said this ""implies a slight nudge down"" to organic growth and the lack of an upgrade to this ""will likely hit sentiment today"".

8.15am: FTSE falls at open

The FTSE 100 more fell out of the gate rather than the expected spring higher, as some stocks went ex-dividend and the departure of easyJet's CEO and results from Sage Group seemed to disappoint.

In initial trades, the index dropped over 22 points to 8423, a fall of 0.27%.

Almost all of this is from the ex-dividend adjustments of 20.58 points as some big names including Shell, BP, GSK, Tesco, Unilever and Kingfisher PLC trade without the value of their next dividend payment, lowering their share prices temporarily.

Elsewhere, BT Group PLC (LSE:BT.A) rose 8.35% on the back of its mixed results, with earnings disappointing but dividend hiked and a cash flow ""inflection"" boasted.

EasyJet PLC (LSE:EZJ) fell 7.66% as its CEO heading for the departure gate overrides a pretty positive set of numbers.

Accounting software maker Sage Group PLC (LSE:SGE) also dropped 8.53% on the back of their results, while water company United Utilities Group PLC (LSE:UU.) leaked 0.94% lower.

7.54am: easyJet CEO set to disembark, H1 results look good

Budget airline easyJet PLC (LSE:EZJ) reported a smaller first-half loss than expected and announced that chief executive Johan Lundgren will step down early next year.

After seven years in charge, Lundgren will be succeeded by current finance chief Kenton Jarvis as CEO.

Jarvis, who joined the low-cost carrier in February 2021, will continue in the role of CFO during the transition period and a search for his successor ""will commence shortly"".

As for the results, revenue of £3.27 billion in the six months to end-March was slightly ahead of forecast (£3.24bn), while a headline pre-tax loss £350 million was down £61 million on a year ago and less than the £357 million than City analysts estimated.

Lundgren outlined a positive outlook for the full year, with third-quarter airline revenue per seat (RPS) expected to be ""slightly up"" on a year ago, with the Easter peak falling into March.

The EasyJet Holidays business is expected to deliver at least a 40% profit growth to £170 million-plus.

7.32am: BT earnings fall short, but dividend lifted

BT Group PLC (LSE:BT.A) results look a little shy of expectations, but the dividend has been nudged higher, which may override the rest of the numbers for many investors.

New boss Allison Kirkby said that as the telco has passed the point of peak investment into its full-fibre broadband rollout and achieved its £3 billion cost cutting programme a year ahead of schedule, ""we've now reached the inflection point on our long-term strategy"".

With the plan now to more than double free cash flow over the next five years, she says this means the dividend is being hiked, well a 3.9% increase, with a final dividend of 5.69p per share making a total of 8.0p for the past year.

Kirkby has also set a new £3 billion target of gross annualised cost savings to be reached by the end of March 2029.

As for the results for the year to March 2024, revenue of £20.8 billion was slightly below the average City analyst's forecast and adjusted EPS down 16% to 18.5p, versus the consensus EPS forecast of 19.2p.

On the outlook, revenue is guided to growth between 0% and 1% and EBITDA just above flat to around £8.2bn (forecasts are currently at around £8.3 billion).

7.11am: FTSE 100 to jump out of the gate

The FTSE 100 is heading for a smooth start again on Thursday, with another day full to the brim with corporate results, including BT Group, easyJet, Future, Sage Group, Premier Foods and United Utilities.

Spread-betters have called London's blue-chip benchmark 22 points higher ahead of the open, after the index notched another record intraday day high (8,474.41) and all-time closing high, up almost 18 points yesterday to 8,445.8.

Shares going ex-dividends will hold the Footsie back by around 20 points today though.

Overnight, the three major US stock indices all closed at new record highs too, as softer inflation report strengthened rate cut expectations.

The Nasdaq gained 1.4% and the S&P 500 added 1.2%, while the Dow Jones rose 0.9%.

As the meme stock rally of the last three days faded, GameStop shares retreated by 18% and AMC was down 20% at the closing bell.",proactiveinvestors.co.uk,news,Proactiveinvestors UK,Oliver Haill,0.03529411764705892,453559162,4,https://cdn.proactiveinvestors.com/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJwYS1jZG4iLCJrZXkiOiJ1cGxvYWRcL05ld3NcL0ltYWdlXC8yMDI0XzA1XC8yMDI0LTA1LTE2LTEzLTI2LTUyLWQ0MjJiNzc3ZDdhODlhN2JjZTE5M2ZhN2ZjOWQ5OGQ2LmpwZyIsImVkaXRzIjp7InJlc2l6ZSI6eyJ3aWR0aCI6MTIwMCwiaGVpZ2h0Ijo2MzAsImZpdCI6ImNvdmVyIn19fQ==,

Oil prices have slipped on Thursday as stockpiles across the world continue to grow.

Brent crude oil fell as much as 0.4% to US$82 per barrel, writing off much of the 0.5% gains experienced on Wednesday.

It comes after data revealed global oil stockpiles rose by 34.6 million barrels in March, according to the International Energy Agency.

Additional data from the Opec cartel identified that several countries which are supposed to reduce their oil outputs have actually increased production ahead of quotas.

Middle East supply chain concerns have also eased as hopes grow that the conflict in the region can move closer to a resolution.

12.23pm: Chevron to sell last assets in North Sea

Oil giant Chevron says it is preparing to sell the last of its assets in the North Sea, leaving the region for the first time in 55 years.

A sale will involve the group's divestment of its 19.4% stake in the Cair oilfield, the BP-operated site located to the west of the Shetland region.

It is the largest oilfield in the North Sea, producing an average of 120,000 barrels per day.

Chevron is currently preparing for its US$53 billion acquisition of rival Hess and has pencilled in the sale of US$20 billion worth of its assets to support the move.

12.05pm: Bitcoin holds onto yesterday's stellar gains

Bitcoin (BTC) soared more than 7.5% against the US on Wednesday, making for the strongest single-day session for the world's largest cryptocurrency in nearly two months.

The rally brought the BTC/USD pair to its strongest point in three weeks and the bulls have managed to hold onto these gains in early Thursday trades.

Bitcoin's solid performance follows a softer-than-expected consumer inflation read for April which ""lit a fire under equities once again"", said IG analysts.

Bret Kenwell, analyst at eToro, equated the consumer inflation print to a ""Goldilocks report"" for equities, with the optimist evidently filtering through to the cryptocurrency markets.

11.45am: Reality stars charged for promoting sham trading scheme

A horde of reality TV stars have been charged by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) for promoting an unauthorised foreign exchange trading scheme via Instagram.

Geordie Shore's Scott Timlin, multiple The Only Way is Essex stars and Love Island contestants such as Rebecca Gormley and Eva Zapico were all found to have been involved in the scheme.

The FCA charged Emmanuel Nwanze for running an unauthorised investment programme which saw advice given on buying and selling contracts for difference, which it was not permitted to do.

The 'fiinfluencers' were accused of promoting the Instagram account which issued the unauthorised advice and will stand before Westminster's Magistrate Court in June.

11.27am: Thames Water shareholder quits board

Thames Water's largest shareholder has withdrawn its representative from the embattled water provider's board as the company continues to struggle with its £18 billion debt pile.

Michael McNicholas, the managing director at Omers Infrastructure, the Canadian pension fund, confirmed he will no longer be a non-executive director for Thames Water.

Kemble, the parent company of Thames Water, is expected to see several other resignations in the coming days from board members who represent connected companies.

It comes after an equity funding round was shelved after Ofcom refused to allow the swingeing price increases that the shareholders demanded in return for their participation.

Oil giant Chevron says it is preparing to sell the last of its assets in the North Sea, leaving the region for the first time in 55 years.

A sale will involve the group's divestment of its 19.4% stake in the Cair oilfield, the BP-operated site located to the west of the Shetland region.

It is the largest oilfield in the North Sea, producing an average of 120,000 barrels per day.

Chevron is currently preparing for its US$53 billion acquisition of rival Hess and has pencilled in the sale of US$20 billion worth of its assets to support the move.

12.05pm: Bitcoin holds onto yesterday's stellar gains

Bitcoin (BTC) soared more than 7.5% against the US on Wednesday, making for the strongest single-day session for the world's largest cryptocurrency in nearly two months.

The rally brought the BTC/USD pair to its strongest point in three weeks and the bulls have managed to hold onto these gains in early Thursday trades.

Bitcoin's solid performance follows a softer-than-expected consumer inflation read for April which ""lit a fire under equities once again"", said IG analysts.

Bret Kenwell, analyst at eToro, equated the consumer inflation print to a ""Goldilocks report"" for equities, with the optimist evidently filtering through to the cryptocurrency markets.

11.45am: Reality stars charged for promoting sham trading scheme

A horde of reality TV stars have been charged by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) for promoting an unauthorised foreign exchange trading scheme via Instagram.

Geordie Shore's Scott Timlin, multiple The Only Way is Essex stars and Love Island contestants such as Rebecca Gormley and Eva Zapico were all found to have been involved in the scheme.

The FCA charged Emmanuel Nwanze for running an unauthorised investment programme which saw advice given on buying and selling contracts for difference, which it was not permitted to do.

The 'fiinfluencers' were accused of promoting the Instagram account which issued the unauthorised advice and will stand before Westminster's Magistrate Court in June.

11.27am: Thames Water shareholder quits board

Thames Water's largest shareholder has withdrawn its representative from the embattled water provider's board as the company continues to struggle with its £18 billion debt pile.

Michael McNicholas, the managing director at Omers Infrastructure, the Canadian pension fund, confirmed he will no longer be a non-executive director for Thames Water.

Kemble, the parent company of Thames Water, is expected to see several other resignations in the coming days from board members who represent connected companies.

It comes after an equity funding round was shelved after Ofcom refused to allow the swingeing price increases that the shareholders demanded in return for their participation.

11am: Japan economy shrinks, but weightloss drugs boost Denmark GDP

Some gross domestic product figures were reported today for two notable economics.

Japan's economy shrank faster than expected in the first quarter, with GDP contracting 2% compared to the same quarter last year, worse than the 1.5% drop in forecast.

Compared to the fourth quarter, GDP was down 0.5%, as households and companies cut back.

Denmark meanwhile nearly doubled its growth forecast for this year to 2.7% thanks to weight-loss drugmaker Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) boosting the economy.

The economy ministry in Copenhagen raised its forecast from 1.4% in December as Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) ramps up production of its blockbuster drug, which is branded Ozempic for diabetes and Wegovy for weight loss, resulting in forecast export growth of 7% from 4.2% previously.

""It's an absolute rarity that the government makes such a significant upward adjustment of the forecast,"" Tore Stramer, chief economist at the Danish Chamber of Commerce, told media.

10.43am: European markets subdued, but Roche jumps on weightloss drug news

The FTSE 100 is not the only European benchmark in the red this morning, not able to sustain the upbeat vibes from the record setting session yesterday.

While London's leading index is down 0.33%, Germany's DAX has dropped 0.22%, France's CAC 40 is 0.54% lower and Spain's IBEX 35 has slipped 0.23%.

One exception is Italy's FTSE MIB, up 0.11%, led by banks BPER and Banca Monte Paschi Siena, with Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) in the green too.

The wider Euro Stoxx 600 index is down 0.17% and the blue-chip Euro Stoxx 50 is down 0.38%.

""After a sparkling session on Wall Street last night amid hopes that the latest inflation data raises the chances of a US interest rate cut, European markets didn't share the joy,"" says Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.

Swiss drug giant Roche is under the Mould microscope, having jumped 4%.

""Weight-loss drugs remain a hot topic and investors are latching on to any positive news in the broader space. Roche is the latest name to turn heads after reporting positive early-stage trial data for an obesity drug. Big share price gains have already been recorded with weight-loss champions Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) and Eli Lilly so investors are keen to find new ways to play the theme.""

10.15am: Royal Mail - analysts sceptical, government 'looking closely'

After Royal Mail owner International Distributions Services PLC (LSE:IDS) received a revised takeover proposal from 'Czech Sphinx' Daniel Kretinsky's EP Group yesterday, some analysts are sceptical that the deal will go through.

As the IDS board has indicated it is minded to recommend an offer at this level, ""it appears the remaining obstacles to a board recommendation are the undertakings and contractual commitments required to try to secure government approval"", says analyst Gerald Khoo at Liberum Capital.

""We remain highly sceptical on the prospects of government clearance, especially if it falls to a potential future Labour government to decide,"" says Khoo...read more here.

But government ministers do not plan to try and block the deal, reports from the Daily Mail have revealed.

IDs shares are up 2% this morning, 12% over the week.

9.40am: Mixed weekly economic data from ONS

The Office for National Statistics has released its spangly new weekly economic activity and social change data, which show mixed activity.

UK spending on credit and debit cards was down 1% compared with the previous week, while UK retail footfall was broadly unchanged.

The week to 5 May saw higher average fuel prices year-on-year for the second consecutive week at 1%.

The total number of online job adverts last Friday, 10 May, was broadly unchanged from the level in the previous week, but was 18% lower than in the equivalent week of 2023, according to data supplied by Adzuna.

On inflation, compared with the previous calendar month, 27% of businesses reported a rise in the price of goods and services that they bought in April, while 13% reported an increase in the price of goods and services they sold.

The data also includes electricity system prices and flight numbers.

9.19am: UK rally 'has plenty further to go'

Another view from the City, this time Panmure Gordon's chief economist Simon French, who reckons the UK rally has the potential to go on a lot longer.

""A series of all-time highs for the FTSE100 index - twelve closing highs in the last month which is a record since the index was launched in 1984 - have led to a flurry of questions on where this has left UK equity market valuations,"" he says in a note to clients this morning.

""The good news for those worrying they have missed the boat is that all-time highs in indices tell us very little about underlying valuations.

""UK valuations remain deeply subdued compared to their historic norms on both a relative and absolute basis. There has been a slight narrowing from the 19% discount we estimated in Q4 2023, with that discount closing to 17%.""

However, French says, ""there is still plenty to go for"", particularly further down the spectrum among the UK's mid-caps and small caps.

We'll have more of his thoughts in a separate story soon.

9.05am: Some market commentary

Let's hear what some market commentators think of the action so far.

""European markets have opened mixed with the DAX trading flat while the FTSE 100 is in the red,"" says Victoria Scholar, head of investment at Interactive Investor, noting the drag from Sage and easyJet plus many big stocks going ex-dividend today.

BT is on track for its biggest one-day gain since November 2021, she notes, with free cash flow beating analysts' expectations and new upbeat guidance for significantly further increases.

""BT struck a positive tone towards the broadband market saying it will recover over the medium term. BT also said it enjoyed strong Openreach customer demand for FTTP (fibre to the premises) in the fourth quarter.

""Allison Kirkby took to the helm as CEO in February 2024 and appears to be trying to win over shareholders, attempting to boost its struggling share price with a better-than-expected free cash flow performance, a focus on cost savings, and by increasing the company's dividend payout.

""She's been facing a tough battle since a lot of major investors have been shorting the stock - investors placed a record £300m bet against BT, according to an FT report this week, which will be getting squeezed today,"" Scholar adds.

Sophie Lund-Yates, lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says: ""The FTSE 100 has shed points after setting another record on Wednesday. The investor confidence boost from Wednesday's encouraging inflation data in the US is being partially offset by wider thoughts on a busy day for company earnings.

""The overall mood remains bright though, with losses relatively minimal. That's thanks to that inflation data - while the path to disinflation was never going to be without bumps, this latest indicator suggests things are moving in favour of Federal Reserve interest rate cuts this year - albeit this can change at short notice.""

One such piece of news is that easyJet's CEO is stepping down after seven years in the captain's seat.

""This is a natural time for Lundgren to step away, with a strong tenure under his belt and the post-Covid heavy lifting complete,"" says Lund-Yates, also pointing to airline booking momentum ""coming off the boil slightly, but overall, the outlook looks robust"".

8.53am: Blue-chips down, mid-caps up

While the Footsie is on its heels, down 28 points or 0.33%, its mid-cap sibling is on the front foot.

The FTSE 250 is up 27 points or 0.13% at 20,802.80

Driving the mid-cap index higher are three double-digit share price gains at Future, Watches of Switzerland and Auction Technology Group.

Future PLC (LSE:FUTR) is up 18.3% (good news for my Christmas tip!) as while first-half revenue declined 2% organically or 3% on a reported basis, the online and magazine publishing company returned to 3% organic growth in the second quarter.

Watches of Switzerland Group PLC (LSE:WOSG) is up 15% after a year-end trading update that reveals the fourth quarter completed a solid end to the year in the US and a good showing in jewellery and Rolex pre-owned business.

FY25 guidance from WoS looks encouraging, ahead of existing consensus.

Auction Technology Group PLC (LSE:ATG) was bid 11% higher as seven out of its eight marketplaces performed well.

8.37am: Sage numbers good but not good enough

First-half numbers from The Sage Group PLC (LSE:SGE) seemed pretty much in line with expectations but the shares are down over 8%, though this might reflect overlying optimistic expectations, having risen almost 50% over the past year and recently hit an all-time high.

Underlying revenue grew 10% to £1.15 billion, while organic growth of 9% was just shy of the consensus 9.5% forecast and recurring revenue growth of 11% was in line with expectations.

Underlying earnings per share came in at 18.2p, up 23% and in-line with forecasts.

CEO Steve Hare said demand for its accounting, HR and payroll products from small and mid-sized businesses ""remains robust"" and looking forward, ""despite the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty, I am confident that Sage's proven strategy, underpinned by continued investment, will enable us to deliver further efficient growth"".

The company expects organic revenue growth for the full year to be in line with the first half.

Analyst Damindu Jayaweera at Peel Hunt said this ""implies a slight nudge down"" to organic growth and the lack of an upgrade to this ""will likely hit sentiment today"".

8.15am: FTSE falls at open

The FTSE 100 more fell out of the gate rather than the expected spring higher, as some stocks went ex-dividend and the departure of easyJet's CEO and results from Sage Group seemed to disappoint.

In initial trades, the index dropped over 22 points to 8423, a fall of 0.27%.

Almost all of this is from the ex-dividend adjustments of 20.58 points as some big names including Shell, BP, GSK, Tesco, Unilever and Kingfisher PLC trade without the value of their next dividend payment, lowering their share prices temporarily.

Elsewhere, BT Group PLC (LSE:BT.A) rose 8.35% on the back of its mixed results, with earnings disappointing but dividend hiked and a cash flow ""inflection"" boasted.

EasyJet PLC (LSE:EZJ) fell 7.66% as its CEO heading for the departure gate overrides a pretty positive set of numbers.

Accounting software maker Sage Group PLC (LSE:SGE) also dropped 8.53% on the back of their results, while water company United Utilities Group PLC (LSE:UU.) leaked 0.94% lower.

7.54am: easyJet CEO set to disembark, H1 results look good

Budget airline easyJet PLC (LSE:EZJ) reported a smaller first-half loss than expected and announced that chief executive Johan Lundgren will step down early next year.

After seven years in charge, Lundgren will be succeeded by current finance chief Kenton Jarvis as CEO.

Jarvis, who joined the low-cost carrier in February 2021, will continue in the role of CFO during the transition period and a search for his successor ""will commence shortly"".

As for the results, revenue of £3.27 billion in the six months to end-March was slightly ahead of forecast (£3.24bn), while a headline pre-tax loss £350 million was down £61 million on a year ago and less than the £357 million than City analysts estimated.

Lundgren outlined a positive outlook for the full year, with third-quarter airline revenue per seat (RPS) expected to be ""slightly up"" on a year ago, with the Easter peak falling into March.

The EasyJet Holidays business is expected to deliver at least a 40% profit growth to £170 million-plus.

7.32am: BT earnings fall short, but dividend lifted

BT Group PLC (LSE:BT.A) results look a little shy of expectations, but the dividend has been nudged higher, which may override the rest of the numbers for many investors.

New boss Allison Kirkby said that as the telco has passed the point of peak investment into its full-fibre broadband rollout and achieved its £3 billion cost cutting programme a year ahead of schedule, ""we've now reached the inflection point on our long-term strategy"".

With the plan now to more than double free cash flow over the next five years, she says this means the dividend is being hiked, well a 3.9% increase, with a final dividend of 5.69p per share making a total of 8.0p for the past year.

Kirkby has also set a new £3 billion target of gross annualised cost savings to be reached by the end of March 2029.

As for the results for the year to March 2024, revenue of £20.8 billion was slightly below the average City analyst's forecast and adjusted EPS down 16% to 18.5p, versus the consensus EPS forecast of 19.2p.

On the outlook, revenue is guided to growth between 0% and 1% and EBITDA just above flat to around £8.2bn (forecasts are currently at around £8.3 billion).

7.11am: FTSE 100 to jump out of the gate

The FTSE 100 is heading for a smooth start again on Thursday, with another day full to the brim with corporate results, including BT Group, easyJet, Future, Sage Group, Premier Foods and United Utilities.

Spread-betters have called London's blue-chip benchmark 22 points higher ahead of the open, after the index notched another record intraday day high (8,474.41) and all-time closing high, up almost 18 points yesterday to 8,445.8.

Shares going ex-dividends will hold the Footsie back by around 20 points today though.

As per the agreement, Siemens Energy will deliver transformers and switchgears for high-voltage substations to expand the electricity grid in the country.

The agreement focuses on the Western part of Denmark, where around 50 new or reinforced 150 kV high-voltage substations are planned to be built or expanded over the next 8 years. The new substations will be automated and include grid technologies from Siemens Energy.

The first four years of the agreement is estimated to be worth up to 800 million euros to boost the energy transition.

With Denmark aiming to reach a target of net zero emissions by 2045 through renewable energy, the race is on to decarbonize the Danish grid.

The transportation sector is therefore central to Denmark's goal of a 70% overall reduction in emissions by 2030.

The most sustainable mode of transportation is still cycling and walking or transporting people and goods around the world using green power. Unlike biofuels, for example, green power can be scaled sustainably. However, wind and solar power are associated with periods of non-production when the wind doesn't blow and the sun doesn't shine, and both forms of energy require the expansion of the electricity infrastructure.

Electrification has a particularly large potential in road transportation, i.e. so that all cars, vans and trucks run primarily on electric batteries. In addition, the electric engine is significantly more energy efficient than an internal combustion engine and therefore consumes less energy in the form of electricity than an equivalent car or truck running on fossil fuels.

The EU has set the framework for switching to electricity in road transportation by ensuring charging infrastructure throughout Europe and setting CO2 requirements for new vehicles.",dtu.dk,news,https://www.dtu.dk,,0.1843137254901961,453550714,7,https://www.dtu.dk/english/-/media/dtudk/nyheder/temaer/groen-transport/metro-near-oerestad-copenhagen.png,

Lisa Doughten, Director of the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs' Financing and Partnerships Division, speaking on behalf of Martin Griffiths, Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, said that her Office recorded over 700 civilian casualties across Ukraine in April, including 129 deaths, a significant increase from March. Since 22 March, there have been five waves of attacks on the country's energy infrastructure, particularly in Kharkiv and Dnipro regions, causing rolling power outages and affecting millions nationwide. Moreover, attacks on ports are threatening their ability to export grain at a time of rising food insecurity.

Despite the spike in hostilities and the related risks, ""the UN and its humanitarian partners are doing everything we can to reach people in need of support"", she said. From the beginning of January until the end of March, 3.6 million people across the country received some form of assistance, and so far this year, 12 inter-agency convoys have delivered vital supplies to 20,000 people in front-line areas. Yet reaching civilians in areas of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia -- currently under Moscow's occupation -- remains a challenge, she observed, urging all parties to facilitate rapid, unimpeded humanitarian relief to the 1.5 million people who require life-saving assistance.

Caitlin Howarth, Director of the Conflict Observatory at the Yale Humanitarian Research Lab, said that 223 damage events across 23 of Ukraine's 24 oblasts were identified between 1 October 2022 and 30 April 2023. ""That's a rate of over 7 damage events identified per week, with peak impact timed for the height of winter,"" she stated, noting that these ""strikes of retribution"" -- as described by Russian Federation politicians -- mean extended periods without water, productivity lost, education fragmented and ""blackouts that last longer than the emergency batteries on life-saving health-care equipment"".

Against this backdrop, she asserted: ""As Russia's officials have comprehensively planned and executed their destruction of Ukraine's critical infrastructure, so should the international community systematically counteract this devastation."" She called on it to ""target the missiles"" through enforced sanctions; ""prepare for emergency"" by mobilizing resources today to ensure civilian survival this winter; and ""let Russia pay"" by releasing Russian Federation assets seized under global sanctions to fund these emergency preparations. ""Above all else, do not underestimate the scale of this threat,"" she stressed.

In the ensuing discussion, many delegates condemned Moscow's massive attacks on Ukraine's civilian population and infrastructure, noting that the worrying developments in Kharkiv Oblast demonstrate the humanitarian impact of the intensified hostilities. Several -- among them the representative of Denmark, also speaking for Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden -- expressed support for the upcoming first peace summit on Ukraine, which will take place in Switzerland on 15-16 June.

The representative of France observed that Moscow's attacks on civilian populations and infrastructure may constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity for which no impunity must be allowed. He welcomed the International Criminal Court's arrest warrants issued on 5 March 2024 against senior officials of the Russian Air Force and the Russian Black Sea Fleet for the campaign of missile strikes against Ukrainian civilian energy infrastructure.

Guyana's speaker expressed particular concern about the continuing attacks on the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, stating: ""This cannot and must not continue"".

Calling for an immediate halt to ""this destructive campaign against Ukraine's energy infrastructure,"" the United Kingdom's representative said that Moscow aims to terrorize civilians, obstruct livelihoods and businesses, and ultimately break down Ukraine's resolve. However, ""Ukrainians will not allow Russia to do that"", she said. She reiterated London's commitment of $55 million to the Energy Community's Ukraine Energy Support Fund, and over $214 million in overall support to the country's energy sector.

Echoing her sentiment, the United States' delegate recalled that his country recently announced $1 billion in new assistance for Ukraine, which includes urgently needed air-defence equipment. And since February 2022, Washington, D.C., has provided nearly $2.9 billion in aid to Ukraine and its neighbours -- including life-saving support for the 3.4 million people that remain internally displaced and the nearly 6.5 million refugees. The speaker for Sierra Leone called for fully funding the 2024 humanitarian response plan for Ukraine, while the representative of the European Union, in its capacity as observer, pledged that ""the EU will continue to support Ukraine for as long as it takes.""

The speaker for Poland said that the purpose of Moscow's barbaric actions is clear: to destroy the lives of Ukrainian people and make large parts of Ukraine uninhabitable. In this context, he voiced particular concern over the ongoing deportations and transfers of Ukrainian children and their forced ""Russification"". Slovenia's delegate noted the death rate of children jumped nearly 40 per cent in the first quarter of 2024, compared to the same period last year.

For his part, the Russian Federation's representative pointed to Western countries' failure to condemn the latest terrorist attack on 12 May, when the peaceful Russian city of Belgorod once again was targeted by a large-scale missile strike, killing 15 civilians. Western countries continue to provide long-range weapons to the Kyiv junta in ""the illusory hope of inflicting a strategic defeat upon the Russian Federation"". However, this will only prolong the Kyiv regime and cost the lives of tens -- if not hundreds -- of thousands of ordinary Ukrainians.

Ukraine's delegate said that Moscow launched a new offensive on 10 May, targeting the northern Kharkiv region with the immediate aim of taking the city of Vovchansk. While Ukrainian forces are holding the line to prevent Russian troops from advancing to Kharkiv -- the second-largest Ukrainian city -- he said that heavy defensive battles are under way, and the situation remains extremely dangerous for local civilians. Noting that Ukraine is now ""the only country in the world being attacked by ballistic and cruise missiles almost daily,"" he stated: ""The more active the world is now in restoring a comprehensive, just and lasting peace for Ukraine, the more likely it is that others in the world will not become the victims of similar aggression.""

LISA DOUGHTEN, Director, Financing and Partnerships Division, Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, speaking on behalf of Martin Griffiths, Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, said that her Office recorded over 700 civilian casualties across Ukraine in April, including 129 deaths. While 90 per cent of the casualties occurred in Ukrainian-controlled territory, strikes have also been reported inside the Russian Federation, including on Sunday in the Belgorod region, reportedly causing several deaths and damage to residential homes. Attacks on civilian infrastructure across Ukraine have intensified. ""Since 22 March 2024, the UN and its partners have seen five waves of attacks directed against the Ukraine's energy infrastructure,"" she said. Kharkiv and Dnipro regions are particularly affected. The country's Energy Ministry reported that up to 250,000 residents have experienced rolling power outages in Kharkiv and ongoing restrictions in Dnipro since March.

Noting ""the stark impact of these power cuts on the most vulnerable"", she said that they have temporarily left millions of households across the country with no power, water or gas needed for cooking, heating and hygiene. ""Children who rely on online schooling are not able to learn. Older persons with mobility impairments, persons with disabilities who use wheelchairs or other assistive devices, and mothers with small children are unable to leave multi-story apartment buildings to access food and medical support,"" she said. She cited a new pattern of attacks on railway infrastructure in the east and south -- with OHCHR recording 10 such attacks in Government-controlled territory in April alone. Also concerning are attacks on factories and production plants, limiting the availability of locally procured humanitarian goods, and on port infrastructure, threatening their ability to export grain and other agricultural commodities at a time of rising food insecurity.

Reported attacks damaging energy infrastructure and oil refineries in the Russian Federation ""risk enflaming the war further and worsening its humanitarian impacts"", she said. ""The intensification in hostilities is making the delivery of humanitarian assistance all the more dangerous. Nevertheless, the UN and its humanitarian partners are doing everything we can to reach people in need of support, despite the enormous risks,"" she said. From the beginning of January until the end of March, 3.6 million people across the country received some form of humanitarian assistance, and so far this year 12 inter-agency convoys have delivered vital supplies to 20,000 people in front-line areas. Assistance has also included the delivery of health-care services to nearly 860,000 people, and emergency water supplies for over 1.2 million people. Humanitarian protection activities have been expanded, including gender-based violence support for people newly displaced by hostilities.

Commending Ukraine's Government for the extra support it has announced for survivors of conflict-related sexual violence -- in the form of financial reparations and medical and psychological assistance -- she said donors have so far given $669 million, 22 per cent, of the $3.1 billion needed under the Ukraine Humanitarian Needs and Response Plan. ""Another challenge remains reaching civilians in areas of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia that are currently under the occupation of the Russian Federation,"" she observed, voicing concern over the estimated 1.5 million people requiring life-saving assistance there and urging all parties to allow and facilitate the rapid, unimpeded humanitarian relief. This war has caused the death and injury of tens of thousands of people in Ukraine, displaced millions, caused immense suffering and left more than 14 million people -- 40 per cent of the population -- in need of humanitarian assistance, she said, calling on the Council ""to seek an end to it"".

CAITLIN HOWARTH, Director of the Conflict Observatory at the Yale Humanitarian Research Lab, recalling recent missile strikes on three thermal plants and two hydroelectric power plants in Ukraine, noted that -- by some counts -- ""near every single power plant"" has been targeted. Citing a report released by her Lab on 29 February 2024 documenting verified damage to Ukraine's power-generation-and-transmission infrastructure that occurred between 1 October 2022 and 30 April 2023, she said that 223 damage events across 23 of Ukraine's 24 oblasts were identified. She noted: ""That's a rate of over 7 damage events identified per week, with peak impact timed for the height of winter."" On 8 May 2024, almost 12 Ukrainian power facilities were reportedly struck in a single day and, since March 2024, successful targeting of power-generation facilities has further slashed Ukraine's capacity. ""Each hit compounds the problem,"" she observed.

She went on to point out that Russian Federation officials have clearly stated their objectives for targeting Ukraine's energy infrastructure: first, to advance Moscow's military objectives; second, to retaliate for Ukraine's purported actions; and third, to inflict harm on civilians to compel Kyiv to submit to negotiations favourable to Moscow. She stressed that, while the first justification ""may"" be lawful under the law of war, the other two likely violate international humanitarian law. Further, while the Lab did not assess the degree of dual-use afforded by the energy infrastructure documented in its report, the law of armed conflict prohibits attacks on both civilian and military targets if the attack causes excessive civilian casualties, damage to civilian objects or a combination of these relative to any concrete or direct military advantage anticipated. Recalling a definition of Moscow's campaign by a State Duma member -- that it is aimed against Ukraine's ""whole energy infrastructure"" -- she emphasized: ""A comprehensive campaign, by its own definition, defies proportionality.""

She noted further comments by Russian Federation politicians that ""strikes of retribution"" on Ukraine's power infrastructure will make Ukrainians ""sit there without gas and without electricity and without everything"". Asking and answering what this means, she said it means extended periods without water, productivity lost, education fragmented and ""blackouts that last longer than the emergency batteries on life-saving health-care equipment"". Against that backdrop, she urged: ""As Russia's officials have comprehensively planned and executed their destruction of Ukraine's critical infrastructure, so should the international community systematically counteract this devastation."" To this end, she called on the international community to ""target the missiles"" through enforced sanctions; ""prepare for emergency"" by mobilizing resources today to ensure civilian survival this winter; and ""let Russia pay"" by releasing Russian Federation assets seized under global sanctions to fund these emergency preparations. ""Above all else, do not underestimate the scale of this threat,"" she underscored.

Statements

The representative of France said that the Russian Federation has shown no concern about its obligation to minimize injury to civilians and damage to civilian objects. These practices may constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity for which no impunity must be allowed. The International Criminal Court's arrest warrants issued on 5 March 2024 against senior officials of the Russian Air Force and the Russian Black Sea Fleet for the campaign of missile strikes against Ukrainian civilian energy infrastructure are a decisive step. He also welcomed the renewal of the mandate of the Human Rights Council's Independent Commission of Inquiry, which documents indiscriminate attacks against Ukraine's populations and critical infrastructure. He noted that mitigating the humanitarian consequences of this war by strengthening the resilience of strategic infrastructure will be a key topic at the peace conference hosted by Switzerland in June.

The representative of Ecuador expressed concern over the continued suffering in Ukraine and risk to regional and global instability. ""The statistics are alarming,"" he said, citing increased intensity and frequency of attacks against essential infrastructure, the destruction of hospitals and schools, and attacks disabling several energy facilities this month, affecting millions of people's access to electricity and clean water. The impact of attacks in the Kharkiv region has been equally devastating, with numerous civilian casualties and a significant increase in internal displacement. Condemning these attacks, he declared: ""International humanitarian law is explicit in its prohibition of attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure."" The warring parties must adhere strictly to the principles of proportionality, distinction and precaution to avoid escalating this cycle of suffering.

The representative of Guyana sounded alarm over the unrelenting attacks on residential buildings, schools, medical and energy facilities and grain ports since the start of the war. ""These attacks were often unrelated to frontline engagement and appeared to have little regard for the requirement of proportionality and military necessity,"" she observed. She noted the international community continues to witness large-scale coordinated attacks on civilian infrastructure, including dozens of energy facilities, resulting in disrupted access to electricity and water supply for millions of people in multiple locations. They are not only causing incidental civilian harm through the disruption of access to critical services but also resulting in loss of civilian lives and injury to those in near-to-target sites. There have also been attacks on the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, despite the many calls to end the attacks on or near the site, she cautioned, stating: ""This cannot and must not continue"".

The representative of Japan expressed regret that the Council heard another briefing ""about the many civilian casualties caused by the clear violation of the UN Charter by a permanent member of the Security Council"". Underscoring that attacks against civilian populations and infrastructure are ""clearly prohibited"" under international law, he also condemned Pyongyang's export and Moscow's procurement of ballistic missiles -- as well as the latter's use of these missiles against Ukraine. This transfer -- a clear violation of relevant Council resolutions -- supports Moscow's war of aggression and increases the suffering of the Ukrainian people, he stressed, adding: ""We continue to monitor closely what North Korea gains in return."" He also detailed his country's support of Ukraine's energy infrastructure, which includes the provision of two large autotransformers, six mobile-power-supply vehicles and five advanced gas turbines. ""Japan remains committed to supporting the Ukrainian people through bolstering the electricity and heating supplies in Ukraine,"" he said.

The representative of Algeria expressed grave concern about the destruction of civilian infrastructure, including energy and power plants. In addition, the worsening tensions and pursuit of hostilities have had dangerous repercussions on the international arena. He reiterated an appeal for diplomatic efforts to avoid a further humanitarian crisis and address human suffering without distinction. Civilians must be protected in line with the UN Charter and international law, including international humanitarian law. He called on all parties to set aside the mindset of confrontation and find what is needed to restore comprehensive and constructive dialogue.

The representative of the United Kingdom observed that this spring, the Russian Federation has targeted power plants, electricity sub-stations and gas storage facilities across Ukraine. Calling for an immediate halt to ""this destructive campaign against Ukraine's energy infrastructure,"" she said that millions of people already face disruption to power, heating and water supply. ""These attacks are making an appalling humanitarian situation even worse,"" she said, noting that this is especially the case for frontline communities, as the attacks and lack of power hamper humanitarian partners' communications and movements. This pattern of aggression continues in an attempt to terrorize civilians, obstruct livelihoods and businesses, and ultimately break down Ukraine's resolve; however, she stated, ""Ukrainians will not allow Russia to do that"". London has committed $55 million to the Energy Community's Ukraine Energy Support Fund and over $214 million in overall support to the energy sector in Ukraine, she added.

The representative of the United States said that the Russian Federation's large-scale attacks on Ukrainian cities and infrastructure are a ""clear escalation"" that threaten critical services. ""Next week, this Council will be subjected to yet another meeting where Russia will claim that Western arms are to blame for prolonging the war it started,"" he noted, urging that Moscow ""need only look in the mirror"" to understand why more than 50 countries provided support to Ukraine's forces. In April 2024, the United States announced $1 billion in new assistance for Ukraine, which includes urgently needed air-defence equipment. Further, since February 2022, the United States has provided nearly $2.9 billion in humanitarian assistance to Ukraine and its neighbours -- including life-saving support for the 3.4 million that remain internally displaced and the nearly 6.5 million refugees. He added that newly approved supplemental funding will help maintain the humanitarian response amidst ""unabated"" attacks on civilian populations and infrastructure.

The representative of the Russian Federation said that if Western colleagues were striving to convey to the international community at least ""an iota of the truth"" about what's happening in Ukraine, then they would not be sweeping it under the rug. Rather, they would condemn the latest terrorist attack on 12 May, when the peaceful Russian city of Belgorod once again was targeted by a large-scale missile strike. A residential building was partially destroyed by a missile launched from Ukrainian-controlled territory, killing 15 civilians. He also highlighted the culpability of Western countries that continue to provide long-range weapons to the Kyiv junta in ""the illusory hope of inflicting a strategic defeat upon the Russian Federation.""

On 20 May, the Council will discuss these destructive actions of North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) countries. In early May, the United Kingdom's Foreign Minister, David Cameron, made a revelatory statement that the weapons provided by London could be used to carry out strikes against Russian territories, including areas beyond the special military operations' confines. The formulas or plans advanced by the Ukrainian henchman and his Western sponsors are so divorced from reality. Any discussion on them will become a pure loss of time, and ""you will become complicit"" in prolonging the Kyiv regime, with the cost of this being tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of the lives of ordinary Ukrainians.

The representative of Slovenia noted that, since early April, over 1,000 drone and missile attacks were recorded across Ukraine, forcing thousands to flee as their homes are being destroyed. She noted a reported 140 educational facilities were destroyed or damaged in attacks across the country in 2024 alone. And according to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the death rate of children jumped nearly 40 per cent in the first quarter of 2024, compared to the same period last year. She further condemned Moscow's use of cluster munitions in its bombardment of Odessa in late April, stressing that ""using such weapons in a densely populated area is against all rules of international humanitarian law"". ""These attacks seek to impair Ukraine's economy and are obviously not directed against military targets. This is a clear violation of international humanitarian law and it needs to stop now,"" she said, adding: ""Ukrainian civilians have suffered too long. We call on Russia to stop with its subversive actions and give peace a chance.""

The representative of Sierra Leone expressed concern that attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure have resulted in major disruptions of essential services, such as electricity, water and gas to medical facilities, manufacturing industries and places of work for ""a significant portion of the population"". This slows production and reduces economic activity, and he also expressed alarm over the impact on health-care facilities -- including those with incubators and other life-saving devices. On that, he noted that such facilities ""in some cases had to resort to the use of batteries that ran out before the re-establishment of power -- putting the lives of many at risk"". Given the devastating impact of the conflict on the civilian population, he called on the parties involved to adhere to their obligations under international law to protect civilian populations and infrastructure -- including energy facilities. He also called for the full funding of the 2024 humanitarian response plan for Ukraine.

The representative of Malta noted the Russian Federation's aerial assaults against Ukrainian power generation and transmission facilities in several regions last week. This deadly trend encompasses daily drone, missile, rocket and artillery attacks in Kharkiv, Odesa, Kherson, Dnipropetrovsk and Donetsk regions -- ""yet another example of Russia's disregard for human life."" As of today, more than 800 heat supply facilities have been destroyed or damaged and the attacks have caused more than $1 billion worth of damage to the energy sector, she said, expressing full support for the important work undertaken by the Register of Damage Caused by the Aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine.

The representative of Switzerland condemned the massive attacks on the civilian population and infrastructure across Ukraine, which have killed and injured civilians in populated areas. Last week alone, several children were injured, and schools and a hospital were damaged, she observed, stating: ""As Ukraine fights for its future, all those who can build it -- including children -- must be protected."" Noting an increase in attacks on critical energy infrastructures, she said that, in total, nine regions across Ukraine -- including those far from the front lines -- have experienced disruptions to their electricity supply in the past week. In addition, the situation around the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant remains worrying. Determined to do everything in its power to contribute to a just and lasting peace in Ukraine, Switzerland will host the first High-Level Summit for Peace in Ukraine on 15 and 16 June, she said, stressing the need ""to define together a road map on how to involve both sides in a future peace process"".

The representative of the Republic of Korea underscored that Moscow's attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure are unacceptable, as targeting such infrastructure violates international humanitarian law. He further stressed that, today, critical energy infrastructure ""holds far more significance in people's daily lives than decades ago"" when such law was created. In addition to hindering millions of Ukrainians' access to electricity in the short-term, the destruction of energy infrastructure has long-enduring impacts on the humanitarian situation in that country. A recent report by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) highlights a domino effect where such destruction leads to the disruption of other basic services such as water and sanitation. Noting that the lack of such services can impair the operation of hospitals and the viability of food production -- leading to the spread of disease, death and displacement -- he underscored that the Russian Federation's illegal invasion ""must end now to save lives and restore humanity"".

The representative of China said that his country is neither the creator of the Ukraine crisis nor a party to it. It has long campaigned for peace and a political settlement. The sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries should be respected. At the same time, the legitimate security concerns of all countries should be taken seriously. In his recent visits to France, Serbia and Hungary, President Xi Jinping had an in-depth exchange of views with European leaders on the Ukraine crisis. China and Europe should work together to oppose the spillover and escalation of the fighting, create conditions for peace talks, and safeguard international energy, food security and the stability of the global supply chain. His country and France also agreed to seize the Paris Olympics as an opportunity to advocate a worldwide ceasefire.

The representative of Mozambique, Council President for May, spoke in his national capacity to highlight the devastating implications of the war in Ukraine for the humanitarian situation in the country. Noting that ""the prospects for a mutually accepted solution remain elusive,"" mainly due to the conflicting parties' firm belief in the primacy of military and zero-sum game logic at the expense of a cooperative approach, he underscored that the Council's consistent calls for the immediate cessation of hostilities ""can no longer be ignored"". Against this backdrop, he stressed the need to ensure the protection of civilians and to facilitate full, safe, rapid and unhindered access for humanitarian personnel.

The representative of Ukraine reported that the Russian Federation launched a new offensive on 10 May, targeting the northern Kharkiv region with the immediate aim of taking the city of Vovchansk. While Ukrainian forces are holding the line to prevent Moscow's troops from advancing to Kharkiv - the second-largest Ukrainian city -- he said that heavy defensive battles are under way and the situation remains extremely dangerous for local civilians. He added: ""Russian forces persist in razing Ukrainian towns to the ground without regard for the local population's suffering, with Vovchansk becoming the latest victim -- akin to Bakhmut or Maryinka."" Detailing numerous attacks committed by ""a country that called itself a friend of the UN Charter"", he noted that Ukraine is now ""the only country in the world being attacked by ballistic and cruise missiles almost daily"". Major cities have borne the brunt of these assaults, with devastating consequences.

""All the above crimes cannot be committed perpetually,"" he stressed, noting that a summit on peace in Ukraine will take place in Switzerland on 15-16 June. While stating that ""we have invited all peace-loving nations, and each nation can really bring peace closer"", he said that -- meanwhile -- Moscow intensifies its lies about ""a so-called peace deal that Ukraine and Russia were allegedly close to in spring 2022"". However, it is the Russian Federation President who has been ruining peace in Ukraine for more than a decade -- by occupying Crimea and parts of the Donbas in 2014, by obstructing the Minsk and Normandy peace processes, by launching a full-scale war of aggression and then by refusing to end it. Urging nations to attend the peace summit, he said: ""The more active the world is now in restoring a comprehensive, just and lasting peace for Ukraine, the more likely it is that others in the world will not become the victims of similar aggression.""

The representative of Germany said that the Russian Federation is attacking the foundation of the United Nations and global peace and security. As a nuclear State, it is invading its neighbour that has renounced nuclear weapons. By employing arms imported from Iran and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, it defies Security Council resolutions. To shield its illegal activities, it is dismantling instruments of this Council, such as the Panel of Experts for sanctions against Pyongyang. His country supports Ukraine with political, humanitarian and military means. Air defence systems supplied by Germany are actively helping to protect Ukrainian cities. Berlin has also invested in humanitarian relief efforts. The upcoming peace summit in Switzerland offers a unique platform. However, a just and lasting way out is only possible if Moscow renounces its objective of conquest and annexation, he stressed.

The representative of Estonia, also speaking on behalf of Latvia and Lithuania, said that every month, the Russian Federation uses over 130 types of missiles -- including those provided by Pyongyang -- over 320 Shahed drones and around 900 guided aerial bombs against Ukraine. As of late, chemical weapons can also be added to that list. ""These weapons are systematically used to kill and maim Ukrainian civilians, destroy homes, schools, hospitals and places of cultural heritage, attack food storage facilities and wipe out Ukrainian energy infrastructure,"" he stated. In total, Moscow's bombs have destroyed over 80 per cent of Ukrainian thermal power plants and 50 per cent of hydroelectric power plants.

He also highlighted that country's pattern of ""double-tap"" attacks targeting civilians and the rescue workers helping them -- ""the trademarks of Russia's aggression"". Accordingly, he underlined the need to ensure the delivery of humanitarian aid and the restoration of the energy infrastructure across Ukraine, noting that Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have altogether contributed over $100 million worth of humanitarian aid to the people of Ukraine and ""will continue to support Ukraine until the aggressor is defeated.""

The representative of the European Union, in its capacity as observer, underscored that ""every discussion on Ukraine must start by restating one unequivocal fact -- Russia's illegal, unprovoked and unjustified war of aggression constitutes a manifest violation of international law"". This is why that country must cease its attacks on Ukraine's civilian infrastructure now, why its leadership must be held fully accountable and why all nations must come together in support of a just, lasting and comprehensive peace in Ukraine. Stressing that Moscow's indiscriminate attacks further exacerbate a dire humanitarian situation in Ukraine where over 14 million people require assistance -- ""you have heard so much about this here today"" -- he reported that the European Union has stepped up its provision of aid, including power generators and transformers.

The Russian Federation, however, has an obligation to allow such aid to reach all those in need, he said, also recalling the March 2022 legally binding order from the International Court of Justice for Moscow to immediately suspend its military operations in Ukraine. He also stated that third parties must immediately cease providing material support to the Russian Federation's war of aggression -- ""or other kinds of cuddling"". Reiterating support for peace in Ukraine, he welcomed Switzerland's initiative to host a peace summit in June and called on all States to participate. ""The EU will continue to support Ukraine for as long as it takes,"" he added and, to Moscow, he said: ""Stop your illegal war, and the illegal and inhumane means you are using to pursue it.""

The representative of Poland said that the Russian Federation is seeking to degrade the Ukrainian economy and society, making large parts of Ukraine uninhabitable. The purpose of these barbaric actions is clear: to destroy the lives of Ukrainian people and intimidate Ukraine and those who support it. In this context, he was particularly appalled by the ongoing deportations and transfers of Ukrainian children and their forced ""Russification"". Welcoming Switzerland's initiative to host a peace summit for Ukraine in June, he voiced support for President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's peace formula as a plan for a just, comprehensive and lasting peace in Ukraine and for the enduring security on the European continent.

The representative of Denmark, speaking also for Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden, condemned Moscow's systematic and detrimental attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure. Noting that since 22 March 2024 there have been five massive attacks damaging over 80 per cent of Ukraine's non-nuclear power plants, she pointed out that this has included dangerous attacks on hydroelectric infrastructure which increase the risk of environmental disaster. She extended the Nordic countries' full support to the upcoming first peace summit on Ukraine in Switzerland, expressing hope that many countries will join. The Russian Federation's aggression and its detrimental global consequences ""demand united efforts"" firmly based on international law, including the UN Charter, and in line with Ukraine's peace formula.",globalsecurity.org,news,GlobalSecurity.org,John Pike,-0.2941176470588235,453549670,28,,eng-9568376

It's now billing the latest achievement, OceanX, as the ""world's largest"" floating platform by capacity, though the title might be hard to hold, as other innovations are making progress, as well.

In April, OceanX was at the tower-lifting stage. A photo of the platform shared on Mingyang's LinkedIn page shows it floating with a multitude of cranes in the background.

""Mingyang, at the forefront of the fourth industrial revolution, is integrating clean energy with industrial intelligence,"" company President Zhang Chuanwei said on its website.

By placing two turbines on one rig -- something other companies are doing, too -- OceanX has set a new benchmark for capacity. It's also an alternative design to simply going bigger, which has limitations.

The V-shaped towers and long, elliptical cross sections provide durability during typhoon conditions, according to the LinkedIn post and a report from Interesting Engineering.

Other perks include ""additional yawing power, enhancing production efficiency, and reducing ultimate load."" The two counter-rotating rotors deliver 16.6 megawatts of capacity. For reference, grid operator California ISO states that one megawatt is enough instantaneous juice for about 750 homes.

It's an accomplishment that started as a 1:10-scale model that was trialed around four years ago with success, according to IE, referencing a Recharge story.

""I still remember well the first tests on a 1:10 scaled prototype. Impressive to see this becoming real at full scale,"" wind specialist Béla Kühn commented on the LinkedIn post.

It's part of a growing offshore wind industry. Data collector Statista reports that worldwide capacity hit 72,663 megawatts in 2023, an increase from prior years. What's more, Denmark developers are planning so-called energy islands that will serve as hubs to better manage the anticipated deluge of offshore wind power in the coming years. The hubs will more efficiently send power to the coast, where the electricity could soon help to power homes farther inland.

It's another step in the transition to cleaner energy on a large scale. Renewable energy already makes up about 20% of America's power production. Wind leads the way, at 10.3% of total production, all per the U.S. Department of Energy. The country's first large-scale offshore turbines, located off the East Coast, started delivering energy to homes earlier this year.

The positive impact can be realized in the very oceans where the turbines are located. By replacing dirty fuel burning with turbine turning, the cleaner energy source reduces the amount of planet-warming air pollution hitting the atmosphere, which has been linked to underwater woes caused by hotter sea temperatures. Sea life health is a concern that directly impacts our food chain.

Next up for OceanX is a trip off the coast of Qingzhou, where the twin platform is to be installed.

Executive Summary

A broad consensus has been reached by Western democracies on the need to address climate change. This consensus runs right through Europe and the UK, with about two-thirds of the public backing climate action.[_] This should be heralded as a political win - but, as this new polling shows, it cannot be taken for granted.

In order to explore the politics of climate, the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change (TBI) commissioned YouGov to field a survey of more than 15,000 respondents across the UK and seven EU member states: Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland and Portugal. Whenever the ""EU"" is mentioned hereafter in this paper and its graphics, it is with specific reference to these seven countries. When combined ""EU"" or ""EU and UK"" figures are reported, this is Tony Blair Institute for Global Change analysis of the country-level data provided by YouGov.

Survey experiments were used to examine how public opinion responds to different types of messaging strategies and different policy designs. The focus was on four key areas of climate policy: trust in policy delivery; home-heating decarbonisation; land-use decarbonisation; and climate assistance for developing countries.

People in the UK and Europe have lost faith in their governments' ability to meet ambitious targets and fear being unfairly penalised by having to take on excessive costs and make substantial lifestyle changes. These are legitimate grievances, but they are being exploited by populists. The European Parliament elections look set to confirm a growing tension for leaders: loud voices on the right without any ambition to address climate change, versus equally loud activists on the left without credible strategies for reaching net zero.

Failing to change direction on climate, both politically and in terms of policy choices, risks a loss of support for the whole idea of climate-change action. That would be a disaster.

The solution lies in a new political impetus. Leaders must no longer focus solely on targets as a means to an end, but instead on how they can be delivered in a way that both boosts prosperity and recognises that climate emissions do not respect national borders. This new survey shows that when presented with this way forward, the public responds positively. Their support for action on climate increases - and even sceptics can be converted.

Key Findings

Support for net zero remains high across the UK and the EU: 69 per cent are concerned about climate change and 61 per cent support the target of net zero.

However, there is an emerging delivery deficit on net zero: people don't believe that major emitters and governments will reach their targets. Just 31 per cent of Europeans, and 19 per cent of the UK public, believe their respective governments will reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

A huge majority (79 per cent across Europe, 84 per cent in the UK) think China will not reach their stated climate goals. And that opinion has consequences: people across Europe and the UK are divided (55 per cent support, 45 per cent oppose) on whether their governments should lead on climate change if China is seen not to act. This belief that China will not do its bit is also linked to an unwillingness on the part of the public to have to pay for net-zero initiatives.

This scepticism and apprehension can be overcome by good policy solutions - and demonstrating the tech-enabled delivery of climate solutions is an under-used political tool. Support for net zero is boosted by 11 per cent among those most sceptical on climate when they are presented with information on how technology is enabling the transition. A negative ""doomer"" message, which is more often used, is much less effective.

Costs need to be fair. Providing support for the poorest in society and targeting taxes at the worst emitters is the best approach, in conjunction with policy ""carrots"" as opposed to ""sticks"".

Climate leadership, and climate finance for developing countries, are supported by the public because they are considered important elements in tackling climate change. Support is highest in Denmark (68 per cent), followed by Italy (63 per cent), with the UK sitting at 50 per cent.

Chapter 2

Forging a New Political and Policy Consensus on Climate

In the UK, emissions are not decreasing at the pace required to meet future targets. In fact, outside of electricity supply, aviation and shipping, the pace needs to almost quadruple if 2030 targets are to be met.[_] It's a similar story in the EU: as things stand it is unlikely to meet its 2050 goal until the middle of the 2060s.[_]

This challenging context does not mean it is necessary to abandon these targets - instead it requires smart policies, deliverable plans and an international outlook. The paper Reimagining the UK's Net-Zero Strategy - also published by the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change (TBI) - sets out a potential route forward, centred on a renewed focus on technological development, as well as innovation and consumer choice. If citizens are expected to change their behaviour, they need to believe that targets are achievable - and consistent with their other priorities.

Leaders, meanwhile, must ensure that the transition is equitable and fair. Such an agenda provides a practical blueprint for governments, but a key question is whether it can have the political effect of addressing the growing green backlash, or greenlash.

The findings of the survey confirm that there is a delivery deficit on climate change: the public support action but, at present, simply do not believe that net zero will be delivered by Europe or key emitters such as China. The data show that sensitivity around the costs of transition (and the distribution of those costs) is essential if leaders are to retain a net-zero consensus. Crucially, the data also demonstrate how harnessing technology is not just good policy but also effective political strategy: it is less polarising than conventional political messaging on climate change.

Chapter 3

Key Survey FindingsThe Public Support Net Zero but the Cost of Living Dominates

Despite recent greenlash, public concern about climate change and support for action has been growing - and that is certainly the case across the EU and the UK.

Figure 1

The majority of people in the EU and UK are concerned about climate change and support the target of net zero by 2050

Source: YouGov for TBI. Note: Climate-change concern and net-zero support measured on a 0-10 scale. 0-4: not concerned/do not support; 5: undecided; 6-10: concerned/support. Note: Due to rounding of the polling data, the data visualisations may not add up to exactly 100%.

However, concern about the climate does not translate into it being the highest priority: in almost every country we surveyed, the public place a higher priority on the cost of living and health care than they do on climate action.

Figure 2

Climate change isn't considered a top priority across Europe and the UK

Source: YouGov for TBI

This is the political environment in which key decisions are being made on the transition: the public is concerned about climate, but it is a second-order priority. This impacts public willingness to make significant personal sacrifices as a result of climate policy, especially anything that erodes already declining incomes.

Large Emitters Such as China Are Not Trusted to Reach Net Zero

There is a lack of trust in key actors to deliver on climate. This is true of national governments and the EU, but particularly China. The majority of respondents do not believe that any of these actors will hit their net-zero targets - and the public is particularly sceptical about China.

While a majority support net zero, few think their government, the EU, large companies or China will get there by 2050

Belief in likelihood of reaching net zero by 2050 measured on a 0-10 scale. 0-4: not likely; 5: neither likely nor unlikely; 6-10: likely. Due to rounding of the polling data, the data visualisations may not add up to exactly 100%.

This is particularly concerning because the public is also aware that China, and other rapidly developing countries such as India, are responsible for an increasing proportion of global emissions, and as such harbour reservations over whether they will play their part.[_] If the public do not believe that major actors will follow through on their climate plans, they may question why they should have to make significant changes to their own behaviour - and incur personal costs - by way of, say, having a heat pump installed or acquiring an electric vehicle.

TBI's survey asked whether respondents felt their government should be a global leader on climate, even if big emitters such China and the US do not take sufficient climate action - and the majority responded positively. However, this belief is concentrated among the most convinced on climate. When we look at the majority of the population in the EU and the UK - those who do not include climate change in their top three priority issues - support for action regardless of what China and the US do is a minority view.

People Won't Pay If They Don't Trust Net-Zero Targets

The link between cost and delivery is an under-appreciated aspect of the public's views on climate policy. If people do not think that net zero is likely, they are much less likely to be willing to pay extra taxes to make it happen.

Chapter 4

Harnessing Technology Is the Right Policy - and the Right Politics

Given that TBI's polling shows that preserving support for action on climate requires the public to believe their government can deliver on net-zero goals, a credible delivery plan is required.

The most significant steps forward for climate action to date have come as a result of innovation. It was the emergence of Tesla that catalysed and accelerated the transition to electric vehicles, while the cost of producing electricity using solar has fallen by 89 per cent in ten years and battery costs have fallen by more than 97 per cent in the past three decades. At the same time, breakthroughs are now happening at even more rapid pace, aided by artificial intelligence.

This makes it imperative that governments in Europe and the UK take the lead on driving the development and rapid adoption of catalytic clean-technology solutions. Reimagining the UK's Net-Zero Strategy sets out the basis for how governments can do this. This involves the government organising itself more effectively and treating net-zero delivery as a whole-system challenge: providing more effective R&D support to drive innovation; aligning regulation with clean-technology requirements; speeding up delivery timelines; effective market-making through strategic use of public funding; and enhanced focus on driving technology transfer across the world.

This policy blueprint, and a clear programme of delivery, needs to sit alongside effective political messaging to maintain support for action. A recent cross-national study by the OECD showed that the best way to get people to support a climate tax is to convince them that policies will achieve their objectives.[_] This speaks to the importance of not just good policy but also good communications, in order to create enduring support for action and reform.

Testing the Theory: How Important Is it to Get the Message Right?

A key hurdle for green policy that is centred on technology is whether it can actually resolve the growing political problem around selling the delivery of net zero. To test this, TBI conducted a randomised control trial of the effectiveness of different messaging strategies. Different sections of our survey's 15,000 sample were given different messages, to test how they affected belief in, and support for, climate goals.

Each tested message was seen by just one section of respondents. A final group, the ""control"" group, saw no message at all. Though they saw different messages (or, in the case of the control group, no message at all), all respondents went on to take the same survey. Since, statistically, the only thing that distinguishes these groups is the message they were exposed to, any significant difference in attitudes can be attributed to the message.

The first message was a technology-delivery message. It highlighted the positives: how climate-technology developments are increasing the effectiveness of emission-reduction measures, and how this in turn makes governments' climate policies more effective. It is likely that the public will become more trusting of governments - both in Europe and around the world - if presented with information on how the technical aspects of dealing with climate issues are becoming more achievable. Recent evidence has shown that among the strongest ways to get people to support climate policy is to convince them that the policies will be effective.[_]

We contrasted this with a pessimistic ""doomer"" message, emphasising that we are falling short of achieving our climate goals and that without fast and dramatic action, the Earth will warm to a catastrophic degree. Many climate activists and policymakers believe that the best way to get the public to support climate action is to make them aware of the grave nature of the emergency and the likely consequences of a lack of action.[_] However, some evidence suggests that this approach could just serve to encourage apathy, especially among those who are less concerned about climate.[_]

As Figure 6 shows, a technology-delivery message has a statistically significant effect on reducing scepticism that national governments will achieve net zero among those with low climate concern. You can see how the public responded to the question of whether net zero will be brought about by their government based on their level of climate concern.

Figure 6

Messaging on climate technology increases public belief in net-zero delivery among those less concerned about climate change

Notes: These are the results of a randomised control trial, where respondents were exposed to different messages to measure their relative effect against a control group. % change is change in respondents' belief in their country reaching net zero by 2050 following messages; the grey area indicates the 95% confidence interval of the control group's belief in their country reaching net zero. ""Very low climate concern"" is anyone who scored 1 or below on a 10-point climate-concern scale. ""Very high climate concern"" is anyone who scored 9 or above on a 10-point climate-concern scale.

The next question is how these two messages impact on support for the target of net zero by 2050. The theory is that if people believe that net zero will be reached around the world, they will be more likely to support ambitious target - and a technology-delivery message is more likely to convince them. Indeed, it is among those with the lowest climate concern that the dial shifts the most.

Figure 7

Climate-technology messaging is most persuasive for those who are more sceptical about climate change

The grey area indicates the 95% confidence interval of the control group's support for the goal of net zero by 2050. Climate concern is measured on a 10-point scale, grouped in increments of 2: very high: 9-10; high: 7-8; undecided: 4-6 (excluded from this visualisation); low 2-3; very low 0-1.

The message from these survey experiments is that climate-technology messaging is an effective way to build support for climate action and belief in climate-policy delivery - particularly among those who do not already have very high levels of climate concern. An enhanced focus on driving technology innovation and creating the markets for rapid adoption is therefore not just effective climate policy, but also good climate politics. To maintain support in the delivery phase, the key is to implement policies that make climate change seem achievable - both at home and abroad - through technological innovation at lower costs.

The Costs of the Transition Must Be Seen to Be Distributed Fairly

Belief that major actors will deliver on climate targets is important if members of the public are to be encouraged to make lifestyle changes and incur costs to reduce their climate footprint - but it is even more important to ensure that the public is persuaded that these costs are reasonable and fair.

As we set out in Reimagining the UK's Net-Zero Strategy, it is important to be honest about the fact that the transition will involve change and costs on the part of individuals. Those individuals are more likely to agree to bearing the costs if they understand the benefits and trust that their government will support them - and think that the costs will be fairly distributed.

The opposite is also true: without a plan to ensure that the financing of the transition is fair, progress is likely to halt. Across the EU this debate has focused on costs in two central areas of the climate-policy debate, which we examine here: the transition to heat pumps and the farmer protests erupting across Europe.

Targeted Taxes and No Bans: How the Public Would Design the Heat Pump Transition

Homeowners are being encouraged to replace high-emission gas boilers with lower-emitting heat pumps - but at a significantly higher cost. While several governments have offered substantial ""carrots"" in the form of subsidies, they have also tried to encourage the transition with ""sticks"": near-term bans on gas boilers.

Regarding home heating, our survey respondents were asked to pick between two hypothetical policies to subsidise heat-pump installation. Each policy had four features and each of those features had one random choice of the three possible elements per feature, as presented in Figure 8 (below). This allowed us to examine respondents' support for each element relative to the others, meaning we can understand their revealed preferences.

In Figure 8, the first items have no green bar because they are the least preferred element of each feature, which all the other figures are relative to. The percentage change (the green bar for each policy element) demonstrates how much that particular dimension of the policy makes a difference to support for the heat pump transition, relative to the least preferred element of that feature.

Figure 8

Opinion of heat pumps: people are sensitive to cost, in favour of carbon taxes and opposed to ban on gas boilers

Source: YouGov for TBI. *The homeowner would pay the rest in monthly instalments over 10 years (€50/month). Respondents in the UK and Denmark were presented with figures in their own currency. Notes: % is the increased probability of choosing a policy package if it includes specific element. The grey area indicates the 90% Bayesian credible intervals of the control group's support for the target of net zero by 2050.

There are four key findings from this experiment. First, the public is sensitive to cost - both the amount that homeowners will have to pay and how the state will finance the subsidies. Of the three cost options for homeowners, respondents prefer higher up-front subsidies targeted at poorer households. These results are consistent with previous findings showing that the public is sensitive to the upfront cost of heat pumps and the perceived fairness of how these costs will be distributed.[_]

The public also prefers the idea that the subsidy is financed through carbon taxes over a general VAT increase. This is consistent with a ""polluter pays"" principle, which is core to EU policy and supported by a body of public-opinion evidence: people want climate action to be funded by those who pollute more.[_]

Third, the public opposes the back-door imposition of costs in the form of a ban on gas boilers, preferring no ban at all or, failing that, a ban in 2040 rather than 2030. This echoes the recent controversy over gas boilers in Germany, which saw significant backlash against a government plan to bring the deadline for a ban on gas boilers forward to 2024. The debate also resulted in an increase in support for the climate-sceptic, right-wing populist Alternative for Germany (AfD), with the party using it as an election issue.

Finally, the public is less moved by discussion over what other types of benefits the introduction of heat pumps will deliver, such as the creation of jobs, lower monthly heating costs or a reduction in carbon emissions. This reinforces the point that when it comes to heat pumps, the public is laser-focused on costs and their distribution.

The Public Is Sensitive to Transition Costs That Hit the Economy, Not Just Their Own Pocket

Land-use regulation is another important area of EU green policy, as land use is one of the leading sources of emissions. The ""Fit for 55"" package within the EU's Green Deal is designed to reduce the emissions from land use by 55 per cent by 2030.[_]

While this issue has less of an effect on the general public, it does impose potentially substantial costs on farmers, whose well-being elicits substantial public concern. Meanwhile, farmer protests have been significantly disruptive across Europe, and a symbol of greenlash.

When we presented respondents with some basic information about the European Green Deal, 63 per cent across the political spectrum supported such a measure. However, just as people are sensitive to costs imposed on both themselves and low-income citizens, we have found that they are also sensitive to costs imposed on farmers.

We discovered this tension through an ""attack and rebuttal"" experiment. We gave a subset of our sample a message from a fabricated European farmers union attacking the Green Deal, and found that support for it subsequently dropped from 63 per cent to 50 per cent. While a rebuttal from an invented green organisation increased support, it didn't return it to the initial level.

We also found that concern for farmers is shared across the political spectrum. The farmers' message had a strong negative effect on support for the Green Deal even among those who support left-wing or green parties.

Figure 9

Support for EU Green Deal suffers when public informed of farmers' opposition

Source: YouGov for TBI. Note: UK survey respondents were given a hypothetical UK-based Green Deal scenario.

When it comes to heat pumps and land use, the thinking could be that while the public is sensitive to costs, if informed of other benefits that these polices will produce, such as cleaner air and more jobs, their support will rebound. We did not find this to be the case. The lesson is that policymakers can only impose costs to a limited degree before a political cost is incurred, which is something that leaders need to consider when designing policy.

Two main principles should therefore apply. First, it is essential for governments to focus on how to create a positive transition for consumers and citizens, with an emphasis on creating the demand for necessary changes through carrots rather than sticks. Encouraging new business models and supporting innovation in technology will be essential to achieving this, rather than putting strong regulatory levers in place that create additional costs before consumers are ready to adopt the technology.

Leaders need to work out how to manage incentives in the economy, such as subsidies, to create a self-sustaining and positive demand for change. This means working with what consumers want. The acceleration in the uptake of electric vehicles provides an instructive example: a rapid reduction in price came about through technological innovation and an extension of the charging infrastructure, both of which were driven by consumer demand.

Second, when governments think about using public funding, there is clear appetite for this funding to be concentrated on those who need it most - and for the tax burden to seem fair as a result. Consideration should also be given to how to equitably distribute carbon taxes and target support more effectively (through tools such as digital ID, for instance).

The Public Recognises That Climate Emissions Don't Respect Borders - Leaders Should Too

While it is important for developed countries to achieve net zero, achieving global climate goals will require countries to develop with low emissions central to all decision-making. This will require both public and private investment, yet private climate financing in recent years has fallen, not risen.

This has been a focus of recent COP conferences, where developed countries have made substantial pledges to provide financial assistance for low-carbon development. Europe and the UK can lead on this by providing a blueprint that others can follow; they can also support developing countries in delivering low-carbon infrastructure and building the low-carbon industries of the future.

While the public is often sceptical of foreign aid, there is appetite for leadership on the global stage to provide financial aid for the net-zero transition, as you can see in Figure 10 (below). In our cross-country sample, just under 51 per cent agreed that it is important for Europe and the UK to provide financial support to developing countries on climate, 31 per cent disagreed, with the remaining 18 per cent unsure.

Figure 10

The EU and the UK largely support climate aid for poorer nations

This belief in the importance of climate finance exists across Europe. It is highest in Denmark (68 per cent), Italy (63 per cent) and Portugal (62 per cent), but support is also a majority position in the UK, where 50 per cent back the idea and 34 per cent oppose.

Chapter 5

Conclusion

The survey provides evidence of a point that is often underappreciated within political discussions on climate: demonstrating effective delivery, at home and abroad, is key to maintaining support.

This is particularly true for those groups who don't consider net zero a top priority. The majority of the public do not need further messages about the harms of fossil fuels, nor the degree to which we are off-track. Instead they need to see evidence of delivery and trust that their government is getting on with it in a way that isn't in conflict with wider economic and social goals.

Governments should unleash innovation in clean technology to create alternatives that can thrive over fossil fuels. They should push through the transition at home and abroad. They should better target and deliver support. And they should accelerate the ability for public climate finance to drive delivery on the ground, while also crowding in private-sector finance.

This is the time to get smarter about both climate policy and climate politics.

Methodology

From 8 to 15 March 2024, the Tony Blair Institute worked with YouGov to survey attitudes to the net-zero transition across seven EU member states and the UK. The interviews were conducted online and each country was sampled and weighted by age, education, gender, region and past national election vote, to be nationally and politically representative.

The individual data from Denmark (2,046), France (2,010), Germany (2,053), Italy (2,120), Netherlands (2,125), Poland (2,006), Portugal (1,006) and the UK (2,127) can be accessed via the hyperlinks.

Annex

This annex provides the full text of the information that was presented to survey respondents for particular polling questions.

Climate-Technology Message (relates to Figures 6 and 7)

The world has recently made big and important advances in tackling climate change. Technology is making this possible.

* Climate scientists have said 2023 was the year global CO2 emissions likely peaked, due to advancements in technology and the spread of renewable energy.

* The price of producing renewable energy has plummeted due to advances in technology. Worldwide, the cost of energy produced by windfarms has fallen by over 70% and solar costs have fallen by 90% since 2010.

* The cost of producing batteries for electric cars has fallen by 85% in a decade. Battery production to store renewable energy is set to increase by 800% by 2030.

* We are still in the early stages of climate technology development and the impact of AI, like we were with the internet in 1995. With continued investment, technology will continue to transform how we tackle climate change.

All this makes it increasingly important for the UK to continue tackling climate change and investing in a carbon-free society.

Climate ""Doomer"" Message (Figures 6 and 7)

Climate change now poses an existential threat to our planet.

* The world is already 1.1 degrees Celsius warmer than it was in pre-industrial years, and 2023 was the hottest year on record.

* Climate and weather-related disasters have increased by 500% in the past 50 years.

* Even if current national commitments are met, experts say the world would still see a catastrophic temperature rise of 2.9°C this century - which would result in hundreds of millions of people being displaced by flooding.

* No G20 country is reducing its emissions enough to reach their net-zero targets. Global coal consumption hit a record high in 2023, mostly driven by increased usage by India and China.

All this makes it increasingly important for the UK to continue tackling climate change and investing in a carbon-free society.

""Fit for 55"" Policy Information (Figure 9)

A new piece of legislation has been proposed called the 'UK's Green Deal'. The aims include:

* to transform at least 30% of the UK's lands and seas into effectively managed protected areas for biodiversity

* to make the UK climate neutral by 2050, with a 55% reduction in Greenhouse Gas emissions by 2030

* to substantially reduce the pollution of nature and carbon emissions

Farmers' Attack Message (Figure 9)

A spokesperson for the United Farmers Coalition has criticised the policy, saying:

""As representatives of the farming community, we are deeply concerned about the implications of the Green Deal on our livelihoods. Over 6,300 agricultural-related businesses in the UK have closed since 2017 and nearly 5,000 meat, fruit, vegetable, and dairy farmers have lost their jobs. #[EU TEXT: In just 15 years, the EU has lost close to 40% of its farmers, almost exclusively small and medium farms, who have gone out of business or been bought up by increasingly large competitors.]

Many of the costs of the Green Deal will fall on our members. By 2030, we will have to reduce pesticide usage by 50% and remove 10% of 2020 farmland for 'reforestation and restoration'.

This will drive up costs and could reduce crop yields by 12%. The Green Deal will increase the challenges that we face at the worst possible time.""

Environmentalist Rebuttal (Figure 9)

A Spokesperson from the Green Unity Network has defended the scheme, responding:

""The Green Deal cannot come soon enough. At present, agriculture generates roughly 30% of greenhouse gas emissions. Without changes to the way we produce food, there is no way we can stop adding to warming of the earth. At the moment, agriculture creates three times more CO2 emissions than the aviation industry in Europe.

Across the UK, farming as it is done today drives animals out of their homes, wastes resources and pollutes waterways. The Green Deal has set a target of planting 50 million trees by the end of 2025. A reduction in pesticides and fertilizers will improve biodiversity, for healthier soil and more resilient crops in the long run. The Green Deal will create environmental and societal benefits for future generations and the planet.""",institute.global,news,institute.global,,0.1607843137254903,453545453,16,https://images.ctfassets.net/75ila1cntaeh/7B06l0e7rAH6nGfWiVBBXE/da8b96d96fd8154bc94bf3b49e51d5f4/GettyImages-1693429925__1_.jpg?fm=jpg,eng-9568175

Siemens Energy and Danish grid operator have signed a framework agreement to renew Denmark's energy infrastructure.

The €1.4bn agreement is for delivery of transformers and switchgear for high-voltage substations to expand the electricity grid in the country to accommodate more renewable electricity.

The agreement focuses on the western part of Denmark, where approximately 50 new or reinforced 150 kV high-voltage substations are planned to be built or expanded over the next eight years.

The first four years of the agreement is estimated to be worth up to €800m to accelerate the energy transition.

Tim Holt, Member of the Executive Board for Siemens Energy, said: ""There is no energy transition without transmission, and that can only happen with the availability of switchgears and transformers.

""Grid investments are accelerating dramatically in Europe and worldwide, and customers are competing for manufacturing slots.

""This agreement enables Siemens Energy to plan its capacities, which will benefit both Danish and European energy infrastructure.

""We are excited to be trusted to deliver on the grid acceleration in Denmark.""

Henrik Riis, CEO of Energinet Electricity Transmission, added: ""We need external suppliers to ensure rapid and significant expansion of the electricity transmission grid.

""The task is enormous. In the coming years, several high-voltage substations on the 'high-ways' of the Danish electricity grid are needed to secure that renewable electricity can be connected to the grid and transported around the country.

""We are incredibly pleased that with Siemens Energy we get a long-term, strategic partnership, thus ensuring that we can keep up with the dramatic development in Denmark.""",renews.biz,news,Renews,,0.4431372549019608,453544037,28,https://renews.biz/media/21883/siemens-substation.jpg?width=640,

""That entire market for us was wiped and we had to make a number of redundancies,"" said Mr Ivers.

He explained that before government made changes early last year, policy in Ireland was driven by developers including Shell and native Irish companies like Simply Blue.

""They would identify a piece of sea bed and go and try to convince government through the planning process that this was a viable area for offshore wind,"" he said.

This led to around 40 different investigation areas that were being identified for offshore renewable energy developments through the use of companies like Green Rebel.

Green Rebel carries out ""geophysical"" surveys where they look at a certain area of seabed and investigate the ecological impact of building offshore wind floating renewable energy projects in these specific areas while also informing developers on what kind of engineering design is needed.

The company also acquired airplanes which we they had at Cork Airport to carry out air investigations through agreements with Ireland Whale and Dolphin Ireland and Birdwatch Ireland to understand marine migrating patterns and bird flight patterns.

However, the Government's ""u-turn"" in the first three months of 2023, where policymakers decided to go with a government plan-led approach, meant they would no longer be licensing companies like Green Rebel to carry out investigations and would acquire this data themselves.

The Government, through the State body Eirgrid, also outsources multinationals to provide the data to them which the Government then gives to interested parties who bid on specified areas of seabed.

For example, instead of using Green Rebel's planes in Munster, planes from Denmark are being flown into Irish airspace to carry out investigations for renewable energy developments.

""Jobs are being created to support other countries, not Irleand,"" said Mr Ivers.

Mr Ivers added that he saw the reasoning behind the plan, as many companies cannot provide all of the services that some of these multinationals do.

""In terms of longevity, the Government have made the right decision, however they were ill-equipped and still are ill-equipped to deliver on that,"" he said.

""In reality, in government and the civil service they don't have anywhere near the requisite qualifications or skillsets to deliver high level data acquisition across Ireland,"" he added.

""It was a plan led with no plan but ultimately it is the right way to go, but has slowed down the entire industry,"" said Mr Ivers.

Although the Government may have had good intentions in its decision, the slowdown for the renewable energy sector means that there is little hope of Ireland hitting 2030 climate targets, according to Mr Ivers.

""It will be 2035 at best,"" he said.

Justin Moran, director of external affairs at Wind Energy Ireland, an industry representative group echoed this sentiment.

Mr Moran said the volume of projects that competed in the third renewable energy support scheme auction (Ress3) was ""far lower than we need to be getting the Ress auctions if we're to come anywhere close to our 2030 targets."" ""We're waiting to see the terms and conditions of the Ress4 auctions,"" he added which could provide some relief to developers or cast a further dark cloud on future developments.

In the meantime, Green Rebel continues carry out work in other markets including countries like Scotland which has ramped up efforts to provide clean energy after historically relying on their offshore oil industry.

The are also eyeing up several potential projects in international markets such as the United States and Australia.

The renewable wind industry is also moving along in the Republic this, albeit at a somewhat underwhelming pace.

Mr Moran said new offshore wind project are going through the planning process before the end of June and all eyes will be on the second offshore renewable energy auction at the end of 2024.

However ""the planning system is still that major chokepoint"" he said.

""In the last four to six months there does seem to be indications that decisions are coming out of An Bord Pleanála more quickly and we'd like to see that continue and accelerate,"" he said.

Hugh Kelly, chief executive of Cork headquartered offshore renewable energy developer Simply Blue Group also voiced concern about the ""high risk"" associated with the Irish planning system, which ultimately influenced the prices in Ress3.

""The Department (of Environment) has indicated that Ress4 will be closely aligned with the design of Ress3. Therefore, arguably, we can expect more of the same,"" he warned.

Mr Kelly said there is scope for ""fine-tuning criteria"" in areas such as delivery timelines, price caps, and risk allocation to mitigate planning delays.

Mr Kelly suggested that the next offshore auction (Oress2) will have the opposite effect of the onshore auction if the design of Oress1 is kept.

""Oress1 was considered to be very successful with initial prices at €86/MWh,"" he said.

Mr Kelly added however that the Oress2 auction for 900MW of capacity, set for later this year, ""is likely to reflect risks and costs associated with planning, as well as issues specific to offshore development, including supply chain bottlenecks and their impact on project delivery.""

Meanwhile, Department of Enterprise assistant secretary Gary Tobin indicated in recent weeks that the State may rely on tech multinationals to drive the development of offshore wind in the Republic as tech companies are under growing pressure to procure clean energy for the use of electricity guzzling data centres.

Mr Tobin acknowledged grid capacity issues in the Republic, which have added to delays in the development of offshore wind farms, but hinted that he is aware of tech firms that are looking to develop wind farms privately.

""Some large energy users are already themselves exploring the potential for offshore wind and they are already in discussion with developers,"" he said.

""These large energy users may not need to use the grid, they may use private wires,"" he added.

Mr Kelly suggested that multinational involvement in offshore wind isn't necessarily a bad thing for the industry.

""Offshore wind projects require billions of euros of investment, along with huge technical capability to develop infrastructure offshore,"" he said.

Multinational companies including utilities, energy companies, and global financial investors, ""play an important role in project development and delivery and are ready to step up and participate in the accelerated development of offshore wind"", said Mr Kelly.

""The wins include abundant and more reliable energy for consumers, sufficient energy for sustainable economic growth and, if we invest strategically, huge wins for Ireland in terms of related jobs and investment,"" he added.

For now, the top priority for offshore renewable energy in the Republic is ""certainty"" from the Government around project development, according to Mr Kelly.

He is also seeking an acceleration of the roll-out of Designated Marine Area Plans (Dmaps) in 2025, and a sped-up planning process that will ""give meaningful support for timely supply chain development."" ""We are developing offshore wind because there is a climate crisis, a climate emergency,"" said Mr Kelly.

He said his company are already witnessing climate change impact biodiversity and manifesting itself in forced migrations of peoples from affected areas.

""Meanwhile, in Ireland, we have already lost years as rules have been changed and the confidence of developers has been eroded,"" he said.

""Developers who are investors in Ireland and have had to write-off millions as the goal posts have moved. While the Irish Government justifies delay by claiming, for example, that floating technology is not yet ready, willing developers including the ESB, and Equinor who has already left Ireland, are participating in leasing rounds overseas,"" said Mr Kelly.

""Ireland is falling behind, unnecessarily. We need to catch up,"" he continued.

Elsewhere, the European wind energy industry was shaken after the EU decided to launch an probe into subsidies received by Chinese suppliers of wind turbines set to be used in Europe.

European wind turbine manufacturers have come under scrutiny in recent times for charging high prices compared to Chinese rivals.

Speaking on this, Donal O'Sullvan, vice president for development and offshore with Statkraft Ireland, said: ""in general getting the cost of wind, both onshore and offshore, down is a challenge and developers and suppliers need to consider all options but also ensuring that we operate within what is acceptable from a sustainability and human rights perspective.""",irishexaminer.com,news,Irish Examiner,Cáit Caden,0.2078431372549019,453539605,1,https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/8230/4115356_4_articlelarge_DC_2b181121_2bWIND_2b04_1_.jpg,eng-9572956

In the euro area, industrial production data for March and employment growth for Q1 are scheduled for release. The current strong labour market gives upside risks to wage growth and thereby domestic inflation.

In Denmark, the government will publish an update on the budget for 2024. For more detail, please see our Fixed income morning comment.

In Sweden, the monthly Prospera survey is published at 08.00 CET. Inflation expectations are at 2.0% on all horizons. Vice governor Martin Flodén is scheduled for his last speech as he steps down on 21 May, after eleven years in the Board.

In Norway, GDP for Q1 is released. There has been a clear pick-up in Norwegian growth in Q1, as the manufacturing sector is lifted by higher demand from abroad as well as the oil sector. We expect mainland-GDP grew 0.3 % q/q in Q1 with risk fairly balanced from seasonality around Easter. Also, Norges Bank will publish the Expectations Survey for Q2, where we expect inflation expectations to be moving lower but wage expectations to remain elevated.

Overnight, China will release the monthly batch of data for retail sales, home sales, home prices, industrial production etc. Focus is still on retail sales and home sales as proxies for how the housing crisis and the domestic economy is doing.

What happened overnight

In Japan, national accounts for Q1 were released, showing GDP declining faster than expected at -0.5% q/q (cons: -0.4%). Private consumption, which accounts for more than half of Japan's GDP, fell by 0.7% q/q (cons: -0.2%) as consumers reduced spending amid a weaker yen driving up food and energy costs. This marks the fourth consecutive quarter of decline in private consumption. Additionally, capital spending decreased by 0.8% q/q (cons: -0.7%), while external demand was -0.3% q/q, in line with expectations.

What happened yesterday

In the US, April inflation was slightly lower than expected on headline level at 0.3% m/m SA (cons: 0.4), while core inflation was close to expectations, printing 0.29% m/m SA (cons: 0.3%). Modest core goods deflation continued, while shelter and health care prices saw moderating inflation pressures - for more detail please see Global Inflation Watch - April US CPI signals cautious relief for the Fed, 15 May.

US retail sales came in markedly lower than expected at 0.0% m/m SA (cons: 0.4%), while the control group sales (measure which strips out the most volatile components) declined some 0.3% m/m SA (cons: 0.1%). The seemingly large downtick can mainly be attributed to a less favourable seasonal adjustment factor, although the downside miss also gives hints about some underlying weakness as well. Overall, this supports our case that the Fed will still cut rates this year, where we call for the first cut in September.

In Europe, Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico was shot multiple times in an assignation attempt. According to Slovak government officials, he is no longer in life-threatening condition.

In Sweden, April CPIF and core inflation (CPIF excluding energy) stood at 2.3% and 2.9%, respectively, 0.4 percentage points below the Riksbanks's forecasts - positive news for the Riksbank. Consequently, as previously expressed by the Riksbank, further rate cuts are anticipated this year. Decomposing the print reveals that rent price increases were lower than expected, which is puzzling given the recent discussion about the dramatic upcoming increases in rents and condominium association fees. Additionally, the volatile components of electricity prices, charter and plane tickets dragged the figure down, while hotel and restaurant prices rose slightly.

On the commodity scene, the International Energy Agency (IEA) pared its 2024 oil demand growth forecast, projecting that global demand will increase by 1.1m bpd this year, down 140k bpd from its previous forecast. The IEA attributed the lower forecast to weak industrial activity and a mild winter, which reduced gasoil consumption, particularly in Europe, where the declining share of diesel cars had already been affecting consumption. This downward revision contrasts with the forecast presented by OPEC on Tuesday, widening the divergence between the two projections compared to earlier this year. Brent crude oil concluded yesterday's session somewhat higher at USD82.75/bbl.

Equities: Global equities rallied following a softer than expected CPI print. However, the sum of macro data was much more favourable for bonds as we observed some softening signs elsewhere, which equity investors basically ignored yesterday. This was in line with our expectations, and inflation figures will continue to dominate financial markets in the coming period. Note the significant number of new all-time high in equity indices reached yesterday, including those of the S&P500 and Nasdaq. This mention is noteworthy because of the bearish investors who, a month ago, were warning of an overdue correction. One month later, most major equity indices are 5-10% higher, and no one really discussed the risk of missing out on a rally... US indices yesterday, Dow +0.9%, S&P 500 +1.2%, Nasdaq +1.4% and Russell 2000 +1.1%.

FI: The soft bag of US data released yesterday provided significant tailwinds to FI Markets throughout the session as G7 curves bull-flattened and markets added to rate cut expectations for 2024. 10Y UST/Bund yields dropped 12bp to 4.31% and 2.42% respectively. Hence, long-end EUR and USD rates are now back at our 12M targets after trading substantially above for most of the past month. And with US macro obviously losing steam, risks seem tilted towards a prolongation of the current momentum. German ASW spreads ticked marginally up throughout the session, while credit spreads were close to unchanged.

FX: In yesterday's session, EUR/USD rose to the upper end of the 1.08-1.09 range, driven by a slightly lower-than-expected US April CPI and significantly softer US April retail sales. This generally resulted in lower global yields and a broadly weaker USD, which helped USD/JPY decline toward 154. The decline in global yields provided some tailwind to risk sentiment, benefiting the Scandies, with both EUR/NOK and EUR/SEK declining toward 11.60. EUR/DKK has risen this week and has reached the April peak again around 7.4615-20.",actionforex.com,news,Action Forex,Danske Bank,0.2078431372549019,453537354,1,https://www.actionforex.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/f-inflation31.jpg,

VITAS said that Vietnam was home to around 3,500 foreign-invested textile and garment projects worth $37 billion, boosting the sector's production capacity and making a significant contribution to export turnover.

The foreign-invested enterprises play an important role in the textile and garment sector, contributing 65 per cent to the sector's total export turnover. Major investors mainly come from South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and China. Among them, South Korea is the largest foreign investor in Vietnam's textile and garment sector.

The expansion of foreign direct investment (FDI) has boosted both the scale and capacity of the local textile and garment sector. Vietnam is still the third-largest textile and garment exporter worldwide, trailing behind China and Bangladesh. In 2022, the country's textile and garment export turnover surpassed $44 billion, a huge leap from $2 billion in 2000.

In 2023, Vietnam's textile industry posted an export turnover of $40.3 billion, down 10 per cent from the previous year due to shrinking demand from major markets like the United States and EU.

In the first four months of 2024, textile and garment orders have shown signs of improvement, with an export turnover of $10.3 billion, up 6.3 per cent on-year. The US is the top export market for Vietnam's textile and garment products, followed by the EU, South Korea, China, and Japan.

The industry currently imports nearly all of its cotton and spends tens of billions of dollars on raw fabric each year. Over the past four months, cotton imports reached over $1 billion, an increase of 20.2 per cent on-year.

The import value of fabric was up 6.5 per cent to $4.34 billion. The figure for textile yarn was $833 million, an increase of 22.5 per cent. Meanwhile, $2.24 was spent to import raw materials for textiles, garments, and footwear, a rise of 18.9 per cent against last year's period.

The leading localities in FDI attraction in the textile and garment sector are Dong Nai, Binh Duong, Tay Ninh, Long An, Nam Dinh, Hai Duong, and Binh Phuoc.

Central bank asks for close supervision of gold market

The State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) said that it has directed its branches in provinces and cities to closely monitor the developments of the local gold market, and at gold trading locations, and report to the central bank any case where people queue to buy gold.

The SBV stated that following the Prime Minister's directive and the policy of increasing the supply of gold bars to the market through auctions, since April 19, the central bank has conducted six gold bullion auctions and their results were publicised on its portal.

Three of the six auctions of SJC-branded gold bars were successful with a total winning bid volume of 14,900 taels.

Notably, the session on May 14 saw eight bidders buying 8,100 taels of SJC-branded gold bullion out of the 16,800 that the SBV offered for sale. The highest and lowest winning bid prices logged were 87.73 million VND and 87.72 million VND per tael, respectively.

The state-owned Saigon Jewelry JSC (SJC) managed by the People's Committee of Ho Chi Minh City, bought a total volume of 2,000 taels per session and immediately sold them in the market.

The central bank said it will continue to hold more gold bar auctions in the coming time, with the next session slated for May 16.

The price of SJC gold has fluctuated significantly in recent days, reaching 92.5 million VND per tael on May 10. It ranged from 89.2 to 90 million VND per tael at 3pm on May 15.

SBV said that the auction aims to ensure stable, transparent, and effective operation of the domestic gold market. It has warned locals to stay prudent when trading gold amidst the world's volatile market./.

Đà Nẵng wants to promote cooperation with Swedish partners: official

The central city of Đà Nẵng wants to promote cooperation with Swedish partners, especially when Việt Nam and Sweden celebrate the 55th anniversary of their diplomatic relations this year, said Vice Chairman of the municipal People's Committee Trần Chí Cường.

Receiving Swedish Minister of Infrastructure and Housing Andreas Carlson in Đà Nẵng on May 15, Cường introduced the guest to the city's socio-economic development, its advantages, and focuses in the coming time, particularly in smart city development.

Cuong said that Đà Nẵng city and Sweden have boasted a friendly relationship for many years. High-level Swedish delegations have visited Đà Nẵng and the city government has also had working visits to and activities in Sweden.

He expected that this year, the Swedish Embassy in Việt Nam and Swedish partners will coordinate to organise activities to enhance cooperation, and cultural and art exchanges, and hold international events in the city to promote cooperation between the two sides.

For his part, Andreas Carlson said his visit to Việt Nam aims to explore opportunities to strengthen bilateral cooperation between the Governments and businesses of the two countries as well as promote people-to-people diplomacy.

He said the two sides can cooperate more deeply in such areas as smart city development, and essential infrastructure such as seaports, airports, and urban transportation.

According to Andreas Carlson, in Sweden's new strategy on trade, investment, and global competitiveness, the country focuses on the Asian region and Việt Nam is an important partner.

Swedish businesses have had long-standing relationships in Việt Nam, he said, hoping that more such cooperative relationships will be established in the coming time. -

HCM City seeks stronger economic links with Australian partners

A business roundtable between Ho Chi Minh City and New South Wales state was held in Sydney on May 14, attracting representatives of over 150 Australian enterprises and investors.

Chairman of the HCM City People's Committee Phan Van Mai introduced the potential and advantages of the southern largest economic hub of Vietnam, along with cooperation opportunities for Australian enterprises.

He also highlighted the emerging areas the city is interested in, including science - technology, innovation, digital transformation and green growth, and calling on educational institutions and businesses in Australia to continue exploring investment chances in HCM City.

HCM City wishes to cooperate more comprehensively and intensively with Australian partners, he said, adding that it will keep working to improve the investment climate and assist investors.

Philippa King, Deputy CEO of the Australian Trade and Investment Commission (AUSTRADE), noted that Vietnam and Australia are enjoying sound trade, investment, and tourism ties boosted by their Enhanced Economic Engagement Strategy, signed in November 2021. On that basis, the two countries have succeeded in realising the common ambition of becoming one of the 10 biggest trading partners of each other within two years.

She perceived that Vietnam is one of the fastest growing economies in the region, making it extremely attractive to Australian investors.

AUSTRADE is implementing initiatives to assist Australian enterprises to further engage with Vietnam. It is also striving to establish an investment centre in HCM City and carry out the Southeast Asia Business Exchange to increase bilateral trade. A series of activities will also be held to improve awareness of business opportunities in Vietnam and across Southeast Asia, according to the official.

She added that AUSTRADE will lead a business delegation to Vietnam in June. They will focus on partnerships in cyber-security, financial technology, and agricultural technology and also introduce Australia's technological capacity and cooperation chances.

After the meeting, Mai met with representatives of four major enterprises of New South Wales which are planning to invest in HCM City.

Most of them said Vietnam still holds much development potential and boasts a young population along with a well-trained and skillful workforce, which are factors encouraging their investment in the Southeast Asian country.

They shared the intention to coordinate with HCM City to develop social housing, science and higher education, rooftop solar power, renewable energy, fast charging stations, and electric vehicles, among others. Some also wanted to learn more about local incentives for investment in technology and smart city building.

The HCM City delegation is paying a working visit to Australia from May 12 to 18./.

Over 400 domestic, foreign firms attend international food industry exhibition

The Ho Chi Minh City International Exhibition of Food and Beverages (HCMC FOODEX) 2024 opened on May 15 at the Saigon Exhibition and Convention Centre in the southern economic hub, with the event drawing more than 400 local and foreign businesses.

Upon addressing the opening ceremony, Nguyen Van Dung, vice chairman of the Ho Chi Minh City People's Committee, said the function is expected to support food production enterprises as they come together to introduce good quality Vietnamese products to the global market and vice versa.

It also serves as a platform to promote business co-operation opportunities between local and foreign manufacturers and distributors, as well as boosting market expansion, he noted.

The four-day event features 500 booths showcasing products from 400 major domestic and international businesses from the food industry such as Binh Tay Food, Sagri, Satra, and Vissan.

On display are a range of products in the categories of raw and deeply-processed food products, beverages, raw materials used in the food processing industry, machinery and equipment for production, packaging and preservation, as well as green and sustainable products.

The highlight of this year's event will be the business-to-business (B2B) sessions, aiming to connect food production enterprises with distribution units and international buyers.

Furthermore, a series of seminars and trade exchange events will be held during the course of the expo as part of efforts to assist firms in keeping updated on the latest information on trends in production, consumption, and orientations for potential export markets.

A cooking contest will also take place to introduce Vietnamese agricultural products through culinary culture.

Conference talks ways to broaden cooperation with Russia

The Vietnam Union of Friendship Organisations (VUFO), the Russian Embassy in Vietnam and Vietnam-Russia Friendship Association jointly held a conference in Hanoi on May 15 with the aim of sharing information about the situation in Russia and bilateral ties.

Talking points were focused on the current political, economic, cultural and social situation of Russia, cooperation between Vietnam and Russia, and potential for future collaboration.

In his speech, Russian Ambassador to Vietnam G.S. Bezdetko said this year both nations celebrate 74 years of diplomatic relations, as well as 30 years of signing the Treaty on Principles of Friendly Relations between Vietnam and Russia, while expressing his satisfaction with the development of political dialogue between the two countries.

ASEAN countries, including Vietnam, are important priorities in Russia's foreign policy in the Asia-Pacific region, he added.

The ambassador also talked about the phone talks between Party General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong and Russian President Putin on March 26 during which the two leaders discussed bilateral cooperation in the time ahead in security-defence, trade, culture, and tourism.

The Vietnamese Party chief used this occasion to invite President Putin to officially visit Vietnam soon and the invitation was graciously accepted.

Bezdetko stated that preparations for the visit are underway and it is expected to add fresh impetus to deepening bilateral cooperation between the two countries.

Concerning bilateral economic cooperation, Trade Representative of Russia in Vietnam V. N. Kharino said that both countries are working to effectively implement the Vietnam - Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) Free Trade Agreement to elevate bilateral trade to US$ 10 billion by 2025.

Numerous Russian high-tech and healthcare businesses take heed to strengthening their presence in the Southeast Asian nation, he said.

Cashew exports look to US$4 billion

Export turnover of cashews reached US$1.16 billion in the first four months of this year, representing a year-on-year increase of 21.2 percent, according to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD).

In April alone, Viet Nam exported 65,000 tons of cashews worth US$350 million, raising total export volume to 216,000 tons in January-April period.

Vietnamese companies regain control of cashew nut containers in suspected scam in Italy

Noticeably, the U.S. was the biggest importer of Vietnamese cashews by spending US$280 million to buy 52,000 tons, up 35.3 percent in quantity and 23 percent in value.

China ranked second by importing 31,500 tons, followed by the Netherlands with 13,700 tons.

Viet Nam has remained the world's largest cashew exporter with annualy revenue of about US$3 billion for 16 consecutive years.

Viet Nam's cashew export turnover reached a record of US$3.63 billion in 2021.

The country's cashew industry is facing serious challenges, especially the fiercer competition from Cambodia and some African countries.

At present, Viet Nam accounts for nearly 80 percent of the global cashew output./.

MARD checking 187 durian PUCs, PHCs

The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development has asked localities to strictly monitor PUCs and PHCs of durians after 187 units received warnings of violations.

The Agriculture and Rural Development Ministry (MARD) informed that at present, the proportion of durian codes under monitoring is rather low, at around 50 percent.

The Department of Plant Protection under MARD reveals that there are now 708 Production Unit Codes (PUCs) for durian on a surface area of over 26,000ha and 168 Pack House Codes (PHCs). However, the percentages of monitored PUCs and PHCs are only 52 percent and 47.6 percent respectively.

The provinces with low PUC monitoring are Dak Nong, Binh Phuoc, Vinh Long, Binh Thuan, Hau Giang, Tien Giang, and Dong Thap while those with low PHC monitoring are Long An and Dong Nai.

After receiving warnings from Chinese functional agencies about exported durian from Vietnamese contaminated with excessive Cadmium, the Plant Protection Department has established an inspection team to collect samples in localities mentioned in the above warnings. No samples were detected with the Cadmium level exceeding the threshold like being reported by China.

However, the Plant Protection Department admitted that localities now are not actively monitoring the status of durian growing and harvesting in accordance with the Protocol related to durian, and thus do not timely handle violations.

MARD requested stricter monitoring over all PUCs and PHCs to promptly discover regulation breaking actions in order to suspend or revoke the codes of violating growing units and packaging facilities.

Travel firms offer various tours, big promotions for this summer

Travel businesses are offering tour packages early to attract students in the upcoming long summer holidays.

This summer, domestic and foreign visitors will have an opportunity to enjoy the bustling atmosphere of the 2nd HCMC River Festival 2024 which is scheduled to officially open on May 31 and run until June 10.

The 2024 HCMC River Festival under the theme ""Legendary Ship"" promoting the land, people, and cultural identities of Vietnam in general and HCMC particularly will include a wide range of cultural, sports, and tourism activities, such as a spectacular fireworks display, a boat race, a swimming competition across the river, performance of water scooters, a floating market, introduction of waterway tourism products and others.

Saigontourist Group, a leading tour operator in Vietnam, has launched a special promotion program for this summer with 360 domestic and foreign tours. For domestic tours departing from HCMC, customers can enjoy discounts of up to 50 percent. Additionally, some sea and island trips to Nam Du, Phu Quoc, Nha Trang, Vung Tau, and Quy Nhon are also offered at competitive prices.

Tourist companies, consisting of Vietravel and Saco Travel, have also launched promotion programs to meet the rising travel demand for the upcoming summer holiday vacation.

Besides, a number of tours to Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, Singapore, China, Japan, and South Korea are also of great interest to visitors. Of these, a Cambodia land tour costs VND2 million - VND3 million (US$78-US$117) per person, and Thailand and China tour packages with flight tickets are VND6 million - VND8 million per person and VND14 million - VND16 million per person respectively.

The summer travel demand doesn't differ significantly from the five-day holiday for this year's Reunification Day (April 30) and Labor Day (May 1) from April 27- May 1. Foreign tours which are offering from VND8 - 15 million per erson attract many individual travelers and family travelers, General Director od Luxtour Tran The Dung said.

Many Vietnamese travelers are opting for outbound tours due to the significant increase in the price of domestic flights and tourism services, and the lack of shopping and entertainment areas, according to Ben Thanh Tourist.

Vietnam to import wind power from Laos

Deputy Prime Minister Tran Hong Ha has approved a proposal to import wind power from Laos submitted by the Truong Son wind power plant. This aligns with Vietnam's Power Development Plan VIII and applicable regulations.

The Ministry of Industry and Trade had earlier submitted the proposal made by the Truong Son wind power plant to the Prime Minister for the import of electricity, detailing a connection plan to bring 250MW of power from Laos to Vietnam.

This plan is essential for bolstering electricity supply and enhancing security, thereby addressing potential power shortages in the country in the upcoming years, said the ministry.

The investor of Truong Son power plant project had proposed selling electricity to Vietnam Electricity Group (EVN) with a maximum import price set at 6.95 cents/kWh for commercial operations commencing before December 31, 2025.

EVN assessed that importing this electricity, particularly wind power, would strengthen the power supply stability for northern Vietnam.

Ho Chi Minh City needs nearly $35 billion for 10 metro lines

The southern city wants to build 10 metro lines by 2060, over 510km in length, and with a total investment of nearly $34.5 billion.

In a recent transport meeting, Tran Quang Lam, director of Ho Chi Minh City Department of Transport (DoT), said that the department has worked with relevant departments and units to formulate the metro project, proposing development directions, investment forms, and capital mobilisation plans.

In addition, specific mechanisms are also brought forward to accelerate investment preparation procedures and facilitate investment in the city's urban railway network until 2035. New routes are expected to be added to the adjusted general planning for Ho Chi Minh City in 2040, with a vision for 2060.

By 2035, the city will have completed around 182.49km of metro lines, including Metro Line 1 (40.8km), Metro Line 2 (20.22 out of 62.8km), Metro Line 3 (29.53 out of 62.17km), Metro Line 4 (36.82 out of 43.4km), Metro Line 5 (32.5 out of 53.87km), and Metro Line 6 (22.85 out of 53.8km).

By 2045, the city will have another 168.36km of metro lines by completing the remaining sections of Metro Lines 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 and building Metro Line 7.

Accordingly, the remaining sections of Metro Line 2 are 42.8km, Metro Line 3 (32.64km), Metro Line 4 (6.58km), Metro Line 5 (21.37km), and Metro Line 6 (30.95km) will be completed. Meanwhile, Metro Line 7 will be 51.23km in length.

By 2060, the city will continue to build Metro Lines 8, 9, and 10, bringing the total length of the city's urban railway system to 510.02km. Specifically, the length of Metro Line 8 is 42.8km, Metro Line 9 with 28.31km, and Metro Line 10 with 87.84km.

The total capital for 10 metro lines in the city is estimated to reach around $34.5 billion.

At the meeting, experts said that the problem of capital resources is the key for the city to complete its urban railway system. The city should clarify the investment forms, capital mobilisation methods, and breakthrough mechanisms, especially financial policies, to fulfill the target.

Self-safeguard growing as a trend shaping future of payments

Businesses and consumers safeguarding themselves against emerging fraud threats is one of three key trends shaping the future of payments in Việt Nam, experts said.

A significant trend is the increasing adoption of cashless transactions by consumers. According to Visa's 2024 Global eCommerce and Fraud Report, refund policy abuse and first-party misuse are the most common forms of fraud affecting nearly half of merchants worldwide. With the growing popularity of e-commerce, customers are demanding secure payment methods and effective fraud prevention measures to maintain trust.

In response to this trend, payment companies have introduced various solutions to enhance security for businesses and consumers. For example, the Visa Acceptance Platform connects merchants to a global network of payment providers and technology solutions. Through tools like tokenisation and fraud detection, merchants using Visa Acceptance Solutions have experienced an average increase in approval rates and a decrease in fraud rates.

Visa reported that merchants using Visa Acceptance Solutions saw an average increase in approval rates of 2.97 per cent and a decrease in fraud rates of 70 basis points.

Another significant trend in e-payment is the evolving payments landscape, which is expected to become more diverse and complex, presenting opportunities for all stakeholders to leverage.

At the Open Payments Forum, which was organised late last week by Visa Vietnam, speakers said that as Việt Nam continues its journey to becoming a cashless society, more participants are expected to join the payment ecosystem, creating a dynamic environment for merchants, financial institutions, fintech companies, and payment facilitators.

Furthermore, customer expectations in e-commerce have evolved, with customers now expecting a more personalised and seamless shopping experience. To meet these changing expectations and align with the cashless and contactless payment trends in Việt Nam, merchants are advised to implement tailored payment solutions and innovative digital experiences.

According to the Open Payments Forum, customer expectations have dynamically shifted as meeting basic expectations for a great user experience and smooth omnichannel journeys has changed.

The future of e-commerce will incorporate a wider range of touchpoints, omnipresent purchasing opportunities, along with innovative digital buying experiences and products. Merchants need to offer tailored payment solutions to meet these changing customer expectations, and to keep pace with the cashless and contactless payment trends in Việt Nam, they said.

The growing need for digitisation in Việt Nam, driven by the desire for businesses to remain competitive, is accelerating the adoption of digital payments in the country. Mobile wallets, online payments, embedded finance, and smart checkout technologies are gaining popularity, following closely behind cash in terms of usage and preference.

Economic experts mull over best way to aid growth

Financial experts are weighing up the best options for Vietnam to support the country's still nascent economic growth and ensure financial market stability.

Vietnam continued its bumpy path of recovery in April, reflecting the highly uncertain global environment, according to Yun Liu, ASEAN economist at HSBC Global Research. Encouragingly, exports rose 10.6 per cent on-year, driven by electronics, which grew 20 per cent on-year.

However, peripheral risks are keeping near-term sentiment cautious despite growing confidence of a cyclical recovery in the global trade cycle.

""Some exporters have noted concerns stemming from the Red Sea disruptions of trade with Europe. Unsurprisingly, textiles and footwear exports, for which Europe is a major destination, stalled in its recovery, falling almost 3 per cent on-year,"" said Liu.

Despite this, the economist assumes that an expansion of Vietnam's manufacturing capabilities through robust foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows should provide a further tailwind to a stronger cyclical rebound as the broader trade cycle picks up.

New FDI to the manufacturing sector rose 50 per cent on-year, while FDI disbursements also rallied to a multi-year-high, exceeding $6 billion in the first four months.

Liu noted that inflation appears an imminent concern as headline inflation rose 0.1 per cent on-month, pushing the on-year ratio to 4.4 per cent, in line with market forecasts. This marks the first time in more than 18 months that inflation has been so close to the State Bank of Vietnam's (SBV) 4.5 per cent inflation ceiling.

Similar to previous episodes, the main drivers are higher oil prices and food inflation. ""The former reminds us of how acutely sensitive Vietnam is to the volatility in the international commodity market, whereas the latter suggests that even an exporter like Vietnam cannot be insulated from high food costs,"" said Liu.

Coupled with the latest downward pressure on the VND, there are concerns this could prompt the SBV to hike interest rates.

""We expect inflation to breach the 4.5 per cent ceiling in the second quarter of this year, before likely dropping below 4 per cent on-year in the third. Moreover, a rate hike in the face of still-subdued credit growth would be negative for the nascent economic growth, so we do not expect the SBV to move,"" Liu said.

In fact, banking sector deposit rates recorded a slight upward trend again in April, particularly in the second half of the month. Specifically, a number of commercial lenders such as VPB, VIB, OCB, and STB hiked their interest rates in the range from 0.2-0.5 per cent annually for both short- and long-term.

Several state lenders such as VietinBank and BIDV also adjusted to increase interest rates by 0.2 per cent yearly for terms under 12 months.

However, deposit interest rates are still at their lowest level for many years, and the rates of some state lenders for long terms are also listed at a lower level than the group of joint-stock banks from 0.2 to 1 per cent annually.

Can Van Luc, chief economist at BIDV, assumes that the SBV will continue to relax the monetary policy in 2024 due to a combination of factors.

""First, the world economy continues to face many challenges. Global inflation is forecast to continue its downward trend and domestic inflation remains under control, below 4 per cent. Second, major central banks worldwide are expected to ease monetary policy tightening through lowering operating interest rates, and lastly, the government and SBV will continue to prioritise economic growth goals,"" said Luc.

Luc expects that the VND interest rates will enter a somewhat more stable period in 2024 and the interest rates in general will remain at a low level, and increase slightly from 0.2 to 0.5 per cent in the second half of the year when credit demand recovers more strongly.

Danish firms to intensify policy dialogue with Vietnamese counterparts

The Danish Minister for Food, Agriculture and Fisheries, Jacob Jensen, is leading a delegation to visit Vietnam from May 14-16.

Danish Minister for Food, Agriculture and Fisheries Jacob Jensen and Vietnamese Minister for Agriculture and Rural Development Le Minh Hoan sign a Memorandum of Understanding on extending the government-to-government cooperation.

The minister's visit, which is accompanied by a group of Danish agri-food companies, aims to intensify policy dialogue with Vietnamese counterparts with a focus on a more sustainable food production and a resource efficient supply chain.

During his visit, the Danish minister has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Vietnamese Minister for Agriculture and Rural Development, Le Minh Hoan, on extending the government-to-government cooperation.

The cooperation will have increased focus on the green transition of food and agricultural production, aiming to promote a more sustainable and resilient food system for the coming years.

'Denmark's green transition in sustainable food production has led to the development of strong, innovative methods and approaches throughout the value chain, which boost production yield and improve product quality but at the same time consume less water and energy. We look forward to sharing these insights and inspire further collaboration with our Vietnamese partners,"" the Danish minister said.

During the visit, he also made a keynote speech at a workshop on Antimicrobial Resistance in agriculture and aquaculture.

During his visit in the South of Vietnam, Minister Jensen will visit Food Bank Vietnam, an important partner for the efforts to combat food waste and food loss. He will also pay site visits to a catfish aqua-farm in Tien Giang and an aqua-feed factory in Ben Tre, where close partnerships between Vietnamese and Danish research institutions and companies promotes the use of new green technologies and solutions for a sustainable aquaculture production in Vietnam.

On his last day of the visit, the minister will deliver a keynote speech at the seminar on ""Sustainable agri-food production - Danish innovative technologies and financing opportunities"". The seminar will provide a forum to connect and facilitate exchange of experiences, technologies, financing and business opportunities between authorities, local decision-makers, sector managers as well as Danish and Vietnamese entrepreneurs.

Light touch called for on gold trade

New measures to enforce stricter compliance and non-cash transactions in gold trading aim to increase transparency and regulatory oversight, but also raise concerns about their feasibility and potential disruption to traditional practices.

The State Bank of Vietnam's (SBV) Ho Chi Minh City branch last week mandated that financial institutions and businesses involved in gold trading rigorously adhere to the invoicing regulations stipulated by the Ministry of Finance, ensuring compliance with anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing laws.

""Businesses must also monitor the buying and selling of gold bars and publicly post transaction prices at their venues,"" a spokesperson for the SBV stressed.

In light of challenges related to gold bar transactions, the branch has requested that businesses promptly report back and offer suggestions for regulatory improvements. This directive is issued in response to frequent fragmented transactions in gold and silver, which often lack proper documentation, resulting in a transparency deficit and notable discrepancies between domestic and international gold prices.

The General Department of Taxation (GDT) has also been active, underscoring its recent initiatives to regulate electronic invoicing for gold transactions.

Earlier this month, the GDT also urged the SBV to help tighten monetary flows and consider enforcing mandatory non-cash payments for gold transactions. It also calls on local authorities to step up inspections and enforce compliance regarding invoice issuance.

Huynh Trung Khanh, an advisor to the World Gold Council in Vietnam, noted that a significant portion of the industry, comprising 5,835 gold and silver businesses accounting for up to 90 per cent of the market, has already adopted electronic invoicing. This development marks initial steps towards regulatory control over the sector.

Khanh, however, raised concerns about the feasibility of enforcing non-cash transactions across all gold sales.

""Mandating non-cash payments for gold transactions is not practical. Consumers, particularly the elderly who buy gold for savings, might be the first to react adversely, as not everyone has access to bank accounts or credit cards,"" he stated.

He argued that while such a regulation could work for large transactions or for specific products like SJC gold bars, it would be impractical for smaller, everyday gold purchases.

""To date, no business sector has fully implemented a non-cash transaction rule. Imposing such a rule on the industry would be stricter than the regulations stipulated on gold trade management,"" Khanh added.

Economist Ngo Tri Long also highlighted the deep-rooted preference for cash among Vietnamese consumers, particularly in rural areas, where gold is often bought as a small-scale investment or gift. ""Imposing a cashless rule could significantly inconvenience these individuals, many of whom are not tech-savvy and lack the means for digital transactions,"" Long pointed out.

He suggested that the proposal for non-cash payments should be limited to larger investment-grade purchases. ""A policy requiring non-cash payments for transactions of one SJC gold bar or more would be more feasible and align better with the current economic landscape,"" Long added.

Economist Vu Dinh Anh criticised the proposal as impractical. ""The method of payment, whether for purchasing one thousand taels or just one tael of gold, should remain flexible, as it does not effectively regulate the market or deter gold purchases,"" Anh remarked.

He further emphasised that banning cash transactions in the gold market would not address the disparities between domestic and global gold prices or the challenges in raw material imports, and could potentially worsen these issues.

There are experts who support the initiative. Nguyen Van Duoc, a member of the Vietnam Tax Consultancy Association and CEO of Trong Tin Accounting and Tax Consultancy, said, ""Implementing non-cash payments would enhance management efficiency, facilitate tax collection, and streamline macroeconomic governance, resulting in a more transparent and efficient economy.""

Duoc pointed out a significant oversight in current practices. ""We lack control over the amount of gold traded privately. Ideally, this initiative should have been enacted much earlier rather than being merely proposed now. It's time for the SBV to intervene. Proper legal frameworks need to be established to appropriately regulate these transactions,"" he suggested.

Despite his support, Duoc voiced concerns about potential barriers, such as limited public understanding and inadequate infrastructure for non-cash payments, which could particularly affect gold transactions.

""While not everyone is familiar with electronic banking, especially among older and rural populations, these are the minority. Overlooking these few cases may be necessary to achieve broader economic benefits,"" he remarked.

Nguyen Van Thuc, a senior tax and accounting expert, recommended a cautious approach. ""A preliminary survey or pilot programme should be undertaken before wide-scale implementation. This would allow us to make necessary adjustments and avoid any major issues during the policy's rollout,"" Thuc said.

Under the existing anti-money laundering regulations, transactions valued over VND400 million ($16,650) require reporting to the SBV. Businesses dealing in gold, silver, and gemstones, as well as payment intermediaries, must undertake thorough customer due diligence. This includes collecting, updating, and verifying customer information to gauge money laundering risks and ascertain the origins of assets.

Additionally, as per rules governing the gold market, entities are required to adhere to established accounting regulations, ensure proper issuance and usage of invoices, and are responsible for publicly listing details such as the weight, purity, and pricing of gold products at transaction points, maintaining accountability for product quality.

Forex rate hike dampens business performance in Q1

The VND-USD exchange rate has risen 5.9 per cent so far this year, badly affecting the performances of a slew of businesses in the first quarter.

These firms tend to have large dollar-denominated loans or big import values, leading to them incurring foreign exchange losses and badly affecting the profit picture.

In Q1 of this year, Power Generation Corporation 3 (Genco 3) under state utility group Vietnam Electricity saw its post-tax profit contract by $27 million, whereas it counted $25.8 million in profit one year ago.

Besides the fact that the average electricity price during the period was lower compared to a year ago, resulting in a drop in the company's power sales revenue, its foreign exchange losses amounted to $25.7 million in Q1, compared to $7.1 million profit in the same period last year.

At the end of Q1, Genco 3 reported $1.43 billion in loans, encompassing over $223 million in short-term and about $1.21 billion in long-term loans. The loans are mostly in US dollars, Chinese renminbi, and Japanese yen, and were used to expedite a raft of sizable hydro and thermal power plants.

For textile and apparel firms, state-run Vietnam Textile and Garment Group (Vinatex) bagged $164.8 million in net revenue in Q1, down 6 per cent on-year.

Thanks to cost-saving measures, Vinatex counted $14.3 million in accrued profit during the period, up 5 per cent on-year.

Member units under Vinatex, however, mostly have dollar loans for production and business activities.

With the surging forex rate, Vinatex incurred $1.9 million in foreign exchange losses during the period, double compared to one year ago.

Its post-tax profit during the period shed 35 per cent on-year, falling to a mere $1.52 million.

At private-held southern major Century Synthetic Fiber Corporation (STK), the company counted $11.07 million in revenue in Q1, down 8 per cent on-year, yet its accrued profit amounted to $13.4 million, almost double on-year thanks to cost-saving measures.

Foreign exchange losses during the period, however, reached $316,600, pulling the company's post-tax profit to nearly $30,000 during the period, shedding 56 per cent on-year.

In the group of retailers, MobileWorld Investment Corporation (MWG), the number-one company in mobile and electronics retail, counted $4.25 million in foreign exchange losses in Q1 of this year, compared to zero in the same period last year.

Similarly, leading steelmaker Hoa Phat Group reported $9.62 million in implemented foreign exchange losses and $7.6 million from unimplemented foreign exchange losses in Q1.

As for national flag carrier Vietnam Airlines, in Q1 of this year the company incurred $32.1 million in foreign exchange losses, triple that from a year ago, driving its financial costs to $61.2 million, which was double compared to last year.

At PetroVietnam Drilling and Well Services Corporation (PV Drilling), foreign exchange losses in Q1 came to $2.2 million, up 83 per cent on-year.

Do Duc Chien, deputy chairman of PV Drilling, revealed that as the company has multiple loans in foreign currencies and most of its investments are counted in US dollars, the solution to restrict foreign exchange risks is negotiating with its partners to make USD payments and only shifting USD into VND when necessary, while striving to keep its USD balance at the highest possible level.

In addition, PV Drilling is using derivative products from the SBV to stabilise the greenback amid market volatility.

Vietcombank Securities JSC assumed that as the exchange rate pressure is eminent because the US Federal Reserve is keeping interest rates and the dollar index high, meanwhile the VND interest rate will remain low.

This means that the risk associated with incurring foreign exchange losses will last until the Fed moves towards lowering interest rates.

Experts forecast that the Fed will commence rate cuts in the second half of this year.

Masan, Japanese partner reach framework agreement

Masan High-Tech Materials (HNX-UpCOM: MSR) announced on May 14 that it had reached a framework agreement with Mitsubishi Materials Corporation Group of Japan.

MMC Group intends to acquire 100 per cent of H.C. Starck Holding (Germany) GmbH from Masan High-Tech Materials.

The parties will enter into a long-term, win-win APT and tungsten oxide offtake agreement.

Masan is expected to retain its ownership in Nyobolt, a fast-charging lithium-ion battery technology company based in the UK.

Masan is also expected to retain potential monetary upside from future commercialisation of blackmass technology intellectual property developed by HCS.

In 2020 Masan High-Tech Materials acquired 100 per cent of HCS with the goal of bringing tungsten recycling technology to Việt Nam to transition itself to a more circular and sustainable business model.

In the same year MHT entered into a partnership with MMC Group.

However, due to regulatory constraints limiting MHT's ability to import tungsten scrap into Việt Nam to implement its recycling strategy, MHT intends to sell 100 per cent of HCS to MMC Group to focus on optimising its domestic operations.

This framework agreement marks the next step in the parties' business cooperation.

The use of proceeds from the envisaged transactions will be to reduce MHT's outstanding debt balance. The offtake agreement with MMC Group anchors MHT's tungsten products order book and enables it to maximise its overall order book.

The retention of Nyobolt is strategic and there is significant potential upside: in July 2023 the company successfully demonstrated an EV concept with six-minute charging.

Nyobolt has also signed Head of Terms with two major commercial customers and is in the final stage of finalising contracts, demonstrating significant progress towards commercialisation.

The combined transactions are expected to be accretive to Masan Group's consolidated earnings and are consistent with the group's deleveraging target of net debt to EBITDA of 3.5 times or less.

This also marks the first step in the group's continuing journey to reduce interest in non-core businesses.

MMC Group's potential acquisition of HCS plays to its strengths in the mid- and down-stream portions of the tungsten value chain.

The acquisition will provide MMC Group with access to HCS's production hubs in Europe, North America and China as well as a comprehensive tungsten scrap recycling platform backed by proprietary intellectual property including 90 worldwide patents and another 53 in the application phase.

Binding agreements between the parties shall be subject to further discussions and customary corporate approvals.

Masan High-Tech Materials is the global leader in providing advanced tungsten materials used in key industries such as electronics, chemical, automotive, aviation and aerospace, energy, and pharmaceuticals with production facilities in Việt Nam, Germany, Canada, and China.

As the largest manufacturer of mid-stream tungsten products outside of China, the company has a research and development centre each in Germany and Việt Nam, and it is currently operating the Núi Pháo polymetallic mine and a state-of-the-art tungsten processing plant in Thái Nguyên Province.

It is also a globally significant producer of fluorite and bismuth.

HCS, a wholly owned subsidiary of Masan High Tech Materials, is the world's leading manufacturer of high-quality tungsten powder tailored to individual customer needs.

MMC Group is an ""integrated materials manufacturer"", providing such basic materials as copper and cement.

The group also manufactures and sells mechanical parts, electronic materials and components used in automobiles, home appliances and others, and the tools used to make them.

It is also involved in recycling and the energy business.

Ensure feasibility of direct power purchase mechanism: Deputy PM

Deputy Prime Minister Trần Hồng Hà asked to focus on ensuring feasibility of the direct power purchase agreement (DPPA) mechanism to create a foundation for a competitive power market.

Speaking at the meeting discussing the draft decree on DPPA on Tuesday, Hà said that the implementation of power policies remains slow due to the lack and inconsistency in the legal framework.

DPPA is considered a foundation for Việt Nam to develop a competitive power market in which the State management will be separated from electricity production, transmission and distribution. The State management will only focus on ensuring the national energy security while enterprises, whether state-owned or private, can compete equally, Hà stressed.

The DPPA decree needs to clarify participants, responsibilities and obligations of parties to ensure economic benefits and grid safety.

In addition, it is necessary to develop policies to encourage the use of green and renewable energy to get green credits.

With regard to the proposal of conducting direct power trading through private lines or investing in new storage system, Hà said that the regulations should be developed towards not regulating the capacity limits.

Hà asked the Ministry of Industry and Trade and Việt Nam Electricity (EVN) to calculate and announce the renewable power capacity which can be raised as a basis for reducing coal- and gas-fired power sources in the planning, emphasising that the eighth national power development plan (PDP8) does not limit the development of renewable energy providing that it meets technical criteria to replace other sources at reasonable prices.

The decree also needs regulations to ensure transparency in the use of electricity sources of enterprises for the granting of green credits.

According to Deputy Minister of Industry and Trade Nguyễn Sinh Nhật Tân, the draft regulates the direct power purchase to be conducted via the national grid and separate lines, implementation procedures and responsibilities of relevant parties.

The viewpoint of the decree is to ensure feasibility without issuing sub-documents.

Accordingly, direct power purchase through separate lines can be applied to customers who are located near generation sources with the prices agreed upon the generators and customers.

Direct power purchase through the national grid will be applied to customers who are located far the generation sources and conducted via the spot electricity market with fees including transmission, distribution, dispatching, trading operation, and others.

A representative from Việt Nam Electricity Association said that it is necessary to strictly manage the direct power purchase through separate lines to prevent rampant development and disruptions to existing planning.

The DPPA is expected to be submitted to the Government for consideration within this month.

Under the Government's power market development plan approved in 2013, Việt Nam aimed to develop a competitive generation market in 2012-18, a competitive wholesale electricity market from 2019 and a competitive retail electricity market from 2023.

However, the implementation failed to meet the target. Currently, the competitive power market are mainly formed for generation and wholesale while the retail market is still at early stage.

Vietnam's steel industry commits to green transition

More than 400 major industry players from the Asian steel sector, including industry experts, associated trade associations and government representatives joined the 2024 Southeast Asia Iron and Steel Institute (SEAISI) Conference and Exhibition in the central city of Da Nang.

The event featured a series of trade promotions and special seminars that introduce the latest steel production technologies and provide forecasts on global steel demand in the coming years.

The conference, themed 'Surviving and Thriving in the Decarbonised World', was a way for steel producers to share business strategies, their approach to advanced technologies and gain information from regional partners.

Chairman of the Vietnam Steel Association (VSA) Nghiem Xuan Da, said: ""The conference is an excellent opportunity for us to discuss policy development, technology and the challenges and opportunities of working towards a sustainable green steel industry.""

Dr. Edwin Basson, Director General of the World Steel Association, said global steel production has increased tenfold since the 1950s. The steel industry has been profoundly impacted by four major trends intensified by the pandemic, which have brought significant changes: technological advances, socio-economic transformations, geopolitical shifts, and notably, climate change.

Since 2015, Vietnam's steel industry has developed into one of the leading manufacturers in ASEAN for the production and consumption of finished steel products and in 2023 was ranked 12th in the world in crude steel production, with an output of 20 million tonnes. However, the industry remains a major greenhouse gas emitter and environmental impactor - responsible for 7% of national total emissions and about 46% of industrial processes, according to experts.

Vice Chairman of the Da Nang City People's Committee Tran Chi Cuong said central and local state management agencies need to focus on creating conditions for the Vietnam Steel Association and the steel manufacturing business community to have a successful green transformation, contributing to Vietnam's commitments made at the 26th UN Climate Change Conference (COP26).

""It is recommended that experts and international organisations pay attention and help support the Vietnam Steel industry in sharing experiences, technology, techniques, financial support, human resources and management solutions, in order to build, develop and implement a carbon neutral roadmap,"" Cuong said.

There was also an exhibition area at the conference, with steel companies from Southeast Asia and well-known brands from countries with advanced steel industries, such as Australia, Japan, and the Republic of Korea, participating./.

To meet travel demand, Vietnam Airlines will offer nearly 1 million seats on late-night flights on domestic routes in June, July, and August.

Deputy PM emphasises need for advanced urban railway technology

Deputy Prime Minister Tran Hong Ha has emphasised the importance of selecting advanced urban railway technology during the first meeting of a task force established to accelerate urban railway projects in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City.

The meeting, held in Hanoi on May 15, underscored the Government's commitment to developing a robust urban railway network in Vietnam's two largest cities.

Deputy PM Ha, who is also head of the task force, also stressed the need to ensure mastery of the chosen technology throughout the entire project lifecycle, from design and production to operation and management, towards forming an urban railway industry in the country.

The Ministry of Transport (MoT) and the two cities were asked to work closely together to build a comprehensive plan for urban railway development.

The MoT was tasked with promptly building mechanisms, policies and legal frameworks for the management and operation of the urban railway system. This includes issuing standards and regulations for technology, machinery, elevated and underground railways, passenger stations, organisational structures and workforce training.

During the implementation of urban railway projects, attention must be paid to developing the urban transportation construction industry, with key domestic firms involved, the leader noted.

According to the approved master plan, Hanoi will build 10 urban railway lines with a total length of 417.8 km while Ho Chi Minh City will construct 11 lines stretching around 229.1 km.

To date, Hanoi has completed and put into operation one line, the 13km Cat Linh - Ha Dong. Two other lines, Nam Thang Long-Tran Hung Dao and Nhon-Hanoi station totaling 24 km are under construction. Meanwhile, HCM City is building two lines - the Ben Thanh - Suoi Tien and Ben Thanh - Tham Luong, with a total length of 20.74km.

According to Chairman of the Hanoi People's Committee Tran Sy Thanh, Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City need to build an additional 18 urban railway lines, which is a significant volume of work that requires a comprehensive, breakthrough and synchronous solution package.",vietnamnet.vn,news,VietNamNet News,,0.2862745098039217,453530807,40,https://static-images.vnncdn.net/vps_images_publish/000001/00000Q/2024/5/16/vietnam-business-news-may-162024-aa0481325fb544b8963e9f9c56cb84e0-799.jpg?width=0&s=KN_IkSwHl7n0tmTAepM2NA,

But will they work?

By a quirk of geography, the Orkney islands, located off the northern tip of Scotland, are unusually well positioned to bear witness to the ocean's might. On the archipelago's western shores, waves crash relentlessly against the rocks. And within its numerous channels, the tides push an enormous volume of water from the North Atlantic to the North Sea and back again, twice every day, squeezing between and around the islands of Rousay, Westray, Eday, and a myriad of other ones.

No wonder the European Marine Energy Center, one of the world's leading agencies for developing and testing wave and tidal power technologies, chose to set up shop here; the nonprofit agency hosts both wave and tidal power testing facilities on Orkney.

EMEC's wave-energy testing site is at Billia Croo, located on the western shore of Orkney's largest island. On a relatively calm day last spring, Lisa MacKenzie, EMEC's marketing and communications manager, surveyed the gray waters from the Billia Croo site. ""We get an average of 2-to-3-meter wave height,"" she said, or roughly 6.5 to 10 feet. ""But we've had waves of over 20 meters"" -- more than 65 feet -- during ""really extreme conditions over the winter.""

The surrounding landscape is windswept and nearly treeless. Were one to sail directly west from this spot, ""the first bit of land that you would hit is Canada,"" MacKenzie said.

EMEC was founded in 2003 following a recommendation by the U.K. House of Commons Science and Technology Committee (now known as the Science, Innovation, and Technology Committee). To date it has received about $53 million in public investment; its funders include the European Union, the U.K. government, the Scottish government, and the Orkney Islands Council. More than 20 corporate clients have used EMEC's facilities, and more ocean energy converters have been tested at the center than at any other site in the world.

The Billia Croo facility opened in 2004 on land rented from a local farmer. An array of transformers, housed in green bins each the size of a compact car, lines the perimeter of the site's small parking lot. A modest stone-wall hut, which blends into the landscape, houses the facility's control center and is filled electronic switching equipment. The testing berths are offshore, where EMEC's clients can test all manner of wave-energy conversion devices, with cables running along the seabed to the control hut. Any electricity produced can also be fed directly into the U.K. national grid.

Waves, like the wind that produces them, are not a constant; both are inherently variable. And they are linked: Wind imparts energy to the ocean, which then dissipates as waves over a longer time scale. As MacKenzie puts it, waves are the aftermath of wind.

Harnessing the energy of waves is one way to draw power from the oceans; another is to exploit the energy of the tides. Of the two energy sources, tidal is more constant, given the tides' regular-as-clockwork response to the push and pull of the moon and sun.

EMEC runs a grid-connected tidal energy test facility located off the southern tip of Eday. ""We get a peak tidal flow over 4 meters per second, which is about 8 knots,"" MacKenzie said. ""So about half a billion tons of water passes through there, every hour, at peak tide.""

And that flow is comparatively predictable -- far more so than, say, wind or solar, which are stymied by calm or cloudy conditions. ""We can predict the tides 200 years into the future,"" MacKenzie said. ""Which means that we can predict how much power can be derived from the tides, 200 years into the future.""

There is no question that the planet's oceans contain enormous amounts of energy. According to a 2021 study published in Proceedings of the Royal Society A, tidal stream energy alone could provide the equivalent of 11 percent of the U.K.'s annual electricity needs. Power from the oceans is ""the largest untapped resource of renewable energy on the planet right now,"" said Rémi Gruet, CEO of Ocean Energy Europe, the world's largest network of ocean energy professionals.

The question is, can that energy be harnessed economically -- or is the idea of pulling watts from the water doomed to be a mere sideshow in the quest for green energy? After decades of testing at tidal energy facilities like EMEC and other smaller-scale facilities around the globe, only a handful of commercial wave and tidal power facilities are online, and they contribute a miniscule amount to the world's energy production. Even in Orkney, a leader in the quest to extract energy from the ocean, wave and tidal power account for just a fraction of the islands' energy consumption.

Notably, wave and tidal lag behind other forms of renewable energy. ""It's fair to say that we're nowhere near a wind or solar industry at this point,"" says Carrie Schmaus, a marine energy technology manager at the U.S. Department of Energy's Water Power Technologies Office.

Still, for the technology's supporters, the ocean is seen as a virtually limitless source of energy waiting to be tapped, if only governments step up with the public investment needed to kick the industry into high gear. ""There's an energy resource there,"" says Andrew Scott, CEO of Edinburgh-based Orbital Marine Power Ltd. ""The question is, what are you prepared to pay to extract that energy?""

On paper, the power of the world's oceans is indisputable: Tidal stream energy is estimated to represent a global resource of some 1,200 terawatt-hours (a terawatt is one trillion watts) per year, while wave power is even more abundant, adding up to almost 30,000 terawatt-hours per year -- enough, in theory, to meet all of humanity's energy needs 10 times over.

As promising as tidal and wave energy may seem, the list of obstacles to widespread adoption is significant: the formidable cost of scaling up the technology; bureaucratic hurdles; environmental concerns, including possible effects on fish and sea mammals; and, in the case of tidal power, geographical restrictions. There are also fears that rising sea levels could substantially alter ocean movements in a way that could impact current or planned tidal power facilities. In a 2022 paper published in the journal Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, Danial Khojasteh and his co-authors noted that ""long-term management decisions associated with harnessing the potential of tidal energy schemes within estuaries should be made with caution.""

The question of cost is paramount. Even though the cost of tidal and wave energy may be dropping, the cost of wind and solar are dropping even faster, said Brian Polagye, a University of Washington mechanical engineer who studies marine renewable energy. That means tidal and wave energy can be seen as succeeding and failing at the same time.

""Until your price comes down to the point where you're competitive with other forms of generation -- either because you're directly competitive, or you're being subsidized until you get to that point -- the technologies really can't take off,"" Polagye said. Nonetheless, he added, ""I do feel these are technologies that have a long-term role to play in our energy systems.""

Schmaus, at the Water Power Technologies Office, describes wave and tidal power as a nascent industry (as did others interviewed for this story). By way of comparison, she pointed out that in the early days of the wind power industry, all manner of turbine designs were tested. ""And then at some point that technology converged,"" she said. ""Now we have the three-bladed turbine we all know and love. Marine energy is still in that ideation kind of area. We have not had technology convergence yet.""

One of her department's goals, she says, is to learn from small-scale demonstration projects, scale up designs, and bring down costs. This scaling-up is just what Scott's Orbital Marine is trying to achieve in Orkney. They're the company behind the O2 tidal stream energy generator -- the world's most powerful such device -- located in the Fall of Warness, south of Eday, and connected to the grid via EMEC's tidal energy test site. (MacKenzie described the project as ""one of our biggest success stories."") The O2 is a 240-foot-long structure shaped like a submarine (though it stays on the surface), with two submerged arms, each supporting a twin-bladed turbine. In an interview in a cavernous exhibition hall at the annual All-Energy conference in Glasgow last spring, and later by email, Scott spoke of his vision for the company, and the potential of tidal stream power. He said that Orbital Marine hopes to add another six turbines to the Fall of Warness site over the next few years, and, in time, perhaps another dozen.

Scott acknowledges the forbidding technical challenges -- especially the difficulty of designing machinery that can withstand seawater's salt and grime for months or years on end. And he has seen his share of unrealistic proposals over the years. At times ""it was a bit of a joke,"" he recalled. People saw how much traction wind energy was getting, he says, and figured wind's success could be readily duplicated beneath the waves.

""People would say, 'Just go and 'marinize' it, and it will be equally successful in the tidal application,"" he continued. ""It was as naïve as that.""

But many of those early challenges have been overcome, Scott said. He noted that O2 is currently providing about 10 percent of Orkney's electricity, enough to power about 2,000 homes. Because the islands are sparsely populated, and rich in wind energy, Orkney actually produces more energy than is needed locally, which means the islands are already a net contributor to the U.K. grid -- and some of that energy comes from O2. Scott said he foresees Orbital Marine generating about $17.5 million from electricity sales per year, over the turbine array's projected 20-year life. ""We're effectively at that critical stage where we start to grow commercial revenues and profits,"" Scott said.

Of course, most parts of the world are not blessed with Orkney's extreme tidal flows. ""It is niche,"" Scott acknowledged. ""But where it does exist, it represents a phenomenally dense form of renewable energy. Because water is 800 times the density of air.""

While some regions have more powerful tides than others, waves can be found pretty much everywhere that ocean meets land. During a visit to the FloWave Ocean Energy Research Facility on the campus of the University of Edinburgh, a crew from a company called Mocean Energy tested a floating wave-energy converter in a massive circular water tank, some 80 feet across. Paddles along the perimeter of the tank create waves that strive to mimic the conditions of the open seas.

So far, there's no one preferred way to extract energy from waves -- just as there's no one preferred way to build a tidal stream turbine -- so various designs are being tested. The one Mocean was testing uses a simple electrical generator to convert the kinetic energy of the waves into electricity. As Mocean's converter bobbed in response to the waves, Chris Retzler, the company's technical director and co-founder, spoke of the path to commercialization, saying he hoped to have a product on the market in 12 to 18 months, and ""a much larger-scale, grid-connected machine"" in three to four years.

For now, both wave energy and tidal energy lag behind wind in terms of investment and commercialization, but the gap may be closing, Retzler said. ""The wind industry, of course, has been phenomenally successful -- but it started in much the same way, with small-scale experimentation, gradually building up,"" he says. ""And we're following a similar pattern here. We learn by doing.""

Retzler also noted that there is a natural symbiosis between wave energy, with its long-term dependability, and wind and solar, which have much greater hour-to-hour and day-to day fluctuations. ""The ocean is storing wind energy over time,"" he said. ""Waves take a while to build up, and then a long while to decay. That smooths out the production of energy. So wave energy can provide a more stable contribution, and therefore can fill in the gaps that are left by wind and solar.""

The United States has not traditionally been a big player in ocean power technologies, though that may be changing. An established testing facility known as PacWave North, located off the coast of Oregon, will soon be joined by PacWave South, a larger facility now under construction in deeper waters south of Newport. PacWave, funded by the Department of Energy, the State of Oregon, and other public and private entities, bills itself as the first pre-permitted, utility-scale, grid-connected, open-water test facility in the U.S.

Burke Hales, an oceanographer at Oregon State University and PacWave's chief scientist, describes PacWave as conceptually similar to Scotland's EMEC, which was one of PacWave's design partners. ""PacWave will be bigger, [with] more total power capability, more berths, more individual devices,"" he says. Hales cites figures from the Department of Energy that suggest wave power could meet 15 percent of the nation's electricity demand.

While the Oregon coast is synonymous with pounding waves, other locations may be better suited to small-scale projects that take advantage of the local geography. For example, in the village of Igiugig, in southwestern Alaska, there's a demonstration project that draws energy from the estuary of the Kvichak River, via underwater turbines. That's seen as a vast improvement on the current situation, in which the community trucks in diesel fuel at great cost.

And other U.S. projects may be on the horizon. In 2022, the Department of Energy pledged $35 million in funding ""to advance tidal and river current energy systems"" in a move that represents the largest such investment in the nation.

Back in Orkney, a company called SAE Renewables announced last winter that they'd hit the milestone of producing 50 gigawatt-hours of electricity with their tidal stream array in the Pentland Firth, the strait that separates Orkney from the Scottish mainland. Further north, in Shetland, Nova Innovation added a sixth turbine to its tidal array last year, which has been powering homes and businesses in the area since 2016.

Across Europe, some 2.2 megawatts of tidal stream capacity were added in 2021, up from just 260 kilowatts the year before. By comparison, Europe installed more than 17 gigawatts of wind power capacity in 2021 (87 percent of them on-shore). By 2022, wind accounted for well over a third of Europe's energy consumption.

Tidal stream and wave power are not the only ways to extract energy from the oceans. In estuaries or bays with high tides, tidal barrages are another option, a practice dating back as far as 619 A.D. The idea is simple: Find an inlet with significant tides, and build a barrier with sluices that can open and close (similar to a traditional hydroelectric dam). Open the valves as the tide comes in, then direct the water through turbines as the tide goes out. So far, tidal barrages have historically seen more commercial use than tidal stream projects, notably in France (the world's first commercial tidal power project, on the estuary of the Rance River, dates from 1966), and in South Korea.

As with tidal stream power, tidal barrages could be a natural fit in specific environments. For example, as low-lying countries like the Netherlands and Belgium look to build dikes and barriers to protect against rising ocean levels, tidal barrage generators may be a natural addition to already-planned projects. There is concern, however that tidal barrages can impact salinity and sediment levels and disrupt coastal ecology.

Interestingly, the spot with the world's highest tides -- the Bay of Fundy, which separates the Canadian provinces of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia -- has also seen the most disappointment. The volume of water that whooshes through the bay twice each day could, on paper, generate up to 2,500 megawatts of power -- roughly equivalent to two large nuclear reactors, enough to meet Nova Scotia's electricity needs.

But efforts to harness those tides have been fraught. A tidal barrage power station opened on the bay in 1984, but ceased operations in 2019 following technical problems and concern over harm to fish in the bay. Tidal stream projects have been attempted in the bay as well, but have likewise struggled. Last year, a company called Sustainable Marine Energy Canada pulled the plug on its floating tidal turbine platform in the bay after five years of testing and $45 million in investment, citing bureaucratic barriers put in its way by the Canadian government. The company declared voluntary bankruptcy last spring, and in November one of its floating turbine platforms broke free from its mooring and ran aground on the bay's south shore.

One thing industry insiders agree on is that, for all forms of wave and tidal energy, the path to commercialization requires significant public investment. A 2019 study pegged the cost of tidal energy for one commercial-scale project at $130 to $280 per megawatt-hour, compared to $20 to around $40 per megawatt-hour for wind. But according to Scott at Orbital Marine, it's misleading to speak of tidal power as being expensive and wind and solar as being cheaper, because so much more investment has been pumped into the latter compared to the former. The green energy sector ""has all this legacy background in terms of state intervention and subsidy,"" he said. ""And the whole thing is structured around taxation and subsidy.""

The path to commercialization for ocean energy projects can seem like a paradox, said Polagye. ""Economies of scale occur because you're building a lot of things,"" and ""you tend to build a lot of things because they're the most cost-effective thing to build,"" he said. ""So it's a chicken and egg problem, right?""

Gruet similarly sees the supposed lagging-behind of wave and tidal power as the result of a lack of public investment. ""The industry has not received any subsidies in any shape or form in a similar way that the wind or solar industry have received in the early stage of their development,"" he said. ""And that has slowed down our development tremendously.""

He added that the cost of tidally generated power is already on par with that for floating offshore wind platforms. ""So tidal and wave are not lagging behind,"" he said. ""It took the wind industry 20 years to get commercial and 40 years to get cheap, between the 1980s and today, so we are still well ahead of the curve.""

For EMEC's MacKenzie, the latent energy of the world's oceans represents a chance for her own country to make up for past mistakes in the race for renewables. She recalled an incident in 1987, when the U.K. secretary of state for energy, Cecil Parkinson, spoke in the House of Commons about the potential of wind power. Sure, it was a good idea in principle, he said, but he ""cannot see the day when we shall be generating large quantities of electricity from wind.""

The U.K. hesitated -- and Denmark jumped in. ""Denmark absolutely won that race,"" MacKenzie says. ""And this is what we're really keen to make sure doesn't happen with wave and tidal."" (Today, wind power provides about one third of the U.K.'s electricity production. About 40 percent comes from coal, oil, and natural gas, while nuclear power and bioenergy provide about 15 percent and 11 percent respectively.)

For Scott, the power latent in the world's oceans is an important resource in the fight against catastrophic climate change, even if its total contribution remains small compared to that of other renewables. ""Inaction is not an option,"" he says.",goodmenproject.com,news,The Good Men Project,,0.08235294117647052,453518098,31,https://goodmenproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/ant-rozetsky-q-DJ9XhKkhA-unsplash.jpg,

About 250 miles from Madison lies Washington Island, Wisconsin --  the perfect vacation spot for those yearning for scenic bike rides, relaxing B&Bs or an otherworldly island.

Feels like you're exploring a Scandinavian island: Bike Washington Island

Boarding the ferry for Washington Island at the tip of Door County, I couldn't help but feel like I was back in Denmark catching one of the many ferries from Copenhagen to the country's mainland or its various islands. As I sat on the deck and watched the landscape recede behind the boat, I got that same feeling that I was headed to a place where the pace of life would be plenty slower.

For this trip, I'd hitched my bike to the back of my car and decided to lean even further into a slowdown by pedaling the island. Washington Island is roughly 125 square miles, and in just a few days you can cover quite a bit of ground on bike. (Just be prepared to do some riding on hilly terrain.) If you prefer not to haul a bike, Island Rides at the Dor Cros Inn and Island Adventure Co. both offer e-bike and traditional bike rentals near Detroit Harbor.

Pack a picnic lunch and loop along the southern and eastern shores of the island for a scenic experience, or bike north on Main Road to pack in a mix of stopping points. Grab coffee at the eclectic Red Cup Coffee House, stop at The Albatross Drive-In for soft-serve ice cream and classic drive-in food, and pull over when you see the grass rooftops of Den Norske Grenda Wood Shop & Art Gallery to shop for Scandinavian-inspired knits, paintings and wood carvings. Join the ""Bitter's Club"" with a shot of ""the cure"" at Nelsen's Hall Bitters Pub, the oldest continuously operating tavern in Wisconsin. Veer onto Town Line Road to visit the Norwegian-inspired Stavkirke church (which is free to visit 24/7) and Fragrant Isle Lavender Farm & Shop for island-grown lavender products and a cafe serving everything from lavender root beer floats to lavender macarons.

At the end of Main Road, find the limestone pebbles that make up Schoolhouse Beach. Stay awhile, or continue north to see the historic and natural artifacts at the Jens Jacobsen Museum, whose namesake was an early Danish settler on the island. East of Schoolhouse Beach, enjoy music and drinks at Fiddler's Green, and peek around the shop at world-famous Sievers School of Fiber Arts. Don't forget to keep your eyes peeled for sights that you won't find on the map, like the clock forest, quirky yard art, and other little surprises along the roadside.

Feels like you're at a northern European B&B: Stay and dine at Hotel Washington

It was the restaurant at Hotel Washington that really sold me on a trip to Washington Island. As I ate smoked whitefish dip, a creamy bowl of roasted beets and pepper pizza on the first night of my stay, hotel co-manager Matt Poole brought me a sample of soon-to-be wine his kitchen team had started fermenting from island grapes earlier that day. Then hotel owner Jeannie Kokes introduced herself and invited me to have my juniper and black currant ice cream at her table. I quickly realized that I'd struck gold, not only with incredible food, but genuine, small-town hospitality as well.

The historic hotel, which was originally opened in 1904 by Icelandic immigrant Ben Johnson and his wife, Effie, has been a site of conviviality for 120 years  --  and a fond memory for Kokes, who had been a lifelong island visitor. When she purchased the hotel in 2014, it had been closed for four years. With the support of two nearby farms she helped establish, Kokes arrived with a vision to bring the hotel back to life by recentering it around a thriving ecosystem of local farmers and producers.

In that spirit, the restaurant serves a rotating menu of dishes made with ingredients grown locally on the island (including at Hoot Blossom Farm and Folk Tree Farm) and elsewhere in the Midwest. Co-manager and pastry chef Amanda Ebenhoeh makes scratch bread for the menu, along with a line-up of novel ice cream flavors and fresh pastries for the Washington Island Farmers' Market on Saturdays. Pastries are also sold in the Honeymoon House Market behind the hotel, along with a selection of Wisconsin-made products, wine and souvenirs. You could easily eat dinner three nights in a row at the hotel restaurant, but staff recommended I take a night off to try the freshly caught island fish at K.K. Fiske on Main Road.

After those big, delicious dinners, I felt like the little bear in a nightcap on my favorite box of tea as I pulled the curtains closed on the twinkling lights in the front yard below and tucked myself into my soft queen bed in the Dragonfly Room. The hotel has several types of accommodations: Two guest houses on the property  --  The Livery and The Cottage  --  offer a more private experience, while the second floor of the main building has eight single guest rooms (all adorably named after flowers and critters) and two shared bathrooms. Just like at any good northern European B&B, I woke up every morning to a breakfast spread of house-made yogurt, breads and pastries, fruit, coffee and juice.

Feels like you're transported into a storybook set in the Icelandic countryside: Take the day ferry to Rock Island

The first time I visited Rock Island, I cried as if I'd never been that far from home before. My dad had signed us up for a one-week docent stay at the Pottawatomie Lighthouse on the island's northern tip. The lighthouse hadn't been functionally updated since the early 1900s: no running water, no AC or electricity, and it was decorated floor-to-ceiling in carefully preserved period furniture. I was 17 years old and only knew how to pine for familiar comforts.

But as I got older, that homesickness shifted into a longing to go back as an adult. Every corner of the island hid a new trail to be explored, and with it the hush of blue waves crashing into rock along the island's perimeter, glistening patches of sunlight on moss and ferns in wooded areas, and cool, moist sea air. The beach, across the island from the lighthouse, fanned out to cradle the cold Lake Michigan water. When I returned with a partner to camp years later, we indeed walked right off our beach-side campsite to the water's edge and watched the setting sun turn the sky to marmalade.

Rock Island is almost otherworldly to me. Not because it doesn't look like the landscapes we already know, but because it feels like a dream or a storybook depiction of real life. Adding to its lore is a small collection of stone buildings erected on the island under the direction of Icelandic American inventor Chester Thordarson. They include a mythic-looking boathouse, a stone water tower and a cropping of colorful cottages near the boat landing.

For a short escape, take the day ferry from Washington Island's Jackson Harbor over to Rock Island. Pack a picnic lunch and hike (no bikes permitted) the 10 miles of trails around the island, tour the historic lighthouse between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m., play the piano in the Thordarson Boathouse or go for a cool swim at the beach. To experience more of the island's magic, plan to book a campsite shortly after the Wisconsin DNR opens reservations for the following summer  --  prime weekends on Rock Island fill up quickly.

SACRAMENTO, Calif., May 15, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Federal, state, and industry leaders on Day One of the 2024 Pacific Offshore Wind Summit joined in encouraging California to advance its plans to deploy 25 gigawatts (GW) from offshore wind by 2045, as the state sets a course to be a global leader on floating offshore wind power. Speakers at the Summit, hosted by Offshore Wind California (OWC), urged the state to move expeditiously on essential next steps to develop offshore wind at scale - including investing in transmission and ports, procuring at scale, setting a permitting roadmap, engaging key stakeholders, building a supply chain and workforce training, and defining more lease areas to reach the state's goals.

The California Energy Commission (CEC) is finalizing the state's draft AB 525 Strategic Plan, which was released in January and outlines California's next steps to responsibly develop offshore wind and achieve its planning goals for up to 5 GW by 2030 and 25 GW by 2045. Last fall, Governor Newsom signed AB 1373 enabling the state to procure offshore wind at scale. Last December, California also joined the Global Offshore Wind Alliance and has now signed agreements with Norway, Denmark, Japan, China, and Scotland to advance deployment of floating offshore wind.

""25 GW of offshore wind is a landmark goal. We're all in on building this, bringing it to fruition, and doing it the right way,"" said David Hochschild, Chair, CEC, of the floating technology California is moving ahead to deploy 20 miles offshore. ""That means a very inclusive process, it means a lot of dialogue, and it means really trying to do it in a way that supports and uplifts communities. We see offshore wind playing a fundamental role not just in our climate strategy but our economic future as well. We're going to be adopting, if all goes well, California's strategic plan for offshore wind at our Commission meeting next month,"" he said to 700+ federal and state officials, industry leaders, and stakeholders attending the Summit.

""Now is the time to address climate change by supporting a thriving domestic offshore wind industry,"" said Liz Klein, Director, Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM). ""At BOEM, we are proud of the strong partnership we've built with California. We share your enthusiasm over the state's ambitious goals to reach 5 GW by 2030 and 25 GW by 2045. We held our first California lease sale in 2022. We're excited to continue our close partnership as you pursue the state's vision to be a leader in offshore wind, particularly floating offshore wind.""

In April, the Biden Administration announced its plan in the next five years for up to 12 rounds of offshore wind leasing, including California, to meet its national goals for 30 GW of offshore wind by 2030, 15 GW of floating wind by 2035, and a path to 110 GW by 2050. BOEM held its first federal auction for California offshore wind in December 2022, identifying five leaseholders to deploy an initial 7 to 10 GW off the state's Central and North Coast, according to industry estimates.

""In a California for all, we are creating offshore wind for all,"" said Jana Ganion, Senior Advisor, Offshore Wind, Office of Gov. Gavin Newsom. ""Offshore wind, if developed responsibly, is a cleaner energy solution at the scale we need to combat the climate emergency. Offshore wind also has the capacity factor and attributes to improve electric reliability and complement other clean energy resources such as solar. And because offshore wind requires supporting industry - ports, transmission, ecosystem management, supply chains - it has considerable promise to create high-quality jobs.""

""We are going to go big on offshore wind energy. We're going to go big on our climate goals. And we're going to go big on support for our local communities,"" said Assemblymember Dawn Addis, (D-San Luis Obispo) California State Assembly. ""It's important that as we move offshore wind development forward we're founded in science and we duly engage local communities,"" said Addis who Chairs the Assembly Select Committee on Offshore Wind and authors legislation to ensure offshore wind co-exists with ocean life and habitat and also to create a capacity-building fund for local communities.

""California is well positioned to be a global leader of floating offshore wind,"" said Ruth Perry, Board Chair, OWC, a trade group of offshore wind developers and technology firms. ""To make it a reality, Offshore Wind California is encouraged by the state's AB 525 Strategic Plan. We urge California to move ahead on the key next steps to responsibly develop offshore wind - which generates power night-and-day - and help the state meet its climate, clean-energy, and grid-reliability goals.""

The National Renewable Energy Laboratory estimates California's offshore wind potential at 200 GW, with more than 25 GW in BOEM's two lease areas and the waters off the state's North Coast. Deeper West Coast waters require floating technologies already deployed in other world markets. Reports show that developing 25 GW of California offshore wind can support thousands of jobs, supply up to 15-20% of the state's planned new clean energy, save ratepayers billions of dollars, drive economies of scale, and generate enough competitively priced electricity to power up to 25 million homes.

Offshore Wind California's more than 40 members include Burns & McDonnell, Crowley Wind Services, Fugro, General Dynamics NASSCO, Pacific Ocean Energy Trust, PG&E, Port of Long Beach, Shell, SSE Renewables, WSP, Vestas, and XODUS.

About OWC - Offshore Wind California is a coalition of industry partners with a shared interest in promoting policies and public support for responsible development of offshore wind power in California. Its members are dedicated to providing an independent voice and industry expertise to facilitate offshore wind deployment off California's coast. OWC undertakes public education and advocacy of this renewable resource as part of a comprehensive solution to California's energy needs. OWC is a nonprofit, 501(c)(6) organization.

RWE has had a solid start to the year: in the first quarter of 2024, the company posted adjusted EBITDA (adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) of €1.7 billion and adjusted net income of €0.8 billion. The reduction in earnings compared to the same quarter of the previous year are mainly due to lower earnings in the Flexible Generation segment, as expected.

Michael Müller, Chief Financial Officer of RWE AG: ""We can look back on a solid first quarter of 2024, with significant increases in earnings in both Offshore Wind and Onshore Wind/Solar. This shows that our investments are paying off. In the first three months of the year, 42% of our electricity generation came from renewable sources - and we are continuing to invest massively. Currently, we have projects with a total capacity of 8.3 gigawatts under construction. We confirm our outlook for 2024 and our target of paying a dividend of €1.10 per share for the current fiscal year.""

With net investments of €2.3 billion in the first quarter of 2024, RWE continues to expand its portfolio. Around €1 billion was attributable to the acquisition of three offshore wind development projects from Vattenfall off the coast of the UK. In addition, RWE invested more than twice as much in the construction of new wind and solar power plants in the first quarter as in the same period last year. Proceeds from the sale of a 49% stake in the Dogger Bank South offshore wind projects in the UK to Masdar had a counteracting effect.

RWE is currently building plants with a total capacity of 8.3 gigawatts (GW). These include the offshore wind projects Sofia off the UK coast with 1.4 GW and Thor in Denmark with 1.1 GW. RWE is also driving forward the expansion of onshore wind and solar energy and the construction of new batteries with more than 100 projects under construction in Europe and the US.

Business development in the first quarter of 2024 by segment

Offshore Wind: Adjusted EBITDA in the Offshore Wind segment amounted to €548 million, compared to €473 million in the first quarter of 2023. The increase in earnings is mainly due to improved wind conditions. In the same period of the previous year, these were below the assumed average.

Onshore Wind/Solar: The Onshore Wind/Solar segment recorded adjusted EBITDA of €341 million compared to €247 million in the first quarter of 2023. The positive earnings development is mainly due to the commissioning of new capacity and the recognition of the business activities of Con Edison Clean Energy Businesses in the US for the full three months. Moreover, wind conditions at the European onshore sites improved marginally overall, which also had a positive effect.

Flexible Generation: Adjusted EBITDA of the Flexible Generation segment decreased to €552 million in the first quarter of 2024 from €1,181 million in the prior-year period. The margins on electricity forward electricity sales and income from the short-term optimisation of power plant dispatch fell short of the exceptionally high level recorded last year.

Supply & Trading: Although the segment's adjusted EBITDA of €251 million was below the previous year's figure of €289 million, it once again reached a high level. A strong proprietary trading performance was the basis for this.

As of fiscal 2024, RWE has pooled the lignite-fired power generation business and the nuclear decommissioning activities under the name 'Phaseout Technologies' and has been managing them based on adjusted cash flows. This business is no longer included in adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBIT and adjusted net income.

Continued solid financial position despite high level of investment activity. As of 31 March 2024, RWE reported net debt of €11.2 billion. Due to the company's significant growth investments, the leverage factor, i.e. the ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA, is likely to increase in 2024. However, it is expected to remain well below the upper limit of 3.0 that RWE has set for itself.",marketscreener.com,news,Market Screener,,0.1450980392156862,453477654,7,,

This time around, participants debated issues relating to the competitiveness of the EU economy, energy, and the green transition.

Overall, the perspectives from the politicians taking part underlined something of a consensus on the need for reform within the EU, the slashing of bureaucracy and over-regulation, while also maintaining important existing protections and creating a fairer competitive environment.

The panelists virtually all suggested a focus on making the EU more business-friendly too, without compromising on essential standards and rights.

Appearing on the panel were: Yoko Alender (Reform), Annela Anger-Kraavi (Parempoolsed), Rain Epler (EKRE), Lauri Laats (Center), Rasmus Lahtvee (Greens) Liisa-Ly Pakosta (Eesti 200), Jüri Ratas (Isamaa) and Riina Sikkut (SDE), while the show hosts were Liisu Lass and Andres Kuusk.

On being asked about supporting the rapid implementation of the green transition, Jüri Ratas recalled his time in government, Ratas was prime minister late 2016 to early 2021, when the 2050 climate neutrality goals were approved.

""However, we must first meet our targets set for 2030, which is ambitious, but Estonia can manage,"" Ratas said.

""The most important point is the renovation of housing stock. The green transition cannot constitute a planned economy,"" he added.

""Changes will definitely occur, but it is crucial for Estonia that our business competitiveness is not lost. We must protect our firms via the European Innovation Fund. The concept behind the green deal is that we can play our strengths; Estonia needs to expand its energy portfolio,"" Ratas stressed.

The Isamaa European candidate, formerly Center Party leader, also noted that in addition to the existing Estlink undersea electricity connections, an additional, similar links needs to be installed.

Annela Anger-Kraavi meanwhile expressed concerns over the green transition, stressing that it should not compromise public welfare or be implemented via command economy tactics, either.

She said: ""Estonia did not stand up for itself in the European Council regarding the green deal, yet now smaller targets are being set for Estonia in the direction of a climate-resilient economy. That same minister has agreed to various treaties.""

Anger-Kraavi argued that Estonia struggles to advocate for itself within the EU and criticized what she called a lack of trust in landowners when it comes to biodiversity conservation, noting that species searches are being conducted on private lands without their owners' being made aware.

Rain Epler criticized the green transition as ideological extremism, aimed at reaping funds from a large proportion of the population and of businesses, to benefit a narrow interest group. ""This is harmful to the economy. For example, German industry has been relocating and downsizing.""

""There are also U.S. states which have switched to renewable energy, yet it's not sustainable,"" Epler went on, highlighting what he saw as the economic and practical challenges of transitioning to green energy.

Riina Sikkut contra-wise argued for the necessity of the green transition to prevent further environmental degradation.

Sikkut said: ""The green transition states that we cannot produce more pollution than we currently do. We need innovation to preserve biodiversity, though the transition should not come at the expense of lower-income individuals. This means they need to be compensated for it.""

""Leadership is needed to drive the Green Deal forward, but, fortunately, EU member states have agreed on climate neutrality,"" Sikkut added, highlighting the collective commitment within the EU.

Yoko Alender highlighted the green transition as representing not only a new opportunity but also one which is inter-connected with security concerns. ""We have so far been dependent on Russian fossil fuels, but the green transition will ensure our energy independence.""

""Dependence on China is also a significant issue, yet we also have rare earth metals, in Sillamäe,"" Alender went on.

Rasmus Lahtvee of the Greens stressed the inclusive nature of the green deal, stating: ""The Greens are talking about a green deal where no one gets left behind, neither people nor businesses.""

Lahtvee lamented the irony of criticisms directed at the Greens, given that it is other parties which have been making the decisions which have led to economic decline.

""It's almost funny to hear accusations aimed at the Greens. In Estonia, the Greens are blamed for almost everything, yet It is the other parties who have been making the decisions so far,"" Lahtvee said.

Lauri Laats also voiced concerns over the burdens of the green deal on Estonian people and businesses. ""If we make a giant leap in the use of electric cars, then we become dependent on China, as a battery manufacturer.""

""People needing to replace their home gas boilers -- this directly affects them. Switching from gas boilers requires funds, but these have not even been allocated from the EU; it's still under discussion,"" Laats continued.

Liisa-Ly Pakosta argued for necessary changes without sacrificing equality. ""If we don't want to burn up our planet, changes are needed, but they must be just,"" Pakosta said.

""Europe has already done much to break free from dependence upon Russian natural gas; only 5 percent of the EU's gas purchases currently come from Russia, and even that will soon disappear thanks to a new round of sanctions. People are not going to be forced to disconnect their gas boilers, and there will be no coercion in terms of home renovation. The EU provides funding, for those that choose this,"" she went on.

Lahtvee advocated for a smarter energy grid, citing the inefficiency of Estonia's current reliance on oil shale-generated electricity.

""Euro for euro earned, Denmark's spending is one seventh of Estonia's, primarily because we are using oil shale energy.""

""We need to eliminate support not just for oil shale but for all fossil fuels, to then grasp the real price we have to pay,"" Lahtvee argued.

He stressed that investments should be made into network security to ensure security of electricity supply in more outlying areas of the country, and that following the green deal in developing energy systems would facilitate this.

Liisa-Ly Pakosta outlined the EU's stance on oil shale, noting that while it hasn't been banned, it has been set at price levels which would discourage its long-term use. ""Natural gas hasn't been banned either; biogas can be used, for instance.""

At the same time: ""We need to accelerate our efforts to meet the renewable energy targets we promised to the EU 15 years ago,"" Pakosta added.

Pakosta also expressed concerns about accepting draft legislation from officials which may impose excessive obligations on Estonia.

On nuclear energy, Pakosta noted that: ""the EU has agreed that nuclear energy is clean, and should at least be considered as an option in Estonia.""

Epler argued that energy security in Estonia and in Europe could be ensured through oil shale, nuclear energy, and coal too.

""We have our own oil shale, and the scientific capability to utilize it. Wind and solar power are environmentally harmful methods of energy production, but France successfully built nuclear power stations in the 1970s and is now reaping the rewards,"" Epler said.

He also suggested that support should be eliminated. ""Once the subsidies are gone, wind and solar energy [prices] will skyrocket, because they have developed solely on the back of these subsidies.""

Sikkut questioned the long-term viability of mining oil shale and other fossil fuels, and suggested biogas usage alongside other renewable energies as a solution.

""During windless periods, we can utilize biogas. It's also important to manage consumption. There is potential to control things when we use energy,"" said Sikkut said, stressing the importance of energy efficiency and alternative sources.

Sikkut however argued against the need for a nuclear power plant in Estonia, asserting that the state can achieve energy security via other means. She highlighted the importance of domestic consensus as well, and a firm stance in order to strengthen Estonia's position during EU negotiations.

""Estonia has proved itself an excellent negotiator at the EU, but the problem lies more domestically, where we can't agree on what is necessary and beneficial for Estonia,"" she said.

""Ratas says there is a market for oil shale, while Anger-Kraavi says we need oil shale plants to produce shale gas. But we need to agree at home on phasing out oil shale, to achieve better results during EU negotiations,"" Sikkut concluded.

Laats said Estonia needs oil shale to maintain controllable energy capacities. ""This sector provides jobs. Why does Estonia want to be at the forefront of the EU in resolving all its issues?""

He highlighted the potential economic impact of transitioning away from traditional energy sources, suggesting that the energy deriving from the green transition in Estonia would be considerably more expensive even than current rates in the Scandinavian countries. ""Including all charges, the electricity price in Estonia would be 16-17 cents per KW,"" Laats said.

Yoko Alender argued that it is in Europe's interest for European countries to develop together.

""Europe can help, by financially aiding the construction of connections between countries,"" she said. Alender also outlined Estonia's ambitious 2030 goal of generating all its energy needs from renewable sources.

""This is not an insurmountable obligation. There is a clear link between well-being and electricity consumption: We need new clean industries. Renewable energy, coupled with storage and possibly small nuclear reactors, will ensure Estonia's energy security of supply,"" she elaborated.

Ratas commented on the idea of constructing a nuclear power plant in Estonia, suggesting that while research is the right direction, one must not be naïve about the challenges which this would bring.

""While back in 2000 Finland thought that it would be able quickly to build a nuclear power plant, it only recently connected to the grid. Estonia can produce biogas, plus the Paldiski pumped storage plant needs to be finished,"" Ratas said.

Anger-Kraavi stressed the paramount importance of energy security. ""Oil shale is not harmful to the climate if it is not burned, but we lack alternatives.""

For Parempoolsed, contesting its first European elections and only its second election overall, it is crucial that the market determine what energy type is worth using, not subsidies for certain types of technology,"" she argued.

Anger-Kraavi also referenced the apparent renaissance of nuclear energy, noting the availability of next generation small reactors, which she said could potentially offer a viable alternative energy source for Estonia.

During the course of the broadcast, all the panelists also responded to questions from voters, mainly on whether boosting the competitiveness of the European economy is a realistic goal.

Lauri Laats acknowledged the challenges, noting that both the U.S. and China have far outpaced Europe in recent years. He pointed out that the bureaucracy has been a significant impediment to business. ""Europe has been lagging behind, mainly because of the layers of bureaucracy, which stifles business initiative,"" Laats said.

Ratas concurred that bureaucracy is a barrier, and suggested that cutting it would foster economic growth and help the EU progress.

He also said that Estonia should advocate for more significant investments in the transport sector. ""Cutting down bureaucratic hurdles can significantly contribute to economic growth, and make the EU more dynamic and competitive,"" Ratas said.

Alender, too, identified bureaucracy as a hindrance and proposed that with the introduction of each new regulation, previous ones should be reviewed to ensure they are still necessary and effective.

""There needs to be a balance between regulation and freedom for businesses to operate efficiently. By revisiting old regulations, we can streamline processes and foster innovation,"" Alender argued.

Sikkut emphasized the importance of government intervention and support for businesses needing to be consistent across countries.

She added that innovation is difficult for a single country to achieve alone, and stressed the need for increased cooperation between nations. ""It's vital for countries within the EU to work together more effectively to foster innovation and support entrepreneurs,"" Sikkut said.

Epler highlighted that bureaucracy has become a significant problem, illustrating his point by referencing Elon Musk's approach at one of his companies, where he dismissed a team, only to rehire individually the workers it was felt were truly needed. This example underscores the efficiency gained by streamlining operations and reducing excesses, Epler claimed.

Anger-Kraavi commented on the issue of over-regulation in Europe, stating that the internal market has all but disappeared.

Her comment reflects a concern in some quarters that excessive regulation may be hindering the free movement of goods, services, and capital within the EU, undermining is a fundamental principle of the union in the first place.

Pakosta spoke about the disparity in support larger countries can offer their business sectors compared with smaller nations like Estonia. She advocated for reducing national support within the union, to create a fair internal market.

This position underscores the need for a level playing field that allows smaller nations' businesses to compete more effectively.

Sikkut agreed with Pakosta, adding that competitive advantages often come at the expense of human rights. She argued that regulation is not inherently bad if it ensures protection, such as in data security, highlighting the importance of balancing business interests with individual rights.

Lahtvee discussed the concept of a sustainable economic model, emphasizing the need to stop wasting resources and reduce bureaucracy. He pointed out the challenges faced by Estonian entrepreneurs who must undergo time-consuming certification processes in each country they operate in, which can stifle innovation and efficiency, he said.

Overall, the responses highlighted a shared concern among the politicians about the impact of excessive bureaucracy on economic competitiveness, and suggest a common interest in fostering a more business-friendly environment within an EU context.",news.err.ee,news,ERR,,0.2549019607843137,453469520,13,https://s.err.ee/photo/crop/2024/05/14/2396844h81det24.jpg,

Eco-anxiety, climate doom, environmental existential dread - as green journalists, we see these terms used a lot - and often feel them ourselves.

While there's a lot to be worried about when it comes to the climate and nature crises, we must not lose hope - because hopelessness breeds apathy.

The media has an important role to play in combatting climate doom. It's our job to be truthful and accurate in our reporting, not trying to downplay or greenwash the situation. But it's also our job to show that there is hope.

In 2023, as part of our ongoing effort to tackle eco-anxiety (both that of our readers and our own), we kept track of all the positive environmental news throughout the year. We racked up over 200 stories of eco-innovation, green breakthroughs and climate wins - more than double the number in 2022 and a sure sign of momentum.

In 2024, we're confident the good news will keep on coming, as renewable power soars, vulnerable ecosystems gain rights, and climate protocols start to pay dividends.

This article will be regularly updated with the latest good news. It may be something small and local, something silly that made us smile, or something enormous and potentially world-changing.

European cities are becoming climate CHAMPs. You could be one, too

A new acronym in the climate space is getting its sea legs after the United Nations climate talks in Dubai last year, COP28. And if you, too, want to be a ""champ"" for climate action and policy, then this one's for you.

It's called CHAMP, and it stands for the Coalition for High Ambition Multilevel Partnerships, with the primary focus on all things multilevel.

Portugal generated an 'historic' 95 per cent of its electricity from renewables in April, according to the network operator REN.

Renewable energy generation averaged just below that for the first four months of the year, covering 91 per cent of the nation's power needs.

Fossil fuels provided less than a quarter of the EU's energy for the first time in April.

The good news comes from energy think tank Ember which found that the proportion of electricity generated by fossil fuels in the bloc fell to a record low of 23 per cent last month - a sharp drop of 22 per cent compared to April 2023 despite an increase in demand. It also surpasses the previous record low of 27 per cent from May 2023.

Two men who were instrumental in creating a global seed vault designed to safeguard the world's agricultural diversity will be honoured as the 2024 World Food Prize laureates.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken lauded them for their ""critical role in preserving crop diversity"" at seed banks around the world.

More than 30 per cent of the world's electricity is now generated using renewables and the European Union is well ahead of this global average, a new report has found.

Energy think tank Ember found that major growth in wind and solar helped push global electricity production past this milestone in 2023.

Tuesday, 9 April will go down in history as a milestone in the fight for a liveable future for all.

On that day, the European Court of Human Rights recognised the climate crisis as an existential threat to us all and confirmed that our leaders must act immediately to protect people of all ages from accelerating harm.

This ruling will be a crucial tool to pressure governments to reduce emissions, and activists are already taking to the streets to demand much stronger government action.

Scientists have discovered what could be the first known smooth hammerhead shark nursery in the Galápagos.

The vulnerable shark species - so-called for its elongated head which forms a straighter curve than the scalloped hammerhead - is rarely spotted in the marine reserve.

Battery costs have dropped by more than 90 per cent in the last 15 years, a new report from the International Energy Agency (IEA) reveals.

It's one of the fastest declines ever seen among clean energy technologies, and provides hope that batteries can carry the world to its renewable energy goals.

Rewilding is often attached to the idea of ""letting nature take care of itself"", with minimal human interference.

But is less human intervention always better? Or the most realistic approach on a 21st-century planet, home to 8.1 billion people?

Not necessarily. In some cases, a human touch can not only be helpful in designing rewilded ecosystems but also remain a vital part of them.

Eurostar has promised to power its trains with 100 per cent renewable energy by 2030.

The plan was laid out in the company's first sustainability report. It details plans to reduce energy use, source renewable power, minimise waste and promote train travel as a greener alternative to flying.

From Pink Floyd to the Beatles, natural sounds have been enhancing music forever.

A new initiative will recognise nature as an official artist meaning singers, songwriters and bands who use these sounds can choose to add it as a featured artist. Some of their profits from streaming platforms like Spotify and Apple Music will then be shared with environmental causes.

More than 400,000 plug-in solar systems have been installed in Germany, most of them taking up a seamless spot on people's balconies.

New data shows at least 50,000 of the PV devices were added in the first quarter of 2024 alone. A boom born from Germany's ""very strong solar culture"", in the words of one expert.

Last year was the best year on record for new wind energy installation.

The world installed 116 gigawatts of new wind power capacity in 2023, according to the latest Global Wind Report from industry trade association the Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC). That is a 50 per cent increase from 2022 making it the best year on record for new wind projects.

New US limits on toxic forever chemicals in drinking water expected to save thousands of lives

The USA has placed the first ever federal limits on toxic 'forever chemicals' in drinking water.

The rule, finalised by the Biden administration on Wednesday 10 April, requires utilities to reduce the chemicals to the lowest level they can be reliably measured.

Officials say this will reduce exposure for 100 million people and help prevent thousands of illnesses, including cancers.

In a landmark decision, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has today ruled that government inaction on climate change violates fundamental human rights.

The right to respect for one's private and family life is the main legal basis through which the court has previous ruled on environmental cases, but this decision is ""historic"" regarding the climate crisis, observers say.

The case was brought by an association of older Swiss women concerned about the impact of global warming on their health. They claimed that the Swiss government is not taking enough action.

Born in New York and raised in Amsterdam, 29-year-old Wouter Draijer is CEO and co-founder of SolarMente - a company aiming to change the way people consume and distribute energy in Spain.

Deep in the Arizona desert, a Danish company is building a massive solar farm that includes batteries that charge when the sun is shining and supply energy back to the electric grid when it's not.

""Solar farms only produce when the sun shines, and the turbines only produce when the wind blows,"" said Ørsted CEO Mads Nipper. ""For us to maximise the availability of the green power, 24-7, we have to store some of it too.""

Belgium, current holder of the rotating EU Council presidency, has forged agreement between governments over new rules to tackle the growing problem of discarded packaging materials, overcoming the European Commission's concerns over trade diplomacy.

National diplomats have endorsed a new European law on packaging waste, including provisions that would hold overseas producers to EU environmental standards on plastic recycling at the risk of losing market access.

Germany's greenhouse gas emissions dropped by one-tenth last year, thanks to its investment in renewables and high energy prices which may have driven down demand.

Europe's biggest economy is trying to cut its emissions by 65 per cent, compared with 1990, by 2030. These latest stats put it on track to reach a cut of almost 64 per cent by that date.

Doing van life sustainably started with our build, where we repurposed materials, opted for hemp insulation, and used reclaimed wood for interiors. Choosing solar power over gas, we designed the van for winters in southern Europe and summers in the north to minimise our environmental impact.

Some people are surprised to hear that our carbon footprint is now about a third lower than before.

Nature-based policies from governments around the world have doubled over the last 12 months, a new study has found.

The report looked at 300 different policies around the world and found that around half of global emissions reductions by 2035 are likely to come from those aimed at ending deforestation, reducing food waste, restoring ecosystems, lowering agricultural emissions and rolling out nature-based climate solutions.

Employees of the Richmond Wildlife Center in Virginia are doing their best to act like mother foxes as they feed and care for an orphaned kit that found her way into their care.

In a bid to make this as natural as possible, they had to get a little bit creative.

Executive director Melissa Stanley took the unorthodox step of donning a hyper realistic fox mask while feeding the tiny kit from a syringe.

A French town is installing a canopy of solar panels over its cemetery that will distribute energy to local residents.

In the town of around 4,000 people, some 420 residents have officially registered their interest in joining the project. For an entry fee of just €5, they will eventually have a share in the energy it produces.

The European Parliament's environment committee has backed a proposal for mandatory monitoring and remedial measures with a view to restoring an estimated two-thirds of soils that are in poor health, jeopardising biodiversity and future food production.

US President Joe Biden is proposing a huge increase in fuel taxes for private jets. It is being pitched as a fairness issue compared with airline passengers, who pay special taxes on every ticket.

Raising fuel taxes for private jets could not only improve fairness in air travel, it could also discourage use of the polluting transport.

For 27 years, the heat in Regina Fred's Queens apartment building came from a noisy steam radiator that she couldn't control.

Sometimes it didn't come on at all, leaving her shivering. Sometimes, the radiators ran so hot that residents had to keep their windows open in the middle of winter for relief.

That all changed a few months ago when she got a window-mounted heat pump as part of a pilot project by the New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) aimed at cutting energy costs and lowering emissions.

Fast fashion adverts could soon be banned in France under a new proposal to crack down on the polluting industry.

The bill, tabled by MP Anne-Cécile Violland, also seeks to impose penalties on low-cost clothing to cover its environmental impact.

A flock of finches, the birds famously studied by Charles Darwin in his theory of evolution, have been reintroduced to an area of the Galapagos Islands.

Since 2023 experts have been working to eradicate introduced species which have caused the disappearance of numerous native species, paving the way for ecological restoration.

""This is a very special day,"" says Eliécer Cruz, Spokesman for the Jocotoco Conservation Foundation.

Wind power and heat pumps are obvious assets in the fight against fossil-fuelled climate change. But have you ever considered how well the two might work together?

A new report from UK climate action charity Possible has done exactly that - and found they're not only a match, but one capable of cutting energy bills by a third.

Clean energy tech slowed down growth of global carbon emissions in 2023, IEA says

Without clean energy technology, global carbon emissions in the last five years would have been three times larger, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).

Global carbon dioxide emissions still reached a record high in 2023. But the new analysis found that growth in clean sources had led to a ""structural slowdown"" in energy-related emissions.

Even as energy demand increased, the expansion of solar, wind and nuclear power helped the world to avoid even greater use of fossil fuels last year.

Lock gates have always been an essential part of Amsterdam. It only became liveable when the River Amstel was dammed to hold back the salty waters of the IJ.

Now the city has 200 sets of mainly wooden lock gates, offering an increasingly important defence as sea levels rise.

These fine pieces of woodwork come from a far more distant source than the 12th century fisherman who made Amsterdam's first lock could have dreamed of: the Congo Basin.

'Revolutionary': EU Parliament votes to criminalise most serious cases of ecosystem destruction

The European Union has become the first international body to criminalise the most serious cases of environmental damage that are ""comparable to ecocide"".

Ecosystem destruction, including habitat loss and illegal logging, will be punished with tougher penalties and prison sentences under the EU's updated environmental crime directive.

Spain is banning some short-haul domestic flights as part of its plan to reduce carbon emissions.

Flights with a rail alternative that takes less than two and a half hours will no longer be allowed, ""except in cases of connection with hub airports that link with international routes"".

A company in New Zealand is turning discarded woodchips into synthetic graphite that can be used in EV batteries.

CarbonScape makes 'biographite' by heating byproducts from the forestry industry using a process called thermo-catalytic graphitisation.

This produces charcoal, which can be catalysed and purified into battery anode-quality graphite.

The public high school of Antonio Meucci in Carpi looks much like any other in Europe: a hub of students eagerly awaiting lunch breaks, professors navigating peaks of motivation and resignation, while janitors run the halls.

But tucked away in a distant corner of the schoolyard, a mysterious fenced structure emerges from the trees. Accessible only to specialised technicians, a panel on the structure hints at its purpose: H2 Hydrogen.

This building contains the first green-hydrogen-powered boiler to heat an EU educational site, and it has zero emissions potential.

Just a few years ago, someone who wanted to install a rooftop solar connection in India faced getting multiple approvals, finding a reliable company to install the panels and heavy expenses before seeing the first surge of clean energy.

But that's changing. The government has streamlined the approvals process, made it easier for people to claim subsidies and pushed mountains of cash - including $9 billion (€8.3 billion) announced this month - to encourage faster adoption of technology that's seen as critical for India to reach its clean-energy goals.

Lawmakers reached a deal to further curtail air pollution across the EU and align air quality standards with the World Health Organization (WHO) in a bid to reach zero pollution by 2050, during inter-institutional negotiations in Brussels.

In a world full of division, anger and heartbreak it's cathartic to have something uncontroversial that we can all sit back and admire.

That's what the European Tree of the Year gives us.

Since 2011 the competition has brought together a selection of the most unique and beautiful trees from across the continent.

Barclays has announced that it will no longer fund new oil and gas fields, in a ""massive win"" for the climate campaigners who have been urging it to stop for years.

The British bank is the second biggest funder of fossil fuels in Europe, having been overtaken by French-based multinational BNP Paribas in 2022.

European 'Godfathers of wind' jointly win the 'Nobel prize' of engineering

The winners of the ""Nobel prize of engineering"" have been announced - and they are two European pioneers of wind energy.

Danish Henrik Stiesdal and British Andrew Garrad - often referred to as the 'Godfathers of wind' - share this year's Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering, as a recognition of their critical contributions to the development of wind power.

A new dinosaur-like species has been uncovered in Scotland, giving palaeontologists a precious insight into animal life in the Middle Jurassic.

Researchers from the UK's Natural History Museum first noticed a few bones sticking out of a boulder during a field trip to the Isle of Skye in 2006. That fossil has now been revealed as a new species of pterosaur, named 'Ceoptera evansae'.

A photo of a young polar bear napping on an iceberg has been handed the Wildlife Photographer of the Year People's Choice Award.

Nima Sarikhani's striking Ice Bed, captured off Norway's Svalbard archipelago, is a poignant visual reminder of how fast the ice caps are melting due to rising temperatures.

The winner said that while climate change is the ""biggest challenge we face"", he hopes the photo inspires hope.

One of Europe's deepest mines is being transformed into an underground energy store. It will use gravity to retain excess power for when it is needed.

The remote Finnish community of Pyhäjärvi is 450 kilometres north of Helsinki. Its more than 1,400-metre-deep zinc and copper Pyhäsalmi mine was decommissioned but is now being given a new lease of life by Scotland-based company Gravitricity.

Next time you hit the gym or jump on your exercise bike, take inspiration from the fact you could be powering a work of art.

While chances are you're the only one feeling the fitness benefits, a new tech and theatre partnership is proving that anything is possible.

Two specially created exercise bikes powered an entire play in the Lithuanian National Drama Theatre last weekend.

Ireland is set to meet its pledge of providing €225 million in climate finance per year to poorer nations by 2025.

Tánaiste (deputy prime minister of the Republic) Micheál Martin shared the positive news with the publication of Ireland's climate and environmental finance report for 2022.

California's collapsing marshlands have found an unlikely saviour in hungry sea otters.

The return of otters and their voracious appetites could halt one of the biggest causes of erosion, a new study shows.

Sea otters eat constantly and one of their favourite snacks is the striped shore crab. These crabs dig burrows and also nibble away roots of the marsh grass pickleweed that holds dirt in place.

Climate change was one of the issues at the top of the list for discussion during the recent World Economic Forum meeting in Davos.

From climate referendums to renewable energy, we took a look at the green credentials of the country where the global get-together was held.

Renewable power sources generated enough energy to meet 100 per cent of Scotland's electricity demand in 2022, recently released government data shows.

Green energy such as wind and hydro generated the equivalent of 113 per cent of Scotland's gross electricity consumption.

This was 26 per cent more than in 2021.

Heavyweights Germany, France and Spain are among 10 member states that have joined Denmark in calling for a 2040 emissions reduction target. This is in line with the advice of EU scientists who say net greenhouse gas output must be slashed to no more than a tenth of 1990 levels.

Denmark is the only country so far to have explicitly endorsed a 90 per cent net reduction target, which equates to a seven-fold reduction from current levels over the next sixteen years.

From a classroom in the Amazon's tallest treehouse, young Peruvians are learning how to defend their rainforest home.

Nestled in the crown of a strangler fig tree, the rangers have a bird's eye view over the canopy.

It's an education in itself, says Juan Julio (JJ) Durand, vice president of Junglekeepers - a nonprofit which conserves threatened habitat in the Madre de Dios (Mother of God) region of Peru's Amazon.

Scientists hope that the first pregnancy of a rhinoceros after an embryo transfer could pave the way to save the nearly extinct northern white rhino subspecies.

The method was tested in another rhino subspecies, with researchers successfully creating a southern white rhino embryo in a lab.

Scientists and veterinarians transferred two southern white rhino embryos into a surrogate mother at a conservancy in Kenya and confirmed a pregnancy of 70 days.

An area of Belgium will soon have new animal-friendly labels on food products.

In Flanders, a Dutch-speaking area in the country's north, packaging will come with information about animal production standards.

The new label, called Beter voor Dieren (Better for Animals), will identify products whose companies have followed ethical procedures when raising animals used for human consumption.

Single-use plastic bag bans have successfully reduced plastic bag use and associated litter and pollution, a new study has found.

Bans in five US states and cities with a combined population of around 12 million people have cut single-use plastic bag consumption by about 6 billion bags per year, according to the research.

Adopting a ban that's similar to the policies in these places could eliminate roughly 300 single-use plastic bags per person per year, according to the report.

Chile and Palau have become the first two countries to ratify a landmark UN treaty for the protection of the high seas.

The UN's High Seas Treaty was adopted last year after almost 20 years of negotiations. More than 80 countries have so far signed it but need to ratify it to be bound by it.

The treaty would become the world's first international law to mandate the conservation and management of marine life in areas beyond countries' national jurisdictions.

From being a kid trapped in a storm to walking the halls of power, 31-year-old David Saddington's life has been shaped by the course of climate change and climate action in the UK.

""It was already clear in 2005 that this issue of 'climate change' was going to affect my life and generations to come,"" he tells Euronews Green from the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos. ""So I took it upon myself to make a noise in my school.""

But his fledgling climate activism took an unusual turn when he was invited to Downing Street at 14, to discuss the issue with then Prime Minister Tony Blair. He asked the PM to put climate change on the national curriculum - a measure adopted in 2007.

The greenest city in Europe has officially upped sticks from the Baltic shores of Estonia to the Spanish Mediterranean.

Valencia took over as European Green Capital from Tallinn in a ceremony last week, kickstarting more than 400 sustainable events in 2024.

""Valencia has earned the Green Capital title because of its ambitious sustainability strategy, and it has learned from lessons in the past,"" says EU Commissioner for Environment, Oceans and Fisheries Virginijus Sinkevičius.

Scientists have discovered at least four new octopus species in a roughly 260-kilometre square area off the coast of Costa Rica.

""Through hard work, our team discovered new hydrothermal springs offshore [of] Costa Rica and confirmed that they host nurseries of deep-sea octopus and unique biodiversity,"" says Dr Beth Orcutt from the Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences who co-led the expeditions on the Schmidt Ocean Institute's Falkor (too).

The return to power of Polish prime minister Donald Tusk could see one of Europe's least enthusiastic supporters of climate action in recent years throw its weight behind a radical new 2040 emissions reduction target.

Poland's new government has promised a new coal phase-out date as it signalled support for a 90 per cent reduction in net greenhouse gas output across the EU by 2040.

Food scientists have found a way to make chicken nuggets and fish cakes out of otherwise discarded bones and hard tissues.

The idea is to reduce food waste and carbon emissions from animal agriculture, by getting more mileage out of the meat, thereby requiring fewer animals to be farmed for the same output.

Global renewable energy capacity grew by the fastest pace in the last 20 years in 2023, which could put the world within reach of meeting a key climate target by the end of the decade, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).

The Paris-based agency said rapid growth of solar in China was the main driver as the world added nearly 510 gigawatts - enough to power nearly 51 million homes for a year - with Europe, the United States and Brazil also seeing record growth.

Solar cells that work in low light could help your devices go battery-free.

California-based company Ambient Photonics has been working on indoor solar cells since 2019, improving the performance and price of this emerging technology.

The cells can be 'printed' in almost any size and shape for use on everyday devices such as remote controls and wireless keyboards, potentially removing the need for batteries and decreasing the size and weight of electronics.

South Korea's parliament has passed a landmark ban on the production and sale of dog meat.

Although only a small minority of people still consume dog meat in South Korea, the ancient practise has been the subject of sharp criticism from foreign media and animal rights advocates. In recent years, the country's younger generations have joined calls to ban it.

On Tuesday 9 January, parliament heeded their calls.

Bratislava is pioneering a new way to recycle cigarette butts.

The Slovakian capital's municipal waste management company announced a new push to collect and reuse discarded cigarettes in 2024.

During the city's Christmas markets, the group trialled special containers designed to collect both standard cigarette filters and those found in modern heated tobacco devices like vapes.

The city plans to use the discarded material to create asphalt for roads.

The UK government has announced it will relax planning rules on protected buildings in England to allow the installation of heat pumps and solar panels.

The measures are part of wider efforts to reach net zero targets.

As of 1 January 2024, organic waste recycling is mandatory in France under new 'compost obligatoire' rules.

With support from the government's Green Fund, municipalities must provide residents with ways to sort bio-waste, which includes food scraps, vegetable peels, expired food and garden waste.

Food waste is responsible for about 16 per cent of the total emissions from the EU food system, according to the European Commission.

If you've been living in the tiny EU state of Luxembourg you will already have had access to free public transport for the last three years.

Unsurprisingly on the anniversary of this novel and seemingly very expensive public initiative, almost everyone who uses trams, buses and trains in the tiny EU state says they're happy with it.

""Since it's free, it's easier to make a decision quickly, to choose between public transport or a private car. This means that it is very positive for the environment and practical,"" one man said whilst using the tram in Luxembourg City.

Lohne, 15 May 2024 - EnviTec Biogas AG (ISIN: DE000A0MVLS8) delivered a strong performance across all segments in the fiscal year 2023. The Group's total output increased to EUR 445.8 million (previous year: EUR 421.1 million), with earnings before taxes (EBT) rising to EUR 88.2 million (previous year: EUR 66.6 million).

Sales revenues in EnviTec's largest segment, Own Plant Operation, declined by 12.2% to EUR 236.1 million. The decline is, however, primarily due to the outsourcing of electricity trading of at-equity investments directly to the respective operating companies. Total output amounted to EUR 255.0 million (previous year: EUR 270.7 million). On the other hand, contracts and fixed supply agreements in electricity and gas trading, signed in 2022 on the basis of the above-average energy prices at that time, led to extraordinary income in 2023.

Sales revenues in the Service segment rose by 5.3% to EUR 48.6 million (previous year: EUR 46.1 million). Total output climbed to EUR 50.2 million (previous year: EUR 46.5 million). In the Plant Construction segment (including the holding company), a large number of construction projects were completed and finally invoiced in accordance with the German Commercial Code (HGB). As a result, revenues in this EnviTec segment increased particularly dynamically by 94.6% to EUR 132.1 million. Total output also picked up significantly to EUR 140.5 million (previous year: EUR 103.9 million). Business in the USA developed particularly well. Eleven plants are currently under construction there and further new projects in the pipeline.

The positive segment performance sent consolidated revenues rising by 8.9% to EUR 416.8 million (previous year: EUR 382.8 million). The Group's total output, which additionally includes the value of projects under construction, rose by 5.9% to a new record high of EUR 445.8 million (previous year: EUR 421.1 million).

Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) - including the contribution of at-equity and other investments - amounted to EUR 116.1 million (previous year: EUR 82.8 million). Earnings before taxes (EBT) also improved significantly in the reporting period from EUR 66.6 million to EUR 88.2 million. The EnviTec Group's consolidated net income for the year amounted to EUR 64.1 million (previous year: EUR 48.3 million). Earnings per share for the year 2023 thus rose to EUR 4.31 (previous year: EUR 3.25).

In view of the excellent earnings performance, the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board of EnviTec Biogas AG propose to distribute a dividend of EUR 3.00 per share for the fiscal year 2023.

""In terms of our key performance indicators, 2023 was the best fiscal year since the foundation of our company,"" said Jörg Fischer, Chief Financial Officer of EnviTec Biogas AG. ""Yet, it is clear that this result cannot be repeated in the short term, as there were many extraordinary factors that had a large impact in the fiscal years 2022 and 2023. At the same time, we see that major efforts are being made worldwide to decarbonise and secure energy supplies, which is leading to completely new market dynamics. As Germany's largest biogas producer with an international and diversified business model, we benefit from this constellation.""

As of the balance sheet date 31 December 2023, the EnviTec Group's total assets amounted to EUR 417.3 million, up EUR 76.7 million on the prior year reporting date. The equity ratio stood at 48.1% (31 December 2022: 49.1%). Cash and cash equivalents rose from 69.4 million to EUR 85.3 million and were therefore higher than bank liabilities totalling EUR 76.1 million. Despite the large number of plants finally invoiced as at the balance sheet date, the order backlog in the Plant Construction segment remained at a very high level of EUR 208.0 million (31 December 2022: EUR 217.7 million). Of this amount, EUR 171.9 million are already under construction and partially included in changes in inventories. An amount of EUR 105.6 million relates to the international biogas markets, mainly in France, the USA and Denmark.

Olaf von Lehmden, CEO of EnviTec Biogas AG: ""Since 2021, we have used our position of strength to implement the largest investment programme in the history of our company. In the reporting period, we reached a major milestone when we completed the conversion of BioEnergiepark Güstrow. We are also in the process of converting four other existing plants into gas upgrading facilities, including LCO production. Our team has also grown considerably again in the course of our expansion. It is true that we continue to face major regulatory uncertainties in Germany. At the same time, we have repeatedly demonstrated in the past that we are always able to respond quickly and flexibly not only to changing market conditions but also to opportunities that arise in the international biogas markets. We are therefore optimistic that our company will continue on its successful path in the coming years.""

For the fiscal year 2024, EnviTec projects total output (or revenues) in a range of EUR 360 million to EUR 400 million. The Executive Board expects earnings before taxes (EBT) to be between EUR 40 million and EUR 50 million. The decline compared to the fiscal year 2023 is mainly due to one-time effects in the own plan operation segment (Energy area), which will not be repeated in this form in the current financial year. At the same time, the Group's business volume and profitability are significantly higher than in the previous years, which underlines the dynamic development of EnviTec.

As The Sofia Globe previously reported, Bulgaria had the largest drop in greenhouse gas emissions in the EU in the first quarter of 2023, again had the largest drop in the second quarter of 2023, and the second-largest drop in the third quarter of 2023, all on an annual basis.

In the fourth quarter of 2023, greenhouse gas emissions are estimated to have decreased in 22 EU countries, when compared with the same quarter of 2022, Eurostat said.

The largest reductions in greenhouse gases are estimated for Estonia (-23 per cent), Bulgaria (-17 per cent) and Finland (-9 per cent).

Out of the 22 EU members that are estimated to have decreased their emissions, 10 also recorded a decline in their GDP (Estonia, Finland, Sweden, Germany, Austria, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, The Netherlands and Luxembourg).

Hungary maintained the GDP at the same level while decreasing emissions.

The other 11 EU countries (Bulgaria, Belgium, Czechia, Denmark, Italy, Spain, France, Poland, Portugal, Romania and Croatia) are estimated to have managed to decrease emissions while growing their GDP, Eurostat said.

In the fourth quarter of 2023, EU economy greenhouse gas emissions were estimated at 897 million tons of CO2-equivalents (CO2-eq), a 4.0 per cent decrease compared with the same quarter of 2022 (935 million tons of CO2-eq). The EU's gross domestic product (GDP) remained stable, registering just a small increase (0.2 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared with the same quarter of 2022).

In the fourth quarter of 2023, the economic sectors responsible for the largest reductions compared with the fourth quarter of 2022 were electricity and gas supply (- 17.2 per cent) and manufacturing (-3.1 per cent). Emissions by households remained almost stable, Eurostat said.

He'd hinted as much when the deal was first announced late last year, issuing a paean to steel's role in winning World War II and building the America he grew up in. The president from Scranton, Pennsylvania, was not going to abandon steelworkers -- or, more to the point, be seen as abandoning them -- in an election year.

""I told our steelworkers I have their backs, and I meant it,"" Biden said, assuaging the concerns of U.S. Steel employees who have been consistently against the acquisition. The Biden administration is scrutinizing the proposed takeover under the standard but utterly opaque procedures of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, and a final ruling could come after the election. Biden's rival fusses less with procedural niceties. ""I would block it instantaneously. Absolutely, "" former President Donald Trump said in January.

Oddly, a few days after Biden's March statement, his administration unveiled a $6 billion plan to help decarbonize energy-intensive industries, including steel. Further decarbonizing steel, a major contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions, is one of the first things that Nippon Steel highlighted in presenting its takeover bid last year, and U.S. Steel through recent acquisitions is already on the same path, investing billions of dollars in advanced minimills that use new technology (and fewer workers) to make cleaner steel.

But unions, which like the labor-intensive, old-fashioned, coal-fueled blast furnaces, see things differently. The older steel mills require more workers to make the same amount of steel, and those workers pay union dues; the newer minimills require fewer people and are generally nonunion shops. David McCall, the president of United Steelworkers, North America's largest industrial union, told Bloomberg News in April that, in the authors' words, ""securing specific investments that will ensure another generation of life at the blast furnaces"" is what matters to the union, not who owns U.S. Steel.

That battle between the past and the future is playing out in places such as Gary, Indiana. Gary Works, the largest steel plant in the United States and the rusting jewel in the U.S. Steel portfolio, has been churning out huge volumes of steel from its gigantic furnaces for more than a century. The factory makes more steel than the entirety of the United Kingdom and all but 20 countries. But it makes it dirtier than most.

The competing imperatives to keep old plants functioning -- to keep the unions at bay -- and to make cosmetic environmental fixes -- to pacify the administration and investors -- explains why U.S. Steel announced in April a limited trial program to capture carbon emissions at Gary Works. The problem is that the system would scrub at best 0.5 percent of the plant's annual emissions, and it wouldn't touch the rest of what comes out of the smokestacks. There are several pathways to green steel; this, for now, is not one of them.

""This is the largest single emitter in Indiana, and that is saying something,"" said Ben Inskeep, a program director at Citizens Action Coalition, Indiana's biggest environmental advocacy group. Coke, a coal byproduct used in traditional steelmaking, pollutes the local air in Gary to a degree that alarms even Britons. ""We have concerns that they are keeping the blast oven furnace open by locking in this carbon capture route,"" Inskeep said. He'd prefer a wholesale shift to newer technologies that use electricity, not coal, to make steel.

""Our vision of sustainable steel is going to first and foremost benefit the workers who are breathing this day in and day out,"" he said.

Steel doesn't invade headlines like fashionable metals such as lithium or cobalt do, and it doesn't monopolize attention or even policy the way semiconductors do. But there is nothing more central to the modern world -- not to the material world, not to the green transition, and certainly not to trade and economic nationalism.

Steel holds up skyscrapers and trade agreements between the United States and Europe. It makes wind turbines tall, new cars sleek, and old politicians nostalgic. It is at once a relic of the 19th century and the building block of the next. And it is where trade, industrial policy, national power, and the climate revolution come to do battle.

Today, the world makes more steel every year, nearly 2 billion metric tons, than it did during the entire 19th century; the growth curve for steel output this century is nearly vertical, with global production more than doubling just since 2000. And despite a brief slowdown in world production growth in recent years after the COVID-19 pandemic and thanks to stubborn overcapacity, steel output will only keep growing, as the appetite for new cars, new power plants, and new buildings continues apace.

Even as historic European steelmakers such as ThyssenKrupp scale back their production to fight off cheap Asian imports, India plans to double its production of steel to 300 million metric tons a year by the end of the decade. That is the equivalent of adding the entire steel output of Japan and the United States -- the world's third- and fourth-largest producers, respectively -- in just the next five years. China, which already makes about half the world's steel, is spending tens of billions of dollars to build new coal-fired steel mills, despite its own overcapacity issues.

Steel, which is basically iron mixed with a little bit of carbon to make it stronger and more malleable, has been around in artisanal quantities for centuries: The famous samurai swords and the blades using Damascus steel were made by hand with high-quality steel. But production at an industrial scale began in the middle of the 19th century with Henry Bessemer's breakthrough process to cheaply turn pig iron into molten steel. The flood of affordable steel allowed the rise of railroads and, after a little more technical tinkering, structural steel that spanned rivers and soared skyward.

Most of the world's steel plants today operate a blast furnace that uses pulverized coke to turn pig iron into steel -- essentially more advanced descendants of Bessemer's first plants in Victorian England. More innovative plants today use electricity to zap scrap metal into steel, a less carbon-intensive way to produce the metal but one that requires ready supplies of affordable electricity and scrap metal.

Either way, the uses are endless -- literally so, since steel is infinitely recyclable. A typical car uses nearly a metric ton of steel. A double-track kilometer of high-speed rail needs 240 metric tons of steel. A wind turbine uses about 900 metric tons.

""At its most basic, pretty much all your major infrastructure, buildings, bridges, energy systems, water supply, all of this is built with steel,"" said Kevin Dempsey, the president and chief executive of the American Iron and Steel Institute, a trade association. ""So what we need to live and move around in and do our digital jobs still requires a lot of steel and even more going forward.""

But steel is also central to the problem of climate change, accounting for about 8 percent of global carbon dioxide emissions. That's mostly because the vast majority of the world's steel mills are the old blast furnace and basic oxygen furnace kind, like the one getting a new lease on life in Gary or the dozens under construction in China and India. Those emit about 2.2 metric tons of carbon dioxide for every metric ton of steel produced. (The world makes about 1.9 billion metric tons of steel a year.)

Much like the nasty environmental impacts of cement, the other unsexy but utterly ubiquitous material of the modern world, steel's climate footprint was long considered virtually insoluble; the entire process involves huge amounts of coal and heat. But unlike cement, the bulk of steel's carbon emissions aren't actually baked in. Secondary types of steelmaking, especially melting scrap metal with heavy-duty electric arcs, can reduce carbon emissions per metric ton of steel by about 60 percent or more. Even more advanced techniques just being developed to clean up the iron reduction part of steelmaking by using hydrogen promise even greener steel in the future.

""There has been a lot of progress because there is a lot of demand for green steel from construction, from the automotive industry,"" said Julia Attwood, an industrial decarbonization specialist at BloombergNEF, a research and analysis firm. ""They all need to make things greener, and that is what kick-started steel.""

There is plenty of talk these days about government and corporate plans to decarbonize heavy industry, especially steel, given how central it is to the real economy and the one that politicians from Scranton to Shanghai imagine they must protect. The Biden administration is throwing billions of dollars at the problem. The European Union has a REPowerEU plan that aims to clean up steel, at least a bit. Nippon Steel, when not busy with its stalled takeover bid, aims to decarbonize operations on several continents. Even steelmakers in retreat, such as ThyssenKrupp, are spending money on next-generation technologies to ensure what steel they do still produce will be greener than what came before.

The push for green steel isn't just because the sector accounts for nearly one-tenth of global emissions. It is also because steel will underpin nearly everything that will enable the full transition to cleaner, greener technologies -- lightweight electric car bodies and power trains, massive new wind turbines, solar power arrays, and advanced nuclear power plants. Companies that are betting their future on making products for the carbon-free future can't build it with gear from a carbon-coated past.

""We're going to require a lot more steel if we succeed in moving toward a green energy revolution, in terms of wind, solar, nuclear, natural gas, whatever -- that's a lot of steel,"" Dempsey said.

""We had to reinvest in Oxelosund, a huge source of carbon emissions, so instead of doing that, we said, 'Let's look at the U.S. and minimills and look at doing something similar here,'"" said Martin Lindqvist, SSAB's outgoing president and CEO. SSAB's U.S. operations had experience with electric arc furnaces, which are much more common in the United States than in Europe.

Around the same time, SSAB had teamed up with ore miner LKAB and energy firm Vattenfall to use fossil-free electricity and hydrogen to make virgin iron with no carbon emissions to feed a steel mill. By 2020, the three companies had a pilot plant starting to churn out small amounts of fossil-free sponge iron.

With that in hand, SSAB decided to overhaul more than a single plant -- the idea was to remake the entire Nordic steel industry by turning old blast furnaces into more modern electric arc furnaces. One after another, the company is turning its old, smoky steel mills into sleeker, electric-fired, much greener plants. Just this April, SSAB announced that it was moving faster than anticipated to transform the big plant at Lulea, in northern Sweden, to all electric-arc operations. When the steel mill conversions are complete, it will lower Sweden's national emissions of carbon dioxide by 10 percent.

The goal is to produce entirely fossil-free steel at Oxelosund by 2026 and throughout the company by 2030. Just keeping the existing plants operational for another decade would have cost more than $2 billion. For about $4.8 billion, SSAB is creating a plant that will make more steel, with a better product mix, and almost no emissions.

""It's a no-brainer,"" Lindqvist said. ""It makes business sense. The customers are extremely interested.""

When it comes to green steel, the demand pull is indeed very strong. SSAB started working with automaker Volvo, and later Mercedes-Benz; both want to start introducing clean steel in their cars. Other industries that are under pressure to clean up their products are also increasingly clamoring for cleaner steel, such as the construction industry, Lindqvist said. SSAB gets some state assistance for its innovative fossil-free iron project from Sweden and perhaps soon the United States, but the company insists that the steel transformation is answering a market need.

""What we see now is very strong demand, even though Chinese steel is available at low prices,"" Lindqvist said. ""Politics and policy are very helpful, but in the end, this will be demand-driven.""

One of the industries demanding cleaner steel is one whose whole raison d'être is to make cleaner electricity: wind power. After all, it won't do very well to keep building new wind turbines with hundreds of metric tons of steel made from coke and smoke.

Last year, Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy, a leading wind power company, launched the GreenerTower, a wind turbine that uses steel with one-third the carbon footprint of traditional towers, and quickly landed its first customer, a Danish offshore wind farm of German utility RWE. Siemens Gamesa gets the steel from German steelmaker Salzgitter AG, using electric arc furnaces powered by offshore wind power.

""If you had asked me a year ago, 18 months ago, I would have said that before 2030, there will not be much green steel available,"" said Maximilian Schnippering, the head of sustainability at Siemens Gamesa. ""But in the course of the last year, things have really accelerated.""

Other turbine-makers, such as Denmark's Vestas, are offering their own towers made with green steel. Orsted, a Danish clean energy company that partners with Vestas on sustainability projects, just landed the first consignment of heavier low-carbon steel to be used for the foundations of offshore wind turbines. GE Vernova is just going straight to the source, providing new power management technologies for steelmakers to handle the fluctuating loads of electricity that come with the conversion to electric arc furnaces. Siemens Gamesa is now looking at how to recycle its own wind turbine towers for much-needed scrap metal to feed cleaner mills and how to source the rest of a turbine's steel needs with cleaner and greener steel.

""I think, over the course of the next two, three years, we will see quite green supply chains available,"" Schnippering said. ""I'm much more optimistic that things will go faster.""

It's not just Swedes, Danes, and other leafy Europeans. SSAB got the idea for greening its entire operations from the experiences of its U.S. division. That's because the United States is one of the greener steel-producing countries in the world, especially in its newest electric-fired minimills. Just over two-thirds of America's steelmaking capacity uses electric arc furnaces, with roughly the remaining one-third using the old-fashioned kind. Globally, the proportions are reversed, with China and India in particular betting on traditional forms of steelmaking to underpin their ambitious expansions.

A metric ton of U.S. steel made using electric arc furnaces produces about 600 kilograms of carbon dioxide; even China's most advanced plants produce more than double that. But the vast majority of China's (and India's) steel plants are old blast furnaces, which emit about four times as much carbon as the cleanest U.S. steel (and more than legacy U.S. steel plants, too).

""The United States has some of the lowest carbon intensities because of the electric arc furnaces,"" said Attwood of BloombergNEF. Even without waiting for new breakthroughs in hydrogen and other near-zero alternatives, she said, the most environmentally conscious option for most steel production is using recycled steel and electric arc furnaces -- especially as countries everywhere scramble to meet ambitious climate targets.

""To get to net zero, everybody has to decarbonize, so steel's time is coming,"" she said.

U.S. Steel, for all the flak it may take from environmental advocates for its continued operation of old-fashioned blast furnaces, is moving firmly in that direction. Between 2019 and 2021, before it became a takeover target in its own right, it spent about $1.5 billion to acquire Big River Steel, a minimill operator that runs one of the most advanced steel plants in the United States. U.S. Steel is investing $3 billion to build another state-of-the-art electric minimill nearby. Two cornerstones of U.S. Steel's new pitch are cleaner, advanced grades of steel that cater to environmentally conscious customers and specialty steel for the electricity and electric vehicle sectors. The shift to greenery, which Nippon Steel wants to take even further, is one of the companies' selling points for the stalled cross-border takeover.

If the United States, which is still the fourth-largest steelmaker in the world, can be so heavily tilted toward advanced, electric arc mills, why can't everybody? Why is the bulk of tomorrow's global steel capacity still turning to a playbook essentially written in the 19th century?

First, the electric-fired minimills, which are largely fed using scrap metal, still can't make all the grades of steel that industry requires. ""Scrap has residuals that can have a detrimental impact,"" said Dempsey of the American Iron and Steel Institute. ""For more advanced grades, for automobiles, the sheet metal, that is where you need higher virgin iron content"" from the traditional, integrated steel mills, he added.

Not all countries have access to abundant scrap metal like that found in the U.S. market; Schnippering of Siemens Gamesa predicts that there will be an industrywide scramble for enough scrap to feed the electric arc furnaces that produce cleaner steel. India's plans to build advanced steel furnaces may be limited by the EU's desire to keep more of its scrap at home to power its own decarbonization.

Not every country has access to reliable, affordable electricity to power the new-generation mills, either. Big River's plant in Arkansas uses the equivalent of 176 megawatts of electricity (1 percent of the entire state's installed generation capacity) to run its furnace, and a local utility is building a massive solar farm next door just to provide clean power to the mill.

But the United States has all those technical advantages -- and a friendly playing field when it comes to international trade. The Biden administration has maintained most of the tariffs that Trump levied on steel imports, ostensibly on national security grounds, invoking the Section 232 provision of U.S. trade law to levy tariffs on threatening imports. Trade experts then and now, as well as defense industry veterans, largely agree that the move was about everything but national security. The steel industry can reimagine those tariffs as an environmental measure now that decarbonizing steel is all the rage.

""You want to incentivize the production of clean steel in the United States, and the biggest threat is the threat of cheap but dirty steel that [other countries] are making in the same old steel mills they built 30 years ago,"" Dempsey said. He even suggested the idea of a border adjustment tax to penalize carbon-intensive imports, which would make cleaner (but pricier) U.S. steel more competitive.

It's not just a steel industry fantasy. Biden in May tripled the tariffs on imports of Chinese steel -- though China exports little steel to the United States anyway -- couching the measure as a way to protect U.S. workers from emissions-intensive Chinese imports. ""China's policies and subsidies for their domestic steel and aluminum industries mean high-quality, low-emissions U.S. products are undercut by artificially low-priced Chinese alternatives produced with higher emissions,"" the White House said in a statement.

And the administration is now talking about using tariffs even more in the future -- not on questionable national security grounds but as a climate change measure. That very notion has been at the heart of more than two years of stalled negotiations with Europe over a new, rich-country club of clean steel producers.

In April, the Biden administration's new climate envoy, John Podesta, suggested that the United States might be open to some sort of carbon border adjustment, a fancy way to say new tariffs on old, dirty products. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who has been vocal about a flood of cheap Chinese goods that threaten U.S. manufacturing, has floated similar ideas. All the while, Biden has been promoting a ""Buy America"" plan to make sure that his administration's massive investments in new infrastructure are built with U.S. steel and iron.

Between new tariffs and old economic nationalism, steel has become as central to the Biden reelection campaign in the Rust Belt as it is to the modern world and the green transition. But just how has a domestic industry that now employs a mere 80,000 or so people come to utterly dominate U.S. trade policy?

That argument, as old as U.S. political economy, was laughingly demolished in later congressional testimony. ""We, the steel men, don't need protection anymore. Protection now can only work a serious injustice to the consumer,"" the witness told lawmakers.

There is nothing unusual about that debate; it's the same one raging now among the White House, Congress, trade negotiators, and white-shoe law firms. The only odd thing about it was that both arguments came from the same man: Andrew Carnegie -- first in 1890 as the head of the empire that would become U.S. Steel and several years later as a retired, and less self-interested, philanthropist.

The question of special trade protection for steel is not, of course, something unique to Biden or Trump, though both have made it a central part of their economic nationalism message. Former U.S. President George W. Bush, too, raised tariffs on steel to woo votes, as did most of the presidents who came immediately before him. It goes back further: The decades after the Civil War were a protectionist's dream, and steel reaped the biggest rewards. U.S. protectionism for steel, in a very real way, goes back even further than the invention of modern steelmaking itself: Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton's 1791 Report on Manufactures immediately laid the groundwork for more than two centuries of tariffs to promote U.S. industry.

""The steel industry has not been shy about using its historical heft and its geography, being located in a lot of electorally important places, to push for protection,"" said Scott Lincicome, a trade expert at the Cato Institute. Trump's once and perhaps future trade negotiator, Robert Lighthizer, is the dean of steel industry protectionists, chasing those goals as a lawyer for the industry for decades, pushing tariffs as trade representative during Trump's tenure, and proposing even more for next time.

""In terms of using trade laws to its advantage, steel is probably the No. 1 example,"" said Lincicome, who spent two decades practicing international trade law.

The U.S. steelmaking industry employs about 0.05 percent of the country's nonfarm workforce, yet, Lincicome argued, ""steel has hijacked American trade policy. It is not just the Section 232 tariffs. It is not just the 'Buy America' regulations. It is the entire World Trade Organization as well.""

One of the industry's favorite methodological tricks for securing favorable trade remedies -- known as ""zeroing"" in technical parlance -- involves ignoring fairly priced imports and focusing only on cheaper imports to justify across-the-board tariffs. It is also anathema to the World Trade Organization (WTO). So, over successive administrations from both parties dating back years, the United States essentially shut down the WTO's ability to adjudicate trade disputes. ""It's insanity,"" Lincicome said.

A smokestack industry is so central to so many trade fights not because of what steel actually represents in employment or even economic terms but because of what it symbolizes. Even today, political scientists tend to measure national power by counting a country's steel and iron production, among other crude metrics. Steel's historical echo -- especially for politicians who came of age during America's postwar industrial boom -- is deafening, even more so when steel production is concentrated in politically fickle swing states.

""U.S. Steel has been an iconic American steel company for more than a century,"" Biden said when he came out in open opposition to the planned Japanese takeover in March, ""and it is vital for it to remain an American steel company that is domestically owned and operated.""

But even the purely national security arguments for the sanctity of U.S.-made steel -- the formal justification, then and now, for the Trump-era tariffs on steel imports that Biden has maintained -- ring hollow. Nearly the entirety of U.S.-made steel has other uses than tanks, guns, and ships; protecting an entire industry for the roughly 1 percent used for defense purposes is what makes trade experts howl. And even in cases where the military has relied exclusively on U.S.-made steel, the results haven't always been stainless.

Take nuclear submarines. For decades, below-standard U.S.-made steel was fraudulently sold to the U.S. Navy and used on Virginia-class subs; there were no reported accidents, but the Navy did have to spend more on maintenance. Now, as part of a nuclear submarine deal with Britain and Australia, the Navy will trial small batches of Australian-made specialty steel for the submarines it has to build in years to come. (Britain, the inventor of the modern steel industry, is no better off: The Royal Navy has to get all its specialized steel for submarines and surface ships from abroad.)

The magnified place of steel, whether in politicians' imaginations, campaign aides' calculations, or trade lawyers' hourly earnings, has real impacts that make it harder for the United States to achieve many of the things it keeps saying it wants to accomplish.

Take the transition to a cleaner, lower-carbon future and revitalized infrastructure. The United States and Europe have spent years at loggerheads over Trump's steel tariffs and years more squabbling over what was meant to be their reconciliation, a partnership to promote green steel and punish dirtier producers, which just happen to be their main trade bogeymen anyway.

But negotiations on this proposed partnership, known as the Global Arrangement on Sustainable Steel and Aluminum, have stalled because Washington wants to use blanket tariffs on steel to protect all its production, even from dirty old blast furnaces in competitive battleground states, while Europeans keep trying to simply apply their existing domestic carbon price to imports that don't pass muster.

""A blanket 25 percent tariff on imports from almost every other country in the world has nothing to do with steel's carbon intensity or domestic regulations,"" Lincicome said. ""It's just a tax.""

Or take the Biden administration's Buy America push, requiring U.S.-made iron and steel for infrastructure projects. U.S. steel is a lot more expensive than steel made in Europe, China, or other countries (one of the reasons import tariffs have been so attractive for decades).

""The United States and some other countries are hobbling the infrastructure transition by requiring that it be made at home,"" said Gary Clyde Hufbauer of the Peterson Institute for International Economics. ""So that dilutes the effectiveness of the transition.""

Or take the lingering uncertainty over the Nippon Steel takeover of U.S. Steel, which would create a global behemoth with deep pockets and big ambitions to ramp up the decarbonization of steel in its overseas operations. Nippon Steel's new president, in fact, comes from the electric arc furnace world, not the one dominated by old blast furnaces, and has vowed to make decarbonization one of the company's main objectives going forward.

Or forget everything green, and just look at the Biden administration's plans to revitalize U.S. manufacturing of all stripes. As important as steel production may be, steel use throughout the economy is much more so, directly supporting many more jobs and a lot more economic activity. That's one reason the Trump-Biden tariffs were and are, on balance, such a bad deal. They increased the cost of inputs for nearly everything for everybody just to benefit a few.

Earnings increased for both RWE's offshore wind and onshore wind/solar segments in the first quarter of 2024.

Adjusted EBITDA in the offshore wind segment amounted to €548m, compared to €473m in the first quarter of 2023.

The increase in earnings is mainly due to improved wind conditions.

In the same period of the previous year, these were below the assumed average, RWE said.

The onshore wind/solar segment recorded adjusted EBITDA of €341m compared to €247m in the first quarter of 2023.

The positive earnings development is mainly due to the commissioning of new capacity and the recognition of the business activities of Con Edison Clean Energy Businesses in the US for the full three months.

Moreover, wind conditions at the European onshore sites improved marginally overall, which also had a positive effect, RWE reported.

Michael Müller, chief financial officer of RWE, said: ""We can look back on a solid first quarter of 2024, with significant increases in earnings in both offshore wind and onshore wind/solar.

""This shows that our investments are paying off. In the first three months of the year, 42% of our electricity generation came from renewable sources - and we are continuing to invest massively.

""Currently, we have projects with a total capacity of 8.3GW under construction. We confirm our outlook for 2024 and our target of paying a dividend of €1.10 per share for the current fiscal year.""

Around €1bn was attributable to the acquisition of three offshore wind development projects from Vattenfall off the coast of the UK.

In addition, RWE invested more than twice as much in the construction of new wind and solar power plants in the first quarter as in the same period last year.

Proceeds from the sale of a 49% stake in the Dogger Bank South offshore wind projects in the UK to Masdar had a counteracting effect, the company reported.

RWE is currently building plants with a total capacity of 8.3GW.

These include the offshore wind projects Sofia off the UK coast with 1.4GW and Thor in Denmark with 1.1GW.

RWE is also driving forward the expansion of onshore wind and solar energy and the construction of new batteries with more than 100 projects under construction in Europe and the US.

The outlook for earnings development in the current financial year is unchanged from March 2024.

At the Capital Markets Day on 28 November 2023, RWE forecasted adjusted EBITDA within a range of €5.2bn to €5.8bn.

The company is maintaining this guidance, although RWE expects to close at the lower end of the forecast range.

The reason for this is that electricity prices have dropped significantly since November 2023.

The same is true for adjusted net income, which is expected to be between €1.9bn and €2.4bn.",renews.biz,news,Renews,,0.3803921568627451,453455613,4,https://renews.biz/media/25116/rwe.jpg?width=640,eng-9564665

Denmark's King Frederik X has credited the Norwegian TV series Skam, meaning ""Shame"", for bringing young peole from Denmark and Norway together, at a speech at the Norwegian Royal Palace in Oslo.

""Norway is almost the Nordic champion in youth series, and today the majority of Danish youngsters know the meaning of tuller du? [""Are you kidding?""] and serr [""Seriously?""],"" he said in the speech.

In Denmark, he continued, the series was so popular that it led to several Norwegian words and expressions working their way into the Danish language.

King Frederik and Queen Mary are on a state tour of Sweden and Norway.

The Danish Technical University is working with the municipality and muncipal power company on the island of Bornholm to trial using lampposts in the capital, Rønne, as chargers for electric vehicles.

The lampposts have been shifted to LED bulbs, so use only a franction of the electrical capacity they were built with, freeing up capacity for the charger.

""We have set up a traditional charging stand in a lamppost, where electricity has already been connected. Because we now have LED fixtures, there is plenty of spare capacity. So you can easily charge an electric car overnight with the charging stand installed here,"" said Claus Andersen, from the power company.

The project has intalled chargers from the Spirii brand, which can charge up at up to 22 kwh.

""It's a great idea to take a metal stand at the edge of the road which still has electricity in it and put a charger in it,"" said Mads Aarup, at the Danish Society of Engineers. ""It's super good. It's brilliant because it has dual use.""

New Danish train signalling delayed by three years

A new signalling system being rolled out across Denmark will not be completed until 2033, three years later than the 2030 target, with the rollout on the tracks between Copenhagen and Helsingör, and between Roskilde and Copenhagen particularly badly delayed, Denmark's rail operator, Banedanmark, has said.

This means rail travellers will have to wait even longer to have their routes ""future-proofed"".

The problems are connected to Alstom, which is responsible for the new signalling system, and which had wanted to delay project completion until 2031.

""Alstom has taken good measures to reassure us, but we have not yet seen it implemented,"" Peter Jonasson, from Banedanmark told the Ritzau newswire. ""Therefore, we have become sceptical about the timetable and assessed that a buffer of another two years is needed.""

He acknowledges that during the process there has been an opportunity to change supplier, but it is more complicated than that, it says.

Today could mark the first day of summer, with the temperature passing 25C at at least one of the official measuring stations run by the Danish Meteorological Institute.

On Tuesday, Denmark came within a tenth of a degree of meteorological summer when the measuring station in Stauning near Skjern reached 24.9C.

Fei Chen: Thank you, Robert, and good day to everyone on the call. I am excited to have this opportunity to speak with you and hear an update on the solid progress we have made as we maintain our focus on delivering against the strategic plan we instituted over the past year to successfully stabilize and grow our business initially through our established markets and then position ourselves for incremental growth through our target markets. As a quick reminder, our established markets are marks where we have extensive customer bases and typically have reduced sales cycle times. This includes commercial pool systems, diesel particulate fitters, marine scrubbers and other areas where we have recurring revenue opportunities, such as general aftermarket sales and the plastics. This established business markets provides a strong and stable base of revenue for LiqTech and allow us to gain manufacturing efficiencies by leveraging our existing production capacity. Our target markets include key markets where our high-performance ceramic -- silicon carbon ceramic membrane can provide customers with a strong return on their investments. This include specific industry filtration applications to remove solid, oil, pathogens and heavy metals from water as well as compounds from emissions and industrial off-gases. These areas tend to have longer sales cycles, but it's our belief that if we align ourselves with great partners and establish key reference customers, the sales cycles will decrease and the large market opportunity will open up for LiqTech. I am pleased to report that strategy is working. As I assume most of you saw, we are expecting a significant step-up sequentially in revenue for the second quarter, with revenue to be between $5 million and $5.5 million. This would represent an approximate 20% to 30% sequential revenue growth. But before we talk about a few of the forward-looking expectations and the drivers to the strong second quarter we expect, let's first look back at the progress made during the first quarter. Revenue during quarter one increased 6% compared to Q1 of 2023, driven by delivery of our first U.S.-based oil and gas produced water order as part of our new distribution agreement with Razorback Direct as well as strength in our DPF and the ceramic membrane business. The U.S.-based oil and gas order was a critical development for us in many ways. First, it expands our presence in North America by showcasing the benefit of our produced water treatment solutions to the oil and gas industry. And the second, the order comes rapidly on the heels of us signing our distribution agreement with Razorback Direct in March 2024, highlighting what we believe will be [straining] (ph) interest for our dissolutions in North America. The containerized pilot system that Razorback Direct orders arrived in Houston on April 30th and will be used as a customer site to test, demonstrate and document the efficiency of LiqTech's ultrafiltration technology in treating produced water to facilitate beneficial industry reuse and meet current and future regulatory requirements. Longer term, the intention is to use the results from this pilot operation as a basis to defend and implement full-scale commercial systems for the onshore oil and gas application in the U.S. Let me be clear that our expectation is that this will not be a multi-year trial process. It is our belief that the initial results received in the next few months will help to validate our solutions and provide the data necessary for other customers to move forward. As we stated during our year-end call, the North American oil and the gas market is going to be a key focus for LiqTech moving further forward, and we couldn't be more pleased to be partnered with the great team at Razorback Direct, who has a strong presence in key oil and gas geographies in U.S. Building on the success of North American oil and gas order, we received another significant oil and gas produced water commercial pilot order in the first quarter from National Energy Services Reunited (OTC: NESR ), or NESR, in the Middle East. This unit will be used in Gulf Cooperation Council countries by one of the largest integrated energy and chemical companies in the world and is scheduled to deliver in June. This will be a key component of the strong second quarter that we are expecting. Similar to the U.S. order, we believe that this commercial test unit for produced water has the ability to open the doors for additional orders with this customer and many other operators in the region. The Middle East tends to move a bit slower than in the U.S., but this one of our systems installed two years ago, operating to expectations. We believe there is an opportunity to move rapidly forward with other customers in this geography as well. Overall, I am pleased with the progress made against our oil and gas target market initiatives and look forward to incremental progress in 2024. Let's transition to a few key developments since our last call in our established markets, starting with marine scrubbers. Last week, we announced entry into a partnership with the Dan Marine Group, or DMG, to expand our presence in the Chinese shipbuilding and repair market from marine scrubber water treatment solutions as well as new exhaust gas recirculation water treatment systems for dual-fuel marine vessels. The agreement also includes the servicing by DMG of existing LiqTech's marine installations, including fast delivery of spare parts and on-site repair work. Dan Marine Group has close customer relationships in the marine industry and the strong sales and service organization in China with locations close to customers for shipbuilding and repair. A key component to this partnership is our ability to leverage DMG's highly skilled sales and service capabilities to sell, install and service our marine water treatment systems. The other highlight here is the market for new exhaust gas recirculation water treatment systems for dual-fuel marine vessels. Maritime industry is undergoing a significant transition towards cleaner fuel and reduced environmental emissions. In the coming five years, more than half of the new vessels will be built with dual-fuel engines, which make them be able to operate with LNG or methanol. For this new type of vessels, there is a need for highly sufficient and reliable water treatment systems. LiqTech solution is the perfect fit to this application. We look forward to the opportunities that this new partnership can bring for us in Chinese marine scrubbers and the exhaust gas recirculation market. The second key partnerships we entered was with the Franman, a well-established maritime representative to the shipping industry to market our scrubber water treatment solutions within Greece. For those not aware, Greece is the largest ship-owning market in the world. Franman has close customer relationships with major shipping companies in Greece and have deep technical insight to ensure effective customer collaboration for design and installation of new water treatment systems. With the combination of our unique silicon carbon ceramic filtration technology and years of successful commercial demonstration in the marine industry, we look forward to our two companies come together effectively to expand our marine scrubber footprint and reduce environmental impact from shipping. As we look to the second quarter, beyond key oil and the gas order to the Middle East set for delivery in June, another key driver to our growth expectation is the commercial swimming pool market. During the second quarter, we expect to deliver eight systems in total with contributions coming from each of our key geographies and distribution partners. As a reminder, and for context, we delivered trendy swimming pool systems in all of 2023. The agreements we signed last year with Waterco, Barr + Wray, Total Pool (NASDAQ: POOL ) and Oxidine are all contributors with each delivering at least one system in Q2. I am pleased with the progress we have achieved on this key established market and look forward to continued market adoption in the years to come. Transition to our DPF business and the membrane business, another of our established markets. During the first quarter, DPF sales increased 31% compared to the year-ago first quarter, with sales of nearly $1.6 million. We are seeing increased interest for our DPF solutions within the European inland transportation market as renewed focus on black carbon emission reduction occurs. We are also seeing strong sales for our filters for emergency electricity generator. Similar to pool systems, we are pleased with the growth coming from our DPF solutions, which in many ways was an afterthought for LiqTech previously, but has become a solid contributor for us today. On the ceramic membrane side, we are making inroads to a couple of key potential markets with pilot testing going on at customer sites. These markets include petrochemicals, water treatment, paper and pulp and battery material concentration. We are also looking to scale up through OEM partners in China, Europe and the U.S. We believe this can be a driver for this component of our operations going ahead and hope to have more to share with you in the coming quarters on this pilot test. To wrap things up, before I turn over to Phillip to review the financials in more detail, as our outlook suggests, we expect to see good growth in the second quarter. We have eight pool systems scheduled for delivery with contributions coming from each of distribution partners we have across the world. These orders coupled with our Middle East oil and gas system set for delivery in June and an uptick in nearly each of our key established markets recurring product offerings such as DPF filters and membrane provides us with optimism for both the second quarter and the rest of the year. I look forward to our continued successful execution against the strategic plan we set for us. With that said, let me turn the call over to Phillip to review the financial results in more detail. Phillip?

Phillip Price: Thank you, Fei, and good morning, everyone. Now, let's dive into the financial highlights for the quarter. Revenue came in at $4.2 million compared to $4.0 million in the same quarter last year, representing an increase of 6%. This performance falls within our previously disclosed guidance. Broken down by verticals, sales were as follows: systems sales and related services of $1.5 million compared to $1.4 million in the same period last year and $1.6 million in Q4; DPF and ceramic membrane sales of $1.8 million compared to $1.4 million in the same period last year and up sequentially compared to the $1.4 million in Q4; and finally, plastics revenues of $0.9 million compared to $1.2 million in Q1 last year and $0.8 million in Q4. In summary, our ceramics business experienced a significant increase, the system sales and related services recorded a slight uptick, and the plastics underwent a notable decline. To be specific, the key revenue drivers for this quarter was the delivery of our first U.S.-based oil and gas produced water order as part of our new distribution agreement with Razorback Direct, along with increased sales of DPF and ceramic membrane sales attributed to focused sales efforts beginning from May 2023 that generated elevated activity in the current year. The decline in plastics revenue relates solely to a large one-off sale that was recorded in 2023 without recurrence in the current year. In terms of our forward guidance, as Fei mentioned, we expect the revenue for the second quarter of 2024 to be between $5 million and $5.5 million, which would be a significant increase of approximately 20% to 30% compared to the just ended quarter. We remain committed to growing our business over the coming quarter as we work intensively to execute on our ambition to further penetrate the global oil and gas, chemicals and pool system markets with our proven and industry-leading solutions. Looking at our gross profit for the quarter, we reported $0.3 million, or an implied gross profit margin of approximately 6.4% compared to $0.4 million and 9.8% in the prior-year's first quarter. The unfavorable change is, first of all, a result of the revenue mix for the quarter. In particular, the delivery of the containerized oil and gas pilot system impacted margins, resulting in a decrease compared to typical levels. This decision was strategic, undertaken to showcase and validate the effectiveness of our technology. As we still have overhead and other fixed costs that are not fully being absorbed, one of our key metrics we look at to highlight the progress being made is our contribution margin. During the quarter, when you back out fixed costs, our contribution margin ended at approximately 39% compared to 43% in the same quarter reported last year, with the unfavorable change mainly explained by revenue mix and especially the delivery of the containerized oil and gas pilot system as mentioned before. From an operational perspective, we continue to have excess capacity with the recently installed new kilns and revitalization of our ceramics facility. Hence, the immediate focus is to leverage the positive momentum and compress delivery lead times while still ensuring the delivery of high-quality membranes and filters. As previously stated, we still maintain our guidance that our business will be breakeven measured on an adjusted EBITDA basis, assuming a quarterly revenue of approximately $7 million and potentially lower with the right revenue mix. Turning to OpEx, total operating expenses for the quarter was $2.3 million compared to $2.6 million in Q1 of 2023. This is a decrease of $0.3 million, or approximately 10%. The decrease mainly reflects the release of 2023 bonus provisions, offset by increased insurance costs and expenses associated with the CFO transition. As stated, over the last few quarters, we remain focused on running a lean business by monitoring costs and carefully evaluating our spend to ensure that we do not jeopardize our financial objectives. Moving to the next item. Net other expenses during the quarter were $0.4 million compared to $0.2 million in Q1 of last year with the development mainly explained by the non-cash loss associated with the sale of fixed assets, partly offset by a gain on currency transactions due to the euro depreciation against the U.S. dollar during the period. Concluding on the P&L, net loss for the quarter was $2.4 million, which was consistent with the net loss reported in the first quarter of last year. However, this quarter's result was driven by revenue growth and a decrease in operating expenses, offset by lower margins as well as an increase in other expenses. And finally, let me briefly comment on our cash flow and balance sheet before summarizing and handing back over to Fei. We ended the quarter with $7.7 million in cash, down $2.7 million compared to the fourth quarter. This is explained by the cash used in operating activities, a reduction in accrued expenses related to the release of bonus provisions, an increase in prepaid expenses due to annual insurance premiums and IT licenses paid. And finally, an increased inventories, which is linked to the strategic sourcing for ongoing projects to cut delivery lead times. And also, historically, the first quarter has always been the most financially demanding period in terms of cash flow due to the annual expenses mentioned before. And finally, during this quarter, we managed to sell surplus equipment with the proceeds used to repay the related leasing liabilities in full. To summarize, balancing our cash flow remain a key KPI for our business as we're determined to preserve cash to maintain our strategic and financial flexibility. We also acknowledge that we need to increase the throughput of our existing facilities to accelerate growth, reduce lead times and ultimately pave the way to a business and balance both from a net income and cash flow perspective. Thank you again for your continued support, and back over to you, Fei.

Fei Chen: Thank you, Phillip. In closing, we remain committed to executing against our strategic roadmap, focused on long-term value creation. Over the past years, we have launched a clearly defined commercial strategy that has already yielded positive results. Going forward, our business will be underpinned by strong continuing revenues within our established businesses and increased foothold in our strategic target markets. The growth we expect in quarter two and the results of the year, coupled with improved operational execution across organization, will be key to drive [safe change] (ph) in gross margins and positive cash flows. I look forward to continuing to execute against our strategic initiatives in 2024 to drive value creation for our shareholders. One final comment before I turn it over to your questions. I will be participating together with Phillip in the Lytham Partners Spring 2024 Investor Conference on May 30. If you would like to schedule a one-on-one meeting, please contact Robert Blum, and he will be happy to coordinate for you. With that, operator, we would be happy to take any questions.

Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Rob Brown from Lake Street Capital Markets. Please go ahead.

Rob Brown: I guess, first question is on the U.S. oil and gas market. Great to see some progress there in getting delivery. Could you give us a sense of how the pilot program plays out? I think you talked about a relatively short assessment period. And then, maybe a sense of how the market development and pipeline development happens after that?

Fei Chen: As I mentioned in the talk, the pilot has arrived in the U.S. on the 30th of April. And actually, now it's already at the customer side. We are very happy to start running already this week and the coming week. So, we expect in the coming months or so, we're going to have the first testing results. So that will really give the clear indication about the performance of our pilot plan for the U.S. produced water. And we are already discussing with different companies and especially also with the Razorback Direct about a pipeline. So, there's a lot of things going on, and it's like really people are exciting to see the results of this pilot testing. So, we are very exciting to see the progress in the next couple of years -- months.

Rob Brown: Okay. Great. And I assume, given the Middle East system running for a couple of years that the progress will be favorable. Just want to get a sense, what's sort of the system benefits that the customer gets with your system? And maybe just what's the sales pitch that Razorback goes out with to its customer base?

Fei Chen: Thanks a lot, Rob. This is a very, very good question. The really good benefits of our system definitely is, our membrane is really suitable for this type of the water treatment. It's a highly oil content, and there's also metal content and also very high solid content. And we have demonstrated both in the Middle East and also actually through our marine scrubber market, and our membrane is really good for this type of treatment. And it really can be cleaned up very efficiently to keep the efficiency of filtration. And this is exactly the difference between our membrane and the polymer membrane. So, we really have the long lifetime and the very high efficiency is through a long period of time. And the second thing is we have a containerized solution. So, it's really -- it's very easy to use. It's mobilized, you can put down the track, can transport from one side to the other side. And also, it's a [modelized build] (ph). So basically, we only need demand at customer side, some basic utilities in place, then we can just put the container there and the plugging and really able to start treat. So, you don't need all those construction -- civil construction work. And also the footprint is very small. We have a very compact design of our system. And this really convenient to use and operating cost is much lower than the other existing technology in the market. So, those are the things we also -- really we're able to demonstrate through our pilot testing, both the quality of our filtration and also the OpEx data and also hold operation benefits. Those things, we're able to make our pitch much more sharp when we finish our pilot testing in a couple of months.

Rob Brown: Okay. Great. Thank you. And then, maybe on the Q2 ramp in revenue, I think you mentioned pool systems really stepping up. Could the pool market, does that become more of a diversified stream of activity there going forward? Or is there some kind of one-time stocking stuff going down, but just a sense of how the pool market is developing and how you see it playing out over the next 18 months or so?

Fei Chen: We are -- right now, we primarily active in Europe and Australia, and we are now moving into U.S. market. So, we would like to go to U.S., market to really find the partners for our pool system. And in Europe we have some huge markets like Holland and Germany. We're not really active today, and that's also something we're going to come in. So, next six months, we are entering the new territories for our pool system.

Rob Brown: Okay. Great. And then, in terms of the partnerships, you continue to add some nice partnerships. How much more is to go in getting the partnerships in place? Or do you feel like this -- that you've announced to kind of fill out where you were working on?

Fei Chen: I mean, we have just announced the two partnerships for marine area. And as you see, we will continue to find the partners and maybe different type of partner. But for marine, for example, we have the Dan Marine, it's really for the sales and distribution. And the Franman is different, because they have really network with the ship owner. So, what we're trying to do is we try to get the partners through a whole stakeholder group. So, in this way, our sales and max penetration will be much more efficient. So, this is our sauce, because we're already building quite some partnerships, and we want to be more clever really to use the partnership in a more multiple dimensions to really move our sales more efficient ahead in the selected verticals, which we are working.

Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Lucas Ward from Ascendiant Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Hi, Lucas, is your line on mute?

Lucas Ward: Yes, sorry about that. Lucas Ward here. Good afternoon, Fei and Phillip...

Fei Chen: Good afternoon, Lucas.

Lucas Ward: ...and congratulations on your business progress. Hi. So, I wanted to look at the overall revenue opportunity and just sort of understand like what are the keys to really scaling it up, because it looks like you have so many opportunities in different geographies and different verticals and you have the filter opportunities and the system opportunities, and it's almost like you're planting seeds in a lot of different places. And so, I guess I wanted to ask from your perspective, what are the keys to really scaling those, growing them?

Fei Chen: I mean, that was a very good observation. We are planting the seeds, because what we have found out is our strategic focus area that means swimming pool system, DPF and marine and oil and gas. If we just look at the membrane, if we look at all this together, we actually have addressed the market potential of US$4 billion. So, today, we have market share less than 1%. So, we are actually in the process really clear out the way and putting the seeds for the next wave of growth. So, what you can see is the DPF actually, we are doing very good now in Europe. And we would like to see in next year or coming years where is the new playground, but we would like still really grow in Europe first of all. And the pool system, we are growing very well now in the U.K. and in Australia and in Spain, and we would like to also go to the other markets. So, you'll see now is really we're putting on the foundation, but really can grow fast in the future. And we feel really -- can see the last years as we've done in the different segment, and it's the right way to go. So, we are continuing to putting the seeds on the ground, and then we will harvest them in the coming period. But it's really a very exciting period ahead for us.

Phillip Price: And Lucas, also, just to add some color, it's also just not to be reliable on only one business area. So, to spread our risk.

Lucas Ward: Got it. Okay. Can you comment more on competition? Like how much of a factor -- because the way you presented it, it sounds like it's just -- it's mostly a sales and marketing challenge. It's a matter of like finding the right partners and the resources and just going after it. But could you also comment on who you see in various verticals and geographies? Are they the same players over and over again? And how much does competition impact your ability to get those design wins?

Fei Chen: The interesting about our market is that we don't have a uniform competitor across all the segments. So, we actually have different competition in different segment, and they all different from each to other. And if we take a DPF as example, before we actually had a competitor in Denmark, but that company has been bought by a Chinese company. So, the whole production has been moved to China. So that actually give us a competitive advantage because we are the European company and many of the European customers like to buy from European company. So that's very interesting. And we do have some competition in Germany and in Japan and the French. But we are the ones in the niche is we are very flexible and able to deliver fast and with a high-end product. And that was our special in this DPF area. And many of our customers are recurring customers. So, this is a very solid customer base, and they are still growing. It's given us a very good basis for the revenue income. And if we take the swimming pool area, our competition technology is a sand filter. And our filtration technology solution for the pool system is much more environmental friendly and energy saving and the water saving and the chemical reduction. So, we have some really unique value propositions for this market. So, it's really, for me, it's really only the marketing and the sales speed from our side, it's going to push ahead. And the oil and gas areas, we are still new. We're trying to get in. But we definitely see there's a need for our solutions in that sector. We don't see any heads-on competition yet, and we are keeping very much alert to see what is coming when we have opened the door and really able to demonstrate our technology. And marine area, we did have very strong competition. As I mentioned in the last couple of calls, and we had very good [indiscernible] market. We go into a very dominant position and there's many Chinese cheap solutions coming with a very bad performance, and they cannot flush the market. So, right now, we are trying to go back in the market with much more clear view and go to the high end and like this exhausted gas recirculation. That's a market, those cheap technology cannot really stand, and we're trying to go back there and really occupy market, because that was perfect for our solution. So, we come back with some more smart solution and a different angle. So, this you can hear different segments, there are different competition. We don't have one word competition across the all segment.

Lucas Ward: Okay. Thank you, Fei. One more question on operating expenses. It was surprisingly low. It hasn't been this low for a long time, and it was attributed to this release of bonus provisions. I just wanted to understand like what that means and what I should expect going forward in terms of modeling operating expenses?

Phillip Price: Yes, of course. So, the release of bonus provisions relates to the 2023 KPIs. So, we didn't meet the target, and therefore, we released the bonus provisions, hence, the positive effect on the OpEx. But the level that you should expect is around $2.6 million per quarter.

Lucas Ward: Okay. All right. That's all I had.

Fei Chen: Okay. We are very much cost conscious. So, we're really trying to increase our output from production and output from the salespeople. So, we're really trying to become more and more efficient. And in this way, we actually can keep the operating cost down and increase the sales and our revenue at the same time. So, this is one of very clear KPI for us, and we're also trying to improve our process across the whole value chain.

Lucas Ward: Okay. Yeah, it didn't -- it seemed like there was more going on there, like more of a sort of a structural shift towards cost savings. So, thanks for confirming that.

Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from George Melas from MKH Management. Please go ahead.

George Melas: Good morning, good afternoon, Fei and Phillip. Good job on the quarter and the progress.

Fei Chen: Thank you.

George Melas: I had a question about the U.S. oil and gas order. I'm trying to understand how it happened so fast. Was it that basically Razorback sort of had a customer and that had a problem and they went looking for technology and found you and signed that distribution agreement and then they were able to propose a solution to their customer? Or did they sign a relationship with you first and then started looking for customers and one happened to happen so fast?

Fei Chen: I think that's a very interesting question. I have to say in this way, we are very happy. We find this very good partner to work with because they are in the oil and the gas market and very much alert what is customer needs. So, they have a very strong customer network and the customer group already. So, they know exactly what the customer is really looking for and really lack of the technology. And we have found out the chemistry of these two companies match very well, and there are some very clever technical people and the commercial people in Razorback Direct. So since we start discussion -- simultaneously, we already started discussing present our technology to them, and also they tell us what the customer needs. So it's not like we sign the contract, then we start work together. We already start work, at the same time we signed the contract, and that's also a process. We find out this is the partner we would like to work together with. So that's why there's more than only one month we find the customer. But I have to say it's a really, really good at them. They have a customer really had a really need for a new solution for their problem. So, this is a very good match.

George Melas: Okay. Great. Okay. And then, how many different other solutions can they propose to their customers in terms of treating the produced water? Because, clearly, they have some solutions right now, but you are a new technology that they offer. So, how -- what are the alternatives that they have provided in the past?

Fei Chen: I mean, this is a general knowledge in the market for all the people in the oil and gas market. The pretreatment for produced water is rather tough because the water is nasty. You have a lot of oil inside and a lot of metal content and also salt and solid, many solid particles. So, traditionally, there are many different kind of chemical treatment method for this part. And I think most of people, they don't like use chemical method today. So, when they see our solutions, some needs and also automation and really kind of user friendly also both for the operator and for the environment. So, they really got excited about this and they see potential right away because they are kind of tired of the chemical process -- chemical treatment. So, this is -- you can be lucky sometimes. I think we are lucky because they are looking for something better than what they have today.

George Melas: Okay. Great. And then, one final question on the pool systems. Given the existing distributors that you have, so assuming you're not adding any distributors, but I think you will, but with the existing distributors, do you expect to have to beat the 2023 deliveries? You had 20 deliveries in '23. With the existing distributors, can you match that or beat that?

Fei Chen: We are definitely trying to work with our existing distributors, make them much more efficient. So, I expect their sales grow because, I mean, if they grow their sales and we can grow our revenue. And at the same time, we're also going to build new distributors in the next half year. So, it's a combination of both, but I definitely expect our distributors every year, their sales should grow.

George Melas: Okay. And then, what kind of visibility do you have into the pipeline there -- their pipeline?

Fei Chen: We have totally transparency. So, we really work closely together. So, they're really our partners.

Robert Blum: Fei and Phillip, I've got just a couple of questions here through the webcast portal that I want to make sure we get addressed. So, I'll try to move through a few of these quickly and summarize where there's some overlap. First one is, can you talk about sort of your general sales approach in the United States? It seems like that's a focus area for you. Is this going to be sort of a team approach, marketing, distributors? Just expand a little bit more on your focus in the U.S.?

Fei Chen: We have the first distribution partner for the oil and gas area, Razorback Direct. And what we're working with them is really very close to together. We do the testing together, and we do the marketing together, and we're doing the sales pipeline together and the sales work also together. And their people will do the ground service, and we will be the back office and also the technical support for them. So, there will be our arm and the legs in the U.S. ground. So, this is for the oil and gas. And definitely, we will continue to grow this relationship. And for the pool system, we expect also to find some partners in the U.S. market to help us do the marketing and the sales and also potentially in the future, also the service. So, it's really a strong partnership we are working in the U.S., trying to really make the sales penetration in this market. U.S. is a very big market. So definitely, we will not only have one partner, and we need more partners. But we would like to take one at a time and really make that happen, then we see what that brings next.

Robert Blum: All right. Fantastic. A couple of questions here. Just sort of talking about sort of your breakeven, which I know you talked on a little bit, but maybe just to expand a little bit on sort of the outlook here, your breakeven rate sort of goals in terms of achieving positive cash flow, et cetera.

Phillip Price: Yeah. So, as we mentioned before, we still maintain the guidance for when the business will be breakeven and that's with a quarterly revenue of approximately $7 million, potentially lower if we have the right revenue mix. Regarding to the cash flow, that's, of course, a key KPI for us, we are determined to preserve the cash in order to maintain our strategic and financial flexibility. We'd also acknowledge that we need to increase the throughput of our existing facilities in order to accelerate growth and reduce lead times and ultimately pave the way to a business in balance from both a net income and cash flow perspective. And also what Fei mentioned before is that our main focus is on running a lean business.

Robert Blum: All right. Fantastic. It looks like I've got one last question here. You've talked about some of the growth, I guess, within the DPF solutions, referenced Europe inland transportation and electricity emergency generators. Maybe just expand on what some of the drivers are for that? Is it sort of a sales approach? Or is this sort of a market-driven approach? Just expand a little bit more on the DPF growth there.

Fei Chen: I would say it's a very, very strong trend. We have fear now in the market. And the European inland transportation, it got more and more public and politic awareness. So people really start looking in these sectors and start talking about how much emission they actually give to people through this inland transportation. So, countries like Holland and Germany definitely are looking at that now, and that's what we feel. And we do get some very good customers, and the stronger ones, they actually go into this area and really have a very close collaboration with us in that. And we expect to see this growing in the coming years, definitely. And for the electricity emergency generators, purely is very much is for the data center around the world. And they need to have this DPF installed any of the data center they are building today, especially in combination with artificial intelligence because there's a lot of data center building especially for those ones. And they are definitely around the world. It's not only Europe and also in U.S. and so on. And we are actually been seeing as one of the preferred partners even also by some U.S. companies to produce -- to provide this DPF to them. So, what we feel is we have a quite good reputation in the DPF market. And the many -- very often, the DPF market is most measured. It's not really the massive marketing approach. So, they have this very good relationship and also good reputation in the market. In many cases, actually customer they come to us by themselves, but we're also going out to proactively going to some conference and try to find the target customers to really work with them. So, this is a two-way we are working on. And we are very excited to see this development, and we're really confident this DPF market is going to be continued growth market for us in the coming years or so.

Robert Blum: All right. Fantastic. Very helpful. It appears we have no further questions here either online or through the teleconference. So, Fei, I'll go ahead and turn it back over to you for closing remarks.

Fei Chen: Thank you, Robert. Thank you all very much for being with us today. We look forward to communicating with you all soon again. Thank you.

Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

InvestingPro Insights

LiqTech International (LIQT) appears to be navigating a challenging financial landscape, as reflected by the real-time data from InvestingPro. With a market capitalization of $15.16 million, the company's valuation metrics indicate some concerns. The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio stands at -1.91, highlighting that investors may be wary of the company's earnings potential. This is further underscored by an adjusted P/E ratio for the last twelve months as of Q4 2023 of -1.88. The PEG ratio, which measures the stock's price relative to its earnings growth, is notably negative at -0.03, suggesting that the market may not be factoring in strong future earnings growth.

In terms of financial health, LiqTech's revenue for the last twelve months as of Q4 2023 was $18.0 million, with a growth of 12.63%, indicating some positive momentum in sales. However, the company's gross profit margin during the same period was 15.42%, which could be a point of concern for investors looking for higher profitability.

InvestingPro Tips for LIQT reveal that analysts are not expecting the company to be profitable this year, and the valuation implies a poor free cash flow yield. On a more positive note, the company's liquid assets exceed its short-term obligations, providing some financial stability. Yet, the stock is trading near its 52-week low and has been flagged for poor price performance over the last decade.

Full transcript - LiqTech International Inc (LIQT) Q1 2024:

Operator: Good day, and welcome to the LiqTech International Reports First Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Financial Results Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Robert Blum of Lytham Partners. Please go ahead.

Robert Blum: All right. Thank you very much, Jason, and good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us today for the LiqTech International first quarter 2024 financial results conference call for the period ending March 31, 2024. Joining us on today's call from the company are Fei Chen, Chief Executive Officer; and Phillip Price, the company's Interim Chief Financial Officer. Before I turn the call over to management, let me remind listeners that there will be an open Q&A session at the end of today's call. If you dialed in through the traditional teleconference line, you can press star then one to ask a question. If you are listening through the webcast portal and would like to ask a question, you can submit your question through the ""Ask a Question"" feature in the webcast player. We'll do our best to get to as many questions as possible. Before we begin with prepared remarks, we submit for the record the following statements. This conference call may contain forward-looking statements. Although the forward-looking statements reflect the good faith and judgment of management, forward-looking statements are inherently subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to be materially different from those discussed during the conference call. The company, therefore, urges all listeners to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made in the reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the risk factors that attempt to advise interested parties of the risks that may affect our business, financial condition, operations and cash flows. If one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize or if the underlying assumptions prove incorrect, the company's actual results may vary materially from those expected or projected. The company, therefore, encourages all listeners not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which pertain only as of this date and the date of the release and conference call. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect any events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this release and conference call. That said, I'd like to turn the call over to Fei Chen, CEO of LiqTech International. Fei, please proceed.

Fei Chen: Thank you, Robert, and good day to everyone on the call. I am excited to have this opportunity to speak with you and hear an update on the solid progress we have made as we maintain our focus on delivering against the strategic plan we instituted over the past year to successfully stabilize and grow our business initially through our established markets and then position ourselves for incremental growth through our target markets. As a quick reminder, our established markets are marks where we have extensive customer bases and typically have reduced sales cycle times. This includes commercial pool systems, diesel particulate fitters, marine scrubbers and other areas where we have recurring revenue opportunities, such as general aftermarket sales and the plastics. This established business markets provides a strong and stable base of revenue for LiqTech and allow us to gain manufacturing efficiencies by leveraging our existing production capacity. Our target markets include key markets where our high-performance ceramic -- silicon carbon ceramic membrane can provide customers with a strong return on their investments. This include specific industry filtration applications to remove solid, oil, pathogens and heavy metals from water as well as compounds from emissions and industrial off-gases. These areas tend to have longer sales cycles, but it's our belief that if we align ourselves with great partners and establish key reference customers, the sales cycles will decrease and the large market opportunity will open up for LiqTech. I am pleased to report that strategy is working. As I assume most of you saw, we are expecting a significant step-up sequentially in revenue for the second quarter, with revenue to be between $5 million and $5.5 million. This would represent an approximate 20% to 30% sequential revenue growth. But before we talk about a few of the forward-looking expectations and the drivers to the strong second quarter we expect, let's first look back at the progress made during the first quarter. Revenue during quarter one increased 6% compared to Q1 of 2023, driven by delivery of our first U.S.-based oil and gas produced water order as part of our new distribution agreement with Razorback Direct as well as strength in our DPF and the ceramic membrane business. The U.S.-based oil and gas order was a critical development for us in many ways. First, it expands our presence in North America by showcasing the benefit of our produced water treatment solutions to the oil and gas industry. And the second, the order comes rapidly on the heels of us signing our distribution agreement with Razorback Direct in March 2024, highlighting what we believe will be [straining] (ph) interest for our dissolutions in North America. The containerized pilot system that Razorback Direct orders arrived in Houston on April 30th and will be used as a customer site to test, demonstrate and document the efficiency of LiqTech's ultrafiltration technology in treating produced water to facilitate beneficial industry reuse and meet current and future regulatory requirements. Longer term, the intention is to use the results from this pilot operation as a basis to defend and implement full-scale commercial systems for the onshore oil and gas application in the U.S. Let me be clear that our expectation is that this will not be a multi-year trial process. It is our belief that the initial results received in the next few months will help to validate our solutions and provide the data necessary for other customers to move forward. As we stated during our year-end call, the North American oil and the gas market is going to be a key focus for LiqTech moving further forward, and we couldn't be more pleased to be partnered with the great team at Razorback Direct, who has a strong presence in key oil and gas geographies in U.S. Building on the success of North American oil and gas order, we received another significant oil and gas produced water commercial pilot order in the first quarter from National Energy Services Reunited (OTC: NESR ), or NESR, in the Middle East. This unit will be used in Gulf Cooperation Council countries by one of the largest integrated energy and chemical companies in the world and is scheduled to deliver in June. This will be a key component of the strong second quarter that we are expecting. Similar to the U.S. order, we believe that this commercial test unit for produced water has the ability to open the doors for additional orders with this customer and many other operators in the region. The Middle East tends to move a bit slower than in the U.S., but this one of our systems installed two years ago, operating to expectations. We believe there is an opportunity to move rapidly forward with other customers in this geography as well. Overall, I am pleased with the progress made against our oil and gas target market initiatives and look forward to incremental progress in 2024. Let's transition to a few key developments since our last call in our established markets, starting with marine scrubbers. Last week, we announced entry into a partnership with the Dan Marine Group, or DMG, to expand our presence in the Chinese shipbuilding and repair market from marine scrubber water treatment solutions as well as new exhaust gas recirculation water treatment systems for dual-fuel marine vessels. The agreement also includes the servicing by DMG of existing LiqTech's marine installations, including fast delivery of spare parts and on-site repair work. Dan Marine Group has close customer relationships in the marine industry and the strong sales and service organization in China with locations close to customers for shipbuilding and repair. A key component to this partnership is our ability to leverage DMG's highly skilled sales and service capabilities to sell, install and service our marine water treatment systems. The other highlight here is the market for new exhaust gas recirculation water treatment systems for dual-fuel marine vessels. Maritime industry is undergoing a significant transition towards cleaner fuel and reduced environmental emissions. In the coming five years, more than half of the new vessels will be built with dual-fuel engines, which make them be able to operate with LNG or methanol. For this new type of vessels, there is a need for highly sufficient and reliable water treatment systems. LiqTech solution is the perfect fit to this application. We look forward to the opportunities that this new partnership can bring for us in Chinese marine scrubbers and the exhaust gas recirculation market. The second key partnerships we entered was with the Franman, a well-established maritime representative to the shipping industry to market our scrubber water treatment solutions within Greece. For those not aware, Greece is the largest ship-owning market in the world. Franman has close customer relationships with major shipping companies in Greece and have deep technical insight to ensure effective customer collaboration for design and installation of new water treatment systems. With the combination of our unique silicon carbon ceramic filtration technology and years of successful commercial demonstration in the marine industry, we look forward to our two companies come together effectively to expand our marine scrubber footprint and reduce environmental impact from shipping. As we look to the second quarter, beyond key oil and the gas order to the Middle East set for delivery in June, another key driver to our growth expectation is the commercial swimming pool market. During the second quarter, we expect to deliver eight systems in total with contributions coming from each of our key geographies and distribution partners. As a reminder, and for context, we delivered trendy swimming pool systems in all of 2023. The agreements we signed last year with Waterco, Barr + Wray, Total Pool (NASDAQ: POOL ) and Oxidine are all contributors with each delivering at least one system in Q2. I am pleased with the progress we have achieved on this key established market and look forward to continued market adoption in the years to come. Transition to our DPF business and the membrane business, another of our established markets. During the first quarter, DPF sales increased 31% compared to the year-ago first quarter, with sales of nearly $1.6 million. We are seeing increased interest for our DPF solutions within the European inland transportation market as renewed focus on black carbon emission reduction occurs. We are also seeing strong sales for our filters for emergency electricity generator. Similar to pool systems, we are pleased with the growth coming from our DPF solutions, which in many ways was an afterthought for LiqTech previously, but has become a solid contributor for us today. On the ceramic membrane side, we are making inroads to a couple of key potential markets with pilot testing going on at customer sites. These markets include petrochemicals, water treatment, paper and pulp and battery material concentration. We are also looking to scale up through OEM partners in China, Europe and the U.S. We believe this can be a driver for this component of our operations going ahead and hope to have more to share with you in the coming quarters on this pilot test. To wrap things up, before I turn over to Phillip to review the financials in more detail, as our outlook suggests, we expect to see good growth in the second quarter. We have eight pool systems scheduled for delivery with contributions coming from each of distribution partners we have across the world. These orders coupled with our Middle East oil and gas system set for delivery in June and an uptick in nearly each of our key established markets recurring product offerings such as DPF filters and membrane provides us with optimism for both the second quarter and the rest of the year. I look forward to our continued successful execution against the strategic plan we set for us. With that said, let me turn the call over to Phillip to review the financial results in more detail. Phillip?

Phillip Price: Thank you, Fei, and good morning, everyone. Now, let's dive into the financial highlights for the quarter. Revenue came in at $4.2 million compared to $4.0 million in the same quarter last year, representing an increase of 6%. This performance falls within our previously disclosed guidance. Broken down by verticals, sales were as follows: systems sales and related services of $1.5 million compared to $1.4 million in the same period last year and $1.6 million in Q4; DPF and ceramic membrane sales of $1.8 million compared to $1.4 million in the same period last year and up sequentially compared to the $1.4 million in Q4; and finally, plastics revenues of $0.9 million compared to $1.2 million in Q1 last year and $0.8 million in Q4. In summary, our ceramics business experienced a significant increase, the system sales and related services recorded a slight uptick, and the plastics underwent a notable decline. To be specific, the key revenue drivers for this quarter was the delivery of our first U.S.-based oil and gas produced water order as part of our new distribution agreement with Razorback Direct, along with increased sales of DPF and ceramic membrane sales attributed to focused sales efforts beginning from May 2023 that generated elevated activity in the current year. The decline in plastics revenue relates solely to a large one-off sale that was recorded in 2023 without recurrence in the current year. In terms of our forward guidance, as Fei mentioned, we expect the revenue for the second quarter of 2024 to be between $5 million and $5.5 million, which would be a significant increase of approximately 20% to 30% compared to the just ended quarter. We remain committed to growing our business over the coming quarter as we work intensively to execute on our ambition to further penetrate the global oil and gas, chemicals and pool system markets with our proven and industry-leading solutions. Looking at our gross profit for the quarter, we reported $0.3 million, or an implied gross profit margin of approximately 6.4% compared to $0.4 million and 9.8% in the prior-year's first quarter. The unfavorable change is, first of all, a result of the revenue mix for the quarter. In particular, the delivery of the containerized oil and gas pilot system impacted margins, resulting in a decrease compared to typical levels. This decision was strategic, undertaken to showcase and validate the effectiveness of our technology. As we still have overhead and other fixed costs that are not fully being absorbed, one of our key metrics we look at to highlight the progress being made is our contribution margin. During the quarter, when you back out fixed costs, our contribution margin ended at approximately 39% compared to 43% in the same quarter reported last year, with the unfavorable change mainly explained by revenue mix and especially the delivery of the containerized oil and gas pilot system as mentioned before. From an operational perspective, we continue to have excess capacity with the recently installed new kilns and revitalization of our ceramics facility. Hence, the immediate focus is to leverage the positive momentum and compress delivery lead times while still ensuring the delivery of high-quality membranes and filters. As previously stated, we still maintain our guidance that our business will be breakeven measured on an adjusted EBITDA basis, assuming a quarterly revenue of approximately $7 million and potentially lower with the right revenue mix. Turning to OpEx, total operating expenses for the quarter was $2.3 million compared to $2.6 million in Q1 of 2023. This is a decrease of $0.3 million, or approximately 10%. The decrease mainly reflects the release of 2023 bonus provisions, offset by increased insurance costs and expenses associated with the CFO transition. As stated, over the last few quarters, we remain focused on running a lean business by monitoring costs and carefully evaluating our spend to ensure that we do not jeopardize our financial objectives. Moving to the next item. Net other expenses during the quarter were $0.4 million compared to $0.2 million in Q1 of last year with the development mainly explained by the non-cash loss associated with the sale of fixed assets, partly offset by a gain on currency transactions due to the euro depreciation against the U.S. dollar during the period. Concluding on the P&L, net loss for the quarter was $2.4 million, which was consistent with the net loss reported in the first quarter of last year. However, this quarter's result was driven by revenue growth and a decrease in operating expenses, offset by lower margins as well as an increase in other expenses. And finally, let me briefly comment on our cash flow and balance sheet before summarizing and handing back over to Fei. We ended the quarter with $7.7 million in cash, down $2.7 million compared to the fourth quarter. This is explained by the cash used in operating activities, a reduction in accrued expenses related to the release of bonus provisions, an increase in prepaid expenses due to annual insurance premiums and IT licenses paid. And finally, an increased inventories, which is linked to the strategic sourcing for ongoing projects to cut delivery lead times. And also, historically, the first quarter has always been the most financially demanding period in terms of cash flow due to the annual expenses mentioned before. And finally, during this quarter, we managed to sell surplus equipment with the proceeds used to repay the related leasing liabilities in full. To summarize, balancing our cash flow remain a key KPI for our business as we're determined to preserve cash to maintain our strategic and financial flexibility. We also acknowledge that we need to increase the throughput of our existing facilities to accelerate growth, reduce lead times and ultimately pave the way to a business and balance both from a net income and cash flow perspective. Thank you again for your continued support, and back over to you, Fei.

Fei Chen: Thank you, Phillip. In closing, we remain committed to executing against our strategic roadmap, focused on long-term value creation. Over the past years, we have launched a clearly defined commercial strategy that has already yielded positive results. Going forward, our business will be underpinned by strong continuing revenues within our established businesses and increased foothold in our strategic target markets. The growth we expect in quarter two and the results of the year, coupled with improved operational execution across organization, will be key to drive [safe change] (ph) in gross margins and positive cash flows. I look forward to continuing to execute against our strategic initiatives in 2024 to drive value creation for our shareholders. One final comment before I turn it over to your questions. I will be participating together with Phillip in the Lytham Partners Spring 2024 Investor Conference on May 30. If you would like to schedule a one-on-one meeting, please contact Robert Blum, and he will be happy to coordinate for you. With that, operator, we would be happy to take any questions.

Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Rob Brown from Lake Street Capital Markets. Please go ahead.

Rob Brown: I guess, first question is on the U.S. oil and gas market. Great to see some progress there in getting delivery. Could you give us a sense of how the pilot program plays out? I think you talked about a relatively short assessment period. And then, maybe a sense of how the market development and pipeline development happens after that?

Fei Chen: As I mentioned in the talk, the pilot has arrived in the U.S. on the 30th of April. And actually, now it's already at the customer side. We are very happy to start running already this week and the coming week. So, we expect in the coming months or so, we're going to have the first testing results. So that will really give the clear indication about the performance of our pilot plan for the U.S. produced water. And we are already discussing with different companies and especially also with the Razorback Direct about a pipeline. So, there's a lot of things going on, and it's like really people are exciting to see the results of this pilot testing. So, we are very exciting to see the progress in the next couple of years -- months.

Rob Brown: Okay. Great. And I assume, given the Middle East system running for a couple of years that the progress will be favorable. Just want to get a sense, what's sort of the system benefits that the customer gets with your system? And maybe just what's the sales pitch that Razorback goes out with to its customer base?

Fei Chen: Thanks a lot, Rob. This is a very, very good question. The really good benefits of our system definitely is, our membrane is really suitable for this type of the water treatment. It's a highly oil content, and there's also metal content and also very high solid content. And we have demonstrated both in the Middle East and also actually through our marine scrubber market, and our membrane is really good for this type of treatment. And it really can be cleaned up very efficiently to keep the efficiency of filtration. And this is exactly the difference between our membrane and the polymer membrane. So, we really have the long lifetime and the very high efficiency is through a long period of time. And the second thing is we have a containerized solution. So, it's really -- it's very easy to use. It's mobilized, you can put down the track, can transport from one side to the other side. And also, it's a [modelized build] (ph). So basically, we only need demand at customer side, some basic utilities in place, then we can just put the container there and the plugging and really able to start treat. So, you don't need all those construction -- civil construction work. And also the footprint is very small. We have a very compact design of our system. And this really convenient to use and operating cost is much lower than the other existing technology in the market. So, those are the things we also -- really we're able to demonstrate through our pilot testing, both the quality of our filtration and also the OpEx data and also hold operation benefits. Those things, we're able to make our pitch much more sharp when we finish our pilot testing in a couple of months.

Rob Brown: Okay. Great. Thank you. And then, maybe on the Q2 ramp in revenue, I think you mentioned pool systems really stepping up. Could the pool market, does that become more of a diversified stream of activity there going forward? Or is there some kind of one-time stocking stuff going down, but just a sense of how the pool market is developing and how you see it playing out over the next 18 months or so?

Fei Chen: We are -- right now, we primarily active in Europe and Australia, and we are now moving into U.S. market. So, we would like to go to U.S., market to really find the partners for our pool system. And in Europe we have some huge markets like Holland and Germany. We're not really active today, and that's also something we're going to come in. So, next six months, we are entering the new territories for our pool system.

Rob Brown: Okay. Great. And then, in terms of the partnerships, you continue to add some nice partnerships. How much more is to go in getting the partnerships in place? Or do you feel like this -- that you've announced to kind of fill out where you were working on?

Fei Chen: I mean, we have just announced the two partnerships for marine area. And as you see, we will continue to find the partners and maybe different type of partner. But for marine, for example, we have the Dan Marine, it's really for the sales and distribution. And the Franman is different, because they have really network with the ship owner. So, what we're trying to do is we try to get the partners through a whole stakeholder group. So, in this way, our sales and max penetration will be much more efficient. So, this is our sauce, because we're already building quite some partnerships, and we want to be more clever really to use the partnership in a more multiple dimensions to really move our sales more efficient ahead in the selected verticals, which we are working.

Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Lucas Ward from Ascendiant Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Hi, Lucas, is your line on mute?

Lucas Ward: Yes, sorry about that. Lucas Ward here. Good afternoon, Fei and Phillip...

Fei Chen: Good afternoon, Lucas.

Lucas Ward: ...and congratulations on your business progress. Hi. So, I wanted to look at the overall revenue opportunity and just sort of understand like what are the keys to really scaling it up, because it looks like you have so many opportunities in different geographies and different verticals and you have the filter opportunities and the system opportunities, and it's almost like you're planting seeds in a lot of different places. And so, I guess I wanted to ask from your perspective, what are the keys to really scaling those, growing them?

Fei Chen: I mean, that was a very good observation. We are planting the seeds, because what we have found out is our strategic focus area that means swimming pool system, DPF and marine and oil and gas. If we just look at the membrane, if we look at all this together, we actually have addressed the market potential of US$4 billion. So, today, we have market share less than 1%. So, we are actually in the process really clear out the way and putting the seeds for the next wave of growth. So, what you can see is the DPF actually, we are doing very good now in Europe. And we would like to see in next year or coming years where is the new playground, but we would like still really grow in Europe first of all. And the pool system, we are growing very well now in the U.K. and in Australia and in Spain, and we would like to also go to the other markets. So, you'll see now is really we're putting on the foundation, but really can grow fast in the future. And we feel really -- can see the last years as we've done in the different segment, and it's the right way to go. So, we are continuing to putting the seeds on the ground, and then we will harvest them in the coming period. But it's really a very exciting period ahead for us.

Phillip Price: And Lucas, also, just to add some color, it's also just not to be reliable on only one business area. So, to spread our risk.

Lucas Ward: Got it. Okay. Can you comment more on competition? Like how much of a factor -- because the way you presented it, it sounds like it's just -- it's mostly a sales and marketing challenge. It's a matter of like finding the right partners and the resources and just going after it. But could you also comment on who you see in various verticals and geographies? Are they the same players over and over again? And how much does competition impact your ability to get those design wins?

Fei Chen: The interesting about our market is that we don't have a uniform competitor across all the segments. So, we actually have different competition in different segment, and they all different from each to other. And if we take a DPF as example, before we actually had a competitor in Denmark, but that company has been bought by a Chinese company. So, the whole production has been moved to China. So that actually give us a competitive advantage because we are the European company and many of the European customers like to buy from European company. So that's very interesting. And we do have some competition in Germany and in Japan and the French. But we are the ones in the niche is we are very flexible and able to deliver fast and with a high-end product. And that was our special in this DPF area. And many of our customers are recurring customers. So, this is a very solid customer base, and they are still growing. It's given us a very good basis for the revenue income. And if we take the swimming pool area, our competition technology is a sand filter. And our filtration technology solution for the pool system is much more environmental friendly and energy saving and the water saving and the chemical reduction. So, we have some really unique value propositions for this market. So, it's really, for me, it's really only the marketing and the sales speed from our side, it's going to push ahead. And the oil and gas areas, we are still new. We're trying to get in. But we definitely see there's a need for our solutions in that sector. We don't see any heads-on competition yet, and we are keeping very much alert to see what is coming when we have opened the door and really able to demonstrate our technology. And marine area, we did have very strong competition. As I mentioned in the last couple of calls, and we had very good [indiscernible] market. We go into a very dominant position and there's many Chinese cheap solutions coming with a very bad performance, and they cannot flush the market. So, right now, we are trying to go back in the market with much more clear view and go to the high end and like this exhausted gas recirculation. That's a market, those cheap technology cannot really stand, and we're trying to go back there and really occupy market, because that was perfect for our solution. So, we come back with some more smart solution and a different angle. So, this you can hear different segments, there are different competition. We don't have one word competition across the all segment.

Lucas Ward: Okay. Thank you, Fei. One more question on operating expenses. It was surprisingly low. It hasn't been this low for a long time, and it was attributed to this release of bonus provisions. I just wanted to understand like what that means and what I should expect going forward in terms of modeling operating expenses?

Phillip Price: Yes, of course. So, the release of bonus provisions relates to the 2023 KPIs. So, we didn't meet the target, and therefore, we released the bonus provisions, hence, the positive effect on the OpEx. But the level that you should expect is around $2.6 million per quarter.

Lucas Ward: Okay. All right. That's all I had.

Fei Chen: Okay. We are very much cost conscious. So, we're really trying to increase our output from production and output from the salespeople. So, we're really trying to become more and more efficient. And in this way, we actually can keep the operating cost down and increase the sales and our revenue at the same time. So, this is one of very clear KPI for us, and we're also trying to improve our process across the whole value chain.

Lucas Ward: Okay. Yeah, it didn't -- it seemed like there was more going on there, like more of a sort of a structural shift towards cost savings. So, thanks for confirming that.

Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from George Melas from MKH Management. Please go ahead.

George Melas: Good morning, good afternoon, Fei and Phillip. Good job on the quarter and the progress.

Fei Chen: Thank you.

George Melas: I had a question about the U.S. oil and gas order. I'm trying to understand how it happened so fast. Was it that basically Razorback sort of had a customer and that had a problem and they went looking for technology and found you and signed that distribution agreement and then they were able to propose a solution to their customer? Or did they sign a relationship with you first and then started looking for customers and one happened to happen so fast?

Fei Chen: I think that's a very interesting question. I have to say in this way, we are very happy. We find this very good partner to work with because they are in the oil and the gas market and very much alert what is customer needs. So, they have a very strong customer network and the customer group already. So, they know exactly what the customer is really looking for and really lack of the technology. And we have found out the chemistry of these two companies match very well, and there are some very clever technical people and the commercial people in Razorback Direct. So since we start discussion -- simultaneously, we already started discussing present our technology to them, and also they tell us what the customer needs. So it's not like we sign the contract, then we start work together. We already start work, at the same time we signed the contract, and that's also a process. We find out this is the partner we would like to work together with. So that's why there's more than only one month we find the customer. But I have to say it's a really, really good at them. They have a customer really had a really need for a new solution for their problem. So, this is a very good match.

George Melas: Okay. Great. Okay. And then, how many different other solutions can they propose to their customers in terms of treating the produced water? Because, clearly, they have some solutions right now, but you are a new technology that they offer. So, how -- what are the alternatives that they have provided in the past?

Fei Chen: I mean, this is a general knowledge in the market for all the people in the oil and gas market. The pretreatment for produced water is rather tough because the water is nasty. You have a lot of oil inside and a lot of metal content and also salt and solid, many solid particles. So, traditionally, there are many different kind of chemical treatment method for this part. And I think most of people, they don't like use chemical method today. So, when they see our solutions, some needs and also automation and really kind of user friendly also both for the operator and for the environment. So, they really got excited about this and they see potential right away because they are kind of tired of the chemical process -- chemical treatment. So, this is -- you can be lucky sometimes. I think we are lucky because they are looking for something better than what they have today.

George Melas: Okay. Great. And then, one final question on the pool systems. Given the existing distributors that you have, so assuming you're not adding any distributors, but I think you will, but with the existing distributors, do you expect to have to beat the 2023 deliveries? You had 20 deliveries in '23. With the existing distributors, can you match that or beat that?

Fei Chen: We are definitely trying to work with our existing distributors, make them much more efficient. So, I expect their sales grow because, I mean, if they grow their sales and we can grow our revenue. And at the same time, we're also going to build new distributors in the next half year. So, it's a combination of both, but I definitely expect our distributors every year, their sales should grow.

George Melas: Okay. And then, what kind of visibility do you have into the pipeline there -- their pipeline?

Fei Chen: We have totally transparency. So, we really work closely together. So, they're really our partners.

Robert Blum: Fei and Phillip, I've got just a couple of questions here through the webcast portal that I want to make sure we get addressed. So, I'll try to move through a few of these quickly and summarize where there's some overlap. First one is, can you talk about sort of your general sales approach in the United States? It seems like that's a focus area for you. Is this going to be sort of a team approach, marketing, distributors? Just expand a little bit more on your focus in the U.S.?

Fei Chen: We have the first distribution partner for the oil and gas area, Razorback Direct. And what we're working with them is really very close to together. We do the testing together, and we do the marketing together, and we're doing the sales pipeline together and the sales work also together. And their people will do the ground service, and we will be the back office and also the technical support for them. So, there will be our arm and the legs in the U.S. ground. So, this is for the oil and gas. And definitely, we will continue to grow this relationship. And for the pool system, we expect also to find some partners in the U.S. market to help us do the marketing and the sales and also potentially in the future, also the service. So, it's really a strong partnership we are working in the U.S., trying to really make the sales penetration in this market. U.S. is a very big market. So definitely, we will not only have one partner, and we need more partners. But we would like to take one at a time and really make that happen, then we see what that brings next.

Robert Blum: All right. Fantastic. A couple of questions here. Just sort of talking about sort of your breakeven, which I know you talked on a little bit, but maybe just to expand a little bit on sort of the outlook here, your breakeven rate sort of goals in terms of achieving positive cash flow, et cetera.

Phillip Price: Yeah. So, as we mentioned before, we still maintain the guidance for when the business will be breakeven and that's with a quarterly revenue of approximately $7 million, potentially lower if we have the right revenue mix. Regarding to the cash flow, that's, of course, a key KPI for us, we are determined to preserve the cash in order to maintain our strategic and financial flexibility. We'd also acknowledge that we need to increase the throughput of our existing facilities in order to accelerate growth and reduce lead times and ultimately pave the way to a business in balance from both a net income and cash flow perspective. And also what Fei mentioned before is that our main focus is on running a lean business.

Robert Blum: All right. Fantastic. It looks like I've got one last question here. You've talked about some of the growth, I guess, within the DPF solutions, referenced Europe inland transportation and electricity emergency generators. Maybe just expand on what some of the drivers are for that? Is it sort of a sales approach? Or is this sort of a market-driven approach? Just expand a little bit more on the DPF growth there.

Fei Chen: I would say it's a very, very strong trend. We have fear now in the market. And the European inland transportation, it got more and more public and politic awareness. So people really start looking in these sectors and start talking about how much emission they actually give to people through this inland transportation. So, countries like Holland and Germany definitely are looking at that now, and that's what we feel. And we do get some very good customers, and the stronger ones, they actually go into this area and really have a very close collaboration with us in that. And we expect to see this growing in the coming years, definitely. And for the electricity emergency generators, purely is very much is for the data center around the world. And they need to have this DPF installed any of the data center they are building today, especially in combination with artificial intelligence because there's a lot of data center building especially for those ones. And they are definitely around the world. It's not only Europe and also in U.S. and so on. And we are actually been seeing as one of the preferred partners even also by some U.S. companies to produce -- to provide this DPF to them. So, what we feel is we have a quite good reputation in the DPF market. And the many -- very often, the DPF market is most measured. It's not really the massive marketing approach. So, they have this very good relationship and also good reputation in the market. In many cases, actually customer they come to us by themselves, but we're also going out to proactively going to some conference and try to find the target customers to really work with them. So, this is a two-way we are working on. And we are very excited to see this development, and we're really confident this DPF market is going to be continued growth market for us in the coming years or so.

Robert Blum: All right. Fantastic. Very helpful. It appears we have no further questions here either online or through the teleconference. So, Fei, I'll go ahead and turn it back over to you for closing remarks.

Fei Chen: Thank you, Robert. Thank you all very much for being with us today. We look forward to communicating with you all soon again. Thank you.

Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

This growth was primarily driven by the company's first U.S.-based oil and gas produced water order and continued strength in diesel particulate filters (DPF) and ceramic membrane sales.

The company has projected a significant revenue increase for the second quarter, estimating between $5 million and $5.5 million, indicating a 20% to 30% sequential growth. LiqTech's strategic partnerships and expansion into new markets, including the commercial swimming pool market, are key factors in its optimistic outlook for future growth.

LiqTech International's Q1 financial performance reflects a company poised for growth through strategic partnerships and market expansion. With a clear focus on operational efficiency and cost management, the company is navigating its path toward increased profitability and market share in its specialized filtration technology sector.

LiqTech International (LIQT) appears to be navigating a challenging financial landscape, as reflected by the real-time data from InvestingPro. With a market capitalization of $15.16 million, the company's valuation metrics indicate some concerns. The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio stands at -1.91, highlighting that investors may be wary of the company's earnings potential. This is further underscored by an adjusted P/E ratio for the last twelve months as of Q4 2023 of -1.88. The PEG ratio, which measures the stock's price relative to its earnings growth, is notably negative at -0.03, suggesting that the market may not be factoring in strong future earnings growth.

In terms of financial health, LiqTech's revenue for the last twelve months as of Q4 2023 was $18.0 million, with a growth of 12.63%, indicating some positive momentum in sales. However, the company's gross profit margin during the same period was 15.42%, which could be a point of concern for investors looking for higher profitability.

InvestingPro Tips for LIQT reveal that analysts are not expecting the company to be profitable this year, and the valuation implies a poor free cash flow yield. On a more positive note, the company's liquid assets exceed its short-term obligations, providing some financial stability. Yet, the stock is trading near its 52-week low and has been flagged for poor price performance over the last decade.

Fei Chen: Thank you, Robert, and good day to everyone on the call. I am excited to have this opportunity to speak with you and hear an update on the solid progress we have made as we maintain our focus on delivering against the strategic plan we instituted over the past year to successfully stabilize and grow our business initially through our established markets and then position ourselves for incremental growth through our target markets. As a quick reminder, our established markets are marks where we have extensive customer bases and typically have reduced sales cycle times. This includes commercial pool systems, diesel particulate fitters, marine scrubbers and other areas where we have recurring revenue opportunities, such as general aftermarket sales and the plastics. This established business markets provides a strong and stable base of revenue for LiqTech and allow us to gain manufacturing efficiencies by leveraging our existing production capacity. Our target markets include key markets where our high-performance ceramic -- silicon carbon ceramic membrane can provide customers with a strong return on their investments. This include specific industry filtration applications to remove solid, oil, pathogens and heavy metals from water as well as compounds from emissions and industrial off-gases. These areas tend to have longer sales cycles, but it's our belief that if we align ourselves with great partners and establish key reference customers, the sales cycles will decrease and the large market opportunity will open up for LiqTech. I am pleased to report that strategy is working. As I assume most of you saw, we are expecting a significant step-up sequentially in revenue for the second quarter, with revenue to be between $5 million and $5.5 million. This would represent an approximate 20% to 30% sequential revenue growth. But before we talk about a few of the forward-looking expectations and the drivers to the strong second quarter we expect, let's first look back at the progress made during the first quarter. Revenue during quarter one increased 6% compared to Q1 of 2023, driven by delivery of our first U.S.-based oil and gas produced water order as part of our new distribution agreement with Razorback Direct as well as strength in our DPF and the ceramic membrane business. The U.S.-based oil and gas order was a critical development for us in many ways. First, it expands our presence in North America by showcasing the benefit of our produced water treatment solutions to the oil and gas industry. And the second, the order comes rapidly on the heels of us signing our distribution agreement with Razorback Direct in March 2024, highlighting what we believe will be [straining] (ph) interest for our dissolutions in North America. The containerized pilot system that Razorback Direct orders arrived in Houston on April 30th and will be used as a customer site to test, demonstrate and document the efficiency of LiqTech's ultrafiltration technology in treating produced water to facilitate beneficial industry reuse and meet current and future regulatory requirements. Longer term, the intention is to use the results from this pilot operation as a basis to defend and implement full-scale commercial systems for the onshore oil and gas application in the U.S. Let me be clear that our expectation is that this will not be a multi-year trial process. It is our belief that the initial results received in the next few months will help to validate our solutions and provide the data necessary for other customers to move forward. As we stated during our year-end call, the North American oil and the gas market is going to be a key focus for LiqTech moving further forward, and we couldn't be more pleased to be partnered with the great team at Razorback Direct, who has a strong presence in key oil and gas geographies in U.S. Building on the success of North American oil and gas order, we received another significant oil and gas produced water commercial pilot order in the first quarter from National Energy Services Reunited (OTC:NESR), or NESR, in the Middle East. This unit will be used in Gulf Cooperation Council countries by one of the largest integrated energy and chemical companies in the world and is scheduled to deliver in June. This will be a key component of the strong second quarter that we are expecting. Similar to the U.S. order, we believe that this commercial test unit for produced water has the ability to open the doors for additional orders with this customer and many other operators in the region. The Middle East tends to move a bit slower than in the U.S., but this one of our systems installed two years ago, operating to expectations. We believe there is an opportunity to move rapidly forward with other customers in this geography as well. Overall, I am pleased with the progress made against our oil and gas target market initiatives and look forward to incremental progress in 2024. Let's transition to a few key developments since our last call in our established markets, starting with marine scrubbers. Last week, we announced entry into a partnership with the Dan Marine Group, or DMG, to expand our presence in the Chinese shipbuilding and repair market from marine scrubber water treatment solutions as well as new exhaust gas recirculation water treatment systems for dual-fuel marine vessels. The agreement also includes the servicing by DMG of existing LiqTech's marine installations, including fast delivery of spare parts and on-site repair work. Dan Marine Group has close customer relationships in the marine industry and the strong sales and service organization in China with locations close to customers for shipbuilding and repair. A key component to this partnership is our ability to leverage DMG's highly skilled sales and service capabilities to sell, install and service our marine water treatment systems. The other highlight here is the market for new exhaust gas recirculation water treatment systems for dual-fuel marine vessels. Maritime industry is undergoing a significant transition towards cleaner fuel and reduced environmental emissions. In the coming five years, more than half of the new vessels will be built with dual-fuel engines, which make them be able to operate with LNG or methanol. For this new type of vessels, there is a need for highly sufficient and reliable water treatment systems. LiqTech solution is the perfect fit to this application. We look forward to the opportunities that this new partnership can bring for us in Chinese marine scrubbers and the exhaust gas recirculation market. The second key partnerships we entered was with the Franman, a well-established maritime representative to the shipping industry to market our scrubber water treatment solutions within Greece. For those not aware, Greece is the largest ship-owning market in the world. Franman has close customer relationships with major shipping companies in Greece and have deep technical insight to ensure effective customer collaboration for design and installation of new water treatment systems. With the combination of our unique silicon carbon ceramic filtration technology and years of successful commercial demonstration in the marine industry, we look forward to our two companies come together effectively to expand our marine scrubber footprint and reduce environmental impact from shipping. As we look to the second quarter, beyond key oil and the gas order to the Middle East set for delivery in June, another key driver to our growth expectation is the commercial swimming pool market. During the second quarter, we expect to deliver eight systems in total with contributions coming from each of our key geographies and distribution partners. As a reminder, and for context, we delivered trendy swimming pool systems in all of 2023. The agreements we signed last year with Waterco, Barr + Wray, Total Pool (NASDAQ:POOL) and Oxidine are all contributors with each delivering at least one system in Q2. I am pleased with the progress we have achieved on this key established market and look forward to continued market adoption in the years to come. Transition to our DPF business and the membrane business, another of our established markets. During the first quarter, DPF sales increased 31% compared to the year-ago first quarter, with sales of nearly $1.6 million. We are seeing increased interest for our DPF solutions within the European inland transportation market as renewed focus on black carbon emission reduction occurs. We are also seeing strong sales for our filters for emergency electricity generator. Similar to pool systems, we are pleased with the growth coming from our DPF solutions, which in many ways was an afterthought for LiqTech previously, but has become a solid contributor for us today. On the ceramic membrane side, we are making inroads to a couple of key potential markets with pilot testing going on at customer sites. These markets include petrochemicals, water treatment, paper and pulp and battery material concentration. We are also looking to scale up through OEM partners in China, Europe and the U.S. We believe this can be a driver for this component of our operations going ahead and hope to have more to share with you in the coming quarters on this pilot test. To wrap things up, before I turn over to Phillip to review the financials in more detail, as our outlook suggests, we expect to see good growth in the second quarter. We have eight pool systems scheduled for delivery with contributions coming from each of distribution partners we have across the world. These orders coupled with our Middle East oil and gas system set for delivery in June and an uptick in nearly each of our key established markets recurring product offerings such as DPF filters and membrane provides us with optimism for both the second quarter and the rest of the year. I look forward to our continued successful execution against the strategic plan we set for us. With that said, let me turn the call over to Phillip to review the financial results in more detail. Phillip?

Phillip Price: Thank you, Fei, and good morning, everyone. Now, let's dive into the financial highlights for the quarter. Revenue came in at $4.2 million compared to $4.0 million in the same quarter last year, representing an increase of 6%. This performance falls within our previously disclosed guidance. Broken down by verticals, sales were as follows: systems sales and related services of $1.5 million compared to $1.4 million in the same period last year and $1.6 million in Q4; DPF and ceramic membrane sales of $1.8 million compared to $1.4 million in the same period last year and up sequentially compared to the $1.4 million in Q4; and finally, plastics revenues of $0.9 million compared to $1.2 million in Q1 last year and $0.8 million in Q4. In summary, our ceramics business experienced a significant increase, the system sales and related services recorded a slight uptick, and the plastics underwent a notable decline. To be specific, the key revenue drivers for this quarter was the delivery of our first U.S.-based oil and gas produced water order as part of our new distribution agreement with Razorback Direct, along with increased sales of DPF and ceramic membrane sales attributed to focused sales efforts beginning from May 2023 that generated elevated activity in the current year. The decline in plastics revenue relates solely to a large one-off sale that was recorded in 2023 without recurrence in the current year. In terms of our forward guidance, as Fei mentioned, we expect the revenue for the second quarter of 2024 to be between $5 million and $5.5 million, which would be a significant increase of approximately 20% to 30% compared to the just ended quarter. We remain committed to growing our business over the coming quarter as we work intensively to execute on our ambition to further penetrate the global oil and gas, chemicals and pool system markets with our proven and industry-leading solutions. Looking at our gross profit for the quarter, we reported $0.3 million, or an implied gross profit margin of approximately 6.4% compared to $0.4 million and 9.8% in the prior-year's first quarter. The unfavorable change is, first of all, a result of the revenue mix for the quarter. In particular, the delivery of the containerized oil and gas pilot system impacted margins, resulting in a decrease compared to typical levels. This decision was strategic, undertaken to showcase and validate the effectiveness of our technology. As we still have overhead and other fixed costs that are not fully being absorbed, one of our key metrics we look at to highlight the progress being made is our contribution margin. During the quarter, when you back out fixed costs, our contribution margin ended at approximately 39% compared to 43% in the same quarter reported last year, with the unfavorable change mainly explained by revenue mix and especially the delivery of the containerized oil and gas pilot system as mentioned before. From an operational perspective, we continue to have excess capacity with the recently installed new kilns and revitalization of our ceramics facility. Hence, the immediate focus is to leverage the positive momentum and compress delivery lead times while still ensuring the delivery of high-quality membranes and filters. As previously stated, we still maintain our guidance that our business will be breakeven measured on an adjusted EBITDA basis, assuming a quarterly revenue of approximately $7 million and potentially lower with the right revenue mix. Turning to OpEx, total operating expenses for the quarter was $2.3 million compared to $2.6 million in Q1 of 2023. This is a decrease of $0.3 million, or approximately 10%. The decrease mainly reflects the release of 2023 bonus provisions, offset by increased insurance costs and expenses associated with the CFO transition. As stated, over the last few quarters, we remain focused on running a lean business by monitoring costs and carefully evaluating our spend to ensure that we do not jeopardize our financial objectives. Moving to the next item. Net other expenses during the quarter were $0.4 million compared to $0.2 million in Q1 of last year with the development mainly explained by the non-cash loss associated with the sale of fixed assets, partly offset by a gain on currency transactions due to the euro depreciation against the U.S. dollar during the period. Concluding on the P&L, net loss for the quarter was $2.4 million, which was consistent with the net loss reported in the first quarter of last year. However, this quarter's result was driven by revenue growth and a decrease in operating expenses, offset by lower margins as well as an increase in other expenses. And finally, let me briefly comment on our cash flow and balance sheet before summarizing and handing back over to Fei. We ended the quarter with $7.7 million in cash, down $2.7 million compared to the fourth quarter. This is explained by the cash used in operating activities, a reduction in accrued expenses related to the release of bonus provisions, an increase in prepaid expenses due to annual insurance premiums and IT licenses paid. And finally, an increased inventories, which is linked to the strategic sourcing for ongoing projects to cut delivery lead times. And also, historically, the first quarter has always been the most financially demanding period in terms of cash flow due to the annual expenses mentioned before. And finally, during this quarter, we managed to sell surplus equipment with the proceeds used to repay the related leasing liabilities in full. To summarize, balancing our cash flow remain a key KPI for our business as we're determined to preserve cash to maintain our strategic and financial flexibility. We also acknowledge that we need to increase the throughput of our existing facilities to accelerate growth, reduce lead times and ultimately pave the way to a business and balance both from a net income and cash flow perspective. Thank you again for your continued support, and back over to you, Fei.

Fei Chen: Thank you, Phillip. In closing, we remain committed to executing against our strategic roadmap, focused on long-term value creation. Over the past years, we have launched a clearly defined commercial strategy that has already yielded positive results. Going forward, our business will be underpinned by strong continuing revenues within our established businesses and increased foothold in our strategic target markets. The growth we expect in quarter two and the results of the year, coupled with improved operational execution across organization, will be key to drive [safe change] (ph) in gross margins and positive cash flows. I look forward to continuing to execute against our strategic initiatives in 2024 to drive value creation for our shareholders. One final comment before I turn it over to your questions. I will be participating together with Phillip in the Lytham Partners Spring 2024 Investor Conference on May 30. If you would like to schedule a one-on-one meeting, please contact Robert Blum, and he will be happy to coordinate for you. With that, operator, we would be happy to take any questions.

Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Rob Brown from Lake Street Capital Markets. Please go ahead.

Rob Brown: I guess, first question is on the U.S. oil and gas market. Great to see some progress there in getting delivery. Could you give us a sense of how the pilot program plays out? I think you talked about a relatively short assessment period. And then, maybe a sense of how the market development and pipeline development happens after that?

Fei Chen: As I mentioned in the talk, the pilot has arrived in the U.S. on the 30th of April. And actually, now it's already at the customer side. We are very happy to start running already this week and the coming week. So, we expect in the coming months or so, we're going to have the first testing results. So that will really give the clear indication about the performance of our pilot plan for the U.S. produced water. And we are already discussing with different companies and especially also with the Razorback Direct about a pipeline. So, there's a lot of things going on, and it's like really people are exciting to see the results of this pilot testing. So, we are very exciting to see the progress in the next couple of years -- months.

Rob Brown: Okay. Great. And I assume, given the Middle East system running for a couple of years that the progress will be favorable. Just want to get a sense, what's sort of the system benefits that the customer gets with your system? And maybe just what's the sales pitch that Razorback goes out with to its customer base?

Fei Chen: Thanks a lot, Rob. This is a very, very good question. The really good benefits of our system definitely is, our membrane is really suitable for this type of the water treatment. It's a highly oil content, and there's also metal content and also very high solid content. And we have demonstrated both in the Middle East and also actually through our marine scrubber market, and our membrane is really good for this type of treatment. And it really can be cleaned up very efficiently to keep the efficiency of filtration. And this is exactly the difference between our membrane and the polymer membrane. So, we really have the long lifetime and the very high efficiency is through a long period of time. And the second thing is we have a containerized solution. So, it's really -- it's very easy to use. It's mobilized, you can put down the track, can transport from one side to the other side. And also, it's a [modelized build] (ph). So basically, we only need demand at customer side, some basic utilities in place, then we can just put the container there and the plugging and really able to start treat. So, you don't need all those construction -- civil construction work. And also the footprint is very small. We have a very compact design of our system. And this really convenient to use and operating cost is much lower than the other existing technology in the market. So, those are the things we also -- really we're able to demonstrate through our pilot testing, both the quality of our filtration and also the OpEx data and also hold operation benefits. Those things, we're able to make our pitch much more sharp when we finish our pilot testing in a couple of months.

Rob Brown: Okay. Great. Thank you. And then, maybe on the Q2 ramp in revenue, I think you mentioned pool systems really stepping up. Could the pool market, does that become more of a diversified stream of activity there going forward? Or is there some kind of one-time stocking stuff going down, but just a sense of how the pool market is developing and how you see it playing out over the next 18 months or so?

Fei Chen: We are -- right now, we primarily active in Europe and Australia, and we are now moving into U.S. market. So, we would like to go to U.S., market to really find the partners for our pool system. And in Europe we have some huge markets like Holland and Germany. We're not really active today, and that's also something we're going to come in. So, next six months, we are entering the new territories for our pool system.

Rob Brown: Okay. Great. And then, in terms of the partnerships, you continue to add some nice partnerships. How much more is to go in getting the partnerships in place? Or do you feel like this -- that you've announced to kind of fill out where you were working on?

Fei Chen: I mean, we have just announced the two partnerships for marine area. And as you see, we will continue to find the partners and maybe different type of partner. But for marine, for example, we have the Dan Marine, it's really for the sales and distribution. And the Franman is different, because they have really network with the ship owner. So, what we're trying to do is we try to get the partners through a whole stakeholder group. So, in this way, our sales and max penetration will be much more efficient. So, this is our sauce, because we're already building quite some partnerships, and we want to be more clever really to use the partnership in a more multiple dimensions to really move our sales more efficient ahead in the selected verticals, which we are working.

Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Lucas Ward from Ascendiant Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Hi, Lucas, is your line on mute?

Lucas Ward: Yes, sorry about that. Lucas Ward here. Good afternoon, Fei and Phillip...

Fei Chen: Good afternoon, Lucas.

Lucas Ward: ...and congratulations on your business progress. Hi. So, I wanted to look at the overall revenue opportunity and just sort of understand like what are the keys to really scaling it up, because it looks like you have so many opportunities in different geographies and different verticals and you have the filter opportunities and the system opportunities, and it's almost like you're planting seeds in a lot of different places. And so, I guess I wanted to ask from your perspective, what are the keys to really scaling those, growing them?

Fei Chen: I mean, that was a very good observation. We are planting the seeds, because what we have found out is our strategic focus area that means swimming pool system, DPF and marine and oil and gas. If we just look at the membrane, if we look at all this together, we actually have addressed the market potential of US$4 billion. So, today, we have market share less than 1%. So, we are actually in the process really clear out the way and putting the seeds for the next wave of growth. So, what you can see is the DPF actually, we are doing very good now in Europe. And we would like to see in next year or coming years where is the new playground, but we would like still really grow in Europe first of all. And the pool system, we are growing very well now in the U.K. and in Australia and in Spain, and we would like to also go to the other markets. So, you'll see now is really we're putting on the foundation, but really can grow fast in the future. And we feel really -- can see the last years as we've done in the different segment, and it's the right way to go. So, we are continuing to putting the seeds on the ground, and then we will harvest them in the coming period. But it's really a very exciting period ahead for us.

Phillip Price: And Lucas, also, just to add some color, it's also just not to be reliable on only one business area. So, to spread our risk.

Lucas Ward: Got it. Okay. Can you comment more on competition? Like how much of a factor -- because the way you presented it, it sounds like it's just -- it's mostly a sales and marketing challenge. It's a matter of like finding the right partners and the resources and just going after it. But could you also comment on who you see in various verticals and geographies? Are they the same players over and over again? And how much does competition impact your ability to get those design wins?

Fei Chen: The interesting about our market is that we don't have a uniform competitor across all the segments. So, we actually have different competition in different segment, and they all different from each to other. And if we take a DPF as example, before we actually had a competitor in Denmark, but that company has been bought by a Chinese company. So, the whole production has been moved to China. So that actually give us a competitive advantage because we are the European company and many of the European customers like to buy from European company. So that's very interesting. And we do have some competition in Germany and in Japan and the French. But we are the ones in the niche is we are very flexible and able to deliver fast and with a high-end product. And that was our special in this DPF area. And many of our customers are recurring customers. So, this is a very solid customer base, and they are still growing. It's given us a very good basis for the revenue income. And if we take the swimming pool area, our competition technology is a sand filter. And our filtration technology solution for the pool system is much more environmental friendly and energy saving and the water saving and the chemical reduction. So, we have some really unique value propositions for this market. So, it's really, for me, it's really only the marketing and the sales speed from our side, it's going to push ahead. And the oil and gas areas, we are still new. We're trying to get in. But we definitely see there's a need for our solutions in that sector. We don't see any heads-on competition yet, and we are keeping very much alert to see what is coming when we have opened the door and really able to demonstrate our technology. And marine area, we did have very strong competition. As I mentioned in the last couple of calls, and we had very good [indiscernible] market. We go into a very dominant position and there's many Chinese cheap solutions coming with a very bad performance, and they cannot flush the market. So, right now, we are trying to go back in the market with much more clear view and go to the high end and like this exhausted gas recirculation. That's a market, those cheap technology cannot really stand, and we're trying to go back there and really occupy market, because that was perfect for our solution. So, we come back with some more smart solution and a different angle. So, this you can hear different segments, there are different competition. We don't have one word competition across the all segment.

Lucas Ward: Okay. Thank you, Fei. One more question on operating expenses. It was surprisingly low. It hasn't been this low for a long time, and it was attributed to this release of bonus provisions. I just wanted to understand like what that means and what I should expect going forward in terms of modeling operating expenses?

Phillip Price: Yes, of course. So, the release of bonus provisions relates to the 2023 KPIs. So, we didn't meet the target, and therefore, we released the bonus provisions, hence, the positive effect on the OpEx. But the level that you should expect is around $2.6 million per quarter.

Lucas Ward: Okay. All right. That's all I had.

Fei Chen: Okay. We are very much cost conscious. So, we're really trying to increase our output from production and output from the salespeople. So, we're really trying to become more and more efficient. And in this way, we actually can keep the operating cost down and increase the sales and our revenue at the same time. So, this is one of very clear KPI for us, and we're also trying to improve our process across the whole value chain.

Lucas Ward: Okay. Yeah, it didn't -- it seemed like there was more going on there, like more of a sort of a structural shift towards cost savings. So, thanks for confirming that.

Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from George Melas from MKH Management. Please go ahead.

George Melas: Good morning, good afternoon, Fei and Phillip. Good job on the quarter and the progress.

Fei Chen: Thank you.

George Melas: I had a question about the U.S. oil and gas order. I'm trying to understand how it happened so fast. Was it that basically Razorback sort of had a customer and that had a problem and they went looking for technology and found you and signed that distribution agreement and then they were able to propose a solution to their customer? Or did they sign a relationship with you first and then started looking for customers and one happened to happen so fast?

Fei Chen: I think that's a very interesting question. I have to say in this way, we are very happy. We find this very good partner to work with because they are in the oil and the gas market and very much alert what is customer needs. So, they have a very strong customer network and the customer group already. So, they know exactly what the customer is really looking for and really lack of the technology. And we have found out the chemistry of these two companies match very well, and there are some very clever technical people and the commercial people in Razorback Direct. So since we start discussion -- simultaneously, we already started discussing present our technology to them, and also they tell us what the customer needs. So it's not like we sign the contract, then we start work together. We already start work, at the same time we signed the contract, and that's also a process. We find out this is the partner we would like to work together with. So that's why there's more than only one month we find the customer. But I have to say it's a really, really good at them. They have a customer really had a really need for a new solution for their problem. So, this is a very good match.

George Melas: Okay. Great. Okay. And then, how many different other solutions can they propose to their customers in terms of treating the produced water? Because, clearly, they have some solutions right now, but you are a new technology that they offer. So, how -- what are the alternatives that they have provided in the past?

Fei Chen: I mean, this is a general knowledge in the market for all the people in the oil and gas market. The pretreatment for produced water is rather tough because the water is nasty. You have a lot of oil inside and a lot of metal content and also salt and solid, many solid particles. So, traditionally, there are many different kind of chemical treatment method for this part. And I think most of people, they don't like use chemical method today. So, when they see our solutions, some needs and also automation and really kind of user friendly also both for the operator and for the environment. So, they really got excited about this and they see potential right away because they are kind of tired of the chemical process -- chemical treatment. So, this is -- you can be lucky sometimes. I think we are lucky because they are looking for something better than what they have today.

George Melas: Okay. Great. And then, one final question on the pool systems. Given the existing distributors that you have, so assuming you're not adding any distributors, but I think you will, but with the existing distributors, do you expect to have to beat the 2023 deliveries? You had 20 deliveries in '23. With the existing distributors, can you match that or beat that?

Fei Chen: We are definitely trying to work with our existing distributors, make them much more efficient. So, I expect their sales grow because, I mean, if they grow their sales and we can grow our revenue. And at the same time, we're also going to build new distributors in the next half year. So, it's a combination of both, but I definitely expect our distributors every year, their sales should grow.

George Melas: Okay. And then, what kind of visibility do you have into the pipeline there -- their pipeline?

Fei Chen: We have totally transparency. So, we really work closely together. So, they're really our partners.

Robert Blum: Fei and Phillip, I've got just a couple of questions here through the webcast portal that I want to make sure we get addressed. So, I'll try to move through a few of these quickly and summarize where there's some overlap. First one is, can you talk about sort of your general sales approach in the United States? It seems like that's a focus area for you. Is this going to be sort of a team approach, marketing, distributors? Just expand a little bit more on your focus in the U.S.?

Fei Chen: We have the first distribution partner for the oil and gas area, Razorback Direct. And what we're working with them is really very close to together. We do the testing together, and we do the marketing together, and we're doing the sales pipeline together and the sales work also together. And their people will do the ground service, and we will be the back office and also the technical support for them. So, there will be our arm and the legs in the U.S. ground. So, this is for the oil and gas. And definitely, we will continue to grow this relationship. And for the pool system, we expect also to find some partners in the U.S. market to help us do the marketing and the sales and also potentially in the future, also the service. So, it's really a strong partnership we are working in the U.S., trying to really make the sales penetration in this market. U.S. is a very big market. So definitely, we will not only have one partner, and we need more partners. But we would like to take one at a time and really make that happen, then we see what that brings next.

Robert Blum: All right. Fantastic. A couple of questions here. Just sort of talking about sort of your breakeven, which I know you talked on a little bit, but maybe just to expand a little bit on sort of the outlook here, your breakeven rate sort of goals in terms of achieving positive cash flow, et cetera.

Phillip Price: Yeah. So, as we mentioned before, we still maintain the guidance for when the business will be breakeven and that's with a quarterly revenue of approximately $7 million, potentially lower if we have the right revenue mix. Regarding to the cash flow, that's, of course, a key KPI for us, we are determined to preserve the cash in order to maintain our strategic and financial flexibility. We'd also acknowledge that we need to increase the throughput of our existing facilities in order to accelerate growth and reduce lead times and ultimately pave the way to a business in balance from both a net income and cash flow perspective. And also what Fei mentioned before is that our main focus is on running a lean business.

Robert Blum: All right. Fantastic. It looks like I've got one last question here. You've talked about some of the growth, I guess, within the DPF solutions, referenced Europe inland transportation and electricity emergency generators. Maybe just expand on what some of the drivers are for that? Is it sort of a sales approach? Or is this sort of a market-driven approach? Just expand a little bit more on the DPF growth there.

Fei Chen: I would say it's a very, very strong trend. We have fear now in the market. And the European inland transportation, it got more and more public and politic awareness. So people really start looking in these sectors and start talking about how much emission they actually give to people through this inland transportation. So, countries like Holland and Germany definitely are looking at that now, and that's what we feel. And we do get some very good customers, and the stronger ones, they actually go into this area and really have a very close collaboration with us in that. And we expect to see this growing in the coming years, definitely. And for the electricity emergency generators, purely is very much is for the data center around the world. And they need to have this DPF installed any of the data center they are building today, especially in combination with artificial intelligence because there's a lot of data center building especially for those ones. And they are definitely around the world. It's not only Europe and also in U.S. and so on. And we are actually been seeing as one of the preferred partners even also by some U.S. companies to produce -- to provide this DPF to them. So, what we feel is we have a quite good reputation in the DPF market. And the many -- very often, the DPF market is most measured. It's not really the massive marketing approach. So, they have this very good relationship and also good reputation in the market. In many cases, actually customer they come to us by themselves, but we're also going out to proactively going to some conference and try to find the target customers to really work with them. So, this is a two-way we are working on. And we are very excited to see this development, and we're really confident this DPF market is going to be continued growth market for us in the coming years or so.

Robert Blum: All right. Fantastic. Very helpful. It appears we have no further questions here either online or through the teleconference. So, Fei, I'll go ahead and turn it back over to you for closing remarks.

Fei Chen: Thank you, Robert. Thank you all very much for being with us today. We look forward to communicating with you all soon again. Thank you.

This growth was primarily driven by the company's first U.S.-based oil and gas produced water order and continued strength in diesel particulate filters (DPF) and ceramic membrane sales.

The company has projected a significant revenue increase for the second quarter, estimating between $5 million and $5.5 million, indicating a 20% to 30% sequential growth. LiqTech's strategic partnerships and expansion into new markets, including the commercial swimming pool market, are key factors in its optimistic outlook for future growth.

LiqTech International's Q1 financial performance reflects a company poised for growth through strategic partnerships and market expansion. With a clear focus on operational efficiency and cost management, the company is navigating its path toward increased profitability and market share in its specialized filtration technology sector.

LiqTech International (LIQT) appears to be navigating a challenging financial landscape, as reflected by the real-time data from InvestingPro. With a market capitalization of $15.16 million, the company's valuation metrics indicate some concerns. The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio stands at -1.91, highlighting that investors may be wary of the company's earnings potential. This is further underscored by an adjusted P/E ratio for the last twelve months as of Q4 2023 of -1.88. The PEG ratio, which measures the stock's price relative to its earnings growth, is notably negative at -0.03, suggesting that the market may not be factoring in strong future earnings growth.

In terms of financial health, LiqTech's revenue for the last twelve months as of Q4 2023 was $18.0 million, with a growth of 12.63%, indicating some positive momentum in sales. However, the company's gross profit margin during the same period was 15.42%, which could be a point of concern for investors looking for higher profitability.

InvestingPro Tips for LIQT reveal that analysts are not expecting the company to be profitable this year, and the valuation implies a poor free cash flow yield. On a more positive note, the company's liquid assets exceed its short-term obligations, providing some financial stability. Yet, the stock is trading near its 52-week low and has been flagged for poor price performance over the last decade.

Operator: Good day, and welcome to the LiqTech International Reports First Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Financial Results Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Robert Blum of Lytham Partners. Please go ahead.

Robert Blum: All right. Thank you very much, Jason, and good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us today for the LiqTech International first quarter 2024 financial results conference call for the period ending March 31, 2024. Joining us on today's call from the company are Fei Chen, Chief Executive Officer; and Phillip Price, the company's Interim Chief Financial Officer.

That said, I'd like to turn the call over to Fei Chen, CEO of LiqTech International. Fei, please proceed.

Fei Chen: Thank you, Robert, and good day to everyone on the call. I am excited to have this opportunity to speak with you and hear an update on the solid progress we have made as we maintain our focus on delivering against the strategic plan we instituted over the past year to successfully stabilize and grow our business initially through our established markets and then position ourselves for incremental growth through our target markets. As a quick reminder, our established markets are marks where we have extensive customer bases and typically have reduced sales cycle times. This includes commercial pool systems, diesel particulate fitters, marine scrubbers and other areas where we have recurring revenue opportunities, such as general aftermarket sales and the plastics. This established business markets provides a strong and stable base of revenue for LiqTech and allow us to gain manufacturing efficiencies by leveraging our existing production capacity. Our target markets include key markets where our high-performance ceramic -- silicon carbon ceramic membrane can provide customers with a strong return on their investments. This include specific industry filtration applications to remove solid, oil, pathogens and heavy metals from water as well as compounds from emissions and industrial off-gases. These areas tend to have longer sales cycles, but it's our belief that if we align ourselves with great partners and establish key reference customers, the sales cycles will decrease and the large market opportunity will open up for LiqTech. I am pleased to report that strategy is working. As I assume most of you saw, we are expecting a significant step-up sequentially in revenue for the second quarter, with revenue to be between $5 million and $5.5 million. This would represent an approximate 20% to 30% sequential revenue growth. But before we talk about a few of the forward-looking expectations and the drivers to the strong second quarter we expect, let's first look back at the progress made during the first quarter. Revenue during quarter one increased 6% compared to Q1 of 2023, driven by delivery of our first U.S.-based oil and gas produced water order as part of our new distribution agreement with Razorback Direct as well as strength in our DPF and the ceramic membrane business. The U.S.-based oil and gas order was a critical development for us in many ways. First, it expands our presence in North America by showcasing the benefit of our produced water treatment solutions to the oil and gas industry. And the second, the order comes rapidly on the heels of us signing our distribution agreement with Razorback Direct in March 2024, highlighting what we believe will be [straining] (ph) interest for our dissolutions in North America. The containerized pilot system that Razorback Direct orders arrived in Houston on April 30th and will be used as a customer site to test, demonstrate and document the efficiency of LiqTech's ultrafiltration technology in treating produced water to facilitate beneficial industry reuse and meet current and future regulatory requirements. Longer term, the intention is to use the results from this pilot operation as a basis to defend and implement full-scale commercial systems for the onshore oil and gas application in the U.S. Let me be clear that our expectation is that this will not be a multi-year trial process. It is our belief that the initial results received in the next few months will help to validate our solutions and provide the data necessary for other customers to move forward. As we stated during our year-end call, the North American oil and the gas market is going to be a key focus for LiqTech moving further forward, and we couldn't be more pleased to be partnered with the great team at Razorback Direct, who has a strong presence in key oil and gas geographies in U.S. Building on the success of North American oil and gas order, we received another significant oil and gas produced water commercial pilot order in the first quarter from National Energy Services Reunited (OTC:NESR), or NESR, in the Middle East. This unit will be used in Gulf Cooperation Council countries by one of the largest integrated energy and chemical companies in the world and is scheduled to deliver in June. This will be a key component of the strong second quarter that we are expecting. Similar to the U.S. order, we believe that this commercial test unit for produced water has the ability to open the doors for additional orders with this customer and many other operators in the region. The Middle East tends to move a bit slower than in the U.S., but this one of our systems installed two years ago, operating to expectations. We believe there is an opportunity to move rapidly forward with other customers in this geography as well. Overall, I am pleased with the progress made against our oil and gas target market initiatives and look forward to incremental progress in 2024. Let's transition to a few key developments since our last call in our established markets, starting with marine scrubbers. Last week, we announced entry into a partnership with the Dan Marine Group, or DMG, to expand our presence in the Chinese shipbuilding and repair market from marine scrubber water treatment solutions as well as new exhaust gas recirculation water treatment systems for dual-fuel marine vessels. The agreement also includes the servicing by DMG of existing LiqTech's marine installations, including fast delivery of spare parts and on-site repair work. Dan Marine Group has close customer relationships in the marine industry and the strong sales and service organization in China with locations close to customers for shipbuilding and repair. A key component to this partnership is our ability to leverage DMG's highly skilled sales and service capabilities to sell, install and service our marine water treatment systems. The other highlight here is the market for new exhaust gas recirculation water treatment systems for dual-fuel marine vessels. Maritime industry is undergoing a significant transition towards cleaner fuel and reduced environmental emissions. In the coming five years, more than half of the new vessels will be built with dual-fuel engines, which make them be able to operate with LNG or methanol. For this new type of vessels, there is a need for highly sufficient and reliable water treatment systems. LiqTech solution is the perfect fit to this application. We look forward to the opportunities that this new partnership can bring for us in Chinese marine scrubbers and the exhaust gas recirculation market. The second key partnerships we entered was with the Franman, a well-established maritime representative to the shipping industry to market our scrubber water treatment solutions within Greece. For those not aware, Greece is the largest ship-owning market in the world. Franman has close customer relationships with major shipping companies in Greece and have deep technical insight to ensure effective customer collaboration for design and installation of new water treatment systems. With the combination of our unique silicon carbon ceramic filtration technology and years of successful commercial demonstration in the marine industry, we look forward to our two companies come together effectively to expand our marine scrubber footprint and reduce environmental impact from shipping. As we look to the second quarter, beyond key oil and the gas order to the Middle East set for delivery in June, another key driver to our growth expectation is the commercial swimming pool market. During the second quarter, we expect to deliver eight systems in total with contributions coming from each of our key geographies and distribution partners. As a reminder, and for context, we delivered trendy swimming pool systems in all of 2023. The agreements we signed last year with Waterco, Barr + Wray, Total Pool (NASDAQ:POOL) and Oxidine are all contributors with each delivering at least one system in Q2. I am pleased with the progress we have achieved on this key established market and look forward to continued market adoption in the years to come. Transition to our DPF business and the membrane business, another of our established markets. During the first quarter, DPF sales increased 31% compared to the year-ago first quarter, with sales of nearly $1.6 million. We are seeing increased interest for our DPF solutions within the European inland transportation market as renewed focus on black carbon emission reduction occurs. We are also seeing strong sales for our filters for emergency electricity generator. Similar to pool systems, we are pleased with the growth coming from our DPF solutions, which in many ways was an afterthought for LiqTech previously, but has become a solid contributor for us today. On the ceramic membrane side, we are making inroads to a couple of key potential markets with pilot testing going on at customer sites. These markets include petrochemicals, water treatment, paper and pulp and battery material concentration. We are also looking to scale up through OEM partners in China, Europe and the U.S. We believe this can be a driver for this component of our operations going ahead and hope to have more to share with you in the coming quarters on this pilot test. To wrap things up, before I turn over to Phillip to review the financials in more detail, as our outlook suggests, we expect to see good growth in the second quarter. We have eight pool systems scheduled for delivery with contributions coming from each of distribution partners we have across the world. These orders coupled with our Middle East oil and gas system set for delivery in June and an uptick in nearly each of our key established markets recurring product offerings such as DPF filters and membrane provides us with optimism for both the second quarter and the rest of the year. I look forward to our continued successful execution against the strategic plan we set for us. With that said, let me turn the call over to Phillip to review the financial results in more detail. Phillip?

Phillip Price: Thank you, Fei, and good morning, everyone. Now, let's dive into the financial highlights for the quarter. Revenue came in at $4.2 million compared to $4.0 million in the same quarter last year, representing an increase of 6%. This performance falls within our previously disclosed guidance. Broken down by verticals, sales were as follows: systems sales and related services of $1.5 million compared to $1.4 million in the same period last year and $1.6 million in Q4; DPF and ceramic membrane sales of $1.8 million compared to $1.4 million in the same period last year and up sequentially compared to the $1.4 million in Q4; and finally, plastics revenues of $0.9 million compared to $1.2 million in Q1 last year and $0.8 million in Q4. In summary, our ceramics business experienced a significant increase, the system sales and related services recorded a slight uptick, and the plastics underwent a notable decline. To be specific, the key revenue drivers for this quarter was the delivery of our first U.S.-based oil and gas produced water order as part of our new distribution agreement with Razorback Direct, along with increased sales of DPF and ceramic membrane sales attributed to focused sales efforts beginning from May 2023 that generated elevated activity in the current year. The decline in plastics revenue relates solely to a large one-off sale that was recorded in 2023 without recurrence in the current year. In terms of our forward guidance, as Fei mentioned, we expect the revenue for the second quarter of 2024 to be between $5 million and $5.5 million, which would be a significant increase of approximately 20% to 30% compared to the just ended quarter. We remain committed to growing our business over the coming quarter as we work intensively to execute on our ambition to further penetrate the global oil and gas, chemicals and pool system markets with our proven and industry-leading solutions. Looking at our gross profit for the quarter, we reported $0.3 million, or an implied gross profit margin of approximately 6.4% compared to $0.4 million and 9.8% in the prior-year's first quarter. The unfavorable change is, first of all, a result of the revenue mix for the quarter. In particular, the delivery of the containerized oil and gas pilot system impacted margins, resulting in a decrease compared to typical levels. This decision was strategic, undertaken to showcase and validate the effectiveness of our technology. As we still have overhead and other fixed costs that are not fully being absorbed, one of our key metrics we look at to highlight the progress being made is our contribution margin. During the quarter, when you back out fixed costs, our contribution margin ended at approximately 39% compared to 43% in the same quarter reported last year, with the unfavorable change mainly explained by revenue mix and especially the delivery of the containerized oil and gas pilot system as mentioned before. From an operational perspective, we continue to have excess capacity with the recently installed new kilns and revitalization of our ceramics facility. Hence, the immediate focus is to leverage the positive momentum and compress delivery lead times while still ensuring the delivery of high-quality membranes and filters. As previously stated, we still maintain our guidance that our business will be breakeven measured on an adjusted EBITDA basis, assuming a quarterly revenue of approximately $7 million and potentially lower with the right revenue mix. Turning to OpEx, total operating expenses for the quarter was $2.3 million compared to $2.6 million in Q1 of 2023. This is a decrease of $0.3 million, or approximately 10%. The decrease mainly reflects the release of 2023 bonus provisions, offset by increased insurance costs and expenses associated with the CFO transition. As stated, over the last few quarters, we remain focused on running a lean business by monitoring costs and carefully evaluating our spend to ensure that we do not jeopardize our financial objectives. Moving to the next item. Net other expenses during the quarter were $0.4 million compared to $0.2 million in Q1 of last year with the development mainly explained by the non-cash loss associated with the sale of fixed assets, partly offset by a gain on currency transactions due to the euro depreciation against the U.S. dollar during the period. Concluding on the P&L, net loss for the quarter was $2.4 million, which was consistent with the net loss reported in the first quarter of last year. However, this quarter's result was driven by revenue growth and a decrease in operating expenses, offset by lower margins as well as an increase in other expenses. And finally, let me briefly comment on our cash flow and balance sheet before summarizing and handing back over to Fei. We ended the quarter with $7.7 million in cash, down $2.7 million compared to the fourth quarter. This is explained by the cash used in operating activities, a reduction in accrued expenses related to the release of bonus provisions, an increase in prepaid expenses due to annual insurance premiums and IT licenses paid. And finally, an increased inventories, which is linked to the strategic sourcing for ongoing projects to cut delivery lead times. And also, historically, the first quarter has always been the most financially demanding period in terms of cash flow due to the annual expenses mentioned before. And finally, during this quarter, we managed to sell surplus equipment with the proceeds used to repay the related leasing liabilities in full. To summarize, balancing our cash flow remain a key KPI for our business as we're determined to preserve cash to maintain our strategic and financial flexibility. We also acknowledge that we need to increase the throughput of our existing facilities to accelerate growth, reduce lead times and ultimately pave the way to a business and balance both from a net income and cash flow perspective. Thank you again for your continued support, and back over to you, Fei.

Fei Chen: Thank you, Phillip. In closing, we remain committed to executing against our strategic roadmap, focused on long-term value creation. Over the past years, we have launched a clearly defined commercial strategy that has already yielded positive results. Going forward, our business will be underpinned by strong continuing revenues within our established businesses and increased foothold in our strategic target markets. The growth we expect in quarter two and the results of the year, coupled with improved operational execution across organization, will be key to drive [safe change] (ph) in gross margins and positive cash flows. I look forward to continuing to execute against our strategic initiatives in 2024 to drive value creation for our shareholders. One final comment before I turn it over to your questions. I will be participating together with Phillip in the Lytham Partners Spring 2024 Investor Conference on May 30. If you would like to schedule a one-on-one meeting, please contact Robert Blum, and he will be happy to coordinate for you. With that, operator, we would be happy to take any questions.

Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Rob Brown from Lake Street Capital Markets. Please go ahead.

Rob Brown: I guess, first question is on the U.S. oil and gas market. Great to see some progress there in getting delivery. Could you give us a sense of how the pilot program plays out? I think you talked about a relatively short assessment period. And then, maybe a sense of how the market development and pipeline development happens after that?

Fei Chen: As I mentioned in the talk, the pilot has arrived in the U.S. on the 30th of April. And actually, now it's already at the customer side. We are very happy to start running already this week and the coming week. So, we expect in the coming months or so, we're going to have the first testing results. So that will really give the clear indication about the performance of our pilot plan for the U.S. produced water. And we are already discussing with different companies and especially also with the Razorback Direct about a pipeline. So, there's a lot of things going on, and it's like really people are exciting to see the results of this pilot testing. So, we are very exciting to see the progress in the next couple of years -- months.

Rob Brown: Okay. Great. And I assume, given the Middle East system running for a couple of years that the progress will be favorable. Just want to get a sense, what's sort of the system benefits that the customer gets with your system? And maybe just what's the sales pitch that Razorback goes out with to its customer base?

Fei Chen: Thanks a lot, Rob. This is a very, very good question. The really good benefits of our system definitely is, our membrane is really suitable for this type of the water treatment. It's a highly oil content, and there's also metal content and also very high solid content. And we have demonstrated both in the Middle East and also actually through our marine scrubber market, and our membrane is really good for this type of treatment. And it really can be cleaned up very efficiently to keep the efficiency of filtration. And this is exactly the difference between our membrane and the polymer membrane. So, we really have the long lifetime and the very high efficiency is through a long period of time. And the second thing is we have a containerized solution. So, it's really -- it's very easy to use. It's mobilized, you can put down the track, can transport from one side to the other side. And also, it's a [modelized build] (ph). So basically, we only need demand at customer side, some basic utilities in place, then we can just put the container there and the plugging and really able to start treat. So, you don't need all those construction -- civil construction work. And also the footprint is very small. We have a very compact design of our system. And this really convenient to use and operating cost is much lower than the other existing technology in the market. So, those are the things we also -- really we're able to demonstrate through our pilot testing, both the quality of our filtration and also the OpEx data and also hold operation benefits. Those things, we're able to make our pitch much more sharp when we finish our pilot testing in a couple of months.

Rob Brown: Okay. Great. Thank you. And then, maybe on the Q2 ramp in revenue, I think you mentioned pool systems really stepping up. Could the pool market, does that become more of a diversified stream of activity there going forward? Or is there some kind of one-time stocking stuff going down, but just a sense of how the pool market is developing and how you see it playing out over the next 18 months or so?

Fei Chen: We are -- right now, we primarily active in Europe and Australia, and we are now moving into U.S. market. So, we would like to go to U.S., market to really find the partners for our pool system. And in Europe we have some huge markets like Holland and Germany. We're not really active today, and that's also something we're going to come in. So, next six months, we are entering the new territories for our pool system.

Rob Brown: Okay. Great. And then, in terms of the partnerships, you continue to add some nice partnerships. How much more is to go in getting the partnerships in place? Or do you feel like this -- that you've announced to kind of fill out where you were working on?

Fei Chen: I mean, we have just announced the two partnerships for marine area. And as you see, we will continue to find the partners and maybe different type of partner. But for marine, for example, we have the Dan Marine, it's really for the sales and distribution. And the Franman is different, because they have really network with the ship owner. So, what we're trying to do is we try to get the partners through a whole stakeholder group. So, in this way, our sales and max penetration will be much more efficient. So, this is our sauce, because we're already building quite some partnerships, and we want to be more clever really to use the partnership in a more multiple dimensions to really move our sales more efficient ahead in the selected verticals, which we are working.

Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Lucas Ward from Ascendiant Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Hi, Lucas, is your line on mute?

Lucas Ward: Yes, sorry about that. Lucas Ward here. Good afternoon, Fei and Phillip...

Fei Chen: Good afternoon, Lucas.

Lucas Ward: ...and congratulations on your business progress. Hi. So, I wanted to look at the overall revenue opportunity and just sort of understand like what are the keys to really scaling it up, because it looks like you have so many opportunities in different geographies and different verticals and you have the filter opportunities and the system opportunities, and it's almost like you're planting seeds in a lot of different places. And so, I guess I wanted to ask from your perspective, what are the keys to really scaling those, growing them?

Fei Chen: I mean, that was a very good observation. We are planting the seeds, because what we have found out is our strategic focus area that means swimming pool system, DPF and marine and oil and gas. If we just look at the membrane, if we look at all this together, we actually have addressed the market potential of US$4 billion. So, today, we have market share less than 1%. So, we are actually in the process really clear out the way and putting the seeds for the next wave of growth. So, what you can see is the DPF actually, we are doing very good now in Europe. And we would like to see in next year or coming years where is the new playground, but we would like still really grow in Europe first of all. And the pool system, we are growing very well now in the U.K. and in Australia and in Spain, and we would like to also go to the other markets. So, you'll see now is really we're putting on the foundation, but really can grow fast in the future. And we feel really -- can see the last years as we've done in the different segment, and it's the right way to go. So, we are continuing to putting the seeds on the ground, and then we will harvest them in the coming period. But it's really a very exciting period ahead for us.

Phillip Price: And Lucas, also, just to add some color, it's also just not to be reliable on only one business area. So, to spread our risk.

Lucas Ward: Got it. Okay. Can you comment more on competition? Like how much of a factor -- because the way you presented it, it sounds like it's just -- it's mostly a sales and marketing challenge. It's a matter of like finding the right partners and the resources and just going after it. But could you also comment on who you see in various verticals and geographies? Are they the same players over and over again? And how much does competition impact your ability to get those design wins?

Fei Chen: The interesting about our market is that we don't have a uniform competitor across all the segments. So, we actually have different competition in different segment, and they all different from each to other. And if we take a DPF as example, before we actually had a competitor in Denmark, but that company has been bought by a Chinese company. So, the whole production has been moved to China. So that actually give us a competitive advantage because we are the European company and many of the European customers like to buy from European company. So that's very interesting. And we do have some competition in Germany and in Japan and the French. But we are the ones in the niche is we are very flexible and able to deliver fast and with a high-end product. And that was our special in this DPF area. And many of our customers are recurring customers. So, this is a very solid customer base, and they are still growing. It's given us a very good basis for the revenue income. And if we take the swimming pool area, our competition technology is a sand filter. And our filtration technology solution for the pool system is much more environmental friendly and energy saving and the water saving and the chemical reduction. So, we have some really unique value propositions for this market. So, it's really, for me, it's really only the marketing and the sales speed from our side, it's going to push ahead. And the oil and gas areas, we are still new. We're trying to get in. But we definitely see there's a need for our solutions in that sector. We don't see any heads-on competition yet, and we are keeping very much alert to see what is coming when we have opened the door and really able to demonstrate our technology. And marine area, we did have very strong competition. As I mentioned in the last couple of calls, and we had very good [indiscernible] market. We go into a very dominant position and there's many Chinese cheap solutions coming with a very bad performance, and they cannot flush the market. So, right now, we are trying to go back in the market with much more clear view and go to the high end and like this exhausted gas recirculation. That's a market, those cheap technology cannot really stand, and we're trying to go back there and really occupy market, because that was perfect for our solution. So, we come back with some more smart solution and a different angle. So, this you can hear different segments, there are different competition. We don't have one word competition across the all segment.

Lucas Ward: Okay. Thank you, Fei. One more question on operating expenses. It was surprisingly low. It hasn't been this low for a long time, and it was attributed to this release of bonus provisions. I just wanted to understand like what that means and what I should expect going forward in terms of modeling operating expenses?

Phillip Price: Yes, of course. So, the release of bonus provisions relates to the 2023 KPIs. So, we didn't meet the target, and therefore, we released the bonus provisions, hence, the positive effect on the OpEx. But the level that you should expect is around $2.6 million per quarter.

Lucas Ward: Okay. All right. That's all I had.

Fei Chen: Okay. We are very much cost conscious. So, we're really trying to increase our output from production and output from the salespeople. So, we're really trying to become more and more efficient. And in this way, we actually can keep the operating cost down and increase the sales and our revenue at the same time. So, this is one of very clear KPI for us, and we're also trying to improve our process across the whole value chain.

Lucas Ward: Okay. Yeah, it didn't -- it seemed like there was more going on there, like more of a sort of a structural shift towards cost savings. So, thanks for confirming that.

Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from George Melas from MKH Management. Please go ahead.

George Melas: Good morning, good afternoon, Fei and Phillip. Good job on the quarter and the progress.

Fei Chen: Thank you.

George Melas: I had a question about the U.S. oil and gas order. I'm trying to understand how it happened so fast. Was it that basically Razorback sort of had a customer and that had a problem and they went looking for technology and found you and signed that distribution agreement and then they were able to propose a solution to their customer? Or did they sign a relationship with you first and then started looking for customers and one happened to happen so fast?

Fei Chen: I think that's a very interesting question. I have to say in this way, we are very happy. We find this very good partner to work with because they are in the oil and the gas market and very much alert what is customer needs. So, they have a very strong customer network and the customer group already. So, they know exactly what the customer is really looking for and really lack of the technology. And we have found out the chemistry of these two companies match very well, and there are some very clever technical people and the commercial people in Razorback Direct. So since we start discussion -- simultaneously, we already started discussing present our technology to them, and also they tell us what the customer needs. So it's not like we sign the contract, then we start work together. We already start work, at the same time we signed the contract, and that's also a process. We find out this is the partner we would like to work together with. So that's why there's more than only one month we find the customer. But I have to say it's a really, really good at them. They have a customer really had a really need for a new solution for their problem. So, this is a very good match.

George Melas: Okay. Great. Okay. And then, how many different other solutions can they propose to their customers in terms of treating the produced water? Because, clearly, they have some solutions right now, but you are a new technology that they offer. So, how -- what are the alternatives that they have provided in the past?

Fei Chen: I mean, this is a general knowledge in the market for all the people in the oil and gas market. The pretreatment for produced water is rather tough because the water is nasty. You have a lot of oil inside and a lot of metal content and also salt and solid, many solid particles. So, traditionally, there are many different kind of chemical treatment method for this part. And I think most of people, they don't like use chemical method today. So, when they see our solutions, some needs and also automation and really kind of user friendly also both for the operator and for the environment. So, they really got excited about this and they see potential right away because they are kind of tired of the chemical process -- chemical treatment. So, this is -- you can be lucky sometimes. I think we are lucky because they are looking for something better than what they have today.

George Melas: Okay. Great. And then, one final question on the pool systems. Given the existing distributors that you have, so assuming you're not adding any distributors, but I think you will, but with the existing distributors, do you expect to have to beat the 2023 deliveries? You had 20 deliveries in '23. With the existing distributors, can you match that or beat that?

Fei Chen: We are definitely trying to work with our existing distributors, make them much more efficient. So, I expect their sales grow because, I mean, if they grow their sales and we can grow our revenue. And at the same time, we're also going to build new distributors in the next half year. So, it's a combination of both, but I definitely expect our distributors every year, their sales should grow.

George Melas: Okay. And then, what kind of visibility do you have into the pipeline there -- their pipeline?

Fei Chen: We have totally transparency. So, we really work closely together. So, they're really our partners.

Robert Blum: Fei and Phillip, I've got just a couple of questions here through the webcast portal that I want to make sure we get addressed. So, I'll try to move through a few of these quickly and summarize where there's some overlap. First one is, can you talk about sort of your general sales approach in the United States? It seems like that's a focus area for you. Is this going to be sort of a team approach, marketing, distributors? Just expand a little bit more on your focus in the U.S.?

Fei Chen: We have the first distribution partner for the oil and gas area, Razorback Direct. And what we're working with them is really very close to together. We do the testing together, and we do the marketing together, and we're doing the sales pipeline together and the sales work also together. And their people will do the ground service, and we will be the back office and also the technical support for them. So, there will be our arm and the legs in the U.S. ground. So, this is for the oil and gas. And definitely, we will continue to grow this relationship. And for the pool system, we expect also to find some partners in the U.S. market to help us do the marketing and the sales and also potentially in the future, also the service. So, it's really a strong partnership we are working in the U.S., trying to really make the sales penetration in this market. U.S. is a very big market. So definitely, we will not only have one partner, and we need more partners. But we would like to take one at a time and really make that happen, then we see what that brings next.

Robert Blum: All right. Fantastic. A couple of questions here. Just sort of talking about sort of your breakeven, which I know you talked on a little bit, but maybe just to expand a little bit on sort of the outlook here, your breakeven rate sort of goals in terms of achieving positive cash flow, et cetera.

Phillip Price: Yeah. So, as we mentioned before, we still maintain the guidance for when the business will be breakeven and that's with a quarterly revenue of approximately $7 million, potentially lower if we have the right revenue mix. Regarding to the cash flow, that's, of course, a key KPI for us, we are determined to preserve the cash in order to maintain our strategic and financial flexibility. We'd also acknowledge that we need to increase the throughput of our existing facilities in order to accelerate growth and reduce lead times and ultimately pave the way to a business in balance from both a net income and cash flow perspective. And also what Fei mentioned before is that our main focus is on running a lean business.

Robert Blum: All right. Fantastic. It looks like I've got one last question here. You've talked about some of the growth, I guess, within the DPF solutions, referenced Europe inland transportation and electricity emergency generators. Maybe just expand on what some of the drivers are for that? Is it sort of a sales approach? Or is this sort of a market-driven approach? Just expand a little bit more on the DPF growth there.

Fei Chen: I would say it's a very, very strong trend. We have fear now in the market. And the European inland transportation, it got more and more public and politic awareness. So people really start looking in these sectors and start talking about how much emission they actually give to people through this inland transportation. So, countries like Holland and Germany definitely are looking at that now, and that's what we feel. And we do get some very good customers, and the stronger ones, they actually go into this area and really have a very close collaboration with us in that. And we expect to see this growing in the coming years, definitely. And for the electricity emergency generators, purely is very much is for the data center around the world. And they need to have this DPF installed any of the data center they are building today, especially in combination with artificial intelligence because there's a lot of data center building especially for those ones. And they are definitely around the world. It's not only Europe and also in U.S. and so on. And we are actually been seeing as one of the preferred partners even also by some U.S. companies to produce -- to provide this DPF to them. So, what we feel is we have a quite good reputation in the DPF market. And the many -- very often, the DPF market is most measured. It's not really the massive marketing approach. So, they have this very good relationship and also good reputation in the market. In many cases, actually customer they come to us by themselves, but we're also going out to proactively going to some conference and try to find the target customers to really work with them. So, this is a two-way we are working on. And we are very excited to see this development, and we're really confident this DPF market is going to be continued growth market for us in the coming years or so.

Robert Blum: All right. Fantastic. Very helpful. It appears we have no further questions here either online or through the teleconference. So, Fei, I'll go ahead and turn it back over to you for closing remarks.

Fei Chen: Thank you, Robert. Thank you all very much for being with us today. We look forward to communicating with you all soon again. Thank you.

As the international community faces the pressing challenge of transitioning to a low-carbon future, technologies such as green hydrogen and power-to-x play a vital part in worldwide decarbonisation efforts. The production of green fuels such as hydrogen and ammonia through electrolysis, powered by renewable electricity, has the potential to reshape the future energy landscape.

With more than 20 hydrogen projects on the drawing board, and a national strategy aiming for 4-6 GW electrolysis capacity towards 2030, Denmark is set to play a key part in accelerating the production of green hydrogen and green fuels for the future. Denmark's emphasis on renewable energy, especially its abundant wind resources, sets the stage for the cost-effective and extensive adoption of green hydrogen.

This and much more was on the agenda, as State of Green together with good partners and a group of leading solution providers from across the Danish hydrogen value chain travelled to Rotterdam to showcase hydrogen solutions and foster new partnerships.

With an expected 15.000 international participants, spanning from public decision-makers to hydrogen experts, professionals and public solution providers, this year's World Hydrogen Summit provided a perfect platform for knowledge-sharing, and networking as well as showcasing new and innovative solutions to harness the potential of green hydrogen and Power-to-X on a global scale.

Together with the Confederation of Danish Industries and The Royal Danish Embassy in Holland, State of Green co-hosted the Pavilion of Denmark, showcasing Danish achievements, advancements, and the transformative potential of green hydrogen and power-to-x globally. As part of the pavilion, 12 participating Danish companies and organisations represented various solutions within green hydrogen and power-to-x, promoting and presenting Denmark's hydrogen stronghold to the world.

Guests at the Danish pavilion included Rob Jetten, Minister for Climate and Energy Policy and Deputy Prime Minister for the Netherlands, who stopped by the Danish Pavillion for a talk about the developments, future projects and challenges within the hydrogen industry in the Netherlands.",stateofgreen.com,news,State of Green,,0.4588235294117646,453418157,10,https://stateofgreen.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WHS_1-4-L-min.jpg,eng-9561767

Fei Chen

Thank you, Robert, and good day to everyone on the call.

I am excited to have this opportunity to speak with you and hear an update on the solid progress we have made as we maintain our focus on delivering against the strategic plan we instituted over the past year to successfully stabilize and grow our business initially through our established markets and then position ourselves for incremental growth through our target markets.

As a quick reminder, our established markets are marks where we have extensive customer bases and typically have reduced sales cycle times. This includes commercial pool systems, diesel particulate fitters, marine scrubbers and other areas where we have recurring revenue opportunities, such as general aftermarket sales and the plastics. This established business markets provides a strong and stable base of revenue for LiqTech and allow us to gain manufacturing efficiencies by leveraging our existing production capacity.

Our target markets include key markets where our high-performance ceramic -- silicon carbon ceramic membrane can provide customers with a strong return on their investments. This include specific industry filtration applications to remove solid, oil, pathogens and heavy metals from water as well as compounds from emissions and industrial off-gases. These areas tend to have longer sales cycles, but it's our belief that if we align ourselves with great partners and establish key reference customers, the sales cycles will decrease and the large market opportunity will open up for LiqTech.

I am pleased to report that strategy is working. As I assume most of you saw, we are expecting a significant step-up sequentially in revenue for the second quarter, with revenue to be between $5 million and $5.5 million. This would represent an approximate 20% to 30% sequential revenue growth.

But before we talk about a few of the forward-looking expectations and the drivers to the strong second quarter we expect, let's first look back at the progress made during the first quarter.

Revenue during quarter one increased 6% compared to Q1 of 2023, driven by delivery of our first U.S.-based oil and gas produced water order as part of our new distribution agreement with Razorback Direct as well as strength in our DPF and the ceramic membrane business.

The U.S.-based oil and gas order was a critical development for us in many ways. First, it expands our presence in North America by showcasing the benefit of our produced water treatment solutions to the oil and gas industry. And the second, the order comes rapidly on the heels of us signing our distribution agreement with Razorback Direct in March 2024, highlighting what we believe will be [straining] (ph) interest for our dissolutions in North America.

The containerized pilot system that Razorback Direct orders arrived in Houston on April 30th and will be used as a customer site to test, demonstrate and document the efficiency of LiqTech's ultrafiltration technology in treating produced water to facilitate beneficial industry reuse and meet current and future regulatory requirements. Longer term, the intention is to use the results from this pilot operation as a basis to defend and implement full-scale commercial systems for the onshore oil and gas application in the U.S.

Let me be clear that our expectation is that this will not be a multi-year trial process. It is our belief that the initial results received in the next few months will help to validate our solutions and provide the data necessary for other customers to move forward.

As we stated during our year-end call, the North American oil and the gas market is going to be a key focus for LiqTech moving further forward, and we couldn't be more pleased to be partnered with the great team at Razorback Direct, who has a strong presence in key oil and gas geographies in U.S.

Building on the success of North American oil and gas order, we received another significant oil and gas produced water commercial pilot order in the first quarter from National Energy Services Reunited, or NESR, in the Middle East. This unit will be used in Gulf Cooperation Council countries by one of the largest integrated energy and chemical companies in the world and is scheduled to deliver in June. This will be a key component of the strong second quarter that we are expecting. Similar to the U.S. order, we believe that this commercial test unit for produced water has the ability to open the doors for additional orders with this customer and many other operators in the region.

The Middle East tends to move a bit slower than in the U.S., but this one of our systems installed two years ago, operating to expectations. We believe there is an opportunity to move rapidly forward with other customers in this geography as well.

Overall, I am pleased with the progress made against our oil and gas target market initiatives and look forward to incremental progress in 2024.

Let's transition to a few key developments since our last call in our established markets, starting with marine scrubbers. Last week, we announced entry into a partnership with the Dan Marine Group, or DMG, to expand our presence in the Chinese shipbuilding and repair market from marine scrubber water treatment solutions as well as new exhaust gas recirculation water treatment systems for dual-fuel marine vessels. The agreement also includes the servicing by DMG of existing LiqTech's marine installations, including fast delivery of spare parts and on-site repair work. Dan Marine Group has close customer relationships in the marine industry and the strong sales and service organization in China with locations close to customers for shipbuilding and repair. A key component to this partnership is our ability to leverage DMG's highly skilled sales and service capabilities to sell, install and service our marine water treatment systems.

The other highlight here is the market for new exhaust gas recirculation water treatment systems for dual-fuel marine vessels. Maritime industry is undergoing a significant transition towards cleaner fuel and reduced environmental emissions. In the coming five years, more than half of the new vessels will be built with dual-fuel engines, which make them be able to operate with LNG or methanol. For this new type of vessels, there is a need for highly sufficient and reliable water treatment systems. LiqTech solution is the perfect fit to this application. We look forward to the opportunities that this new partnership can bring for us in Chinese marine scrubbers and the exhaust gas recirculation market.

The second key partnerships we entered was with the Franman, a well-established maritime representative to the shipping industry to market our scrubber water treatment solutions within Greece. For those not aware, Greece is the largest ship-owning market in the world. Franman has close customer relationships with major shipping companies in Greece and have deep technical insight to ensure effective customer collaboration for design and installation of new water treatment systems. With the combination of our unique silicon carbon ceramic filtration technology and years of successful commercial demonstration in the marine industry, we look forward to our two companies come together effectively to expand our marine scrubber footprint and reduce environmental impact from shipping.

As we look to the second quarter, beyond key oil and the gas order to the Middle East set for delivery in June, another key driver to our growth expectation is the commercial swimming pool market. During the second quarter, we expect to deliver eight systems in total with contributions coming from each of our key geographies and distribution partners. As a reminder, and for context, we delivered trendy swimming pool systems in all of 2023.

The agreements we signed last year with Waterco, Barr + Wray, Total Pool and Oxidine are all contributors with each delivering at least one system in Q2. I am pleased with the progress we have achieved on this key established market and look forward to continued market adoption in the years to come.

Transition to our DPF business and the membrane business, another of our established markets. During the first quarter, DPF sales increased 31% compared to the year-ago first quarter, with sales of nearly $1.6 million. We are seeing increased interest for our DPF solutions within the European inland transportation market as renewed focus on black carbon emission reduction occurs. We are also seeing strong sales for our filters for emergency electricity generator. Similar to pool systems, we are pleased with the growth coming from our DPF solutions, which in many ways was an afterthought for LiqTech previously, but has become a solid contributor for us today.

On the ceramic membrane side, we are making inroads to a couple of key potential markets with pilot testing going on at customer sites. These markets include petrochemicals, water treatment, paper and pulp and battery material concentration. We are also looking to scale up through OEM partners in China, Europe and the U.S. We believe this can be a driver for this component of our operations going ahead and hope to have more to share with you in the coming quarters on this pilot test.

To wrap things up, before I turn over to Phillip to review the financials in more detail, as our outlook suggests, we expect to see good growth in the second quarter. We have eight pool systems scheduled for delivery with contributions coming from each of distribution partners we have across the world. These orders coupled with our Middle East oil and gas system set for delivery in June and an uptick in nearly each of our key established markets recurring product offerings such as DPF filters and membrane provides us with optimism for both the second quarter and the rest of the year. I look forward to our continued successful execution against the strategic plan we set for us.

With that said, let me turn the call over to Phillip to review the financial results in more detail. Phillip?

Now, let's dive into the financial highlights for the quarter. Revenue came in at $4.2 million compared to $4.0 million in the same quarter last year, representing an increase of 6%. This performance falls within our previously disclosed guidance.

Broken down by verticals, sales were as follows: systems sales and related services of $1.5 million compared to $1.4 million in the same period last year and $1.6 million in Q4; DPF and ceramic membrane sales of $1.8 million compared to $1.4 million in the same period last year and up sequentially compared to the $1.4 million in Q4; and finally, plastics revenues of $0.9 million compared to $1.2 million in Q1 last year and $0.8 million in Q4.

In summary, our ceramics business experienced a significant increase, the system sales and related services recorded a slight uptick, and the plastics underwent a notable decline. To be specific, the key revenue drivers for this quarter was the delivery of our first U.S.-based oil and gas produced water order as part of our new distribution agreement with Razorback Direct, along with increased sales of DPF and ceramic membrane sales attributed to focused sales efforts beginning from May 2023 that generated elevated activity in the current year. The decline in plastics revenue relates solely to a large one-off sale that was recorded in 2023 without recurrence in the current year.

In terms of our forward guidance, as Fei mentioned, we expect the revenue for the second quarter of 2024 to be between $5 million and $5.5 million, which would be a significant increase of approximately 20% to 30% compared to the just ended quarter. We remain committed to growing our business over the coming quarter as we work intensively to execute on our ambition to further penetrate the global oil and gas, chemicals and pool system markets with our proven and industry-leading solutions.

Looking at our gross profit for the quarter, we reported $0.3 million, or an implied gross profit margin of approximately 6.4% compared to $0.4 million and 9.8% in the prior-year's first quarter. The unfavorable change is, first of all, a result of the revenue mix for the quarter. In particular, the delivery of the containerized oil and gas pilot system impacted margins, resulting in a decrease compared to typical levels. This decision was strategic, undertaken to showcase and validate the effectiveness of our technology.

As we still have overhead and other fixed costs that are not fully being absorbed, one of our key metrics we look at to highlight the progress being made is our contribution margin. During the quarter, when you back out fixed costs, our contribution margin ended at approximately 39% compared to 43% in the same quarter reported last year, with the unfavorable change mainly explained by revenue mix and especially the delivery of the containerized oil and gas pilot system as mentioned before.

From an operational perspective, we continue to have excess capacity with the recently installed new kilns and revitalization of our ceramics facility. Hence, the immediate focus is to leverage the positive momentum and compress delivery lead times while still ensuring the delivery of high-quality membranes and filters. As previously stated, we still maintain our guidance that our business will be breakeven measured on an adjusted EBITDA basis, assuming a quarterly revenue of approximately $7 million and potentially lower with the right revenue mix.

Turning to OpEx, total operating expenses for the quarter was $2.3 million compared to $2.6 million in Q1 of 2023. This is a decrease of $0.3 million, or approximately 10%. The decrease mainly reflects the release of 2023 bonus provisions, offset by increased insurance costs and expenses associated with the CFO transition. As stated, over the last few quarters, we remain focused on running a lean business by monitoring costs and carefully evaluating our spend to ensure that we do not jeopardize our financial objectives.

Moving to the next item. Net other expenses during the quarter were $0.4 million compared to $0.2 million in Q1 of last year with the development mainly explained by the non-cash loss associated with the sale of fixed assets, partly offset by a gain on currency transactions due to the euro depreciation against the U.S. dollar during the period.

Concluding on the P&L, net loss for the quarter was $2.4 million, which was consistent with the net loss reported in the first quarter of last year. However, this quarter's result was driven by revenue growth and a decrease in operating expenses, offset by lower margins as well as an increase in other expenses.

And finally, let me briefly comment on our cash flow and balance sheet before summarizing and handing back over to Fei. We ended the quarter with $7.7 million in cash, down $2.7 million compared to the fourth quarter. This is explained by the cash used in operating activities, a reduction in accrued expenses related to the release of bonus provisions, an increase in prepaid expenses due to annual insurance premiums and IT licenses paid. And finally, an increased inventories, which is linked to the strategic sourcing for ongoing projects to cut delivery lead times. And also, historically, the first quarter has always been the most financially demanding period in terms of cash flow due to the annual expenses mentioned before. And finally, during this quarter, we managed to sell surplus equipment with the proceeds used to repay the related leasing liabilities in full.

To summarize, balancing our cash flow remain a key KPI for our business as we're determined to preserve cash to maintain our strategic and financial flexibility. We also acknowledge that we need to increase the throughput of our existing facilities to accelerate growth, reduce lead times and ultimately pave the way to a business and balance both from a net income and cash flow perspective.

Thank you again for your continued support, and back over to you, Fei.

In closing, we remain committed to executing against our strategic roadmap, focused on long-term value creation. Over the past years, we have launched a clearly defined commercial strategy that has already yielded positive results. Going forward, our business will be underpinned by strong continuing revenues within our established businesses and increased foothold in our strategic target markets.

The growth we expect in quarter two and the results of the year, coupled with improved operational execution across organization, will be key to drive [safe change] (ph) in gross margins and positive cash flows. I look forward to continuing to execute against our strategic initiatives in 2024 to drive value creation for our shareholders.

One final comment before I turn it over to your questions. I will be participating together with Phillip in the Lytham Partners Spring 2024 Investor Conference on May 30. If you would like to schedule a one-on-one meeting, please contact Robert Blum, and he will be happy to coordinate for you.

With that, operator, we would be happy to take any questions.

Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Rob Brown from Lake Street Capital Markets. Please go ahead.

I guess, first question is on the U.S. oil and gas market. Great to see some progress there in getting delivery. Could you give us a sense of how the pilot program plays out? I think you talked about a relatively short assessment period. And then, maybe a sense of how the market development and pipeline development happens after that?

Fei Chen

As I mentioned in the talk, the pilot has arrived in the U.S. on the 30th of April. And actually, now it's already at the customer side. We are very happy to start running already this week and the coming week. So, we expect in the coming months or so, we're going to have the first testing results. So that will really give the clear indication about the performance of our pilot plan for the U.S. produced water. And we are already discussing with different companies and especially also with the Razorback Direct about a pipeline. So, there's a lot of things going on, and it's like really people are exciting to see the results of this pilot testing. So, we are very exciting to see the progress in the next couple of years -- months.

Rob Brown

Okay. Great. And I assume, given the Middle East system running for a couple of years that the progress will be favorable. Just want to get a sense, what's sort of the system benefits that the customer gets with your system? And maybe just what's the sales pitch that Razorback goes out with to its customer base?

Fei Chen

Thanks a lot, Rob. This is a very, very good question. The really good benefits of our system definitely is, our membrane is really suitable for this type of the water treatment. It's a highly oil content, and there's also metal content and also very high solid content. And we have demonstrated both in the Middle East and also actually through our marine scrubber market, and our membrane is really good for this type of treatment. And it really can be cleaned up very efficiently to keep the efficiency of filtration. And this is exactly the difference between our membrane and the polymer membrane. So, we really have the long lifetime and the very high efficiency is through a long period of time.

And the second thing is we have a containerized solution. So, it's really -- it's very easy to use. It's mobilized, you can put down the track, can transport from one side to the other side. And also, it's a [modelized build] (ph). So basically, we only need demand at customer side, some basic utilities in place, then we can just put the container there and the plugging and really able to start treat. So, you don't need all those construction -- civil construction work. And also the footprint is very small. We have a very compact design of our system. And this really convenient to use and operating cost is much lower than the other existing technology in the market.

So, those are the things we also -- really we're able to demonstrate through our pilot testing, both the quality of our filtration and also the OpEx data and also hold operation benefits. Those things, we're able to make our pitch much more sharp when we finish our pilot testing in a couple of months.

Rob Brown

Okay. Great. Thank you. And then, maybe on the Q2 ramp in revenue, I think you mentioned pool systems really stepping up. Could the pool market, does that become more of a diversified stream of activity there going forward? Or is there some kind of one-time stocking stuff going down, but just a sense of how the pool market is developing and how you see it playing out over the next 18 months or so?

Fei Chen

We are -- right now, we primarily active in Europe and Australia, and we are now moving into U.S. market. So, we would like to go to U.S., market to really find the partners for our pool system. And in Europe we have some huge markets like Holland and Germany. We're not really active today, and that's also something we're going to come in. So, next six months, we are entering the new territories for our pool system.

Rob Brown

Okay. Great. And then, in terms of the partnerships, you continue to add some nice partnerships. How much more is to go in getting the partnerships in place? Or do you feel like this -- that you've announced to kind of fill out where you were working on?

Fei Chen

I mean, we have just announced the two partnerships for marine area. And as you see, we will continue to find the partners and maybe different type of partner. But for marine, for example, we have the Dan Marine, it's really for the sales and distribution. And the Franman is different, because they have really network with the ship owner. So, what we're trying to do is we try to get the partners through a whole stakeholder group. So, in this way, our sales and max penetration will be much more efficient. So, this is our sauce, because we're already building quite some partnerships, and we want to be more clever really to use the partnership in a more multiple dimensions to really move our sales more efficient ahead in the selected verticals, which we are working.

[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Lucas Ward from Ascendiant Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Hi, Lucas, is your line on mute?

Lucas Ward

Yes, sorry about that. Lucas Ward here. Good afternoon, Fei and Phillip...

...and congratulations on your business progress. Hi. So, I wanted to look at the overall revenue opportunity and just sort of understand like what are the keys to really scaling it up, because it looks like you have so many opportunities in different geographies and different verticals and you have the filter opportunities and the system opportunities, and it's almost like you're planting seeds in a lot of different places. And so, I guess I wanted to ask from your perspective, what are the keys to really scaling those, growing them?

Fei Chen

I mean, that was a very good observation. We are planting the seeds, because what we have found out is our strategic focus area that means swimming pool system, DPF and marine and oil and gas. If we just look at the membrane, if we look at all this together, we actually have addressed the market potential of US$4 billion. So, today, we have market share less than 1%. So, we are actually in the process really clear out the way and putting the seeds for the next wave of growth.

So, what you can see is the DPF actually, we are doing very good now in Europe. And we would like to see in next year or coming years where is the new playground, but we would like still really grow in Europe first of all. And the pool system, we are growing very well now in the U.K. and in Australia and in Spain, and we would like to also go to the other markets.

So, you'll see now is really we're putting on the foundation, but really can grow fast in the future. And we feel really -- can see the last years as we've done in the different segment, and it's the right way to go. So, we are continuing to putting the seeds on the ground, and then we will harvest them in the coming period. But it's really a very exciting period ahead for us.

Phillip Price

And Lucas, also, just to add some color, it's also just not to be reliable on only one business area. So, to spread our risk.

Lucas Ward

Got it. Okay. Can you comment more on competition? Like how much of a factor -- because the way you presented it, it sounds like it's just -- it's mostly a sales and marketing challenge. It's a matter of like finding the right partners and the resources and just going after it. But could you also comment on who you see in various verticals and geographies? Are they the same players over and over again? And how much does competition impact your ability to get those design wins?

Fei Chen

The interesting about our market is that we don't have a uniform competitor across all the segments. So, we actually have different competition in different segment, and they all different from each to other. And if we take a DPF as example, before we actually had a competitor in Denmark, but that company has been bought by a Chinese company. So, the whole production has been moved to China. So that actually give us a competitive advantage because we are the European company and many of the European customers like to buy from European company. So that's very interesting. And we do have some competition in Germany and in Japan and the French. But we are the ones in the niche is we are very flexible and able to deliver fast and with a high-end product. And that was our special in this DPF area. And many of our customers are recurring customers. So, this is a very solid customer base, and they are still growing. It's given us a very good basis for the revenue income.

And if we take the swimming pool area, our competition technology is a sand filter. And our filtration technology solution for the pool system is much more environmental friendly and energy saving and the water saving and the chemical reduction. So, we have some really unique value propositions for this market. So, it's really, for me, it's really only the marketing and the sales speed from our side, it's going to push ahead.

And the oil and gas areas, we are still new. We're trying to get in. But we definitely see there's a need for our solutions in that sector. We don't see any heads-on competition yet, and we are keeping very much alert to see what is coming when we have opened the door and really able to demonstrate our technology.

And marine area, we did have very strong competition. As I mentioned in the last couple of calls, and we had very good [indiscernible] market. We go into a very dominant position and there's many Chinese cheap solutions coming with a very bad performance, and they cannot flush the market. So, right now, we are trying to go back in the market with much more clear view and go to the high end and like this exhausted gas recirculation. That's a market, those cheap technology cannot really stand, and we're trying to go back there and really occupy market, because that was perfect for our solution. So, we come back with some more smart solution and a different angle.

So, this you can hear different segments, there are different competition. We don't have one word competition across the all segment.

Lucas Ward

Okay. Thank you, Fei. One more question on operating expenses. It was surprisingly low. It hasn't been this low for a long time, and it was attributed to this release of bonus provisions. I just wanted to understand like what that means and what I should expect going forward in terms of modeling operating expenses?

Phillip Price

Yes, of course. So, the release of bonus provisions relates to the 2023 KPIs. So, we didn't meet the target, and therefore, we released the bonus provisions, hence, the positive effect on the OpEx. But the level that you should expect is around $2.6 million per quarter.

Okay. We are very much cost conscious. So, we're really trying to increase our output from production and output from the salespeople. So, we're really trying to become more and more efficient. And in this way, we actually can keep the operating cost down and increase the sales and our revenue at the same time. So, this is one of very clear KPI for us, and we're also trying to improve our process across the whole value chain.

Lucas Ward

Okay. Yeah, it didn't -- it seemed like there was more going on there, like more of a sort of a structural shift towards cost savings. So, thanks for confirming that.

[Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from George Melas from MKH Management. Please go ahead.

George Melas

Good morning, good afternoon, Fei and Phillip. Good job on the quarter and the progress.

I had a question about the U.S. oil and gas order. I'm trying to understand how it happened so fast. Was it that basically Razorback sort of had a customer and that had a problem and they went looking for technology and found you and signed that distribution agreement and then they were able to propose a solution to their customer? Or did they sign a relationship with you first and then started looking for customers and one happened to happen so fast?

Fei Chen

I think that's a very interesting question. I have to say in this way, we are very happy. We find this very good partner to work with because they are in the oil and the gas market and very much alert what is customer needs. So, they have a very strong customer network and the customer group already. So, they know exactly what the customer is really looking for and really lack of the technology. And we have found out the chemistry of these two companies match very well, and there are some very clever technical people and the commercial people in Razorback Direct.

So since we start discussion -- simultaneously, we already started discussing present our technology to them, and also they tell us what the customer needs. So it's not like we sign the contract, then we start work together. We already start work, at the same time we signed the contract, and that's also a process. We find out this is the partner we would like to work together with. So that's why there's more than only one month we find the customer. But I have to say it's a really, really good at them. They have a customer really had a really need for a new solution for their problem. So, this is a very good match.

George Melas

Okay. Great. Okay. And then, how many different other solutions can they propose to their customers in terms of treating the produced water? Because, clearly, they have some solutions right now, but you are a new technology that they offer. So, how -- what are the alternatives that they have provided in the past?

Fei Chen

I mean, this is a general knowledge in the market for all the people in the oil and gas market. The pretreatment for produced water is rather tough because the water is nasty. You have a lot of oil inside and a lot of metal content and also salt and solid, many solid particles. So, traditionally, there are many different kind of chemical treatment method for this part. And I think most of people, they don't like use chemical method today. So, when they see our solutions, some needs and also automation and really kind of user friendly also both for the operator and for the environment. So, they really got excited about this and they see potential right away because they are kind of tired of the chemical process -- chemical treatment. So, this is -- you can be lucky sometimes. I think we are lucky because they are looking for something better than what they have today.

George Melas

Okay. Great. And then, one final question on the pool systems. Given the existing distributors that you have, so assuming you're not adding any distributors, but I think you will, but with the existing distributors, do you expect to have to beat the 2023 deliveries? You had 20 deliveries in '23. With the existing distributors, can you match that or beat that?

In terms of what visibility do you have in the pool system?

Fei Chen

We are definitely trying to work with our existing distributors, make them much more efficient. So, I expect their sales grow because, I mean, if they grow their sales and we can grow our revenue. And at the same time, we're also going to build new distributors in the next half year. So, it's a combination of both, but I definitely expect our distributors every year, their sales should grow.

George Melas

Okay. And then, what kind of visibility do you have into the pipeline there -- their pipeline?

We have totally transparency. So, we really work closely together. So, they're really our partners.

Fei and Phillip, I've got just a couple of questions here through the webcast portal that I want to make sure we get addressed. So, I'll try to move through a few of these quickly and summarize where there's some overlap.

First one is, can you talk about sort of your general sales approach in the United States? It seems like that's a focus area for you. Is this going to be sort of a team approach, marketing, distributors? Just expand a little bit more on your focus in the U.S.?

Fei Chen

We have the first distribution partner for the oil and gas area, Razorback Direct. And what we're working with them is really very close to together. We do the testing together, and we do the marketing together, and we're doing the sales pipeline together and the sales work also together. And their people will do the ground service, and we will be the back office and also the technical support for them. So, there will be our arm and the legs in the U.S. ground. So, this is for the oil and gas. And definitely, we will continue to grow this relationship.

And for the pool system, we expect also to find some partners in the U.S. market to help us do the marketing and the sales and also potentially in the future, also the service. So, it's really a strong partnership we are working in the U.S., trying to really make the sales penetration in this market. U.S. is a very big market. So definitely, we will not only have one partner, and we need more partners. But we would like to take one at a time and really make that happen, then we see what that brings next.

Robert Blum

All right. Fantastic. A couple of questions here. Just sort of talking about sort of your breakeven, which I know you talked on a little bit, but maybe just to expand a little bit on sort of the outlook here, your breakeven rate sort of goals in terms of achieving positive cash flow, et cetera.

Phillip Price

Yeah. So, as we mentioned before, we still maintain the guidance for when the business will be breakeven and that's with a quarterly revenue of approximately $7 million, potentially lower if we have the right revenue mix.

Regarding to the cash flow, that's, of course, a key KPI for us, we are determined to preserve the cash in order to maintain our strategic and financial flexibility. We'd also acknowledge that we need to increase the throughput of our existing facilities in order to accelerate growth and reduce lead times and ultimately pave the way to a business in balance from both a net income and cash flow perspective. And also what Fei mentioned before is that our main focus is on running a lean business.

Robert Blum

All right. Fantastic. It looks like I've got one last question here. You've talked about some of the growth, I guess, within the DPF solutions, referenced Europe inland transportation and electricity emergency generators. Maybe just expand on what some of the drivers are for that? Is it sort of a sales approach? Or is this sort of a market-driven approach? Just expand a little bit more on the DPF growth there.

Fei Chen

I would say it's a very, very strong trend. We have fear now in the market. And the European inland transportation, it got more and more public and politic awareness. So people really start looking in these sectors and start talking about how much emission they actually give to people through this inland transportation. So, countries like Holland and Germany definitely are looking at that now, and that's what we feel. And we do get some very good customers, and the stronger ones, they actually go into this area and really have a very close collaboration with us in that. And we expect to see this growing in the coming years, definitely.

And for the electricity emergency generators, purely is very much is for the data center around the world. And they need to have this DPF installed any of the data center they are building today, especially in combination with artificial intelligence because there's a lot of data center building especially for those ones. And they are definitely around the world. It's not only Europe and also in U.S. and so on. And we are actually been seeing as one of the preferred partners even also by some U.S. companies to produce -- to provide this DPF to them.

So, what we feel is we have a quite good reputation in the DPF market. And the many -- very often, the DPF market is most measured. It's not really the massive marketing approach. So, they have this very good relationship and also good reputation in the market. In many cases, actually customer they come to us by themselves, but we're also going out to proactively going to some conference and try to find the target customers to really work with them. So, this is a two-way we are working on. And we are very excited to see this development, and we're really confident this DPF market is going to be continued growth market for us in the coming years or so.

Robert Blum

All right. Fantastic. Very helpful. It appears we have no further questions here either online or through the teleconference. So, Fei, I'll go ahead and turn it back over to you for closing remarks.

Fei Chen

Thank you, Robert. Thank you all very much for being with us today. We look forward to communicating with you all soon again. Thank you.

Definition:

The term ""Electric Vehicle Insurance"" refers to insurance coverage specifically designed for electric vehicles (EVs). It is a subset of the auto insurance market tailored to the unique characteristics and considerations associated with electric cars.

Electric Vehicle Insurance typically covers electric cars, hybrid vehicles, and plug-in hybrid vehicles, which use electricity as a primary or supplementary power source. Electric Vehicle Insurance often includes coverage for components unique to electric cars, such as the battery pack, charging equipment, and electric drivetrain components.

These can be expensive to repair or replace, making specialized coverage important.

Electric vehicle owners may experience ""range anxiety,"" the fear of running out of battery charge before reaching their destination.

Some insurance policies may offer coverage or services related to emergency charging assistance or towing.

Market Trends:

The electric vehicle market has been expanding globally. As more consumers switch to EVs, the demand for specialized Electric Vehicle Insurance has also increased. Insurance providers have been offering more tailored policies for electric vehicles, addressing specific needs like battery coverage and charging equipment protection. The use of telematics and data analytics for monitoring and assessing driver behavior in EVs is on the rise. Insurers can use this data to create usage-based or pay-as-you-go insurance models.

Market Drivers:

Government incentives, rebates, and mandates to encourage EV adoption can boost the demand for Electric Vehicle Insurance. Growing environmental consciousness is motivating consumers to opt for electric vehicles, indirectly driving the demand for insurance. Advancements in electric vehicle technology, including improved battery life and performance, make EVs more attractive, driving their adoption and the need for insurance.

Market Opportunities:

The electric vehicle insurance market presents significant growth opportunities as the adoption of EVs accelerates. This market expansion can result in increased revenues for insurers. There is an opportunity for insurance providers to innovate and create new types of coverage, such as on-demand insurance or coverage specifically tailored to autonomous electric vehicles. Collaborations between automakers, charging infrastructure companies, and insurance providers can create opportunities for bundled products and streamlined services.

Market Challenges:

Electric vehicles often have expensive components, like batteries, that can significantly increase repair or replacement costs. This can pose a challenge for insurers in setting premiums. Insurers may face challenges in accurately assessing risk for EVs due to a lack of historical claims data, which can result in uncertainty in pricing policies. The availability and reliability of charging infrastructure can impact EV usage, and subsequently, the risk associated with insuring these vehicles.

Market Restraints:

The higher upfront cost of electric vehicles compared to traditional gasoline-powered cars may deter some consumers, limiting the immediate market size for Electric Vehicle Insurance. Concerns about running out of battery charge, or ""range anxiety,"" can influence potential EV buyers and affect insurance demand. As the Electric Vehicle Insurance market grows, it becomes more competitive, potentially leading to price wars and lower profit margins for insurers.

These efforts aim to complement and support the essential work performed by the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) in providing urgent care. Since the beginning of hostilities, PRCS staff and volunteers have continued to courageously provide emergency medical services to communities in Gaza, amidst unacceptably high levels of loss. Seventeen PRCS colleagues have been killed while on duty, and crucial facilities have been damaged. This includes Al-Amal and Al Quds hospitals and several Emergency Medical Service (EMS) centers, as well as emergency vehicles, with 25 ambulances knocked out of service. PRCS colleagues have been detained, with concerning reports emerging of their treatment, and the whereabouts of many still unknown.

Despite these challenges, PRCS continues to do vital work to respond to the medical needs of communities in Gaza, including by running three advanced medical posts, six medical points, and three clinics, in addition to its emergency response. The PRCS are a valued partner in the Red Cross Red Crescent Movement, and the ICRC and participating National Societies welcome the opportunity to support their essential work as they recover from the terrible losses in this conflict.

The 60-bed field hospital is meant to complement and support PRCS work as the medical and humanitarian community attempts to meet vast health needs in Gaza. The field hospital will provide, emergency surgical care; obstetric/gynecological, maternal, and newborn care; pediatric care; and outpatient department. Mass casualty management and triage capacities are included.

The ICRC field hospital, implemented in coordination with the PRCS and supported by Red Cross Societies of Australia, Austria, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Hong Kong, Iceland, Japan, Norway, and Switzerland, will be able to provide medical care for roughly 200 people a day.

Attacks on medical facilities and personnel have inflicted a devastating blow on the healthcare system. According to the World Health Organization, only 33% of Gaza's 36 hospitals and 30% of primary health care centers are functional in some capacity, and those that are still operational are overwhelmed with patients, the severity of their health needs, a shortage of supplies and resources to treat them, as well as displaced people looking for safe shelter.

Medical staff are faced with people arriving with severe injuries, increasing communicable diseases which could lead to potential outbreaks, and complication related to chronic diseases untreated that should have been treated days earlier. Amputations are common, as well as acute respiratory infection, gastrointestinal illnesses and skin diseases which are spreading rapidly through displaced communities due to a lack of clean water, sanitation, and access to food. Chronic and serious illnesses, such as diabetes, heart disease, pneumonia, infectious and non-communicable diseases, to name a few, are not receiving the attention they deserve because the priority is to treat the critically wounded.

With health needs growing by the day in Gaza, the ICRC reiterates its call for the protection of medical facilities under international humanitarian law. No patient should be killed while lying in a hospital bed. No doctors, nurses, or any medical professionals should ever die while working to save lives. Hospitals are sanctuaries to treat and preserve human life - international humanitarian law states that all parties to the conflict must respect and protect the medical mission, including infrastructure.

The field hospital is a continuation of more than 15 years of ICRC healthcare support in Gaza. ICRC teams have been providing surgical services at the European Gaza Hospital, and supporting other hospitals through medical donations where they´ve supported thousands of patients since the escalation of the conflict.

The field hospital team will be comprised of around 30 humanitarian experts from the various contributing National Societies, resident staff, and the ICRC which will include surgeons, doctors, anesthesiologists, nurses, technicians, engineers, logisticians, and administrators.

At the moment, the National Societies are contributing the following:

The Australian Red Cross is deploying staff.The Austrian Red Cross is contributing a reverse osmosis water purification system.The Canadian Red Cross is contributing surgical equipment, medical consumables, disinfection equipment and supplies, and pharmaceuticals, as well as deploying staff.The Danish Red Cross is contributing accommodations for staff sleeping quarters and a reverse osmosis water purification system, as well as deploying staff.The Finnish Red Cross is contributing X-ray equipment, water tanks, and sinks, as well as deploying staff.The German Red Cross is contributing nursing equipment, laboratory equipment, staff accommodation materials, an electricity toolkit, water tanks, and sinks, as well as deploying staff.The Hong Kong Red Cross is deploying staff.The Icelandic Red Cross is deploying staff.The Japanese Red Cross is contributing nursing physiotherapy and an operating theater/anesthesia module.The Norwegian Red Cross, which is taking a coordinating role in the project, is contributing medical equipment, a water purification system, office equipment, tents, lighting, latrine kits, kitchen kits, and pharmaceutical drugs, as well as deploying staff.The Swiss Red Cross is deploying staff.The ICRC will maintain the medical supply throughout the functioning of the field hospital.

Video and photos of the field hospital will be available on 14 May at: www.icrcnewsroom.org

Management Commentary

""We achieved continued growth during the first quarter, driven by delivery of our first U.S.-based, oil & gas, produced water order as part of our new distribution agreement with Razorback Direct. We believe this is a critical milestone to expand our presence in North America by showcasing the benefits of our produced water treatment solution to the oil & gas industry,"" commented Fei Chen, President and CEO of LiqTech International. ""We also received a second critical oil & gas system order with our partners at NESR in the Middle East. This order is scheduled to be delivered in June of this year and will be a key contributor to the positive sequential growth that we expect in the second quarter.""

""The strategic plan that we instituted over the past year to stabilize and grow our business initially through our 'established markets' and then position ourselves for growth through our 'target markets,' continues to progress according to plan. Within our 'established markets,' we continue to see growth within our pool system solutions, ceramic membranes, and diesel particulate filters, and we recently signed two strategic partnerships within the marine scrubber market that should inspire growth this year. In particular, our agreement with Dan Marine Group adds another dimension to our offerings in China, including a repair market for marine scrubber water treatment solutions and a new market for exhaust gas recirculation water treatment systems for dual-fuel marine vessels. Within DPFs, we are experiencing increased demand for black carbon emission reduction for inland transportation in Europe and emergency electricity generators, two markets that were relatively non-existent for us a few years ago.""

""Within our 'target markets,' we are pleased with the initial orders from both North America and the Middle East for our oil & gas produced water solutions. Both partners in each geographic region are actively promoting the unique capabilities of LiqTech's ultrafiltration technology in treating produced water to facilitate beneficial industrial reuse and meet current and future regulatory requirements. We have had numerous conversations with key end market customers and expect to see further orders this year.""

""As our outlook suggests, we expect to see solid growth in the second quarter. We have eight pool systems scheduled for delivery, with contributions from each of the distribution partners we have around the world. These orders, coupled with our Middle East oil & gas system set for delivery in June, along with an uptick in nearly each of our 'established market' product offerings, provide us with optimism for both the second quarter and rest of the year. I look forward to reporting new commercial milestones that demonstrate continued successful execution of our strategic plan,"" Chen concluded.

Q2 2024 Financial Results

Revenue for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 was $4.2 million compared to $4.0 million in the first quarter of 2023, representing an increase of 6%. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in sales of DPFs and ceramic membranes along with an increase in deliveries of liquid filtration systems and aftermarket sales, partly offset by a decline in plastics products. The uptick in DPFs and ceramic membranes sales was due to focused sales efforts beginning in late 2023 that generated elevated activity in the current year. The increase in liquid filtration system sales was mainly attributed to the delivery of the oil & gas pilot system to North America, albeit offset by reduced deliveries of marine orders. The decline in plastic products relates solely to a large one-off sale that was recorded in 2023, without recurrence in the current year.

Gross profit for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was $0.3 million, reflecting a gross profit margin of 6.4%, compared to $0.4 million, or a gross profit margin of 9.8%, in the first quarter of 2023. This decline in gross profit can be attributed to an unfavorable change in the revenue mix. Specifically, the deployment of the containerized oil & gas pilot system contributed to lower-than-usual margins, reflecting a strategic decision aimed at demonstrating and documenting the efficiency of our technology. The decline in gross profit was partly offset by continued initiatives aimed at optimizing manufacturing processes, which have improved profitability within DPF and ceramic membrane production.

Total operating expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2024 were $2.3 million, representing a decrease of $0.3, or 10%, compared to $2.6 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease mainly reflects the release of 2023 bonus provisions, offset by increased insurance costs, and expenses associated with the CFO transition.

Other Income (Expenses) for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was $(0.4) million compared to $(0.2) million for the comparable period in 2023. The decrease was attributable to the non-cash loss associated with the sale of fixed assets and increased interest expenses incurred due to the acquisition of leased equipment. Additionally, we have increased amortization cost due to the extension of the maturity date for the senior promissory notes, with additional warrants issued as consideration for the extension. The increase in Other Income (Expenses) was offset by a gain on currency transactions due to the EUR/DKK depreciation against the USD during the period.

Net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was $(2.4) million, which was flat in comparison to the comparable period in 2023.

Cash on hand (including restricted cash) on March 31, 2024 was $7.7 million compared to $10.4 million on December 31, 2023.

Q2 2024 Outlook

The Company expects revenue in the second quarter of 2024 to be between $5.0 million and $5.5 million.

Please note: Political content has been redacted from this transcript.

[Please note political content redacted here.]

I feel a profound sense of urgency. Because more will change in the next five years than in the last thirty.

I'm convinced that the next few years will be some of the most dangerous yet the most transformational our country has ever known.

So the question we face today is this: Who has the clear plan and bold ideas to deliver a secure future for you and your family?

The dangers that threaten our country are real. They are increasing in number. An axis of authoritarian states like Russia, Iran, North Korea, and China is working together to undermine us and our values.

War has returned to Europe, with our NATO allies warning that if Putin succeeds in Ukraine, they might be next.

War rages, too, in the Middle East as Israel defends itself not only against the terrorists of Hamas but a barrage of missiles fired - for the first time - directly from Iran.

Right now in Africa, conflicts are being fought in 18 different countries. And Putin's recklessness has taken us closer to a dangerous nuclear escalation than at any point since the Cuban missile crisis.

These are not faraway problems. Iranian proxies are firing on British ships in the Red Sea, disrupting goods destined for our high streets.

Here at home, China has conducted cyber targeting of our democratically elected MPs. Russia has poisoned people with chemical weapons.

And when Putin cut off the gas supplies it had a devastating impact on people's lives and threatened our energy security.

And in this world of greater conflict and danger, 100 million people are now displaced globally.

Countries like Russia are weaponising immigration for their own ends, and criminal gangs keep finding new routes across European borders.

Illegal migration is placing an intolerable strain on our security and our sense of fairness, and unless we act now and act boldly this problem is only going to grow.

Extremists are also exploiting these global conflicts to divide us.

People are abusing our liberal democratic values - the freedom of speech and right of protest - to intimidate, threaten and assault others, to sing antisemitic chants on our streets and our university campuses, and to weaponise the evils of anti-Semitism or anti-Muslim hatred in a divisive, ideological attempt to set Briton against Briton.

And from gender activists hijacking children's sex education to cancel culture, vocal and aggressive fringe groups are trying to impose their views on the rest of us.

They're trying to make it morally unacceptable to believe something different and undermine people's confidence and pride in our own history and identity.

[Please note political content redacted here.]

But for all the dangers ahead, few are felt more acutely than people's sense of financial insecurity. We've been pounded by a series of once-in-a-generation shocks.

The worst international financial crisis since the great depression in the 1930s. The first global pandemic since the Spanish flu in 1918.

The biggest energy shock since the 1970s. Global forces, yet they are hitting our living standards here at home.

We must be prepared strategically, economically, with robust plans and greater national resilience, to meet this time of instability with strength.

And people's sense of insecurity is only heightened by the fears about new technologies like AI.

When the IMF says 40% of jobs could be affected, or hundreds of leading experts say the risks could be on a par with pandemics or nuclear war, and when children are exposed to bullying, sexualised content or even self-harm online, people want to know they've got someone in charge who understands these dangers, because only if you understand what is happening can you be trusted to keep us safe.

But the paradox of our age is that for all the profound dangers we face, right now, we also hold in our hands an opportunity for human progress that could surpass the industrial revolution in speed and breadth.

Technologies like AI will do for the 21st century what the steam engine and electricity did for the 19th.

They'll accelerate human progress by complementing what we do, by speeding up the discovery of new ideas, and by assisting almost every aspect of human life.

Think of the investment they will bring, the jobs they'll create, and the increase in all our living standards they'll deliver.

Credible estimates suggest AI alone could double our productivity in the next decade.

And in doing so, help us create a world of less suffering, more freedom, choice, and opportunity.

Just imagine. Every child in school with their own personalised tutor, and every teacher free to spend more time personally developing each student.

New frontiers in medical diagnostics where a single picture of your eyes can not only detect blindness but predict other diseases like heart attacks or Parkinson's.

And counterintuitive as it may seem, throughout human history, the greatest breakthroughs of science and learning have so often come at the moments of greatest danger.

The first electronic digital computers were developed by British codebreakers in the Second World War. Solar technology went from powering pocket calculators to a viable commercial technology following the energy crisis of the 1970s.

The fastest development, and deployment, of a vaccine in history came during the Covid pandemic.

And so it is incumbent upon us to make this a period not just of great danger, but great progress, too.

That's why we launched a bold plan to make science and technology our new national purpose.

We're rightly proud of Britain's spirit of discovery and entrepreneurship made us the leading country in the industrial revolution.

But we can be just as proud, just as confident, just as optimistic about our future, and our prospects to lead again in this new industrial age.

And doing so will enrich our lives and create good, well-paid jobs in the growth industries of the future here at home.

At the same time, new and fast-growing economic superpowers like India, Indonesia, and Nigeria are significantly reshaping the global economy.

And just as this ever more interconnected world creates new dangers, it also creates new possibilities.

The United Kingdom is uniquely placed to benefit. We've always been an open, trading, maritime nation; and Brexit has given us the opportunity to trade even more.

And we invent, discover, and produce new products and services that the world wants to buy.

From aircraft wings in Filton, to financial services in Glasgow, to incredible cultural exports like film, music, and TV, or sports like the Premier League.

Everywhere from rural Kenya to the cityscapes of South Korea, people stay up all times of day and night to watch their favourite British team.

It's no wonder that Brexit Britain has leapt above France, Japan, and the Netherlands to become the world's fourth biggest exporter.

And the more we export, the better our businesses will do, the more jobs we will create, the more wealth we will generate - right across our country.

This is the opportunity before us. A world transformed by technological progress. Huge global markets hungry for new talent, goods, and services. You can see it all around us.

Two brothers from Merseyside sat around their kitchen table and built Castore a £1bn sportswear business taking on global giants like Nike and Adidas, their kit now worn by Red Bull Formula 1 and Bayer Leverkusen.

British companies and workers right across the country are pioneering offshore wind and exporting it around the world. Already, we've built the first floating offshore wind farm.

And our innovations have helped reduce the cost of wind energy by around two-thirds, and increased the size of turbines to the equivalent of the Eiffel Tower with blades bigger than Big Ben.

And you can see the opportunity too in healthcare, giving people longer, healthier lives. In Denmark, NovoNordisk created the Ozempic drug which is not only helping to tackle chronic disease globally, but singlehandedly grew Denmark's entire economy last year.

All this progress should show us that while this is one of the most dangerous periods we've ever known, it will also be one of the most transformational.

And if we make the right choices, if we have a bold enough vision, then we should feel confidence, pride, and optimism that Britain's future is secure.

My point is this: our country stands at a crossroads. Over the next few years, from our democracy to our society to our economy - to the hardest questions of war and peace - almost every aspect of our lives is going to change.

How we act in the face of these changes - not only to keep people safe and secure but to realise the opportunities too, will determine whether or not Britain will succeed in the years to come.

[Please note political content redacted here.]

In the last 14 years, we've made progress in the most difficult conditions any governments has faced since the Second World War.

A world leading economy, we've seen the 3rd highest growth rate in the G7, and created 4 million jobs, 800 a day.

We took difficult decisions to restore our country's financial security and control national debt, and that allowed us to support the country through Covid, deliver the fastest vaccine roll-out in the world, provide record funding to the NHS, and protect state pensions with the triple lock.

We've reformed welfare by capping benefits and introducing Universal Credit to help people into work.

We've reduced absolute poverty, pensioner poverty, child poverty. We've cut carbon emissions by a third.

Maintained our position as NATO's second biggest defence power. Halved violent and neighbourhood crime. And improved standards in our schools with English schoolchildren not just the best readers in the UK, but in the western world.

We've legislated for equal marriage. And it is now not even surprising for people from ethnically diverse backgrounds to lead Scotland, Wales, and the United Kingdom.

And the economy now decisively has momentum. Inflation down from over 11% to 3%. Wages rising faster than prices.

And in the first quarter of this year, we grew faster than France, Germany, Japan, Italy, and even America.

The plan is working - so we must stick to it, and not go back to square one.

[Please note political content redacted here.]

Because at heart, we're a nation of optimists. We're not blind to the challenges or threats that we face.

We just have an innate belief that whatever they are, we can overcome them, as we have done so many times in our history. And create a secure future for you and your family.

Let me tell you more about my vision for how I would lead this country through this time of danger and transformation.

[Please note political content redacted here.]

We've proudly taken the generational decision to increase defence spending to a new baseline of 2.5% of GDP, by 2030. Yet Labour have refused to match our pledge.

[Please note political content redacted here.]

The global displacement of a hundred million people is a new and defining challenge of our age. But we can and will protect ourselves against illegal migration.

[Please note political content redacted here.]

That's why we're pioneering the Rwanda scheme. And so, when people see that if they come here illegally, they will be swiftly detained and removed, they will be deterred from making that perilous journey, stopping the boats and saving thousands of lives.

I know that our international frameworks are outdated. So there may be flashpoints ahead with the ECHR.

And if the Strasbourg Court make me choose between the ECHR and this country's security, I will choose our country's security every single time.

And nor will I ever compromise on defending our values, our history, and our way of life, against those who seek to undermine them.

I am unapologetically proud of who we are.

And under my leadership, ours will be a country where people can disagree in good faith, but where they must do so with respect and decency for others.

A country where the benefits of belonging to our Union are self-evident to the overwhelming majority of our people.

A country where we protect and strengthen the greatest institution of all - the family, better protect children from the harms of the online and offline worlds, and do more to protect single sex spaces.

A country where we celebrate the small acts of kindness that bind our society together, and where we actively work to rebuild the civic involvement and pride that have always formed part of our distinctive national culture.

A country where we honour those prepared to pay the highest price for our freedoms, as we make this the best place in the world to be a veteran here at home.

And a country where we properly respect the older generation.

They've contributed all their lives, so whatever the triple lock costs, it is morally right to give older people dignity and comfort in retirement.

But as well as strengthening our national security and restoring pride in our national culture, we'll also protect you from the dangers of a more unstable world by giving you greater peace of mind over your financial security.

People have been struggling to make ends meet - I know that. In the last few years, you've seen rising energy bills, mortgage rates, the cost of the weekly shop.

And I hope I've shown through my time in office that, from furlough to support with your energy bills, the government I lead will always be there for you.

But that's only possible if we take the tough decisions to strengthen the country's finances and control debt.

You can trust me to do that.

When I stood for the leadership of my party, and my opponent's policies imperilled our financial strength, I was sooner prepared to lose than abandon what I believe so deeply is right for our country.

I feel the same conviction about Net Zero.

In a more unstable world, where dictators like Putin have held us to ransom over energy prices, I reject the ideological zeal of those who want us to adopt policies that go further, faster than any other country, no matter the cost or disruption to people's lives.

[Please note political content redacted here.]

But even as we strengthen our security and our sense of pride and confidence in ourselves, I also feel a sense of urgency about readying our country to succeed in a world transformed.

That starts by giving all our young people - wherever they live and whatever their background - the skills and knowledge to succeed.

Building on the success of the last 14 years, we will create a truly world-class education system.

The Advanced British Standard is the most far-reaching reform to education for 16-18 year olds in a generation.

We're tearing down the artificial barriers between technical and academic education.

Increasing children's time in the classroom.

Studying a greater breadth of subjects to match our competitors.

And unapologetically saying that every single child must leave school not just literate but numerate as well.

Now, I know this will not win universal acclaim but maths will be fundamental to our children's life chances in this new technological age.

And it is our duty to give them those skills. And more. We'll end rip-off degrees and massively expand the number of apprenticeships, because a degree is not the only path to success in the modern economy.

And we'll make sure that everyone has the funding they need to retrain or learn new skills, at any point in their lives, because in the future education won't stop when you walk out of the school gates.

But for Britain to finish first in today's world, we don't just need the skills to succeed, we need to create a dynamic, innovative economy fuelled by technological progress, so we lead in the industries of the future and help you and your family become wealthier and more economically secure.

The government I lead is creating the conditions for a new British dynamism. By investing in the new infrastructure of the future - not just roads, railways, and buses, but gigabit broadband, research and development, computing power.

By helping to create hundreds of thousands of good, secure, well-paid, highly-skilled jobs, that will level up opportunity right across our country.

And yes, by taking the necessary decisions to build the right homes in the right places to support those jobs.

But true British dynamism won't come from the State alone. It will come from you. It will come from the ingenuity and creativity of the British people, given the support, the opportunities and the rewards to have, pursue and realise big ambitions.

If you have a brilliant new idea - I want you to build it. If you're passionate about solving a problem - I want you to pursue it.

If you simply want to set up on your own - I want you to get out there and do it.

Because you won't find the future written in a slide deck in a Whitehall quango.

You'll find it out there in our country.

And so the government I lead will create the conditions for people themselves to try, to build, to invent - yes, sometimes to fail, but more often to succeed.

That's why we're cutting taxes directly on investment. It's why we're cutting taxes to encourage innovation.

And it's why we're seizing the freedom and flexibility of Brexit. Because so often, the EU's default approach was top down, precautionary regulation.

Whereas we in the UK now have the chance to be more agile, so that rather than stifling innovation and growth, we encourage it, in everything from financial services to agriculture, from healthcare to house building.

Above all, we will reward hard work.

Because you don't get anything in life without hard work.

So we're making the tax system simpler, fairer, and more rewarding, cutting National Insurance by £900 for the average worker, alongside increasing the state pension by £900 this year.

We're raising the National Living Wage to end low pay.

And we're reforming welfare to make sure that work always pays, and our safety net is fair to those who pay for it.

Not least because giving people support to get off welfare and into work gives them purpose, dignity and hope and it is also the only sustainable way to cut legal migration.

And that's how we'll transform public services, too.

Imagine a welfare system where new technologies allow us to crack down on the fraudsters, exploiting the hardworking taxpayers who fund it.

Imagine the huge opportunities to cut crime through technologies like live facial recognition, helping police catch wanted criminals, find missing people, and spend more time on the beat.

And imagine our NHS, still free at the point of use, but transformed for the future.

A service staffed by tens of thousands more doctors and nurses, thanks to our Long Term Workforce Plan.

Backed by record funding made possible by years of fiscal discipline. With far greater choice over where you can receive your care, made as simple as choosing what to watch on iPlayer.

And I believe there will be no more powerful example of what all the forces of British dynamism, innovation, scientific discovery and technological progress can achieve, than this:

To address, finally, the fear of one word that still lurks in the back of everyone's minds, that touches almost every family in our country, and that envelopes our whole world, if we or a loved one hears it: cancer.

Yet even here, if we are bold enough, there can be cause for new hope. We already know we can prevent most lung cancer cases - the UK's leading cause of cancer deaths - by stopping smoking.

That's why I took the important decision to create a smokefree generation.

And with huge breakthroughs in early diagnosis and new treatments, like the MRNA vaccine for skin cancer, I believe we can be just as bold and ambitious in improving rates of cancer survival.

Because if we can bring together my vision of a country transformed, with our world class education system that trains the PhD oncologists and apprentice lab technicians, and our dynamic economy that attracts investors and incubates the billion-pound biotech businesses of the future, our post-Brexit regulatory freedoms to approve trials in a safe but faster way.

And the scale of our NHS to help us research and trial those new drugs in a way no other country can, then just one example of the incredible achievements this country can make would be to make a generational breakthrough against this cruel disease and fundamentally change what it will mean for our children and grandchildren to hear the word cancer.

Today I've set out my vision for how Britain can succeed in one of the most dangerous yet transformational eras we've ever known.

The values that lie behind that vision are a new patriotism: a confidence in ourselves and in all that we can achieve.

[Please note political content redacted here.]

I reject those who insidiously question our history and our identity.

I believe in that innate confidence in ourselves that has always run through our island story.

And just as we're proud of all that we created, invented, and discovered in our past, so we can be confident and optimistic about what we will achieve in our future.

My pledge to you is that I will create the conditions to make that possible, to help you fulfil your ambitions.

To build the world-class education system that gives our children the skills they need to succeed, no matter where they started off in life.

To create the dynamic, innovative economy that will give you the opportunity of a wealthier, more financially secure life for you and your family.

To restore our sense of civic pride and national cohesion so we can be secure in the knowledge that we are all on the same side.

And above all, you can trust me to keep you and your family safe and secure from the threats we face at home and abroad.

Because with bold action and a clear plan, we can and we will create a secure future.",wired-gov.net,news,WiredGov,,0.1058823529411765,453385608,4,https://www.wired-gov.net/wg/news.nsf/channel-social/DNWA-87XE8F/$file/PMO_social.gif,eng-9563537

(NASDAQ: LIQT) (""LiqTech""), a clean technology company that manufactures and markets highly specialized filtration technologies, today announced its financial results for the first quarter of 2024.

""We achieved continued growth during the first quarter, driven by delivery of our first U.S.-based, oil & gas, produced water order as part of our new distribution agreement with Razorback Direct. We believe this is a critical milestone to expand our presence in North America by showcasing the benefits of our produced water treatment solution to the oil & gas industry,"" commented Fei Chen, President and CEO of LiqTech International. ""We also received a second critical oil & gas system order with our partners at NESR in the Middle East. This order is scheduled to be delivered in June of this year and will be a key contributor to the positive sequential growth that we expect in the second quarter.""

""The strategic plan that we instituted over the past year to stabilize and grow our business initially through our 'established markets' and then position ourselves for growth through our 'target markets,' continues to progress according to plan. Within our 'established markets,' we continue to see growth within our pool system solutions, ceramic membranes, and diesel particulate filters, and we recently signed two strategic partnerships within the marine scrubber market that should inspire growth this year. In particular, our agreement with Dan Marine Group adds another dimension to our offerings in China, including a repair market for marine scrubber water treatment solutions and a new market for exhaust gas recirculation water treatment systems for dual-fuel marine vessels. Within DPFs, we are experiencing increased demand for black carbon emission reduction for inland transportation in Europe and emergency electricity generators, two markets that were relatively non-existent for us a few years ago.""

""Within our 'target markets,' we are pleased with the initial orders from both North America and the Middle East for our oil & gas produced water solutions. Both partners in each geographic region are actively promoting the unique capabilities of LiqTech's ultrafiltration technology in treating produced water to facilitate beneficial industrial reuse and meet current and future regulatory requirements. We have had numerous conversations with key end market customers and expect to see further orders this year.""

""As our outlook suggests, we expect to see solid growth in the second quarter. We have eight pool systems scheduled for delivery, with contributions from each of the distribution partners we have around the world. These orders, coupled with our Middle East oil & gas system set for delivery in June, along with an uptick in nearly each of our 'established market' product offerings, provide us with optimism for both the second quarter and rest of the year. I look forward to reporting new commercial milestones that demonstrate continued successful execution of our strategic plan,"" Chen concluded.

Q2 2024 Financial Results

Revenue for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 was $4.2 million compared to $4.0 million in the first quarter of 2023, representing an increase of 6%. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in sales of DPFs and ceramic membranes along with an increase in deliveries of liquid filtration systems and aftermarket sales, partly offset by a decline in plastics products. The uptick in DPFs and ceramic membranes sales was due to focused sales efforts beginning in late 2023 that generated elevated activity in the current year. The increase in liquid filtration system sales was mainly attributed to the delivery of the oil & gas pilot system to North America, albeit offset by reduced deliveries of marine orders. The decline in plastic products relates solely to a large one-off sale that was recorded in 2023, without recurrence in the current year.

Gross profit for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was $0.3 million, reflecting a gross profit margin of 6.4%, compared to $0.4 million, or a gross profit margin of 9.8%, in the first quarter of 2023. This decline in gross profit can be attributed to an unfavorable change in the revenue mix. Specifically, the deployment of the containerized oil & gas pilot system contributed to lower-than-usual margins, reflecting a strategic decision aimed at demonstrating and documenting the efficiency of our technology. The decline in gross profit was partly offset by continued initiatives aimed at optimizing manufacturing processes, which have improved profitability within DPF and ceramic membrane production.

Total operating expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2024 were $2.3 million, representing a decrease of $0.3, or 10%, compared to $2.6 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease mainly reflects the release of 2023 bonus provisions, offset by increased insurance costs, and expenses associated with the CFO transition.

Other Income (Expenses) for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was $(0.4) million compared to $(0.2) million for the comparable period in 2023. The decrease was attributable to the non-cash loss associated with the sale of fixed assets and increased interest expenses incurred due to the acquisition of leased equipment. Additionally, we have increased amortization cost due to the extension of the maturity date for the senior promissory notes, with additional warrants issued as consideration for the extension. The increase in Other Income (Expenses) was offset by a gain on currency transactions due to the EUR/DKK depreciation against the USD during the period.

The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in sales of DPFs and ceramic membranes along with an increase in deliveries of liquid filtration systems and aftermarket sales, partly offset by a decline in plastics products. The uptick in DPFs and ceramic membranes sales was due to focused sales efforts beginning in late 2023 that generated elevated activity in the current year. The increase in liquid filtration system sales was mainly attributed to the delivery of the oil & gas pilot system to North America, albeit offset by reduced deliveries of marine orders. The decline in plastic products relates solely to a large one-off sale that was recorded in 2023, without recurrence in the current year.

Gross profit for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was $0.3 million, reflecting a gross profit margin of 6.4%, compared to $0.4 million, or a gross profit margin of 9.8%, in the first quarter of 2023. This decline in gross profit can be attributed to an unfavorable change in the revenue mix. Specifically, the deployment of the containerized oil & gas pilot system contributed to lower-than-usual margins, reflecting a strategic decision aimed at demonstrating and documenting the efficiency of our technology. The decline in gross profit was partly offset by continued initiatives aimed at optimizing manufacturing processes, which have improved profitability within DPF and ceramic membrane production.

Total operating expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2024 were $2.3 million, representing a decrease of $0.3, or 10%, compared to $2.6 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease mainly reflects the release of 2023 bonus provisions, offset by increased insurance costs, and expenses associated with the CFO transition.

Other Income (Expenses) for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was $(0.4) million compared to $(0.2) million for the comparable period in 2023. The decrease was attributable to the non-cash loss associated with the sale of fixed assets and increased interest expenses incurred due to the acquisition of leased equipment. Additionally, we have increased amortization cost due to the extension of the maturity date for the senior promissory notes, with additional warrants issued as consideration for the extension. The increase in Other Income (Expenses) was offset by a gain on currency transactions due to the EUR/DKK depreciation against the USD during the period.

Javier Milei, eight months ago.

During his relatively short but surprisingly meteoric political career, Argentina's faux libertarian President Javier Milei has not exactly been shy about his feelings toward the People's Republic of China. On the campaign trail, he told Tucker Carlson that he would never trade with China, which was then Argentina's second largest trading partner, due to its government's left-wing, authoritarian proclivities:

Not only am I not going to do business with China, I am not going to do business with any communist... I am a defender of freedom, peace and democracy. The Chinese don't fit in.""

In an interview with Bloomberg, he referred to the Asian nation as an ""assassin,"" saying:

People are not free in China, they can't do what they want and when they do it, they get killed. Would you trade with an assassin?

The Chinese government was typically tight lipped in its response. When Milei won the election, Beijing congratulated him.

""We congratulate Argentina on its presidential election and congratulate Mr. Milei on his election,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said at a regular press briefing in Beijing on Monday. ""China values its relations with Argentina and we are ready to work with Argentina to continue nurturing our friendship and contribute to each other's development.""

All of these statements of Milei's were made on the campaign train. When Milei the candidate became Milei the president, he quickly softened his position, as he has with many of his other more radical positions, such as his pledge to shutter Argentina's central bank and to dollarise Argentina's economy. In relation to China, he now said he wouldn't stand in the way of private business deals between Argentinian and Chinese companies. ""We are liberals,"" he said. ""And if people want to do business with China, they can.""

But his government would not be engaging directly in business with the Chinese government or, for that matter, Chinese state-owned enterprises. Or so his voters were led to believe. But that, it turns out, was also not true.

A Very Sensitive Business

The Milei government is doing some very important -- indeed, highly sensitive -- business with the People's Republic of China. That business is printing money.

With official annual inflation still raging at an eye-watering 289% in March -- though the monthly rate is gradually coming down as the country's economy is starved of internal demand by the government's crushing austerity measures -- new high-denomination notes are desperately needed. The highest denomination note currently in circulation is the 2,000 peso bill, which right now (11:26 pm, GMT+1, May 13) is worth just $2.26, according to Argentina's official exchange rate.

The Central of the Republic of Argentina is about to begin the process of putting into circulation a larger denomination bill: the 10,000 peso note (with a current value of $11.31). The new bill will be distributed progressively to bank branches and ATMs throughout the country over the coming months.

What isn't getting much attention -- for obvious reasons -- is the fact that the first batch of the new currency, consisting of 770 million bills, was manufactured not by Argentina's national mint but by the China Banknote Printing and Minting Corporation (CBPMC), a state-owned corporation that carries out the minting of all renminbi coins and printing of renminbi banknotes for the People's Republic of China, and which has a rapidly-growing list of government clients from around the world (more on that later).

This, understandably, has raised a few eyebrows among members of Milei's La Libertad Avanca (Freedom Advances) coalition party. As an article in Clarín notes, some are questioning the wisdom of entrusting the manufacturing of a resource as ""sensitive and strategic"" as the country's national currency to a company that is essentially owned by China's communist government, which Argentina's president has identified as ""assassins"" who are not to be trusted.

The new banknotes were not manufactured in-house by the Argentine Mint for an apparently simple reason: it has unpaid debts with many foreign suppliers of the technologies and resources needed to print new bills. That's according to government sources cited by the Argentine newspaper El Cronista. A recent article by Clarín suggests that the Milei government's slashing (or chainsawing) of public spending means there may not be enough money available in the future to pay for local manufacturing of the majority of new banknotes.

In other words, Argentina is likely to become even more dependent on international suppliers for its own physical money supply. And as with so many manufacturing industries today, few can compete on price with the Chinese.

In the Milei government's defence, the first agreement Argentina entered into with China for the printing of banknotes was signed a number of years ago by the Kirchner government when it authorised the Mint to acquire an ""emergency"" shipment of the national currency. The more recent deal for the consignment of 10,000 peso bills was signed by the previous Alberto Fernández government. And you can hardly blame Argentina's current government for taking delivery of currency bills ordered by previous administrations.

But while the order for 770 million Chinese-made 10,000 peso notes may have been made due to reasons extraneous to the Milei government, the same cannot be said of the upcoming 20,000 peso notes. In late April, Argentina's treasury department and central bank awarded the tender to print the first batch of 20,000 peso notes, bearing an image of the Argentine liberal hero Juan Bautista Alberdi, to the China Banknote Printing and Minting Corporation. As El Cronista notes, the decision ultimately boiled down to a question of basic economics:

The Chinese company won the tender, after presenting a cheaper offer than its competitors from Malta, Germany and France.

It is paradoxical, however, that a Government that has freedom as its mantra has chosen the Asian superpower, governed with an iron fist by the Chinese Communist Party, as the main supplier of the new banknotes. Although Milei pledged during the campaign that he ""would not do business with communists"", the forces of the market or, rather, of the Chinese State, prevailed.

A Gathering Trend

Argentina is not the only country to have outsourced its production of national currency to the China Banknote Printing and Minting Corporation, as a 2018 article by the New Zealand Herald documents:

[I]n 2013, Beijing launched the belt and road plan, a global development blueprint involving about 60 countries from Asia, Europe to Africa to stimulate economic growth with large-scale capital investment and infrastructure construction projects.

Two years later, China started printing 100-rupee notes for Nepal... Since then the company had ""seized the opportunities brought by the initiative"" and ""successfully won contracts for currency production projects in a number of countries including Thailand, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, India, Brazil and Poland,"" he said.

But that could be just the tip of the iceberg. The actual number of countries that have or plan to outsource currency printing to China could be much bigger, according to one source in the corporation.

Some governments have asked Beijing not to publicise the deal because they are worried such information could compromise national security or trigger ""unnecessary debates at home"", the person said.

Hu Xingdou, a professor of economics at the Beijing Institute of Technology, said a country must have considerable trust in the Chinese government to allow it to print its banknotes.

That is clearly not the case of the Milei government, which has aligned Argentina as firmly as possible with the collective West. It has rejected buying Chinese warplanes in favour of American-designed F-16s from Denmark. It has even applied to become a ""global partner"" of NATO, months after cancelling Argentina's membership of the BRICS-plus alliance. The potential fallout of that decision for Argentina's battered economy as well as the BRICS was nicely summed up by Josef Gregory Mahoney, a politics and international relations professor at East China Normal University in Shanghai.

""I wouldn't really describe Argentina's decision as a setback for BRICS or China -- it's a setback for Argentina,"" Mahoney told the South China Morning Post (SCMP) on January 7. ""Given the poor state of the Argentine economy and the damage that's being done to it by Milei's economic policies, his withdrawal is a blessing in disguise for the other BRICS members -- they've dodged a bullet.""

As I noted in December, the election of Milei could also have major repercussions for China's ""comprehensive strategic partner[ship]"" (as described by China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Wang Wenbin) with Argentina. That could be the final straw for Argentina's dilapidated economy.

For a start, Argentina's second largest trade partner, after Brazil. Trade between the two countries has already declined sharply since Milei's election, as Beijing looks to alternative markets for agricultural, including neighbouring Brazil.

It is also massively invested in many of Argentina's strategic sectors, including lithium and gas -- sectors that the US government and corporations also have their eyes on. The ties between the two countries have become even stronger in recent years, with Argentina joining Xi Jinping's signature Belt and Road initiative in 2022. China is heavily invested in the construction (stalled since 2022) of Argentina's nuclear plant, Atucha 3.

A Chinese firm called Gezhouba is leading the construction of the Néstor Kirchner-Jorge Cepernic hydroelectric plant. The project, involving the construction of two dams on the Santa Cruz river, represents the largest bilateral infrastructure project ever attempted between the two countries. The plant was meant to provide for the daily electricity consumption of 1.5 million Argentine households and cut almost $1.1 billion off Argentina's oil and gas import expenses each year. It should have been completed four years ago, but construction was stalled by the Macri government and then dogged by geological issues. Now, it has been frozen again, and the Chinese appear to have run out of patience.

It should have been completed four years ago, but construction was stalled by the Macri government and then dogged by geological issues. Now, it has been frozen again, and the Chinese appear to have run out of patience.

Tired of waiting for the Milei government to sign the necessary contracts to continue with the work, Gezhouba left the country in March, leaving 1,800 destroyed jobs behind and serious questions about what will happen with the left over debt. According to La Politica Online, Xi Jinping has a wild card up his sleeve: the contract for the project contains a clause for breach of contract that brings Argentina's currency swap with China into play as well as the Belgrano Cargas modernisation project, which also includes financing from the Asian giant.

When Economic Reality Trumps Ideology

Beijing is a major trade partner, investor and creditor of Argentina. The first currency swap was signed in 2009 with then-Argentine President Cristina Fernández de Kirchener. Special currency swap arrangements negotiated between the Alberto Fernández government and Beijing last summer enabled Buenos Aires to continue servicing its $44 billion IMF loan package despite suffering an acute foreign currency shortage -- the result of a severe drought in Argentina's agricultural heartlands. Now there is over $6 billion of Chinese debt outstanding, much of which is about to fall due -- unless, of course, the credit line can be rolled over.

Between June and July, 35 billion yuan ($4.84 billion) is scheduled to come due -- money that neither the government nor the central bank have at their disposal. All of a sudden, Argentina's immediate economic needs are beginning to taking precedence over Milei's fanatical anti-socialist ideology and unquestioning devotion to Washington. In late April, the government dispatched its gaffe-prone foreign minister, Diana Mondino, to Beijing to try to mend relations. She was accompanied on the mission by Argentina's finance minister and central bank governor. From Mercopress:

Argentine Foreign Minister Diana Mondino is on a crusade in China to discuss bilateral issues with an economic giant with whom President Javier Milei had pledged during his campaign that he wanted no ties...

Mondino is to meet with her Chinese colleague Wang Yi and with businessmen from both countries to review the complementarity ""evidenced in the high levels of commercial exchange.""

The Minister insisted on Argentina's ""great opportunities to increase its export offer to the Chinese market"" and told Argentine businessmen that they would ""find great opportunities"" in the Asian country.

The Chancellor met with Bagó Group Director and President of Argentina's Chamber of Commerce for Asia and the Pacific, Rallys Pliauzer; with Argentine businessmen and also with the president of Power Construction Corporation of China, Lindi Jiang, a construction and development group with more than 30 projects in the South American country.

Mondino's mission seeks to lower the political tension between the two countries while at the same time negotiating an extension to the currency swap worth some US$ 6 billion agreed upon under former President Alberto Fernández. The Minister's first trip to China since she took office coincides with the tenth anniversary of the comprehensive strategic partnership between the two countries. Argentina needs the swap extended to strengthen BCRA's reserves and also to pay some maturities with the International Monetary Fund, it was reported.

Mondino came back empty handed after Beijing refused to make any commitments regarding the credit line. She then proceeded to make matters worse by giving the following answer to a question about a recent inspection of a Chinese space station in Patagonia that the US claims is being used for military and intelligence purposes (emphasis my own):

""[N]o one detected that there were military personnel there. Those who were investigating did not identify that there were military personnel. They are Chinese, they are all the same.""

Not what you'd call diplomatic language. The remarks, which Mondino insists were taken out of context, have caused a bit of a stir in Argentina. But it's impossible to know how they are viewed by the Chinese leadership in Beijing. Diego Guelar, a former Argentine ambassador to China during the Macri government (2015-19), says that verbal missteps can have a significant impact on bilateral relations as well as the perception of Argentina in the international arena. But he also believes that China will continue to exercise ""strategic patience"" and as such will take a pragmatic stance regarding the currency swap.

China has so far been characteristically diplomatic in its statements. During his meeting with Mondino, China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Beijing is willing to work with Argentina to ""jointly steer the direction of the future development of relations between the two countries,"" adding that the two sides should advance cooperation in space, space flight, maritime and Antarctic fields, and promote sustained, healthy and balanced development of bilateral trade.

But for the moment there are no guarantees, especially when it comes to the currency swap. According to Bloomberg Linea, Bloomberg's Latin American outlet, ""the lack of any concrete announcements regarding efforts to postpone the debt maturities has left more doubts than certainties."" Some are even speculating that Milei may even have to visit Beijing, ""as a political gesture to unblock negotiations."" And that would surely represent a diplomatic coup for Beijing as well as a bruising return to reality for the rapidly pro-Western Milei and his supporters.",nakedcapitalism.com,news,naked capitalism,Nick Corbishley,0.1058823529411765,453379784,4,,eng-9564374

13 May 2024

I feel a profound sense of urgency. Because more will change in the next five years than in the last thirty.

I'm convinced that the next few years will be some of the most dangerous yet the most transformational our country has ever known.

So the question we face today is this: Who has the clear plan and bold ideas to deliver a secure future for you and your family?

The dangers that threaten our country are real. They are increasing in number. An axis of authoritarian states like Russia, Iran, North Korea, and China is working together to undermine us and our values.

War has returned to Europe, with our NATO allies warning that if Putin succeeds in Ukraine, they might be next.

War rages, too, in the Middle East as Israel defends itself not only against the terrorists of Hamas but a barrage of missiles fired - for the first time - directly from Iran.

Right now in Africa, conflicts are being fought in 18 different countries. And Putin's recklessness has taken us closer to a dangerous nuclear escalation than at any point since the Cuban missile crisis.

These are not faraway problems. Iranian proxies are firing on British ships in the Red Sea, disrupting goods destined for our high streets.

Here at home, China has conducted cyber targeting of our democratically elected MPs. Russia has poisoned people with chemical weapons.

And when Putin cut off the gas supplies it had a devastating impact on people's lives and threatened our energy security.

And in this world of greater conflict and danger, 100 million people are now displaced globally.

Countries like Russia are weaponising immigration for their own ends, and criminal gangs keep finding new routes across European borders.

Illegal migration is placing an intolerable strain on our security and our sense of fairness, and unless we act now and act boldly this problem is only going to grow.

Extremists are also exploiting these global conflicts to divide us.

People are abusing our liberal democratic values - the freedom of speech and right of protest - to intimidate, threaten and assault others, to sing antisemitic chants on our streets and our university campuses, and to weaponise the evils of anti-Semitism or anti-Muslim hatred in a divisive, ideological attempt to set Briton against Briton.

And from gender activists hijacking children's sex education to cancel culture, vocal and aggressive fringe groups are trying to impose their views on the rest of us.

They're trying to make it morally unacceptable to believe something different and undermine people's confidence and pride in our own history and identity.

But for all the dangers ahead, few are felt more acutely than people's sense of financial insecurity. We've been pounded by a series of once-in-a-generation shocks.

The worst international financial crisis since the great depression in the 1930s. The first global pandemic since the Spanish flu in 1918.

The biggest energy shock since the 1970s. Global forces, yet they are hitting our living standards here at home.

We must be prepared strategically, economically, with robust plans and greater national resilience, to meet this time of instability with strength.

And people's sense of insecurity is only heightened by the fears about new technologies like AI.

When the IMF says 40% of jobs could be affected, or hundreds of leading experts say the risks could be on a par with pandemics or nuclear war, and when children are exposed to bullying, sexualised content or even self-harm online, people want to know they've got someone in charge who understands these dangers, because only if you understand what is happening can you be trusted to keep us safe.

But the paradox of our age is that for all the profound dangers we face, right now, we also hold in our hands an opportunity for human progress that could surpass the industrial revolution in speed and breadth.

Technologies like AI will do for the 21st century what the steam engine and electricity did for the 19th.

They'll accelerate human progress by complementing what we do, by speeding up the discovery of new ideas, and by assisting almost every aspect of human life.

Think of the investment they will bring, the jobs they'll create, and the increase in all our living standards they'll deliver.

Credible estimates suggest AI alone could double our productivity in the next decade.

And in doing so, help us create a world of less suffering, more freedom, choice, and opportunity.

Just imagine. Every child in school with their own personalised tutor, and every teacher free to spend more time personally developing each student.

New frontiers in medical diagnostics where a single picture of your eyes can not only detect blindness but predict other diseases like heart attacks or Parkinson's.

And counterintuitive as it may seem, throughout human history, the greatest breakthroughs of science and learning have so often come at the moments of greatest danger.

The first electronic digital computers were developed by British codebreakers in the Second World War. Solar technology went from powering pocket calculators to a viable commercial technology following the energy crisis of the 1970s.

The fastest development, and deployment, of a vaccine in history came during the Covid pandemic.

And so it is incumbent upon us to make this a period not just of great danger, but great progress, too.

That's why we launched a bold plan to make science and technology our new national purpose.

We're rightly proud of Britain's spirit of discovery and entrepreneurship made us the leading country in the industrial revolution.

But we can be just as proud, just as confident, just as optimistic about our future, and our prospects to lead again in this new industrial age.

And doing so will enrich our lives and create good, well-paid jobs in the growth industries of the future here at home.

At the same time, new and fast-growing economic superpowers like India, Indonesia, and Nigeria are significantly reshaping the global economy.

And just as this ever more interconnected world creates new dangers, it also creates new possibilities.

The United Kingdom is uniquely placed to benefit. We've always been an open, trading, maritime nation; and Brexit has given us the opportunity to trade even more.

And we invent, discover, and produce new products and services that the world wants to buy.

From aircraft wings in Filton, to financial services in Glasgow, to incredible cultural exports like film, music, and TV, or sports like the Premier League.

Everywhere from rural Kenya to the cityscapes of South Korea, people stay up all times of day and night to watch their favourite British team.

It's no wonder that Brexit Britain has leapt above France, Japan, and the Netherlands to become the world's fourth biggest exporter.

And the more we export, the better our businesses will do, the more jobs we will create, the more wealth we will generate - right across our country.

This is the opportunity before us. A world transformed by technological progress. Huge global markets hungry for new talent, goods, and services. You can see it all around us.

Two brothers from Merseyside sat around their kitchen table and built Castore a £1bn sportswear business taking on global giants like Nike and Adidas, their kit now worn by Red Bull Formula 1 and Bayer Leverkusen.

British companies and workers right across the country are pioneering offshore wind and exporting it around the world. Already, we've built the first floating offshore wind farm.

And our innovations have helped reduce the cost of wind energy by around two-thirds, and increased the size of turbines to the equivalent of the Eiffel Tower with blades bigger than Big Ben.

And you can see the opportunity too in healthcare, giving people longer, healthier lives. In Denmark, NovoNordisk created the Ozempic drug which is not only helping to tackle chronic disease globally, but singlehandedly grew Denmark's entire economy last year.

All this progress should show us that while this is one of the most dangerous periods we've ever known, it will also be one of the most transformational.

And if we make the right choices, if we have a bold enough vision, then we should feel confidence, pride, and optimism that Britain's future is secure.

My point is this: our country stands at a crossroads. Over the next few years, from our democracy to our society to our economy - to the hardest questions of war and peace - almost every aspect of our lives is going to change.

How we act in the face of these changes - not only to keep people safe and secure but to realise the opportunities too, will determine whether or not Britain will succeed in the years to come.

In the last 14 years, we've made progress in the most difficult conditions any governments has faced since the Second World War.

A world leading economy, we've seen the 3rd highest growth rate in the G7, and created 4 million jobs, 800 a day.

We took difficult decisions to restore our country's financial security and control national debt, and that allowed us to support the country through Covid, deliver the fastest vaccine roll-out in the world, provide record funding to the NHS, and protect state pensions with the triple lock.

We've reformed welfare by capping benefits and introducing Universal Credit to help people into work.

We've reduced absolute poverty, pensioner poverty, child poverty. We've cut carbon emissions by a third.

Maintained our position as NATO's second biggest defence power. Halved violent and neighbourhood crime. And improved standards in our schools with English schoolchildren not just the best readers in the UK, but in the western world.

We've legislated for equal marriage. And it is now not even surprising for people from ethnically diverse backgrounds to lead Scotland, Wales, and the United Kingdom.

And the economy now decisively has momentum. Inflation down from over 11% to 3%. Wages rising faster than prices.

And in the first quarter of this year, we grew faster than France, Germany, Japan, Italy, and even America.

The plan is working - so we must stick to it, and not go back to square one.

Because at heart, we're a nation of optimists. We're not blind to the challenges or threats that we face.

We just have an innate belief that whatever they are, we can overcome them, as we have done so many times in our history. And create a secure future for you and your family.

Let me tell you more about my vision for how I would lead this country through this time of danger and transformation.

We've proudly taken the generational decision to increase defence spending to a new baseline of 2.5% of GDP, by 2030. Yet Labour have refused to match our pledge.

The global displacement of a hundred million people is a new and defining challenge of our age. But we can and will protect ourselves against illegal migration.

That's why we're pioneering the Rwanda scheme. And so, when people see that if they come here illegally, they will be swiftly detained and removed, they will be deterred from making that perilous journey, stopping the boats and saving thousands of lives.

I know that our international frameworks are outdated. So there may be flashpoints ahead with the ECHR.

And if the Strasbourg Court make me choose between the ECHR and this country's security, I will choose our country's security every single time.

And nor will I ever compromise on defending our values, our history, and our way of life, against those who seek to undermine them.

I am unapologetically proud of who we are.

And under my leadership, ours will be a country where people can disagree in good faith, but where they must do so with respect and decency for others.

A country where the benefits of belonging to our Union are self-evident to the overwhelming majority of our people.

A country where we protect and strengthen the greatest institution of all - the family, better protect children from the harms of the online and offline worlds, and do more to protect single sex spaces.

A country where we celebrate the small acts of kindness that bind our society together, and where we actively work to rebuild the civic involvement and pride that have always formed part of our distinctive national culture.

A country where we honour those prepared to pay the highest price for our freedoms, as we make this the best place in the world to be a veteran here at home.

And a country where we properly respect the older generation.

They've contributed all their lives, so whatever the triple lock costs, it is morally right to give older people dignity and comfort in retirement.

But as well as strengthening our national security and restoring pride in our national culture, we'll also protect you from the dangers of a more unstable world by giving you greater peace of mind over your financial security.

People have been struggling to make ends meet - I know that. In the last few years, you've seen rising energy bills, mortgage rates, the cost of the weekly shop.

And I hope I've shown through my time in office that, from furlough to support with your energy bills, the government I lead will always be there for you.

But that's only possible if we take the tough decisions to strengthen the country's finances and control debt.

You can trust me to do that.

When I stood for the leadership of my party, and my opponent's policies imperilled our financial strength, I was sooner prepared to lose than abandon what I believe so deeply is right for our country.

I feel the same conviction about Net Zero.

In a more unstable world, where dictators like Putin have held us to ransom over energy prices, I reject the ideological zeal of those who want us to adopt policies that go further, faster than any other country, no matter the cost or disruption to people's lives.

But even as we strengthen our security and our sense of pride and confidence in ourselves, I also feel a sense of urgency about readying our country to succeed in a world transformed.

That starts by giving all our young people - wherever they live and whatever their background - the skills and knowledge to succeed.

Building on the success of the last 14 years, we will create a truly world-class education system.

The Advanced British Standard is the most far-reaching reform to education for 16-18 year olds in a generation.

We're tearing down the artificial barriers between technical and academic education.

Increasing children's time in the classroom.

Studying a greater breadth of subjects to match our competitors.

And unapologetically saying that every single child must leave school not just literate but numerate as well.

Now, I know this will not win universal acclaim but maths will be fundamental to our children's life chances in this new technological age.

And it is our duty to give them those skills. And more. We'll end rip-off degrees and massively expand the number of apprenticeships, because a degree is not the only path to success in the modern economy.

And we'll make sure that everyone has the funding they need to retrain or learn new skills, at any point in their lives, because in the future education won't stop when you walk out of the school gates.

But for Britain to finish first in today's world, we don't just need the skills to succeed, we need to create a dynamic, innovative economy fuelled by technological progress, so we lead in the industries of the future and help you and your family become wealthier and more economically secure.

The government I lead is creating the conditions for a new British dynamism. By investing in the new infrastructure of the future - not just roads, railways, and buses, but gigabit broadband, research and development, computing power.

By helping to create hundreds of thousands of good, secure, well-paid, highly-skilled jobs, that will level up opportunity right across our country.

And yes, by taking the necessary decisions to build the right homes in the right places to support those jobs.

But true British dynamism won't come from the State alone. It will come from you. It will come from the ingenuity and creativity of the British people, given the support, the opportunities and the rewards to have, pursue and realise big ambitions.

If you have a brilliant new idea - I want you to build it. If you're passionate about solving a problem - I want you to pursue it.

If you simply want to set up on your own - I want you to get out there and do it.

Because you won't find the future written in a slide deck in a Whitehall quango.

You'll find it out there in our country.

And so the government I lead will create the conditions for people themselves to try, to build, to invent - yes, sometimes to fail, but more often to succeed.

That's why we're cutting taxes directly on investment. It's why we're cutting taxes to encourage innovation.

And it's why we're seizing the freedom and flexibility of Brexit. Because so often, the EU's default approach was top down, precautionary regulation.

Whereas we in the UK now have the chance to be more agile, so that rather than stifling innovation and growth, we encourage it, in everything from financial services to agriculture, from healthcare to house building.

Above all, we will reward hard work.

Because you don't get anything in life without hard work.

So we're making the tax system simpler, fairer, and more rewarding, cutting National Insurance by £900 for the average worker, alongside increasing the state pension by £900 this year.

We're raising the National Living Wage to end low pay.

And we're reforming welfare to make sure that work always pays, and our safety net is fair to those who pay for it.

Not least because giving people support to get off welfare and into work gives them purpose, dignity and hope and it is also the only sustainable way to cut legal migration.

And that's how we'll transform public services, too.

Imagine a welfare system where new technologies allow us to crack down on the fraudsters, exploiting the hardworking taxpayers who fund it.

Imagine the huge opportunities to cut crime through technologies like live facial recognition, helping police catch wanted criminals, find missing people, and spend more time on the beat.

And imagine our NHS, still free at the point of use, but transformed for the future.

A service staffed by tens of thousands more doctors and nurses, thanks to our Long Term Workforce Plan.

Backed by record funding made possible by years of fiscal discipline. With far greater choice over where you can receive your care, made as simple as choosing what to watch on iPlayer.

And I believe there will be no more powerful example of what all the forces of British dynamism, innovation, scientific discovery and technological progress can achieve, than this:

To address, finally, the fear of one word that still lurks in the back of everyone's minds, that touches almost every family in our country, and that envelopes our whole world, if we or a loved one hears it: cancer.

Yet even here, if we are bold enough, there can be cause for new hope. We already know we can prevent most lung cancer cases - the UK's leading cause of cancer deaths - by stopping smoking.

That's why I took the important decision to create a smokefree generation.

And with huge breakthroughs in early diagnosis and new treatments, like the MRNA vaccine for skin cancer, I believe we can be just as bold and ambitious in improving rates of cancer survival.

Because if we can bring together my vision of a country transformed, with our world class education system that trains the PhD oncologists and apprentice lab technicians, and our dynamic economy that attracts investors and incubates the billion-pound biotech businesses of the future, our post-Brexit regulatory freedoms to approve trials in a safe but faster way.

And the scale of our NHS to help us research and trial those new drugs in a way no other country can, then just one example of the incredible achievements this country can make would be to make a generational breakthrough against this cruel disease and fundamentally change what it will mean for our children and grandchildren to hear the word cancer.

Today I've set out my vision for how Britain can succeed in one of the most dangerous yet transformational eras we've ever known.

The values that lie behind that vision are a new patriotism: a confidence in ourselves and in all that we can achieve.

I reject those who insidiously question our history and our identity.

I believe in that innate confidence in ourselves that has always run through our island story.

And just as we're proud of all that we created, invented, and discovered in our past, so we can be confident and optimistic about what we will achieve in our future.

My pledge to you is that I will create the conditions to make that possible, to help you fulfil your ambitions.

To build the world-class education system that gives our children the skills they need to succeed, no matter where they started off in life.

To create the dynamic, innovative economy that will give you the opportunity of a wealthier, more financially secure life for you and your family.

To restore our sense of civic pride and national cohesion so we can be secure in the knowledge that we are all on the same side.

And above all, you can trust me to keep you and your family safe and secure from the threats we face at home and abroad.

Because with bold action and a clear plan, we can and we will create a secure future.",globalsecurity.org,news,GlobalSecurity.org,John Pike,-0.05882352941176472,453374916,4,,

While its relevance in helping to reach climate goals has long been recognised, deployment of carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) has been slow and consistently accounting for less than 0.5% of global investment in clean energy technologies.

Although CCUS is not a new technology, and there are currently around 41 operational facilities globally, it has typically been deployed at a small scale - mainly for R&D projects and for enhanced oil recovery.¹ In order for CCUS to meaningfully contribute to climate change goals, the amount of CO2 captured would need to grow four-fold from current levels by 2030.² However, stronger climate targets and investment incentives are now starting to drive increased momentum into CCUS - and one of the key strategies to provide a boost to the technology is the efficient production of hydrogen.

Hydrogen is a versatile energy carrier that can help support the decarbonisation of a range of hard-to-abate sectors where electrification from renewable sources cannot deliver the level of energy output required. These include iron, steel, chemicals and cement production, as well as hydrogen-based fuels for aviation, shipping, and long-distance haulage.

CCUS can facilitate the production of low-carbon hydrogen (sometimes referred to as 'blue' hydrogen) from natural gas and provide an opportunity to bring it into new markets in the near term - and at a reasonable cost.

It can help alleviate pressure on already constrained electricity grids, allowing renewable electricity generation and electrolytic hydrogen production to scale at a more manageable pace. This benefit of CCUS-enabled hydrogen over the next decade has been recognised in the Committee on Climate Change's recently published 2023 Progress Report to Parliament.

Today, the cost of CCUS-enabled hydrogen production is likely to be around 50% of hydrogen production via electrolysis powered by renewables-based electricity. While the cost of electrolytic hydrogen is anticipated to reduce over time with the onset of increasingly cheaper electrolysers and renewable electricity, CCUS-equipped hydrogen will most likely remain a competitive option across regions typically associated with low-cost fossil fuels.

Recently there has been a significant increase in the appetite to develop CCUS projects, with a 50% increase in CO2 capture in the 12 months between 2022 to 2023.³ This has been driven by governments internationally coming under increasing pressure to meet global climate targets, implementing robust legislation and providing clear pricing signals in order to make CCUS commercially viable.

Despite this positive news, there remain three significant issues. Of the many announced CCUS projects, only around 5% have taken firm investment decisions due to the uncertainty of demand, a lack of clarity around certification and regulation - and, critically - the lack of infrastructure available to actually deliver the hydrogen to customer sites. And according to the IEA, to help deliver a majorly decarbonised heavy industry by 2030, a third of all hydrogen production will need to be dedicated to those hard-to-abate sectors. Currently, these applications only account for around 0.1% today, meaning there is considerably more work to do.

Because CCUS is far from a mature industry, a single stakeholder is typically unable to take on all the expertise, risk and capital expenditure needed across the whole value chain. As such, the most significant challenges with deploying CCUS at scale are the multiple different, distinct stakeholders that need to be co-ordinated, including the industrial plants that are the CO2 emitters themselves, the various CCUS technology suppliers which separate and capture the CO2, providers of processing, compression solutions, transportation solutions and, finally, experienced storage providers who can inject and store the CO2 underground.

It is evident that urgent policy action is needed to create demand for low-carbon hydrogen and unlock the necessary investment to accelerate the scale-up of production and the building of delivery infrastructure.

Currently, different policy approaches are being undertaken by governments to encourage the deployment of CCUS at scale. In particular, the United States has provided a much-needed shot in the arm for the infrastructure required to scale up technologies. Incentives under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) provide project developers with a $50 per metric tonne of CO2 tax reduction where CO2 is stored in dedicated storage sites. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act passed in November 2021 also provided a combined $15bn to support CCUS and low-carbon hydrogen production.

The IRA has had a considerable positive impact on hydrogen production, enabling the US to have the largest hydrogen project pipeline of any country. It currently accounts for 18% of the total announced capacity, putting Australia in second place at 14%. And while the percentage of hydrogen projects in the EU surpasses both of those (at 29%), it should be remembered that this figure accounts for the whole of the EU (consisting of 27 countries) and the UK, which ultimately results in relatively minor pipelines per country.

While Europe may be advancing the highest number of projects overall, the US is considerably closer to offering early scale-up. The generous IRA tax credits eventually help a strong flow of US projects towards final investment decision (FID).

The majority of announced projects are for green hydrogen, which is produced using renewable energy and electrolysis, and is the cleanest form of hydrogen production. However, it is also expensive, making access to cheaper clean power necessary to achieve the desired economics.

While most of the recently announced projects are for carbon-free hydrogen, the most advanced projects are dominated by blue hydrogen, especially in the US. Blue hydrogen is mainly produced from natural gas and creates carbon dioxide as a by-product, so it's a low-carbon solution but not strictly a 'clean' one. However, it enjoys a significant cost advantage over green hydrogen, particularly where natural gas is cheap, as in the US and Canada.

Today, the cost of CCUS-enabled hydrogen production remains around half that of producing hydrogen through electrolysis powered by renewables-based electricity. And while the cost of electrolytic hydrogen will decline over time, with cheaper electrolysers and renewable electricity, CCUS-equipped hydrogen will most likely remain a competitive option in regions with low-cost fossil fuels and CO2 storage resources.

In discussions with Greg Bean, Director of the Gutierrez Energy Management Institute at the University of Houston, he said: ""Recent federal government policies affecting low carbon intensity (LCI) hydrogen - specifically the funding of seven hydrogen hubs, along with IRA production tax credits for LCI hydrogen and enhanced CCUS tax credits - should accelerate the initial wave of CCS hydrogen given its current cost advantage over electrolytic hydrogen, especially in the US with low natural gas prices. However, the more favourable tax treatment for electrolytic hydrogen in the IRA and the likely reduction in electrolytic hydrogen cost suggests that it might ultimately have a larger market share in an aggressive decarbonisation scenario.""

Hydrogen trading is still relatively nascent but could see significant growth this decade. Even low-carbon hydrogen will be crucial for net importers to reach net-zero targets and for net exporters like the US to maximise benefits from clean energy deployment. CCUS-based hydrogen is likely to become an internationally traded commodity to help countries meet their hydrogen demand more economically.

However, Greg Bean goes on to note: ""With main export markets likely to be in Europe and North Asia, there could be policy actions in these countries that penalise or limit CCS hydrogen imports. A relevant example is the ""maximum methane intensity values"" and associate penalty structure being discussed for LNG imports into Europe. Time will tell.""

We are in a decisive decade and need to scale solutions today if we wish to avoid the worst of climate impacts on our society and global ecosystem. Both CCUS and low-carbon hydrogen are well-tested and the US has shown that they can be rapidly scalable solutions that can deliver decarbonised industries at a lower cost.

The significant opportunities for low-carbon hydrogen can only be delivered through co-ordinated international collaboration. This requires cross-industry partnerships that must work together based on guiding principles of lower costs, speed, and uncompromising quality.

Utilizing a docking mechanism, advanced sensors, and an artificial intelligence system, the drone can identify power lines whenever it needs to recharge its batteries. It approaches the high-voltage cables, latches on, and draws electricity, effectively functioning like an electric vampire.

""The drones would be able to essentially live on the grid and operate completely autonomously for extended periods with no need for human interaction,"" the development team explained via email.

The concept of using power lines to charge drones originated in 2017 when Emad Ebeid, a professor at the University of Southern Denmark (SDU), was exploring drone applications and identified power line inspection as a promising area. Ebeid noted that the existing inspection process, relying on helicopters and ground personnel, was both costly and inefficient. Drones emerged as a natural alternative for this expensive maintenance effort, capable of remote or autonomous operation to oversee the lines. However, drones' limited battery life -- typically maxing out at 40 minutes -- posed a significant challenge, necessitating a permanent human crew nearby, which contradicted the goal of autonomous operation.

To achieve complete autonomy, the drones needed a way to recharge without human intervention. The solution lay in the power lines themselves. Ensuring that a drone could find, securely latch onto, and draw electricity from a power line proved to be a complex design problem.

The first issue was enabling the drones to interact with the power lines. ""By default, drones are not meant to physically interact with anything other than the air during flight and the ground during landing,"" the researchers explained. Initial tests with early maneuvers showed unpredictable behavior when contacting power lines, necessitating the presence of a skilled safety pilot to prevent potential damage or wildfires.

The team programmed the drone to approach the power line from below, reducing collision risks. They outfitted the drone with grippers, essentially insulated clamps that grab the power line without conducting electricity to the drone itself. The gripper mechanism activates through an electromagnetic process when the drone's software detects it is in the correct position, ensuring a secure attachment.

The final design challenge was converting the power line's high voltage into a manageable form for the drone. Typical power lines carry between 1,000 and 800,000 volts, while drones require only about 9 volts. High-voltage transformers, which can weigh hundreds of tonnes, were not a viable option. Instead, the team utilized inductive coupling, harnessing the magnetic field around the cable to induce a current in the drone's energy harvester, similar to how a wireless phone charger works. Depending on the cable's voltage, a 9.4-pound drone requires between 30 minutes to six hours to charge.

After seven years of development, the system was successfully tested at HCA Airport in Denmark. The drone performed five recharging sessions without human intervention, allowing it to fly for two uninterrupted hours -- an impressive increase from the usual 30 minutes. Theoretically, this could enable the drone to fly indefinitely.

The next steps involve optimizing the system and testing its durability under adverse weather conditions. ""It will be challenging to weatherproof the system and also make it resistant to very high voltages,"" the team noted. Ensuring the system's durability and public safety is crucial, as is preventing potential jamming or hijacking.

Before widespread adoption, issues like the cost of the electricity drawn from the lines need resolution. The drone, in a sense, ""steals"" power that would otherwise be unused. However, the researchers believe utility companies will eventually adopt this technology to reduce the substantial costs of power-line monitoring and maintenance.

While currently a research and enterprise project, this technology could eventually be used by drone enthusiasts and various industries, potentially transforming operations with 24/7 monitoring and optimization. With approximately 25 million miles of power lines worldwide, enough to circle Earth 1,000 times, the potential applications and benefits of this technology are vast, ranging from cost savings to life-saving emergency operations.

As the inventors conclude, the applications and benefits of this technology are ""as vast as the global power-line network itself.""",impactlab.com,news,impactlab.com,,0.192156862745098,453355793,16,,

The recent demand by the Nigerian Labour Congress (NLC) for N615,000.00 as the new minimum wage, will begin a new round of negotiations between Government and Workers, represented by the NLC. How realistic and feasible is the NLC's demand for this sizeable upward review of workers salaries, especially with the present economic downturn? Is the NLC demand justified? Does the Government have the capacity and/or the willingness to pay such bumper wages? Should there be a decentralisation of the Minimum Wage, considering the fact that size of the work force, the cost of living, IGR and Federal Allocation differs from State to State? Norrison Quakers, SAN; Chief Aikhunegbe Anthony Malik, SAN; Jide Ojo and Jude Igbanoi give their perspectives on this weighty issue of national concern. But, one thing they all appear to agree on, is that the current N30,000 minimum wage is grossly inadequate, as it is a take home pay that does not take anyone home

Wages have become the top issue for Nigeria's organised labour movements, in the past year. Reacting to recent increases in the cost of living, the labour movement has been calling for an upward review of the national minimum wage, currently N30,000 (US$24) a month.

Definition

A minimum wage is the lowest remuneration that employers can legally pay their employees - the price floor below which employees may not sell their labour. The Committee of Experts of the Governing Body of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) at the 168th Session had concluded that the minimum wage, 'represents the lowest level of remuneration permitted, in law' paid hourly, daily or monthly.

Given the fact that minimum wages pose an increase to the cost of labour, companies often try to circumvent minimum wage laws. They achieve this by using gig workers, by moving labour to locations with lower or nonexistent minimum wages, automating job functions, etc. However, most countries have minimum wage legislation in place.

Background

In 1972, the Udoji Public Service Review Commission was set up by the Military Government to examine the organisation, structure, and management of public service in Nigeria; and in 1974, the Commission returned with far-reaching reform proposals, including the increase of workers' wages. The Government followed the recommendations. However, public sector workers were the main beneficiaries.

It was on September 3, 1981 that the first minimum wage law was introduced in Nigeria, covering all full-time workers except seasonal workers, and those who worked in enterprises employing fewer than 50 workers.

Of paramount importance to this article, is that the legislation came on the wings of agitation by the Nigerian Labour Congress (NLC), under the leadership of Hassan Sunmonu, and the key basis was for improvement to the welfare of workers. Since then, the minimum wage in Nigeria has been revised a number of times, but it has not kept pace with the cost of living in Nigeria.

It became N250 in 1991, N5,500 in 2000 and N18,900 in 2011. The current N30,000 took effect in 2019, under the subsisting National Minimum Wage Act of 2019, which defines the minimum amount of money an employer of labour is required to pay the lowest paid worker monthly as N30,000.

Key Issues

This Article is geared at lending a voice to the discourse on three levels, to wit:

I. The realism of NLC's demand for N650,000 minimum wage

II. The attitude of the State Governors who maintain their inability to pay more than N30,000

III. What Nigeria should do about minimum wage, in the face of spiralling inflation, harsh economic conditions across the nation and availability of resources to actualise the minimum wage increase.

Before responding to these three issues, we look at the broader conversation on whether the minimum wage protects workers from extreme poverty. Analysts have said that, it depends on how poverty is measured.

Where a nation establishes a poverty line (or a minimum income level), which is usually set very low, below which someone would be considered poor, this minimum amount is deemed adequate to maintain an acceptable living standard, based on the cost of living in that country. However, if a multidimensional measure of poverty is used, that is, one that considers income, access to health, education, and living standard indicators (including sanitation, drinking water, electricity, and housing), the minimum wage is inadequate.

In reality, Nigeria's minimum wage traps workers in a cycle of poverty, and as of 2021, when the latest data was compiled, 47.3% of Nigerians were multidimensionally poor. That number may have gone up significantly, following the removal of fuel subsidies and a galloping inflation rate of 33%. The subsequent steep increase in the cost of living, without wage adjustments, can only push more Nigerians into poverty.

It is therefore, possible for someone earning the minimum wage to be regarded as non-poor under the income measure, but poor when the multidimensional measure is used. The current minimum wage of N30,000 (US$24) in Nigeria cannot extricate workers from multidimensional poverty, and the number of poor people in Nigeria has been rising for the past eight years. It will continue to do so until the minimum wage reflects the cost of living and recognises the salience of social services like health, education and housing.

Another reason the minimum wage does not protect Nigerian workers from poverty, is that it is not indexed to inflation. Inflation has been rising faster than wage growth in Nigeria, thereby decreasing the real purchasing power of workers. Their income buys less and less. Inflation rose from about 11% in 2008 to 25% in 2023. The minimum wage has not increased significantly, within the same period.

The current minimum wage has had a negative impact on the Nigerian economy, as to make ends meet, many workers are now doing ""side hustles"". Many public-sector workers are hardly available in their places of work, and when they are, they are very susceptible to corruption. The low wage has equally undermined the morale and productivity of the workers, creating a sense of deprivation among them.

Statement of Case

Sequel to his election into office, the two primary labour organisations in Nigeria - the NLC and the Trade Unions Congress (TUC), presented a proposal for the welfare of the Nigerian workforce, and the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, constituted a tripartite Committee comprising government, labour, and private sector representatives in January of 2024 to assess the N30,000 minimum wage implemented during former President Muhammadu Buhari's tenure.

It was to that Committee that the NLC and TUC presented their proposal for the new minimum wage for workers in Nigeria, to be N615,000. The Government has refrained from announcing a new minimum wage, citing its reluctance to accept labour's proposal because it was 'assessing each State Government's fiscal capacity and the potential effects of different proposals, to determine an enhanced minimum wage that could be sustained by the States'.

Wellington (1991) found data from 1986 to confirm the fact that the real (inflation- adjusted) value of minimum wage had declined, because it had not been increased since 1981. On this issue, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, 1933 had this to say:

""It seems to me to be equally plain, that no business which depends for existence on paying less than living wages to its workers, has any right to continue in this country.""

This begs the question of whether the non-realistic bent for minimum wage is only in the fact that it has been left off for too long, and we are now dealing with an accumulation of benefits.

The National President of the NLC, Comrade Joe Ajaero, gave his analysis of how the proposal of the organised labour for the current minimum wage was arrived by.

According to him:""Living wage is such that will, at least, keep you alive. It is not a wage that will make you poorer and poorer. It is not a wage that will make you borrow to go to work. It is not a wage that will lead you to be in the hospital every day because of malnutrition"".

He said further,

""Let me give you a breakdown of how we arrived at that figure. We have housing and accommodation of N40,000. We asked for electricity of N20,000 - of course, that was before the current tariff increase. Nobody can spend this amount currently. We have a utility that is about N10,000. We looked at kerosene and gas, that is about N25,000 to N35,000. We looked at food for a family of six, that is about N9,000 in a day. For 30 days, that is about N270,000. Look at medical, N50,000 provided, there will be no surgery or whatever.

""For clothing, we looked at N20,000. For education, N50,000. I don't know about those who tried to put their children in private schools; they will not be able to cope with this amount. We also have sanitation of N10,000. Where we have another bulk of the money is transportation. This is because the workers stay on the fringes, and because of the cost of petrol, this amounted to N110,000.""

The amount put forward by Ajaero may appear outrageous and unreasonable, but is it really? The breakdown is very convincing since the current prices of products in the country have skyrocketed in the last one year, without any measures by government to curb it. If an increase is required, surely, it must meet the desired result.

The NLC President and his comrades have understandably spoken from the point of view of entitlement to socio-economic security. However, in a nation not known for any worthwhile safety nets for the generality of its citizens, it is necessary that it should, at least, make provision for a robust compensation for those working .

The trajectory of minimum wages in Nigeria shows a significant pattern, the first minimum wage in 1981 was N125 per month. At the exchange rate of US$1 = 0.61 naira in 1981, this amounted to about US$204. In 2024, that minimum wage would be equivalent to about 265,000 naira (US$204) per month, going by the current exchange rate of about US$1 = 1,300 naira. As of this writing, the current exchange rate is US$ = N1,424.90. This puts the minimum wage in 1981, at least eight times more than the current minimum wage.

Since May 2023 when the immediate implementation of petrol subsidy removal was announced and the Naira floated, the initial response of the economy was almost 300% devaluation. According to the Nigerian Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the food inflation rate in December 2023 was 33.93% on a year-on-year basis.

Granted that minimum wage varies greatly across different jurisdictions, for example, under certain US State laws, the minimum wage is $7.25 per hour ($14,500 per year), it is $16.28 per hour in the US State of Washington.

The narrative presented by the NLC and TUC does appear to have put a human face to the Nigerian Worker, who has remained faceless over generations, whilst the very cadre of citizens to determine his fate have continued to feed fat on the fortunes of the nation, when in fact these are the products of the Nigerian Worker.

The clog posed by the attitude of the State Governors who say they can't pay more than N30,000 minimum wage

The States have responded in various ways, and even the N30,000 minimum wage was ignored by some States. Reports have it, for instance, that some teachers in Zamfara State, the most educationally-underdeveloped State in the Federation, receive N8,000 monthly salaries. In many States, workers are owed months, even years, in arrears, while the Governors and other political office holders continue to live like the proverbial mandarins. On what basis would those Governors agree to the payment of a higher minimum wage and when they give a nod, is that not a mere rhetoric?

The cost of governance in Nigeria is high at all levels, coupled with the unchecked corruption and squandering of public resources. These are the areas in which the Government has to intervene, or else it will indeed, have very little to pay government workers from, and continue to postpone the building of essential public amenities. We believe that these politicians must be held into account as they have no idea what value their workforce holds, and the boost that a significant increase in the minimum wage will have on their State's economy.

Research carried out by David Card and Alan Krueger in 1992 when the minimum wage increased in New Jersey from $4.25 to $5.05 per hour (an 18.8% increase), while it remained at $4.25 in the adjacent State of Pennsylvania showed from the information gathered from the fast-food restaurants in New Jersey and Eastern Pennsylvania that, the increase in the minimum wage increased employment in the New Jersey restaurants.

The Governors ought to be made to recognise the value of a thriving workforce to the prosperity of their States, and it is this re-orientation that will give them the impetus to join the move to revamp the Nigerian workforce and to propel the Nigerian economy forward.

According to former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher,

'Wealth is not created by governments but by the vitality, initiative and enterprise of individuals who want to build something, a business, an industry, a place of learning, a theatre, an orchestra. As they prosper themselves, we believe that they will use their wealth to help others prosper'.

'Enterprise is the best way to create the wealth you need, to bring a higher standard of living and all the other benefits which we in the West now enjoy.'

When Britain cut taxes and gave the necessary support to boost the morale of the people, the result that was borne out by the statistics was the changing attitudes of the people and Britain's greater influence in the wider world at the time. Britain's economic vitality was illustrated by the number of people setting up in business on their own - 1,600 every week that year, and the sense of enterprise had a powerful effect on the economy which grew very fast.

The Governors must be made aware of the fact that economic reform requires the acceptance of initiative and responsibility by people themselves, and this is very difficult in countries which have never known these qualities. Nigeria stands in a position to begin to imbibe those qualities, but in a situation where the Government is unwilling to first play its part and take responsibility for setting up policies that will inform the change, the economic reform we all long for, is not in view.

The NLC's proposal is said to be a product of a painstaking effort, to capture the cost of living of Nigerian workers and masses in all parts of the country. It was essentially an outcome of an independent research conducted by the NLC and TUC on the cost of meeting the primary needs of an average family around the country. The research was based on a family with both parents alive and four children, without the burden of having other dependents with them.

The Union arrived at the figure before the increase in electricity tariff and the scarcity of petrol across the nation occurred, which would undoubtedly spike the transportation costs contemplated by the proposal.

In view of the provisions of the Minimum Wage Act of 2019, this increment, taking into cognisance the economic realities have legal backing, since it will inure for the next five years regardless of any turns in the economy. Ajaero confirmed this as the basis of their agitations in saying that any figure below this amount becomes a starvation wage and condemns Nigerian workers and their families to perpetual poverty,

""We have to remember that the old one having expired on the 18th day of April, 2024, a new one is expected to have come into effect on the 19th day of April, 2024. However, because of Government's inability to comply with the Law that demanded for negotiations for a new national minimum wage to have begun six months before the expiration of the existing one, concluding the new one has become unfortunately delayed,"" he added.

Finally, on the political will and otherwise of the various Governors to comply with the new minimum wage, Winston Churchill MP had this to say on the Trade Boards Bill, Hansard House of Commons (28 April 1909) Vol 4, col 388

'It is a serious national evil that any class of his Majesty's subjects should receive less than a living wage, in return for their utmost exertions. It was formerly supposed that the working of the laws of supply and demand would naturally regulate or eliminate that evil ... [and]... ultimately produce a fair price. Where ... you have a healthy bargaining ... But where you have what we call sweated trades, you have no organisation, no parity of bargaining, the good employer is undercut by the bad, and the bad employer is undercut by the worst... where those conditions prevail you have not a condition for progress, but a condition for progressive degeneration'.

What should Nigeria do about minimum wage, in the face of spiralling inflation, harsh economic conditions across the nation and availability of resources to actualise the minimum wage increase

The sentiment is that labour must be realistic, and this is represented by it having in mind the state of the economy, Government's ability to pay and the need to ensure that the new minimum wage is to strengthen, and not to further undermine the Naira and the economy at large.

So far, there has been some sort of master-servant relationship in which workers have held the short end of the stick. Proper dialogue about macro-economic issues like hyper-inflation, shut down of more factories and millions of small and medium enterprises (SMEs), joblessness and the further endangering of the Naira, have been dangled as reasons for not increasing the minimum wage. However, is there any meaningful move to progress further?

Recognising the urgent need, in May 2017 the House of Representatives moved to amend the National Minimum Wage Act for a compulsory review of workers remuneration every five years, but this has been mere rhetoric. The law as it stands today, requires periodic review of minimum wage to align with the evolving economic realities faced by workers and the analysis by the NLC and TUC in arriving at the proposal is a fair one, going by the current economic realities.

Ex- US President, Theodore Roosevelt, also made a supporting proclamation, when he said:

""We stand for a living wage. Wages are subnormal if they fail to provide a living for those who devote their time and energy to industrial occupations. The monetary equivalent of a living wage varies according to local conditions, but must include enough to secure the elements of a normal standard of living - a standard high enough to make morality possible, to provide for education and recreation, to care for immature members of the family, to maintain the family during periods of sickness, and to permit of reasonable saving for old age.""

Many political leaders have tagged Ajaero and his comrades as insensitive; however, they have not demonstrated genuine sacrifice and leadership, as to gain any credence on this subject matter. The percentage of Nigerians who work in government and organised private sectors is small, compared to the populace, but, that would be a good place to start from. The pervasive hardship is evident, and there is a reason for this conversation to be had.

According to NECA Director-General, Adewale Smart Oyerinde, the Committee's pace in deliberating upon these issues, has not been commendable, he had this to say: ""This protracted delay has the potential to further promote agitation, and fester distrust among stakeholders. We urge the government to, without delay, recall the tripartite committee to continue its assignment as soon as practicable... Employers are in absolute support of a new national minimum wage, as an increase in wages could also promote economic activities, stimulate consumption, and enhance the capacity utilisation of businesses"".

Since the recent reforms in Nigeria, including the removal of fuel subsidy and the unification of the foreign exchange market have pushed the cost of living to newer levels, causing inflation figures to hit 33.2% in March 2024, and compounding an already troubled economy, the labour union believes their proposal can be achieved if the states get their priorities right.

One thing is clear. We must do something, and other alternatives in place in other climes include the following:

*basic income or negative income tax- a system of social security that periodically provides each citizen with a sum of money that is sufficient tp live frugally.

*Refundable tax credit- a mechanism whereby the tax system can reduce the tax owed by a household to below zero, and result in a net payment to the tax payer beyond their own payments into the tax system.

*Earned Income Tax Credit

*The Adam Smith Institute prefers cutting taxes on the poor and middle class instead of raising wages as an alternative to the minimum wage.

*Wage subsidy- a payment made by a government for work people do. It is based on an hourly basis or by income earned.

*Education and training- education or funding apprenticeships or technical training can provide a bridge for low skilled workers to move into wages above a minimum wage.

We can borrow a leaf from data from the United States where, in 2014, job creation was found to be faster in States that raised their minimum wages. In the same year, news organisations reported the State with the highest minimum wage garnered more job creation than the rest of the United States. It is therefore, not apt to assume that a State that raises its minimum wage is doomed to failure. Research has proven to the contrary. Economists in Denmark found that when wage rates were discontinued after a worker turned 18, employment rate dropped to 33 %.

Conclusion

It is self-evident that the purpose of minimum wage is to protect the most vulnerable workers, often in precarious work, as employers can (and are encouraged to) pay above legally permissible minimum. The National Minimum wage debate is essentially for the protection of workers in unorganised sectors against low pay, since businesses will seek to maximise profits by minimising costs even when an economic crisis is looming.

This calls for an overhaul of the current national minimum wage.

The Imperative of Minimum Wage for Nigerian Workers

Chief Aikhunegbe Anthony Malik, SAN

Since the start of organised labour unionism in Nigerian around the year 1912, when workers in the colonial civil service collectively constituted themselves into a trade union, taking a cue from their Sierra Leonean counterpart, there have [always] been two major recurring issues with profound impact on the activities and preoccupation of the organised labour in Nigeria. These are factious infighting and the agitation for wage increase, usually expressed in the code name ""Minimum Wage"".

Significantly, the focus of this intervention is not on the factious infighting both in the parent and every affiliate union bodies, but on a different constant in the activities of labour unionism in Nigeria, that is, the seeming unending agitation for a raise in minimum wage.

While it cannot be gainsaid that the life of organised labour unionism in Nigeria, just as in any other clime, is characterised by struggles for welfare of workers, it does appear that the organised labour unionism in Nigeria has yet to learn a lesson or two on how continuous wage increase over the years, on account of labour agitations, has only but paled into a will-o'-the-wisp, and has not really improved the welfare of workers in real terms, in the face of concomitant inflation that attends every wage increase. One therefore wonders, why the organised labour union in whose rank and file is resident every imaginable skill, expertise, professionalism and know-how, cannot calmly sit back to take another look at its trend of agitation from the outset of organised labour till now, with a view to fashioning out a different approach at addressing the nagging challenge of workers' welfare, constantly sticking out like a sore thumb in virtually all agitations by the organised labour.

Even at the risk of being misunderstood, the point needs to be made that the extant agitation by the NLC for wage increase by as a panacea to rising inflation and demands for good living, is at best, an exercise in self-delusion and a knee-jerk grab at a low hanging fruit that can hardly ever deliver true governance or democratic deliverables to the target workers and their Siamese incident of declining welfare.

As the Tinubu-led government muses on how best to meet or address Labour's fresh agitation for a new minimum wage of N615,000.00, there is the potential of an ensuing fireworks of political intrigues at the NASS for passage of a new Minimum Wage Act or, at the very least, an amendment of the extant one.

Be that as it may, our recent experience and or challenges of implementation of the Minimum Wage Law remain fresh in our collective memories, as to the helplessness of the Nigerian workers when the political class will eventually step into the mix to make nonsense of the Act by another repeat of self-seeking polemics around the principle of federalism, warranting the federating States to decide their individual minimum wage, and not to be bound by any National Minimum Wage Act, just to defeat nation-wide implementation.

Conclusion

Although I am a stern believer in the Marxian posit of the doctrine of ""Surplus Value"", which meaningfully prescribes that the difference between the cost of production and the amount the end product is sold, is the worth of the labour dissipated or which went into producing the goods or the service, thus precipitating a commensurate workers' compensation in that regard. It bears repeating, however, to emphasise the point that, in a developing but fractured governance system such as ours, wage increase achieved without a commensurate improvement in the overall governance deliverables in physical infrastructure, security of lives and property, sustainable education, positive outlook in social orientation of the citizenry etc, is only but a drop on a parched desert land.

President Bola Tinubu is a year old in office. On several occasions he has promised Nigerian workers not only a minimum wage, but a living wage. What Tinubu has in mind as a living wage, is probably known to him alone. On October 2, 2023 after a marathon meeting with the labour unions to forestall their threat of embarking on indefinite strike, he agreed to paying Federal workers N35,000 wage award from September 2023 until a new minimum wage comes into effect and also said a new minimum wage committee will be inaugurated by November 2023. This did not happen until Tuesday, January 30, 2024. It must be stated that labour law expects a new national minimum wage every five years, and negotiation committee to be inaugurated at least six months to the expiration of the extant one. Under Tinubu, it was inaugurated barely three months to the end of the current one.

37-Member Tripartite National Minimum Wage Committee

The new minimum wage should have kicked in by April 2024, but, the only assurance Tinubu's Government has given, is that whenever it is eventually agreed to, the new minimum wage will take effect from May 1, 2024. As earlier said, the Federal Government on Tuesday, January 30, 2024 inaugurated the 37-man Tripartite Committee on National Minimum Wage. Vice President Kashim Shettima who inaugurated the Committee at the Council Chamber of the Presidential Villa Abuja, charged to them to ensure the timely submission of their recommendations. The Committee chaired by the former Head of the Civil Service of the Federation, Goni Bukar Aji, is made up of members of the organised labour, the private sector and the Federal and State Governments. Shettima said the decision to set up the Committee is a recognition of the need to ensure a decent living wage, and in compliance with the existing National Minimum Wage Act of 2019.

Membership of the Committee cuts across the Federal Government, State government, private sector, and organised labour. Present at the inauguration are some State Governors, including Bala Mohammed of Bauchi State; Mohammed Bago of Niger State; Ademola Adeleke of Osun State, and Bassey Otu of Cross River State. Members of the Committee from the Federal Government include Nkeiruka Onyejeocha, Hon. Minister of State, Labour and Employment; Mr Wale Edun; Minister of Finance & Coordinating Minister of the Economy; Alhaji Atiku Bagudu, Hon. Minister of Budget Economic Planning; Dr (Mrs) Yemi Esan, Head of the Civil Service of the Federation; Dr. Nnamdi Maurice Mbaeri, Permanent Secretary, GSO. OSGF and Ekpo Nta, Esq, Chairman/CEO, NSIWC - Member/Secretary.

Labour Unions Demand N615,000 National Minimum Wage

The Labour Unions have placed their demand of N615,000 as the new minimum wage, and are expecting an offer from the Federal Government. The Unions have also demanded that the new Act should have a two-year life with an agreement for automatic adjustment in wages any time inflation exceeds 7.5%. Unions have also demanded that every employer with up to five workers in his employ shall pay the new minimum wage, and have asked for the strengthening of monitoring and compliance mechanisms to penalise non-complying State Governments and organisations.

On the other hand, the Nigeria Governors' Forum, on Thursday, May 2, 2024, emphasised the need for the Government and organised labour to come up with a sustainable minimum wage in the ongoing negotiations. The NGF, which made the call in a communiqué issued at the end of its virtual meeting and signed by its Chairman and Kwara State Governor, AbdulRahaman AbdulRazaq, assured labour of Governors' commitment to pay the workers an improved wage.

The Issues

Giving the rising cost of living, the inflation and devaluation of Naira, the Nigerian Labour Unions are right on their demands. However, the reality on ground is that no government; be it Federal, State or Local, or the organised private sector can afford to adjust minimum wage from N30,000 to a whooping N615,000. As at now, many State Governments are not paying the agreed N30,000 minimum wage of 2019. I recall that Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola as Governor of Osun State could not pay N15,000 minimum wage to the State workers between 2010 and 2018. Rather, he was paying in percentages. Many State Governors such as Senator Uba Sani of Kaduna State, have voiced their concern that their States are finding it difficult to pay the extant N30,000 minimum wage because of paucity of funds starting with debt burden they have to pay, reduction in their monthly subvention, low internally generated revenue, and increased cost of governance.

Many Governors are of the opinion that, workers constitute barely 10% of the population of their States, and they have to provide social amenities such as good roads, hospitals, schools, electricity, potable water, and recreational facilities for the entire population of the State. More so, Ministries, Departments and Agencies will need to have running cost. So, the country is in a Catch 22 situation. Workers demand for welfare is good, but realistically, affordability and sustainability are concerning.

If forced to pay the new minimum wage, Government at all levels including the organised private sector may resort to retrenchment of workers under the guise of right-sizing and downsizing. Thoughts must also be spared for senior citizens who are retirees. Their pensions and gratuities may not be paid.

The Way Forward

I believe that the new national minimum wage should not be less than N70,000 and not more than N100,000, for purposes of affordability and sustainability. Ultimately, I advice that the Labour Act should be amended, to allow for a decentralised minimum wage negotiation. Federal Government should negotiate with the leadership of labour unions at the centre, while State Governors should be allowed to discuss with labour unions in their respective States, and agree to an affordable and sustainable minimum wage. The truth is that States do not have the same population size, labour force, Federal allocations and IGRs. This reflects in their respective annual budgets. Insisting on national minimum wage will continue to lead to threat of sack of workers or situation where governments will owe workers backlog of salaries. In the organised private sector, many industries and companies are resorting to casualisation in order to reduce administrative cost. They know fully well that, casual staff will have no privileges of full staff who get transport allowance, health benefits, housing allowance, leave bonus, feeding allowance and on retirement, will be entitled to pension and gratuity.

Conclusion

It is imperative for the National Minimum Wage Committee to conclude its work without further delay by arriving at a win-win situation for both the Government and Workers' Unions. It is noteworthy that, whatever is agreed on will still have to be sponsored by the President as an Executive Bill to the National Assembly who will review it, pass it and send it back to the President for assent before it will become law and operational. Time is therefore, of essence, as the deadline has already been missed. I implore the labour unions to be reasonable and soft-pedal, for a realistic national minimum wage to be expeditiously agreed on. Best of luck!

Jide Ojo, Development Consultant, Author and Public Affairs Analyst

The perennial agitation for wage increase by Nigerian workers, is nothing new to Nigerians. But, what is different in this recent demand for wage increase, is the humongous leap from N30,000 minimum wage per month to N615,000.

While a not a few think this is ill-conceived, others believe that Nigerian workers have always been held in low esteem by every successive government, where their emoluments and welfare are concerned.

Buhari's Purported Largess

Before the Buhari administration, the minimum wage of Nigerian workers was an abysmal N18,000 monthly.

The perceptible quantum leap from N18,000 to N30,000 under Buhari, didn't elicit the expected excitement and celebration from either the workers or the masses. This is for the simple reasons that even the N30,000 couldn't take Nigerian workers home, given the spiralling inflation that had set in, and the fact that most State Governors bluntly refused to pay the stipulated set amount.

To this day, many State Governors still pay their workers less than the stipulated N30,000. The few State Governors who agreed to pay, more often than not, owe their workers many months in areas, giving rise and opening the floodgate for further agitations.

Average Minimum Wages in Other African Countries

Comparatively, Nigeria occupies the lowest position on the minimum wage scale of African countries.

It is clear from this available data, that Nigeria embarrassingly romances the lowest rung on the minimum wage ladder of Africa. What could be responsible for this?

1. Lack of will power of the Government, to prioritise workers wages and welfare.

2. Failure or incapacitation of the Federal Government, to compel State Governments to implement the stipulated wages.

3. Inability of most States to mobilise adequate resources from Internally Generated Revenue to beef up their Federal allocations and meet up with their monthly wage bills.

4. Politicisation of the workers salaries and welfare.

5. The worrisome and unfathomable volume of ghost workers in the Federal and State Civil Service.

6. Unavailability of adequate or reliable data of workers in Government employ at all levels, giving rise to bloated figures of workers and their salaries. Instances abound at all levels of government, where retired Civil Servants continue to collect their full salaries many years after retirement.

7. There are also countless instances where dead civil servants' names continue to be paid their full salaries.

Recommendations

There must concerted efforts of Government at all levels to ramp up revenues (especially IGR), without necessarily imposing heavy taxes on the hapless citizenry. This is one sure way to ensure that Government has adequate resources at its disposal to upwardly review salaries, with the ability and capacity to pay.

Carry out an onsite and forensic audit of Government staff at all levels, to determine the exact number of employees on Government payroll.

Why Fix Minimum Wage?

The objective of minimum wage fixing, as set out in ILO Minimum Wage Fixing Convention, 1970 (No.131) and its accompanying Recommendation No. 135, is to give wage-earners the necessary social protection, in terms of minimum permissible levels of wages. This objective was already implicitly or explicitly contained in previous ILO Convention No.26 and Recommendation No. 30 (applicable to trades) and Convention No.

99 and Recommendation No. 89 (applicable to agriculture), which stipulated that the minimum wage should not be fixed at a lower rate than one which would ensure the subsistence of the worker and his/her family. Minimum wages along with other measures of economic and social policy, aim at reducing poverty and meeting basic needs. Minimum wage fixing alone cannot succeed, without the satisfaction of the minimum needs of all workers.

What Should Determine Minimum Wage

The main criteria for determining minimum wage, according to a study by ILO, are job evaluation, government order, ability to pay (on the part of the employers), cost of living, collective bargaining and the effort of labour unions, the going rate of wages and salaries paid for comparable work by other institutions in the labour market.

The ILO Report also pointed out that: 'The cost of living is hardly factored in minimum wage in Nigeria, in that the huge cost of living requirements in cities like Lagos is not the same as in Gombe, Ebonyi, Edo and Ondo States, and minimum wage is usually fixed at the same level for all States.

Conclusion

While one agrees that it is the right of workers to reasonable wage increase, they lack the right to fix the percentage of increase as is presently the case where the NLC is demanding N615,000 as the minimum salary for a Nigerian worker.

Should the deadline of two weeks not be met by the Government, a strike is imminent, and consequent negotiation could result in some upward review, which may not be up to the N615,000 being demanded by labour.",thisdaylive.com,news,THISDAYLIVE,,-0.0117647058823529,453339587,10,https://global.ariseplay.com/amg/www.thisdaylive.com/uploads/Screenshot_13-5-2024_185043_.jpeg,eng-9565294

But rather than make the difficult decisions needed to reverse the European Union's industrial decline, leaders have often settled for the status quo. Some populist leaders even oppose plans to modernise Europe's industrial base - effectively deceiving the public in the process.

Europe's manufacturing sector has faced a series of unprecedented challenges in recent years. The Covid-19 pandemic and the Ukraine war laid bare Europe's reliance on others for critical goods and dealt serious blows to manufacturing by disrupting supply chains and triggering energy and cost-of-living crises.

The embrace of short-termism by corporations - reflected in their preference for dividends and share buybacks over reinvestment of profits - has further undermined the EU manufacturing sector's dynamism and resilience. Compounding all these challenges is the biggest crisis of them all - climate change - which is generating rapidly increasing financial and human costs.

The impact on European industry is already apparent. In 2022, the EU's trade deficit reached a staggering €432 billion ($465 billion), driven by both higher spending on energy imports and manufacturing losses linked to the energy crisis. In February 2024, industrial production fell by 6.4 per cent in the euro area and by 5.4 per cent in the EU year on year.

Unless the EU reverses its industrial decline, Europeans could end up without industries that have, for decades, provided quality jobs to countless workers, who gained not only economic security, but also a sense of purpose, community, and identity. And it is not at all clear how that void would be filled.

The world's other major economic powers are already committed to industrial modernisation. Two decades of aggressive industrial strategy have given China a dominant position in most of the clean-technology supply chains. Recently, the United States has responded with an industrial policy of its own, the CHIPS and Science Act and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). If European industries are to remain competitive in this environment - and if Europe is to achieve its goal of ""strategic autonomy"" - the EU will have to follow suit.

The good news is that we already have a roadmap for sustainable industrial modernization: the European Green Deal, a wide-ranging set of policies aimed at transforming the EU into a modern, resource-efficient, and competitive economy. Unfortunately, it hardly represents an easy fix, and we are a long way from delivering on it. To get there, European policymakers will have to deliver unprecedented levels of investment fast and ensure that industries and workers in all member states are included.

The Green Deal's investment demands are considerable. With electricity consumption projected to rise by around 60 per cent by 2030, the European Commission estimates that €584 billion will be needed this decade to modernise our grid alone. This calls for a comprehensive EU-wide investment strategy that both sustains existing heavy industry and incentivizes clean-tech innovation.

For nearly 20 years, the EU has favored the emissions-trading ""stick"" over carrots, or positive incentives for decarbonisation. To be sure, the European Emissions Trading System - which effectively establishes a carbon price by forcing companies to acquire enough permits, or ""allowances,"" to cover their carbon dioxide emissions - has helped to curb emissions from electricity generation. But it has also increased pressure on European industry's competitiveness - pressure that the IRA is now compounding.

Europe has attempted to ease that pressure through carbon border taxes and foreign subsidy regulation. But these are partial measures. EU leaders must go much further, devising a broader industrial strategy that both addresses investment shortfalls and mitigates the risks associated with the production of more expensive net-zero goods in a fiercely competitive global market.

Unfortunately, the EU's new fiscal rules - agreed by the European Parliament and Council in February - will undermine the bloc's ability to invest in green technology and industrial upgrading, and deepen disparities among member states. According to research by the European Trade Union Confederation, only three countries (Denmark, Ireland, and Sweden) can meet their social- and green-investment needs under the EU's new fiscal rules. To bridge the gap across the rest of the EU, an additional €300-420 billion annually will be needed. If that funding is not delivered, the EU's internal market risks fragmentation, which would accelerate deindustrialisation.

Moreover, support for working communities - provided through strong social conditionalities on all public-funding, public-procurement, and lead-market initiatives - is needed to boost economic growth, create jobs, and protect the environment, all of which is essential to win public trust. Exceptional times demand innovative solutions, not more of the same failed policies. Approaches like austerity, labour-market flexibilisation, and privatisation will only exacerbate the problems we face.

Similarly, short-sighted populism is no substitute for the holistic industrial strategy Europe needs to match those of its competitors - an approach that accounts for all dimensions of the challenges ahead. For example, a one-dimensional focus on strict environmental criteria risks producing unaffordable green products, which would stall progress in electric vehicles and other critical industries.

The choices we make in the coming years will determine whether European industry - integral to the EU's social fabric - has a long-term future. That is why the next European Parliament must make implementing a renewed European Green Deal, complemented by initiatives to bolster industry and attract broad public support, a top priority. @Project Syndicate, 2024",omanobserver.om,news,Oman Observer,,-0.1764705882352942,453325970,4,https://www.omanobserver.om/omanobserver/uploads/images/2024/05/13/thumbs/600x600/2660371.jpg,

I feel a profound sense of urgency. Because more will change in the next five years than in the last thirty.

I'm convinced that the next few years will be some of the most dangerous yet the most transformational our country has ever known.

So the question we face today is this: Who has the clear plan and bold ideas to deliver a secure future for you and your family?

The dangers that threaten our country are real. They are increasing in number. An axis of authoritarian states like Russia, Iran, North Korea, and China is working together to undermine us and our values.

War has returned to Europe, with our NATO allies warning that if Putin succeeds in Ukraine, they might be next.

War rages, too, in the Middle East as Israel defends itself not only against the terrorists of Hamas but a barrage of missiles fired - for the first time - directly from Iran.

Right now in Africa, conflicts are being fought in 18 different countries. And Putin's recklessness has taken us closer to a dangerous nuclear escalation than at any point since the Cuban missile crisis.

These are not faraway problems. Iranian proxies are firing on British ships in the Red Sea, disrupting goods destined for our high streets.

Here at home, China has conducted cyber targeting of our democratically elected MPs. Russia has poisoned people with chemical weapons.

And when Putin cut off the gas supplies it had a devastating impact on people's lives and threatened our energy security.

And in this world of greater conflict and danger, 100 million people are now displaced globally.

Countries like Russia are weaponising immigration for their own ends, and criminal gangs keep finding new routes across European borders.

Illegal migration is placing an intolerable strain on our security and our sense of fairness, and unless we act now and act boldly this problem is only going to grow.

Extremists are also exploiting these global conflicts to divide us.

People are abusing our liberal democratic values - the freedom of speech and right of protest - to intimidate, threaten and assault others, to sing antisemitic chants on our streets and our university campuses, and to weaponise the evils of anti-Semitism or anti-Muslim hatred in a divisive, ideological attempt to set Briton against Briton.

And from gender activists hijacking children's sex education to cancel culture, vocal and aggressive fringe groups are trying to impose their views on the rest of us.

They're trying to make it morally unacceptable to believe something different and undermine people's confidence and pride in our own history and identity.

But for all the dangers ahead, few are felt more acutely than people's sense of financial insecurity. We've been pounded by a series of once-in-a-generation shocks.

The worst international financial crisis since the great depression in the 1930s. The first global pandemic since the Spanish flu in 1918.

The biggest energy shock since the 1970s. Global forces, yet they are hitting our living standards here at home.

We must be prepared strategically, economically, with robust plans and greater national resilience, to meet this time of instability with strength.

And people's sense of insecurity is only heightened by the fears about new technologies like AI.

When the IMF says 40% of jobs could be affected, or hundreds of leading experts say the risks could be on a par with pandemics or nuclear war, and when children are exposed to bullying, sexualised content or even self-harm online, people want to know they've got someone in charge who understands these dangers, because only if you understand what is happening can you be trusted to keep us safe.

But the paradox of our age is that for all the profound dangers we face, right now, we also hold in our hands an opportunity for human progress that could surpass the industrial revolution in speed and breadth.

Technologies like AI will do for the 21st century what the steam engine and electricity did for the 19th.

They'll accelerate human progress by complementing what we do, by speeding up the discovery of new ideas, and by assisting almost every aspect of human life.

Think of the investment they will bring, the jobs they'll create, and the increase in all our living standards they'll deliver.

Credible estimates suggest AI alone could double our productivity in the next decade.

And in doing so, help us create a world of less suffering, more freedom, choice, and opportunity.

Just imagine. Every child in school with their own personalised tutor, and every teacher free to spend more time personally developing each student.

New frontiers in medical diagnostics where a single picture of your eyes can not only detect blindness but predict other diseases like heart attacks or Parkinson's.

And counterintuitive as it may seem, throughout human history, the greatest breakthroughs of science and learning have so often come at the moments of greatest danger.

The first electronic digital computers were developed by British codebreakers in the Second World War. Solar technology went from powering pocket calculators to a viable commercial technology following the energy crisis of the 1970s.

The fastest development, and deployment, of a vaccine in history came during the Covid pandemic.

And so it is incumbent upon us to make this a period not just of great danger, but great progress, too.

That's why we launched a bold plan to make science and technology our new national purpose.

We're rightly proud of Britain's spirit of discovery and entrepreneurship made us the leading country in the industrial revolution.

But we can be just as proud, just as confident, just as optimistic about our future, and our prospects to lead again in this new industrial age.

And doing so will enrich our lives and create good, well-paid jobs in the growth industries of the future here at home.

At the same time, new and fast-growing economic superpowers like India, Indonesia, and Nigeria are significantly reshaping the global economy.

And just as this ever more interconnected world creates new dangers, it also creates new possibilities.

The United Kingdom is uniquely placed to benefit. We've always been an open, trading, maritime nation; and Brexit has given us the opportunity to trade even more.

And we invent, discover, and produce new products and services that the world wants to buy.

From aircraft wings in Filton, to financial services in Glasgow, to incredible cultural exports like film, music, and TV, or sports like the Premier League.

Everywhere from rural Kenya to the cityscapes of South Korea, people stay up all times of day and night to watch their favourite British team.

It's no wonder that Brexit Britain has leapt above France, Japan, and the Netherlands to become the world's fourth biggest exporter.

And the more we export, the better our businesses will do, the more jobs we will create, the more wealth we will generate - right across our country.

This is the opportunity before us. A world transformed by technological progress. Huge global markets hungry for new talent, goods, and services. You can see it all around us.

Two brothers from Merseyside sat around their kitchen table and built Castore a £1bn sportswear business taking on global giants like Nike and Adidas, their kit now worn by Red Bull Formula 1 and Bayer Leverkusen.

British companies and workers right across the country are pioneering offshore wind and exporting it around the world. Already, we've built the first floating offshore wind farm.

And our innovations have helped reduce the cost of wind energy by around two-thirds, and increased the size of turbines to the equivalent of the Eiffel Tower with blades bigger than Big Ben.

And you can see the opportunity too in healthcare, giving people longer, healthier lives. In Denmark, NovoNordisk created the Ozempic drug which is not only helping to tackle chronic disease globally, but singlehandedly grew Denmark's entire economy last year.

All this progress should show us that while this is one of the most dangerous periods we've ever known, it will also be one of the most transformational.

And if we make the right choices, if we have a bold enough vision, then we should feel confidence, pride, and optimism that Britain's future is secure.

My point is this: our country stands at a crossroads. Over the next few years, from our democracy to our society to our economy - to the hardest questions of war and peace - almost every aspect of our lives is going to change.

How we act in the face of these changes - not only to keep people safe and secure but to realise the opportunities too, will determine whether or not Britain will succeed in the years to come.

In the last 14 years, we've made progress in the most difficult conditions any governments has faced since the Second World War.

A world leading economy, we've seen the 3rd highest growth rate in the G7, and created 4 million jobs, 800 a day.

We took difficult decisions to restore our country's financial security and control national debt, and that allowed us to support the country through Covid, deliver the fastest vaccine roll-out in the world, provide record funding to the NHS, and protect state pensions with the triple lock.

We've reformed welfare by capping benefits and introducing Universal Credit to help people into work.

We've reduced absolute poverty, pensioner poverty, child poverty. We've cut carbon emissions by a third.

Maintained our position as NATO's second biggest defence power. Halved violent and neighbourhood crime. And improved standards in our schools with English schoolchildren not just the best readers in the UK, but in the western world.

We've legislated for equal marriage. And it is now not even surprising for people from ethnically diverse backgrounds to lead Scotland, Wales, and the United Kingdom.

And the economy now decisively has momentum. Inflation down from over 11% to 3%. Wages rising faster than prices.

And in the first quarter of this year, we grew faster than France, Germany, Japan, Italy, and even America.

The plan is working - so we must stick to it, and not go back to square one.

Because at heart, we're a nation of optimists. We're not blind to the challenges or threats that we face.

We just have an innate belief that whatever they are, we can overcome them, as we have done so many times in our history. And create a secure future for you and your family.

Let me tell you more about my vision for how I would lead this country through this time of danger and transformation.

We've proudly taken the generational decision to increase defence spending to a new baseline of 2.5% of GDP, by 2030. Yet Labour have refused to match our pledge.

The global displacement of a hundred million people is a new and defining challenge of our age. But we can and will protect ourselves against illegal migration.

That's why we're pioneering the Rwanda scheme. And so, when people see that if they come here illegally, they will be swiftly detained and removed, they will be deterred from making that perilous journey, stopping the boats and saving thousands of lives.

I know that our international frameworks are outdated. So there may be flashpoints ahead with the ECHR.

And if the Strasbourg Court make me choose between the ECHR and this country's security, I will choose our country's security every single time.

And nor will I ever compromise on defending our values, our history, and our way of life, against those who seek to undermine them.

I am unapologetically proud of who we are.

And under my leadership, ours will be a country where people can disagree in good faith, but where they must do so with respect and decency for others.

A country where the benefits of belonging to our Union are self-evident to the overwhelming majority of our people.

A country where we protect and strengthen the greatest institution of all - the family, better protect children from the harms of the online and offline worlds, and do more to protect single sex spaces.

A country where we celebrate the small acts of kindness that bind our society together, and where we actively work to rebuild the civic involvement and pride that have always formed part of our distinctive national culture.

A country where we honour those prepared to pay the highest price for our freedoms, as we make this the best place in the world to be a veteran here at home.

And a country where we properly respect the older generation.

They've contributed all their lives, so whatever the triple lock costs, it is morally right to give older people dignity and comfort in retirement.

But as well as strengthening our national security and restoring pride in our national culture, we'll also protect you from the dangers of a more unstable world by giving you greater peace of mind over your financial security.

People have been struggling to make ends meet - I know that. In the last few years, you've seen rising energy bills, mortgage rates, the cost of the weekly shop.

And I hope I've shown through my time in office that, from furlough to support with your energy bills, the government I lead will always be there for you.

But that's only possible if we take the tough decisions to strengthen the country's finances and control debt.

You can trust me to do that.

When I stood for the leadership of my party, and my opponent's policies imperilled our financial strength, I was sooner prepared to lose than abandon what I believe so deeply is right for our country.

I feel the same conviction about Net Zero.

In a more unstable world, where dictators like Putin have held us to ransom over energy prices, I reject the ideological zeal of those who want us to adopt policies that go further, faster than any other country, no matter the cost or disruption to people's lives.

But even as we strengthen our security and our sense of pride and confidence in ourselves, I also feel a sense of urgency about readying our country to succeed in a world transformed.

That starts by giving all our young people - wherever they live and whatever their background - the skills and knowledge to succeed.

Building on the success of the last 14 years, we will create a truly world-class education system.

The Advanced British Standard is the most far-reaching reform to education for 16-18 year olds in a generation.

We're tearing down the artificial barriers between technical and academic education.

Increasing children's time in the classroom.

Studying a greater breadth of subjects to match our competitors.

And unapologetically saying that every single child must leave school not just literate but numerate as well.

Now, I know this will not win universal acclaim but maths will be fundamental to our children's life chances in this new technological age.

And it is our duty to give them those skills. And more. We'll end rip-off degrees and massively expand the number of apprenticeships, because a degree is not the only path to success in the modern economy.

And we'll make sure that everyone has the funding they need to retrain or learn new skills, at any point in their lives, because in the future education won't stop when you walk out of the school gates.

But for Britain to finish first in today's world, we don't just need the skills to succeed, we need to create a dynamic, innovative economy fuelled by technological progress, so we lead in the industries of the future and help you and your family become wealthier and more economically secure.

The government I lead is creating the conditions for a new British dynamism. By investing in the new infrastructure of the future - not just roads, railways, and buses, but gigabit broadband, research and development, computing power.

By helping to create hundreds of thousands of good, secure, well-paid, highly-skilled jobs, that will level up opportunity right across our country.

And yes, by taking the necessary decisions to build the right homes in the right places to support those jobs.

But true British dynamism won't come from the State alone. It will come from you. It will come from the ingenuity and creativity of the British people, given the support, the opportunities and the rewards to have, pursue and realise big ambitions.

If you have a brilliant new idea - I want you to build it. If you're passionate about solving a problem - I want you to pursue it.

If you simply want to set up on your own - I want you to get out there and do it.

Because you won't find the future written in a slide deck in a Whitehall quango.

You'll find it out there in our country.

And so the government I lead will create the conditions for people themselves to try, to build, to invent - yes, sometimes to fail, but more often to succeed.

That's why we're cutting taxes directly on investment. It's why we're cutting taxes to encourage innovation.

And it's why we're seizing the freedom and flexibility of Brexit. Because so often, the EU's default approach was top down, precautionary regulation.

Whereas we in the UK now have the chance to be more agile, so that rather than stifling innovation and growth, we encourage it, in everything from financial services to agriculture, from healthcare to house building.

Above all, we will reward hard work.

Because you don't get anything in life without hard work.

So we're making the tax system simpler, fairer, and more rewarding, cutting National Insurance by £900 for the average worker, alongside increasing the state pension by £900 this year.

We're raising the National Living Wage to end low pay.

And we're reforming welfare to make sure that work always pays, and our safety net is fair to those who pay for it.

Not least because giving people support to get off welfare and into work gives them purpose, dignity and hope and it is also the only sustainable way to cut legal migration.

And that's how we'll transform public services, too.

Imagine a welfare system where new technologies allow us to crack down on the fraudsters, exploiting the hardworking taxpayers who fund it.

Imagine the huge opportunities to cut crime through technologies like live facial recognition, helping police catch wanted criminals, find missing people, and spend more time on the beat.

And imagine our NHS, still free at the point of use, but transformed for the future.

A service staffed by tens of thousands more doctors and nurses, thanks to our Long Term Workforce Plan.

Backed by record funding made possible by years of fiscal discipline. With far greater choice over where you can receive your care, made as simple as choosing what to watch on iPlayer.

And I believe there will be no more powerful example of what all the forces of British dynamism, innovation, scientific discovery and technological progress can achieve, than this:

To address, finally, the fear of one word that still lurks in the back of everyone's minds, that touches almost every family in our country, and that envelopes our whole world, if we or a loved one hears it: cancer.

Yet even here, if we are bold enough, there can be cause for new hope. We already know we can prevent most lung cancer cases - the UK's leading cause of cancer deaths - by stopping smoking.

That's why I took the important decision to create a smokefree generation.

And with huge breakthroughs in early diagnosis and new treatments, like the MRNA vaccine for skin cancer, I believe we can be just as bold and ambitious in improving rates of cancer survival.

Because if we can bring together my vision of a country transformed, with our world class education system that trains the PhD oncologists and apprentice lab technicians, and our dynamic economy that attracts investors and incubates the billion-pound biotech businesses of the future, our post-Brexit regulatory freedoms to approve trials in a safe but faster way.

And the scale of our NHS to help us research and trial those new drugs in a way no other country can, then just one example of the incredible achievements this country can make would be to make a generational breakthrough against this cruel disease and fundamentally change what it will mean for our children and grandchildren to hear the word cancer.

Today I've set out my vision for how Britain can succeed in one of the most dangerous yet transformational eras we've ever known.

The values that lie behind that vision are a new patriotism: a confidence in ourselves and in all that we can achieve.

I reject those who insidiously question our history and our identity.

I believe in that innate confidence in ourselves that has always run through our island story.

And just as we're proud of all that we created, invented, and discovered in our past, so we can be confident and optimistic about what we will achieve in our future.

My pledge to you is that I will create the conditions to make that possible, to help you fulfil your ambitions.

To build the world-class education system that gives our children the skills they need to succeed, no matter where they started off in life.

To create the dynamic, innovative economy that will give you the opportunity of a wealthier, more financially secure life for you and your family.

To restore our sense of civic pride and national cohesion so we can be secure in the knowledge that we are all on the same side.

And above all, you can trust me to keep you and your family safe and secure from the threats we face at home and abroad.

Because with bold action and a clear plan, we can and we will create a secure future.",foreignaffairs.co.nz,news,foreignaffairs.co.nz,Mil-Osi Publisher,-0.06666666666666665,453306350,4,,

There's a big auger in the tube that lifted coal from barges, and which could be used to lift other dry goods.

New Hampshire's two coal-fired power plants in Bow and Newmarket look similar to the passer-by with their aging industrial buildings, rail lines and smokestacks. But as both places prepare to transition from burning coal to hosting fleets of batteries and solar panels, there's one big difference: The waterway on which they sit.

Merrimack Station in Bow was built alongside the Merrimack River, whose water is useful for cooling but not for transport because dams in Manchester and in Lowell and Lawrence, Mass., block boats from coming upstream.

Schiller Station in Newington, however, is on the Piscataqua River, a tidal river open to the ocean. The owner of both sites, Granite Shore Power, says this gives Schiller great value in the field of offshore wind power.

Before that, Schiller will become a force in the new and growing energy field of utility-scale batteries.

The plan from Granite Shore Power calls for the current pile of coal to be replaced by the state's biggest battery array, capable of storing and releasing up to 150 megawatts of electricity for as much as two hours to help stabilize the grid and maximize benefit from variable renewables. The array could be running in as little as two years, depending mostly on regulatory issues.

Plans for Merrimack Station in Bow, which sits on 343 acres, call for a similar battery array and also a large solar farm to be built as it ends its role as a coal-fired plant by 2028. Both sites are valuable because they have existing connections to the power grid; creating such connections at new sites can lead to years-long delays.

Schiller Generating Station sits on about 81 acres, and only a few will be used by the batteries. That leaves plenty of room for other facilities, which brings us back to the Piscataqua River.

The entrance road to Schiller Station shows it's real value - not the rusting smokestacks and dilapidated power plant, but the connection to the region's power grid and the rail line.

Although it's close to picturesque Portsmouth, this section of the Piscataqua has long been industrial. The Newmarket gas-fired power plant, also owned by Granite Shore Power, is adjacent.

Coal has been brought to Schiller Station by waterway since the plant opened in 1949, unloaded by a huge auger and crane that now stands idle on a dock. Schiller hasn't operated as a coal-fired power plant since 2020 and never will again, and the question is how to make best use of the port facilities, especially since the river here can handle ships with a draft of 35 feet, making it a legitimate deep-water port.

Granite Shore President Jim Andrews explained what that means to state lawmakers, local officials and interested folks who gathered at Schiller on Wednesday to learn about future plans as part of the annual New Hampshire Energy Week.

The East Coast, Andrews said, lacks the giant ports that can handle all the huge machinery and infrastructure needed to build and maintain offshore wind farms, with the exception of Norfolk, Va,, ""and I don't think the Navy is going to give that up."" As a result, he said, the work must be divvied up among many smaller ports, and that can include Newmarket.

Andrews said this idea has been part of the vision for the site since Granite Shore Power bought Schiller and Merrimack Station six years ago. He talked about a trip to Denmark in 2018 to learn about Europe's offshore wind industry to see how it could translate to New England. ""We were clearly ahead of the curve. Policy and the markets were not quite ready,"" he commented, a wry reflection on how the United States did little with offshore energy for years, leaving us far behind Europe.

That delay is finally starting to end. In recent years, support from the Biden administration has gotten offshore wind started. A 1,200-megawatt farm, Vineyard Wind 2, is under construction south of Nantucket, and the process of leasing offshore wind in the Gulf of Maine going ahead.

That provides opportunities for ports on New Hampshire's small ocean coastline to provide materials or logistics for what will be a billion-dollar industry, creating jobs and tax revenue, Andrews said: ""We can help make wind power a reality in New Hampshire.""",granitegeek.concordmonitor.com,news,Granite Geek,David Brooks,0.1529411764705881,453305762,1,https://granitegeek.concordmonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/crane-at-schiller-scaled.jpg,

[Please note political content redacted here.]

I feel a profound sense of urgency. Because more will change in the next five years than in the last thirty.

I'm convinced that the next few years will be some of the most dangerous yet the most transformational our country has ever known.

So the question we face today is this: Who has the clear plan and bold ideas to deliver a secure future for you and your family?

The dangers that threaten our country are real. They are increasing in number. An axis of authoritarian states like Russia, Iran, North Korea, and China is working together to undermine us and our values.

War has returned to Europe, with our NATO allies warning that if Putin succeeds in Ukraine, they might be next.

War rages, too, in the Middle East as Israel defends itself not only against the terrorists of Hamas but a barrage of missiles fired - for the first time - directly from Iran.

Right now in Africa, conflicts are being fought in 18 different countries. And Putin's recklessness has taken us closer to a dangerous nuclear escalation than at any point since the Cuban missile crisis.

These are not faraway problems. Iranian proxies are firing on British ships in the Red Sea, disrupting goods destined for our high streets.

Here at home, China has conducted cyber targeting of our democratically elected MPs. Russia has poisoned people with chemical weapons.

And when Putin cut off the gas supplies it had a devastating impact on people's lives and threatened our energy security.

And in this world of greater conflict and danger, 100 million people are now displaced globally.

Countries like Russia are weaponising immigration for their own ends, and criminal gangs keep finding new routes across European borders.

And from gender activists hijacking children's sex education to cancel culture, vocal and aggressive fringe groups are trying to impose their views on the rest of us.

They're trying to make it morally unacceptable to believe something different and undermine people's confidence and pride in our own history and identity.

[Please note political content redacted here.]

We've proudly taken the generational decision to increase defence spending to a new baseline of 2.5% of GDP, by 2030. Yet Labour have refused to match our pledge.

[Please note political content redacted here.]

The global displacement of a hundred million people is a new and defining challenge of our age. But we can and will protect ourselves against illegal migration.

[Please note political content redacted here.]

That's why we're pioneering the Rwanda scheme. And so, when people see that if they come here illegally, they will be swiftly detained and removed, they will be deterred from making that perilous journey, stopping the boats and saving thousands of lives.

I know that our international frameworks are outdated. So there may be flashpoints ahead with the ECHR.

And if the Strasbourg Court make me choose between the ECHR and this country's security, I will choose our country's security every single time.

And nor will I ever compromise on defending our values, our history, and our way of life, against those who seek to undermine them.

I am unapologetically proud of who we are.

And under my leadership, ours will be a country where people can disagree in good faith, but where they must do so with respect and decency for others.

A country where the benefits of belonging to our Union are self-evident to the overwhelming majority of our people.

A country where we protect and strengthen the greatest institution of all - the family, better protect children from the harms of the online and offline worlds, and do more to protect single sex spaces.

A country where we celebrate the small acts of kindness that bind our society together, and where we actively work to rebuild the civic involvement and pride that have always formed part of our distinctive national culture.

A country where we honour those prepared to pay the highest price for our freedoms, as we make this the best place in the world to be a veteran here at home.

And a country where we properly respect the older generation.

They've contributed all their lives, so whatever the triple lock costs, it is morally right to give older people dignity and comfort in retirement.

But as well as strengthening our national security and restoring pride in our national culture, we'll also protect you from the dangers of a more unstable world by giving you greater peace of mind over your financial security.

People have been struggling to make ends meet - I know that. In the last few years, you've seen rising energy bills, mortgage rates, the cost of the weekly shop.

And I hope I've shown through my time in office that, from furlough to support with your energy bills, the government I lead will always be there for you.

But that's only possible if we take the tough decisions to strengthen the country's finances and control debt.

You can trust me to do that.

When I stood for the leadership of my party, and my opponent's policies imperilled our financial strength, I was sooner prepared to lose than abandon what I believe so deeply is right for our country.

I feel the same conviction about Net Zero.

In a more unstable world, where dictators like Putin have held us to ransom over energy prices, I reject the ideological zeal of those who want us to adopt policies that go further, faster than any other country, no matter the cost or disruption to people's lives.

[Please note political content redacted here.]

But even as we strengthen our security and our sense of pride and confidence in ourselves, I also feel a sense of urgency about readying our country to succeed in a world transformed.

That starts by giving all our young people - wherever they live and whatever their background - the skills and knowledge to succeed.

Building on the success of the last 14 years, we will create a truly world-class education system.

The Advanced British Standard is the most far-reaching reform to education for 16-18 year olds in a generation.

We're tearing down the artificial barriers between technical and academic education.

Increasing children's time in the classroom.

Studying a greater breadth of subjects to match our competitors.

And unapologetically saying that every single child must leave school not just literate but numerate as well.

Now, I know this will not win universal acclaim but maths will be fundamental to our children's life chances in this new technological age.

And it is our duty to give them those skills. And more. We'll end rip-off degrees and massively expand the number of apprenticeships, because a degree is not the only path to success in the modern economy.

And we'll make sure that everyone has the funding they need to retrain or learn new skills, at any point in their lives, because in the future education won't stop when you walk out of the school gates.

But for Britain to finish first in today's world, we don't just need the skills to succeed, we need to create a dynamic, innovative economy fuelled by technological progress, so we lead in the industries of the future and help you and your family become wealthier and more economically secure.

The government I lead is creating the conditions for a new British dynamism. By investing in the new infrastructure of the future - not just roads, railways, and buses, but gigabit broadband, research and development, computing power.

By helping to create hundreds of thousands of good, secure, well-paid, highly-skilled jobs, that will level up opportunity right across our country.

And yes, by taking the necessary decisions to build the right homes in the right places to support those jobs.

But true British dynamism won't come from the State alone. It will come from you. It will come from the ingenuity and creativity of the British people, given the support, the opportunities and the rewards to have, pursue and realise big ambitions.

If you have a brilliant new idea - I want you to build it. If you're passionate about solving a problem - I want you to pursue it.

If you simply want to set up on your own - I want you to get out there and do it.

Because you won't find the future written in a slide deck in a Whitehall quango.

You'll find it out there in our country.

And so the government I lead will create the conditions for people themselves to try, to build, to invent - yes, sometimes to fail, but more often to succeed.

That's why we're cutting taxes directly on investment. It's why we're cutting taxes to encourage innovation.

And it's why we're seizing the freedom and flexibility of Brexit. Because so often, the EU's default approach was top down, precautionary regulation.

Whereas we in the UK now have the chance to be more agile, so that rather than stifling innovation and growth, we encourage it, in everything from financial services to agriculture, from healthcare to house building.

Above all, we will reward hard work.

Because you don't get anything in life without hard work.

So we're making the tax system simpler, fairer, and more rewarding, cutting National Insurance by £900 for the average worker, alongside increasing the state pension by £900 this year.

We're raising the National Living Wage to end low pay.

And we're reforming welfare to make sure that work always pays, and our safety net is fair to those who pay for it.

Not least because giving people support to get off welfare and into work gives them purpose, dignity and hope and it is also the only sustainable way to cut legal migration.

A world-class education system.

A dynamic, innovative economy.

Hard work valued and rewarded.

That's how Britain will succeed in future.

That's how we'll grow the economy.

And that's how we'll transform public services, too.

Imagine a welfare system where new technologies allow us to crack down on the fraudsters, exploiting the hardworking taxpayers who fund it.

Imagine the huge opportunities to cut crime through technologies like live facial recognition, helping police catch wanted criminals, find missing people, and spend more time on the beat.

And imagine our NHS, still free at the point of use, but transformed for the future.

A service staffed by tens of thousands more doctors and nurses, thanks to our Long Term Workforce Plan.

Backed by record funding made possible by years of fiscal discipline. With far greater choice over where you can receive your care, made as simple as choosing what to watch on iPlayer.

And I believe there will be no more powerful example of what all the forces of British dynamism, innovation, scientific discovery and technological progress can achieve, than this:

To address, finally, the fear of one word that still lurks in the back of everyone's minds, that touches almost every family in our country, and that envelopes our whole world, if we or a loved one hears it: cancer.

Yet even here, if we are bold enough, there can be cause for new hope. We already know we can prevent most lung cancer cases - the UK's leading cause of cancer deaths - by stopping smoking.

That's why I took the important decision to create a smokefree generation.

And with huge breakthroughs in early diagnosis and new treatments, like the MRNA vaccine for skin cancer, I believe we can be just as bold and ambitious in improving rates of cancer survival.

Because if we can bring together my vision of a country transformed, with our world class education system that trains the PhD oncologists and apprentice lab technicians, and our dynamic economy that attracts investors and incubates the billion-pound biotech businesses of the future, our post-Brexit regulatory freedoms to approve trials in a safe but faster way.

And the scale of our NHS to help us research and trial those new drugs in a way no other country can, then just one example of the incredible achievements this country can make would be to make a generational breakthrough against this cruel disease and fundamentally change what it will mean for our children and grandchildren to hear the word cancer.

Today I've set out my vision for how Britain can succeed in one of the most dangerous yet transformational eras we've ever known.

The values that lie behind that vision are a new patriotism: a confidence in ourselves and in all that we can achieve.

[Please note political content redacted here.]

I reject those who insidiously question our history and our identity.

I believe in that innate confidence in ourselves that has always run through our island story.

And just as we're proud of all that we created, invented, and discovered in our past, so we can be confident and optimistic about what we will achieve in our future.

My pledge to you is that I will create the conditions to make that possible, to help you fulfil your ambitions.

To build the world-class education system that gives our children the skills they need to succeed, no matter where they started off in life.

To create the dynamic, innovative economy that will give you the opportunity of a wealthier, more financially secure life for you and your family.

To restore our sense of civic pride and national cohesion so we can be secure in the knowledge that we are all on the same side.

And above all, you can trust me to keep you and your family safe and secure from the threats we face at home and abroad.

There are storms ahead.

The dangers are all too real.

But Britain can feel proud again.

Britain can feel confident again.

Because with bold action and a clear plan, we can and we will create a secure future.

I feel a profound sense of urgency. Because more will change in the next five years than in the last thirty.

I'm convinced that the next few years will be some of the most dangerous yet the most transformational our country has ever known.

So the question we face today is this: Who has the clear plan and bold ideas to deliver a secure future for you and your family?

The dangers that threaten our country are real. They are increasing in number. An axis of authoritarian states like Russia, Iran, North Korea, and China is working together to undermine us and our values.

War has returned to Europe, with our NATO allies warning that if Putin succeeds in Ukraine, they might be next.

War rages, too, in the Middle East as Israel defends itself not only against the terrorists of Hamas but a barrage of missiles fired - for the first time - directly from Iran.

Right now in Africa, conflicts are being fought in 18 different countries. And Putin's recklessness has taken us closer to a dangerous nuclear escalation than at any point since the Cuban missile crisis.

These are not faraway problems. Iranian proxies are firing on British ships in the Red Sea, disrupting goods destined for our high streets.

Here at home, China has conducted cyber targeting of our democratically elected MPs. Russia has poisoned people with chemical weapons.

And when Putin cut off the gas supplies it had a devastating impact on people's lives and threatened our energy security.

And in this world of greater conflict and danger, 100 million people are now displaced globally.

Countries like Russia are weaponising immigration for their own ends, and criminal gangs keep finding new routes across European borders.

Illegal migration is placing an intolerable strain on our security and our sense of fairness, and unless we act now and act boldly this problem is only going to grow.

Extremists are also exploiting these global conflicts to divide us.

People are abusing our liberal democratic values - the freedom of speech and right of protest - to intimidate, threaten and assault others, to sing antisemitic chants on our streets and our university campuses, and to weaponise the evils of anti-Semitism or anti-Muslim hatred in a divisive, ideological attempt to set Briton against Briton.

And from gender activists hijacking children's sex education to cancel culture, vocal and aggressive fringe groups are trying to impose their views on the rest of us.

They're trying to make it morally unacceptable to believe something different and undermine people's confidence and pride in our own history and identity.

But for all the dangers ahead, few are felt more acutely than people's sense of financial insecurity. We've been pounded by a series of once-in-a-generation shocks.

The worst international financial crisis since the great depression in the 1930s. The first global pandemic since the Spanish flu in 1918.

The biggest energy shock since the 1970s. Global forces, yet they are hitting our living standards here at home.

We must be prepared strategically, economically, with robust plans and greater national resilience, to meet this time of instability with strength.

And people's sense of insecurity is only heightened by the fears about new technologies like AI.

When the IMF says 40% of jobs could be affected, or hundreds of leading experts say the risks could be on a par with pandemics or nuclear war, and when children are exposed to bullying, sexualised content or even self-harm online, people want to know they've got someone in charge who understands these dangers, because only if you understand what is happening can you be trusted to keep us safe.

But the paradox of our age is that for all the profound dangers we face, right now, we also hold in our hands an opportunity for human progress that could surpass the industrial revolution in speed and breadth.

Technologies like AI will do for the 21st century what the steam engine and electricity did for the 19th.

They'll accelerate human progress by complementing what we do, by speeding up the discovery of new ideas, and by assisting almost every aspect of human life.

Think of the investment they will bring, the jobs they'll create, and the increase in all our living standards they'll deliver.

Credible estimates suggest AI alone could double our productivity in the next decade.

And in doing so, help us create a world of less suffering, more freedom, choice, and opportunity.

Just imagine. Every child in school with their own personalised tutor, and every teacher free to spend more time personally developing each student.

New frontiers in medical diagnostics where a single picture of your eyes can not only detect blindness but predict other diseases like heart attacks or Parkinson's.

And counterintuitive as it may seem, throughout human history, the greatest breakthroughs of science and learning have so often come at the moments of greatest danger.

The first electronic digital computers were developed by British codebreakers in the Second World War. Solar technology went from powering pocket calculators to a viable commercial technology following the energy crisis of the 1970s.

The fastest development, and deployment, of a vaccine in history came during the Covid pandemic.

And so it is incumbent upon us to make this a period not just of great danger, but great progress, too.

That's why we launched a bold plan to make science and technology our new national purpose.

We're rightly proud of Britain's spirit of discovery and entrepreneurship made us the leading country in the industrial revolution.

But we can be just as proud, just as confident, just as optimistic about our future, and our prospects to lead again in this new industrial age.

And doing so will enrich our lives and create good, well-paid jobs in the growth industries of the future here at home.

At the same time, new and fast-growing economic superpowers like India, Indonesia, and Nigeria are significantly reshaping the global economy.

And just as this ever more interconnected world creates new dangers, it also creates new possibilities.

The United Kingdom is uniquely placed to benefit. We've always been an open, trading, maritime nation; and Brexit has given us the opportunity to trade even more.

And we invent, discover, and produce new products and services that the world wants to buy.

From aircraft wings in Filton, to financial services in Glasgow, to incredible cultural exports like film, music, and TV, or sports like the Premier League.

Everywhere from rural Kenya to the cityscapes of South Korea, people stay up all times of day and night to watch their favourite British team.

It's no wonder that Brexit Britain has leapt above France, Japan, and the Netherlands to become the world's fourth biggest exporter.

And the more we export, the better our businesses will do, the more jobs we will create, the more wealth we will generate - right across our country.

This is the opportunity before us. A world transformed by technological progress. Huge global markets hungry for new talent, goods, and services. You can see it all around us.

Two brothers from Merseyside sat around their kitchen table and built Castore a £1bn sportswear business taking on global giants like Nike and Adidas, their kit now worn by Red Bull Formula 1 and Bayer Leverkusen.

British companies and workers right across the country are pioneering offshore wind and exporting it around the world. Already, we've built the first floating offshore wind farm.

And our innovations have helped reduce the cost of wind energy by around two-thirds, and increased the size of turbines to the equivalent of the Eiffel Tower with blades bigger than Big Ben.

And you can see the opportunity too in healthcare, giving people longer, healthier lives. In Denmark, NovoNordisk created the Ozempic drug which is not only helping to tackle chronic disease globally, but singlehandedly grew Denmark's entire economy last year.

All this progress should show us that while this is one of the most dangerous periods we've ever known, it will also be one of the most transformational.

And if we make the right choices, if we have a bold enough vision, then we should feel confidence, pride, and optimism that Britain's future is secure.

My point is this: our country stands at a crossroads. Over the next few years, from our democracy to our society to our economy - to the hardest questions of war and peace - almost every aspect of our lives is going to change.

How we act in the face of these changes - not only to keep people safe and secure but to realise the opportunities too, will determine whether or not Britain will succeed in the years to come.

In the last 14 years, we've made progress in the most difficult conditions any governments has faced since the Second World War.

A world leading economy, we've seen the 3rd highest growth rate in the G7, and created 4 million jobs, 800 a day.

We took difficult decisions to restore our country's financial security and control national debt, and that allowed us to support the country through Covid, deliver the fastest vaccine roll-out in the world, provide record funding to the NHS, and protect state pensions with the triple lock.

We've reformed welfare by capping benefits and introducing Universal Credit to help people into work.

We've reduced absolute poverty, pensioner poverty, child poverty. We've cut carbon emissions by a third.

Maintained our position as NATO's second biggest defence power. Halved violent and neighbourhood crime. And improved standards in our schools with English schoolchildren not just the best readers in the UK, but in the western world.

We've legislated for equal marriage. And it is now not even surprising for people from ethnically diverse backgrounds to lead Scotland, Wales, and the United Kingdom.

And the economy now decisively has momentum. Inflation down from over 11% to 3%. Wages rising faster than prices.

And in the first quarter of this year, we grew faster than France, Germany, Japan, Italy, and even America.

The plan is working - so we must stick to it, and not go back to square one.

Because at heart, we're a nation of optimists. We're not blind to the challenges or threats that we face.

We just have an innate belief that whatever they are, we can overcome them, as we have done so many times in our history. And create a secure future for you and your family.

Let me tell you more about my vision for how I would lead this country through this time of danger and transformation.

A country where we celebrate the small acts of kindness that bind our society together, and where we actively work to rebuild the civic involvement and pride that have always formed part of our distinctive national culture.

(""JinkoSolar"" or the ""Company"") (NYSE: JKS), one of the largest and most innovative solar module manufacturers in the world, announced today that it has delivered its Tiger Neo modules to a Solar Power Plant in Lobstädt, Germany (The Witznitz Solar Park). The Witznitz Solar Park adds up to 650 MW module capacity in total. JinkoSolar has delivered more than 1.1 million Tiger Neo modules to the site. German insurance group SIGNAL IDUNA, through its affiliate HANSAINVEST Real Assets GmbH, has invested in the project, securing 605 MW and Shell Energy Europe has signed a 15-year Power Purchase Agreement (PPA). Constructed last year by MOVE ON Energy, the facility will be under its operational management.

From 2023 onwards, and for the entire duration of the support period (up to 16 years), the five ""youngest"" offshore wind farms - which can rely on a variable support mechanism based on the established reference price for electricity - will have to make a structural solidarity contribution. This means that when power prices are high, part of the profits will be returned to the government.

All operational offshore wind farms to date have been connected via dedicated links to the onshore grid. However, the transmission system operator has developed a power transmission grid in the Belgian part of the North Sea. With the creation of the Modular Offshore Grid (MOG), wind farms will be connected to a high-voltage substation located on an offshore platform (OSY), which will be connected to the onshore grid. The objectives of the project are to secure transmission of electricity and the security of the grid, to further improve electricity market integration and to minimise the environmental impact of the cables necessary to connect the offshore wind farms.

Offshore wind farms with a financial close date after December 31, 2016 are obliged to connect to the MOG in the North Sea, which has been operational since 2020. The MOG enables security of supply: if one of the offshore cables is defective or malfunctions, the wind farms can continue to inject their energy into the Belgian grid.

Within the Princess Elisabeth Offshore Wind Development Zone, Belgium is planning an artificial energy island. The energy island will act as a clean energy hub and is expected to handle up to 3.5GW of offshore wind power, connecting multiple offshore wind farms and efficiently transmitting electricity onshore to Belgium and other countries such as the UK and Denmark via subsea cables.

The energy island is expected to be completed in 2026. Thereafter, Elia (Belgium's electricity transmission system operator) will commence construction of the main electricity infrastructure to connect the island onshore. Elia was previously involved in the operation and maintenance of the 'Offshore Switchyard', part of the Modular Offshore Grid (MOG) in the Belgian North Sea. The Offshore Switchyard connects four windfarms: Rentel, Seastar, Mermaid and Northwester 2, collating the combined energy and transmitting it onshore through join subsea cables.

The energy island forms part of the larger Triton Link Project, where the two system operators Elia (Belgium) and Energinet (Denmark) are collaborating on the implementation of a subsea connection between their respective artificial offshore energy islands in the northern and southern parts of the North Sea.

Belgium's Minister of Energy called for Belgium to raise its offshore wind target to 8 GW (up from 5.7 GW) on the back of the ongoing Ukrainian war and its implications on European energy security. It comes after the European Union announced in March 2022 its 'REPowerEU' plan to make Europe independent from Russian fossil fuels well before 2030.

To deliver on the targeted 8 GW offshore wind target, Belgium is considering repowering part of its existing wind farm capacity (i.e. replacing existing turbines with more efficient, modern turbine models). If this goes ahead, it will be the first time a commercial-scale offshore wind farm gets repowered in Europe.

Hybrid projects

Evolving from a more traditional way of offshore grid development - national projects with a direct connection to the mainland via transversal connections - special attention has recently been paid to so-called hybrid projects. Hybrid projects have a dual functionality by combining electricity connections between two or more countries with the transmission of offshore renewable energy. Hybrid projects can be constructed in several ways, including via energy islands.

Embracing this forward-looking vision and the benefits these projects will bring in terms of cost-efficiency and environmental gains, Belgium intends to once again act as a pioneer by constructing one of the first artificial energy islands in the North Sea, which will act both as a grid access point for offshore wind in the Princess Elisabeth Zone and as an access point for future interconnections.

Marine spatial planning

The Belgian part of the North Sea is busy with a lot of activities taking place in a rather limited space, including such as renewable energy projects and transportation, nature conservation, shipping, fishing and sand extraction. In order to achieve balance between these interests, Belgium was one of the first countries in the world to draft a Marine Spatial Plan (MSP), back in 2014. The 2014 MSP legally determined, for a period of six years, where each activity was (or was not) allowed at sea. The existing Natura 2000 nature areas were designated in the 2014 MSP, but until now these areas lacked effective protection.

The 2020-2026 MSP sets out new areas for offshore wind activities, part of which are situated in existing Natura 2000 areas. The limited space for offshore activities, combined with Belgium's leading position in offshore wind, results in many countries watching Belgium with great interest.

The Belgian Offshore Platform, an association of investors and owners of wind farms in the Belgian part of the North Sea, and 4Sea, a coalition of environmental organizations, have announced their intention to work together to ""maximise the protection and enhancement of the biodiversity values of the North Sea."" This announcement evidences an important first step toward good spatial planning in the entire North Sea area. Nature-inclusive renewable energy looks to the future and Belgian is at the front of the race.",nortonrosefulbright.com,news,nortonrosefulbright.com,,0.3647058823529412,453295518,22,https://www.nortonrosefulbright.com/-/media/images/nrf/international-offshore-wind/hero/belgium.png?revision=&revision=4611686018427387904,eng-9572956

If it works, it will be a cheaper way to stabilize renewable energy over longer periods of time.

The world is gradually moving towards zero-carbon energy options, but the road ahead is not a straightforward one. To achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, around 80 percent of the world's electricity will have to come from options like solar and wind power.

For some, the prospect of moving towards zero-carbon grids may seem impossible - but some countries, like Portugal, Denmark, and Namibia are already doing so. However, to be applicable to everyone, new ways of storing and releasing energy produced from these new technologies will need to be improved to keep up with demand. These demands will vary depending on location - some may need almost constant supply, even on overcast days, while others may experience peaks and troughs throughout the day.

At the same time, energy will need to be stored for (forgive the pun) the rainy days of winter or other seasonal low points where wind power may not make up for the loss of solar power.

This is where BaroMar's new compressed air energy storage (CAES) alternative may come in handy.

The technology for CAES has been around for about 40 years and is known to be quite a good cost-effective way to store energy and to ensure that the grid remains stable. Traditionally, the process involves compressing and storing ambient air under pressure in underground reservoirs, like caves or old salt mines. When energy is needed, it can be released using turbines that drive a generator to recover it.

BaroMar believes their alternative approach can outperform this older method and store energy for long-durations using low-tech equipment.

The answer is water. The company plans to set up plants near coastlines with access to deep water, the pressure from which will replace the high-pressure tanks used in traditional CAES. This approach is much cheaper.

So rather than imagining slick sophisticated tanks of pressurized air, imagine large concrete and steel tanks weighed down by cages filled with rocks. These would be submerged at around 200-700 meters (650-2,300 feet).

Each tank has water-permeable valves that fill them with seawater, at least to start with. Then, when energy needs to be stored, the nearby compressor and generator (which is on land) feed air down into the tanks through a hose at around 20-70 bar (290-1,015 psi), depending on the depth. As the air enters the tanks, it forces water out.

Then, when energy needs to be extracted, the air is allowed to return up the hose where it powers a thermal recovery system and then a turbo expander, driving a generator.

Back at the sea floor, the tanks fill back up with water and await further use.

This system, especially the tanks, is said to be significantly cheaper to produce because the pressure from the seawater acts as a stabilizer.

""The tanks are designed to resist loads imposed by the marine environment as well as the compressed air and hydrostatic water pressure, during both installation and operational conditions,"" a spokesperson for Jacobs, who has teamed up with BaroMar, explained to CleanTechnica.

Jacobs is preparing a pilot project for the new system to be installed in Cyprus with the target of reaching a round-trip efficiency - the combined loss of energy added to and withdrawn from an energy store - of around 70 percent. If achieved, this would be around the same efficiency as the world's largest traditional CAES station in China.

However, this water-based pilot project will not be able to achieve the level of energy stored at the Chinese plants. It will initially store around 4 MWh (compared to the 100-MW, 400 MW/h capacity in Zhangjiakou, China).

Despite its promises, there will be challenges ahead. These relate to anything designed to exist underwater for decades, which require extensive feasibility studies, geophysical research, and geotechnological and bathymetric surveying to make sure the tanks can be built and can operate at great depths.

Still, if BaroMar's claims are correct, this new system would be extremely appealing to many cities across the world and could represent a far cheaper and easily scalable solution. Let's see how they get on.",iflscience.com,news,IFLScience,,0.3176470588235294,453294940,1,https://assets.iflscience.com/assets/articleNo/74182/aImg/76165/blue-ocean-and-blue-sky-wind-turbines-dotted-on-the-horizon-line-grass-in-the-foreground-meta.jpg,

""The UK faces one of the ""most dangerous and transformational five years it has ever known"" as it deals with security threats from overseas conflicts, the rise in global immigration and the dawn of artificial intelligence, Rishi Sunak is set to warn. Wars in the Middle East and Eastern Europe, along with the mass movement of people from poorer parts of the world, coupled with the power of AI and a more interconnected world will bring about more change in the coming five years than the previous 30, the Prime Minister will claim in a speech... Sunak will set out how he will tackle the challenges that are looming for the UK at a time of growing uncertainty. ""I have bold ideas that can change our society for the better, and restore people's confidence and pride in our country,"" he will say."" - The I

""The Prime Minister should go ""long"" on calling the general election to...benefit from an improving economy, Lord Cameron has said...He told...Sky News: ""The longer we have between now and the election, the more you're going to see the plan is working."" Asked on what his advice to Mr Sunak would be, he said: ""I'd say to him 'stick to the plan'. I think the Prime Minister is a good man doing a great job at a difficult time. And I think you've got a very clear choice opening up, and that's what happens as you get to the end of a parliament. It stops being a referendum on the Government every day and it starts being a choice between two teams."" The Telegraph revealed last week that Downing Street has shelved plans for a general election this summer..."" - The Daily Telegraph

""Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron has ruled out the UK banning arms sales to Israel amid growing concerns that a full-scale offensive could be launched in Rafah. He said that halting arms sales was ""not a wise path"", but suggested an invasion of Gaza's southernmost city would be wrong ""without a plan to protect people"". Asked whether the UK would echo the US's threat of banning weapons sales to Israel if it invades Rafah, Cameron said that America was ""in a totally different situation"" as it provides...more weapons to Israel. ""The United States is a massive, bulk, state supplier of weapons to Israel, including 1,000lb bombs and all the rest of it,"" he told Sky News... Israel's operation in Rafah, which it has said is Hamas's last significant stronghold, has ramped up in recent days..."" - The I

""David Cameron's policy of cosying up to China when he was prime minister was 'absolutely pathetic', a former cabinet minister and governor of Hong Kong has said. Lord Patten of Barnes, who was governor of Hong Kong from 1992 to 1997, criticised the so-called 'golden era' of UK-China relations under Lord Cameron, who is now Foreign Secretary. In this period there was a state visit by Chinese premier Xi Jinping, during which he met the late Queen and enjoyed fish and chips in a village pub. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Shadow War: China and the West programme, which starts tomorrow, Lord Patten said: ""David Cameron introducing Xi Jinping to his pub near Chequers with a warm pint of beer - for what?""... George Osborne...defended the policy of closer UK-China relations."" - The Daily Mail

""Civil service jobs dedicated to improving equality, diversity and inclusion will be scrapped under plans by the ""common sense"" minister, Esther McVey. In a speech on Monday, McVey will claim that public money is being wasted on ""woke hobby horses"" across Whitehall. She wants to stop any more officials devoted to EDI outside of human resources, with no more staff doing it as their primary role. New guidance is being worked on that would stop all external EDI spending across the civil service unless it is authorised by ministers. Arms-length bodies that spend the most on external EDI will also be called in for meetings with McVey to account for how doing so benefits taxpayers... The amount of staff time taken up by diversity programmes was ""a major concern"", she said."" - The Times

""Civil servants are trying to block plans for league tables of the migrant nationalities with the highest rates of crime. The proposal, backed by 40 Tory MPs as an amendment to the Criminal Justice Bill, would require the crime rates of each nation's migrants in England and Wales to be published annually. Ministers would present a report to Parliament each year detailing the nationality, visa status and asylum status of every offender convicted in English and Welsh courts in the previous 12 months. The move...led by former immigration minister Robert Jenrick...would mirror an approach by some US states and Denmark, where league tables show the crime rates of those from Kuwait, Tunisia, Lebanon and Somalia are far higher than those of Danish nationals."" - The Daily Telegraph

""Michael Gove yesterday accused Labour of 'using Big Brother tactics' to hike up council tax on people's homes. The Housing Secretary hit out after it emerged the Labour-run Welsh Government was using satellites to spy on homeowners living in properties with large gardens or that have undergone renovations and extensions. As well as aerial and street view photography, data from planning applications, information about energy efficiency and statistics on school performance and crime rates are also being assessed as part of an overhaul of council tax bands being drawn up by the Senedd. It means families who live in bigger, better insulated homes, in areas with good schools or lower incidence of crime, could be hit with higher council tax bills."" - The Daily Mail

""Ministers are preparing to extend subsidies to wood-burning power stations despite Tory MPs warning that this risks ""ripping off"" taxpayers unless tougher conditions are imposed. No more taxpayer money should be handed to biomass electricity until it can prove it does not worsen climate change and offer value for money, dozens of Conservative MPs will say. The MPs say there are ""serious questions"" about whether generating electricity by burning wood is sustainable and a review is needed to see if options such as wind and solar are becoming better options. Up to 7 per cent of Britain's electricity comes from biomass, mainly from a Drax power plant in North Yorkshire that was converted from coal to burn wood pellets."" - The Times

""Nadhim Zahawi has admitted for the first time he paid nearly £5m to the tax authority to settle his tax affairs, having previously denied the figure involved and claimed he was being ""smeared"" by journalists who revealed the issue. The former chancellor told the BBC he had paid HMRC just under £5m after making what he called a ""careless mistake"" with the tax he paid on the sales of shares in YouGov, the polling company he helped found. It is the first time Zahawi has spoken openly about the issue, which ended up costing him his job as Conservative chair last year after an inquiry by the prime minister's ethics adviser. He announced this week he was standing down as an MP at the next election... Allegations about Zahawi's tax affairs began to emerge in 2022..."" - The Guardian

Jess Phillips, a Labour MP and former shadow minister for tackling domestic violence, said ""questions have to be answered now"" after allegations were reported by The Sunday Times. Zarah Sultana, another ­Labour MP, broke cover to say publicly that female colleagues had raised concerns over Elphicke's defence of her husband, Charlie, after he was convicted. Sir Robert Buckland, the justice secretary at the time, accused Elphicke, who defected from the Conservatives on Wednesday, of using a meeting...to ask him to interfere in the trial of her husband and speak to the judge..."" - The Times

""Angela Rayner is expected to be interviewed under caution by police in the coming weeks over which of her two homes was her main residence. Greater Manchester Police are understood to have contacted Labour's deputy leader to arrange an interview at a date and time to be agreed by both. The interview would almost certainly be conducted at a local police station in Manchester and Ms Rayner would be questioned under caution. Ms Rayner has previously said that she has been looking forward ""to sitting down with the appropriate authorities... and draw a line under this matter"", suggesting that she will attend the interview voluntarily, obviating any need to arrest her and the embarrassment that would cause."" - The Daily Telegraph

""Labour is looking at toughening Ofcom's powers around politicians hosting their own TV and radio shows due to concerns around impartiality, the shadow Culture Secretary has hinted. Thangam Debbonaire revealed that she has already held talks with regulator Ofcom to discuss how it can better uphold the rules around impartiality when it comes to broadcast channels. It comes after a raft of complaints were made about mainly Conservative MPs interviewing one another on the right-wing channel GB News, with several Tories, including Jacob Rees-Mogg, hosting their own shows. Similar complaints were made about shadow Foreign Secretary David Lammy, who hosts his own radio slot on LBC on Sundays."" - The I

""A Labour government would be in pole position to sign a green free trade agreement with the United States, a former adviser to President Biden has said, praising the UK opposition's ""bold"" climate policies. Jennifer Harris, a former chief economic adviser to the White House's National Security Council, told The Times that a future Democratic administration and a Labour-led UK would be better placed than the European Union to agree a prized trade deal built on shared climate goals. ""I'm a staunch advocate for the Biden second term and Labour inking a free trade agreement that can be the proving ground for a new generation of trade deals, rather than the project of the last 30 years, which has been about lowering tariffs,"" Harris said."" - The Times

""Ministers are committed to moving forward with plans to ban conversion therapy in Scotland, the country's health secretary has said. Neil Gray said that the government will reflect on responses to a consultation on the issue, but that it is an ""important piece of legislation"". The consultation document outlined plans to ban the controversial practice, which sees people attempt to change or suppress the gender identity or sexual orientation of another person. Patrick Harvie, the Scottish Greens co-leader, has said that John Swinney must not water down the policies pursued by his party before the end of the power-sharing deal with the SNP...Some have raised concerns about the conversion therapy plans and how they could affect parenting and the pastoral care offered by religious leaders."" - The Times

""The Liberal Democrats have been accused of deselecting a candidate ""based on his Christian faith"" in a breach of equality law. Members have reported the party to the equalities watchdog over accusations that the party has tolerated a ""hostile environment"" for people of faith, failed to investigate serious allegations of discrimination and harassment and ""emboldened those who believe Christians should be driven out of public life"". The complaint to the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) concerns the treatment of David Campanale...who is set to be replaced as a prospective MP candidate for Sutton and Cheam after a two-year campaign against him by members of his local party and a number of LGBT activists."" - The Daily Telegraph

""Reform UK's election efforts are being hampered by a lack of money and resources and the party has so far largely relied on £1.4m of loans from its leader, Richard Tice. The party is ultimately owned by Nigel Farage, but electoral and corporate filings show it has been mainly bankrolled by Tice, who has contributed about 80% of its declared funding in loans and donations since he took over in 2021. Farage is still undecided about whether to return to a frontline role in the party at this year's election. The party has been ticking up in the polls even without his active presence, reaching 9%-15% nationally. In the Blackpool South byelection on 2 May, its candidate came within 120 votes of the Conservatives, with 17% of the vote."" - The Guardian

""Britain should leave the World Health Organisation rather than hand it the power to force the country into lockdown during pandemics, Nigel Farage has told The Telegraph. The president of Reform UK described the WHO as ""a failing, expensive, unelected, unaccountable, supranational body"" that wants to ""run roughshod"" over nation states...The WHO is proposing a pandemic treaty that would be legally binding on all 194 member states, and is pushing for mandatory lockdowns and vaccinations. It hopes to reach an agreement later in May. The Government has insisted it would never hand over authority to the WHO over whether lockdowns should be imposed, but Mr Farage says ministers should be prepared to go further and leave the Geneva-based body if necessary."" - The Daily Telegraph",conservativeangle.com,news,Brigitte Gabriel,,0.07450980392156858,453287030,7,,

Construction of the world's first artificial energy island, that will serve as an energy hub for collecting and distributing renewable energy from offshore windfarms, is well underway in the Belgium North Sea.

Milestones in building the massive Princess Elisabeth Island, some 45 km off the Belgian coast, were discussed by expert panellists during a session at IPF 2024 In New Orleans held in April. The first construction contract for the EU-funded artificial island project was awarded last year to TM Edison, a consortium made up of the Jan De Nul Group (JDN Group) and Deme Group.

Panellist JDN Group senior business development manager, Carl Heiremans, said the project would require building 23 caissons, or foundations, that will form the outside walls of the artificial island.

Each concrete caisson weighs about 22,000 tonnes and takes about three months to build at a facility in Holland. The construction process involves five separate phases which take about 20 days each to complete, according to electricity grid infrastructure operator and developer Elia Group.

The first of the island's caissons has almost been completed and will be transported by sea and installed on the seabed later this year. Located in about 18 m of water, the island will have a seabed footprint of about 25 hectares and around seven hectares on the surface.

""You are less exposed on the energy island""

Princess Elisabeth Island will connect to secondary wind zones, and in the future, will serve as an interconnector with the UK and Denmark. The island will act as an offshore energy hub, collecting high-voltage alternating current (HVAC) electricity generated by offshore windfarms in the Princess Elisabeth Zone, and send high-voltage direct current (HVDC) back to shore via subsea cables. With a capacity for up to 3.5 GW of offshore wind power, the island will facilitate the exchange of renewable electricity between European countries.

Building an artificial island allows for higher availability and easier maintainability than a floating substation, panellists pointed out. Additionally, Mr Heiremans noted: ""You are less exposed on the energy island"" to allow crews to safely maintain the energy infrastructure. He said the island also offers ""much higher modularity to allow for build out."" Modularity is vital to allow for expansion and future proofing. Another consideration in the design was making the artificial island environmentally friendly to attract birds and sea life. He said construction of the island should be completed by 2026.

Mr Heiremans was joined on the panel by Blauwe Cluster chief executive Piet Opstaele, e-Bo Enterprises international business development renewables Vincent Dehullu, KU Leuven research expert Hakan Ergun and Wind Grid chief executive Markus Laukamp.

Energy security and resilience is driving the construction of Princess Elisabeth Island. One of the largest offshore wind developers in the world with about 2.26 GW of capacity, Belgium has joined with eight other European countries, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway and the UK, in signing the Ostend declaration to develop 120 GW of offshore wind in the North Sea by 2030, and 300 GW by 2050.",rivieramm.com,news,Riviera,,0.1529411764705881,453286963,10,https://dvzpv6x5302g1.cloudfront.net/AcuCustom/Sitename/DAM/163/Caisson_for_Princess_Elisabeth_Island_source_Elia_Groupwebzas.png,eng-9572956

American billionaire Bill Gates met with German politicians last week in Berlin to share his wisdom on scaling climate tech ventures.

Elsewhere at the conference, there were discussions about the idea of launching a €1bn fund to supply project finance to climate techs to help them build their first large-scale plants (known as first-of-a-kind facilities, or FOAKs).

The news comes as Gates' VC firm, Breakthrough Energy Ventures -- which closed a $555m fund in January this year -- also ramps up its focus on Europe. The VC primarily backs climate tech companies.

Gates also invests through the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which gives grants and makes equity investments. It focuses primarily on healthtech.

Here are the European startups he's backed via those funds.

The Breakthrough-backed European companies

UK-based Mission Zero builds direct air capture machines, which remove carbon from the air. Breakthrough Energy Ventures led the company's seed round in 2020 and followed on in its £21.8m Series A earlier this year.

Swedish electric plane startup Heart Aerospace secured backing from Breakthrough Energy Ventures earlier this year, in its $107m Series B round. The company hopes to get its plane in the air by 2028.

Blue World develops methanol fuel cells for the automotive industry. Breakthrough backed the company in its €37m Series B round in 2022.

Paris-based Dioxycle has developed a system that turns carbon dioxide into chemicals such as ethylene, which is used widely in the production of textiles and plastics. Breakthrough backed the company in July 2023, in a $17m Series A, alongside Lowercarbon Capital.

H2site builds tech that can produce hydrogen on site for businesses that need it as a fuel. Breakthrough participated in the company's Series A round in 2022.

London's Reactive Technologies is working on electricity grid stabilisation tools. It received backing from Breakthrough in a $15m raise in 2021.

THE wind gusting across north German farm country brings much to the village of Sprakebuell: fog and rain from the sea, the occasional migrating stork, the faint smell of manure in the newly-fertilised fields.

And perhaps best of all, money - from selling the electricity generated by the wind turbines studding the flat green fields stretching out to the North Sea. A slice of the cash goes to the villagers themselves, with the local buy-in making this windy farming enclave near the border with Denmark a showcase for ways to push ahead with renewable energy projects.

It's not easy when headwinds from the post-pandemic global economy - including high interest rates and inflation - are holding back often costly investment in wind, solar and other forms of clean power.

That is slowing the growth in renewables needed to fend off climate change, just as it needs to speed up to meet an ambitious goal reached at the UN climate summit to boost clean energy capacity.

But Sprakebuell, a three-street cluster of neat one-storey houses where tractor traffic outnumbers cars, has seen new life and added prosperity thanks to renewable energy. Small as it is, some of the German town's practices offer lessons that could resonate globally.

The dividends from citizen-owned wind farms don't make the recipients rich. Instead, the money is a little extra jingle, a financial buffer ""that's very important for us because it gives us a certain freedom,"" said Astrid Nissen, 44, who with her husband manages a 150-cow dairy farm on the village's outskirts.

Milk prices fluctuate wildly, but the steadier income from the wind farms is ""something we can rely on, something we can use to plan"", she said, occasional moos coming from the barn behind her.

The whoosh, whoosh, whoosh from the turbines - inaudible in the village centre but noisy up close - contribute some €400,000 a year in taxes. That paid for a new playground, a bike path and even free piano lessons for Sprakebuell's children.

When it comes to new green energy projects, global hurdles include higher borrowing costs, high prices and clogged supply chains for wind turbines and blades, and the ""not in my backyard"" resistance to wind farms.

Interest rate hikes from the US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and others have economists at University College London warning of ""green collateral damage"" and calling high borrowing costs meant to fight inflation ""terrible news for the green transition"".

Consultancy Wood Mackenzie found that ""clean energy has witnessed one of the toughest years in its short history"" with government calls for more generating capacity going unfilled in Germany, Spain, the UK and Italy.

The situation is even more serious for lower-income countries in places like Africa, where borrowing costs for the higher up-front investment needed for renewables were already high and have risen even further.

In Sprakebuell, the number of family farms shrank from 26 in 1960 to three larger ones today, and it was on the verge of being merged with a neighbouring village 30 years ago. These days, it's home not just to farmers, but people who work a half-hour away in the city of Flensburg.

Sprakebuell's residents put in the 20% down payment on building a wind farm and local banks lent the remaining 80%. The first wind farm had 24 participants; the latest one had more than 150 as word spread.

Borrowing costs and subsidies

Nissen and her husband started with an investment of just over €5,000 more than 20 years ago. The dividends helped pay for a new calf stall, a front-end loader to shovel out animal feed and two workers.

""That means we sometimes have a free weekend, sometimes a vacation - and without employees, that's impossible,"" she said.

Not everyone takes part, but all residents see benefits. There's a shared electric car in the middle of town that anyone can book by smartphone app for €2.50 an hour.

A small grocery store has opened with an attached cafe, and a restaurant serves lunch daily - signs of new purchasing power. Some similar-sized villages in the region have neither.

""Renewable energy projects are visible in the landscape, and for me, it's very important that local people can identify with these projects,"" said Christian Andresen, whose company, Solar-Energie Andresen GmbH, developed the wind farms and solar installations.

Andresen's projects illustrate factors that can move renewables forward. One is the German government's guaranteed price for electricity over 20 years, which gives banks confidence they can lend and get paid back.

Another is low interest rate loans from the government development bank, the KfW. But even those rates have risen, from 1% a few years ago to over 5%, Andresen said.

Andresen speaking during a presentation on green energy in Sprakebuell. -- AP

High interest rates hold back renewables far more than fossil fuel projects. Most of the cost for renewables is up-front in the price of buying the wind turbines or solar panels, while costs to operate them going forward are negligible - the wind blows and sun shines for free.

That makes the cost of borrowing a much more important factor in whether the project will be profitable.

It's the other way around with fossil fuels: a natural gas-fired electricity plant is relatively cheaper to build, while the real costs come later in buying the gas.

On top of that is inflation, which has raised the cost of building facilities, and equipment shortages due to jammed supply chains.

Those were some reasons Danish company Orsted cited when it cancelled two large wind installations off New Jersey. Swedish utility Vattenfall also halted an offshore project in the UK.

The S&P Global Clean Energy Index of shares in companies with clean energy-related businesses has fallen 26% over the past year, even as broader market indexes have surged to records.

In the US higher rates have been a ""speed bump"" for some renewables projects, said David Shepheard, North American energy and utilities partner at global consultancy Baringa.

""The returns are squeezed in the current rate environment"" but are brightening, he said, with the Fed expected to cut rates this year.

The overall picture is nuanced, with a slowdown in renewables by oil majors easing supplier logjams, while domestic content requirements for US subsidies increase supply chain delays for some projects.

In sub-Saharan Africa, where half the population lacks access to electricity, renewable projects face even steeper challenges with financing. With lots of sunshine, solar is an obvious option, but Africa's 1.2 billion people have one-fifth the solar power of cloudy Germany.

Borrowing costs there are far higher than in rich countries, while government subsidies are uncertain because of political upheavals and countries already deep in debt.

In Nigeria, where blackouts are an everyday event for about half of the country's 213 million people, some 14 solar projects have stalled because the finances don't add up.

The government has been leery of World Bank credit guarantees that would make the projects bankable, concerned about being required to pay for the power even if the grid can't deliver it.

""But without that, nobody will develop or finance a project with a government subsidy because it can dry off,"" said Edu Okeke, managing director of energy company Azura, a stakeholder in the Nova solar project in Nigeria's northern Katsina state.

The answer can be to raise the price of electricity - which the German government did last year by 25%. That also helps secure financing. Another is subsidised interest rates or credit guarantees as part of developed countries' efforts to help poorer nations combat climate change.

And where locals are the owners instead of big energy companies, objections to wind towers' appearance, shadows or whooshing tend to fade, said Andresen, the wind developer.

With a population of over 100,000 people, the Umuokpo Autonomous community in Imo State, has for decades, been forced to rely on kerosene lamps and candles to carry out their evening activities, exposing them to serious health and safety risks. Despite their efforts to take matters into their own hands, including purchasing and installing transformers, the community has remained in the dark. explores the struggles and frustrations of the people and their determination to access their basic human right to electricity.

For 76-year-old Mrs Nneoma Okoro, the absence of electricity in her community, Umuokpo Autonomous Community in Nkume, Njaba LGA, Imo State, is a constant reminder of the struggles she has faced her entire life. She recalls the days when she had to rely on kerosene lamps and candles to light her home, often worrying about the safety of her children and grandchildren.

Umuokpo is a rural community grappling with significant environmental and infrastructural challenges. The community is plagued by severe gully erosion, which has ravaged the entire area, causing widespread damage to homes, farmland, and infrastructure. Compounding this issue, therefore, is the frequent and unpredictable power disruptions, which have left the community vulnerable to darkness and economic stagnation.

""We have been in darkness for so long,"" Nneoma Okoro says, her voice laced with frustration. ""We thought we had finally seen the light when we bought our transformer, but DisCo/EEDC took it over and left us in the dark again.""

Mrs Okoro's story is just one of many in the Umuokpo Community, where the lack of electricity has become a way of life. Despite their efforts to take matters into their own hands, the community has been met with resistance and neglect from the Enugu Electricity Distribution Company (DisCo/EEDC).

A community in the dark

Umuokpo Autonomous Community, like many rural communities in Nigeria, has been struggling to access basic amenities like electricity. In 2018, their transformer was vandalised, leaving them in darkness for almost three years. Despite purchasing a new transformer through individual contributions, nothing has changed, as the DisCo/EEDC simply took possession of it without compensation.

Narrating their ordeal to The Nation, one of the community leaders, Elder Okegbe Eze Cooper, explained that the community purchased two transformers at various times, with each costing nothing less than N10 million, including the cost of energizing, approvals and logistics.

""The first was purchased after long requests and delays from EEDC. We went out of our way and got one of ourselves. When the transformer was vandalised, EEDC on our invitation, sent an engineer to do the repairs with the community again bankrolling the expenses which were over N500,000 or more, including logistics. Again when the repairs failed, EEDC then came and moved it to their repair centre to investigate the fault and perhaps fix it; and I can tell you that was the last time we heard nor saw the transformer again.

""After years of demand without result, even as they continued to send the monthly bills knowing full well we had no light, we then went to the NERC which serves as the arbiter between EEDC and its customers.

""It was after this that the body ruled that EEDC should, as a matter of urgency, replace the vandalised transformer in the community; and that the entire community should be provided with prepaid meters rather than the estimated bill which was used. It also ruled that the bill of millions of naira, which was the estimated bill sent to the community when we were in total darkness, be struck out and cancelled as it could stand.

""It was after this ruling by the NERC and having waited for another year without any action from EEDC that the community went out of its way again and contributed money to get for itself another transformer at the cost of over N10 million, including energization and approvals from the same EEDC at very high cost. This, of course, is what should have been done free of charge as the court pronounced but it never was. Rather they came in again and continued the financial plunder of our poor people.""

Elder Okegbe also condemned the Enugu Electricity Distribution Company (EEDC) for their handling of the community's power issues, describing the suffering in the community as ""a hopeless situation.""

He expressed frustration that despite a court ruling in their favour, the company has failed to provide a transformer and prepaid meters, which the community people had to fund themselves.

The community's efforts to fund and energize a new transformer were disregarded by EEDC, which surprised Elder Okegbe. He suggested that the company's behaviour was a blatant disregard for the community's efforts and wondered if they were intentionally provoking another legal battle.

Elder Okegbe's criticism of EEDC's actions highlights the community's frustration and sense of abandonment. Despite their best efforts to resolve the issue, they have been met with inaction and disrespect, leaving them feeling helpless and angry.

""Honestly, the story is very pathetic. As if these were not enough, we even went ahead and paid for prepaid meters for ourselves. That's over a year now but all we got, even as I speak, are just stories and blame games. This is despite the community's proof of payment of N2 million.

""I paid the N2 million into account number 2030937277 of EEDC Orlu Operations on April 28, 2023.

""It is a sad one. While in Abia State, they are going from street to street, installing free prepaid meters for the people, here in Orlu, Imo State, where we have paid money, we get nothing.""

A cry for justice

The community's representative, Chief Basil Adimora, now based in the United States, is determined to fight for his community's rights. ""We are not asking for too much; just basic electricity and fair treatment,"" he says. ""We want DisCo/EEDC to take responsibility for their obligations and stop exploiting our community.""

""We simply want DisCo/EEDC and their affiliates to do the right thing and take their foot off our necks, so we can breathe,"" he adds. ""We are not shareholders, stakeholders, or owners of DisCo/EEDC, yet we are being forced to provide infrastructure for their profit-making activities without compensation or ownership interest. It's unfair and unjust.""

According to him, on February 3, 2024, the community sent a letter to the Managing Director of EEDC, requesting a status update on the 20 individuals who had paid for prepaid meters.

""We wrote to the Managing Director of EEDC, Enugu, requesting a status update. Out of the 20 names, 7 prepaid meters have been installed, and we are still waiting to hear about the status of the remaining 13, which is now almost six years overdue.""

The villagers have been left to fend for themselves, and they have grown accustomed to the neglect. With no one to advocate for them, they feel like they are shouting into the wind, and their cries for help are falling on deaf ears.

As a result, they have lost hope, believing that their plight will continue to be ignored, much like sheep without a shepherd.

The traditional ruler of the community, HRH Eze E.M. Iwuala, Obikaeze 11, succinctly captured the sense of despair. ""It has become the norm in Nigeria for people to cry out for help without receiving any intervention,"" he said, quoting an Igbo proverb. ""Let us continue to cry out, not because we expect our situation to change, but so that the world may hear our voice and know our plight.""

The human cost

The lack of electricity in the Umuokpo Community has a human cost that goes beyond mere inconvenience. It affects the health, education, and economic well-being of the community members.

Mrs. Okoro's granddaughter, Chinaza, has to study with candlelight, risking her eyesight and respiratory health. ""I wish I had a proper light to study with,"" she says, ""but we can't afford to buy fuel for the generator every day.""

The community's only healthcare centre struggles to function without electricity, making it difficult for the nurses to store vaccines and medical supplies.

""We have lost precious lives due to our inability to provide proper care,"" says the community's health worker, who simply gave her name as Mrs Uche.

""We need electricity to access basic healthcare, education, and economic opportunities,"" says Mrs. Uche. ""We can't afford to wait any longer.""

The lack of electricity also affects the community's economic activities, making it difficult for them to run their businesses and sell their products.

""We can't even power our machines to process our farm produce,"" says Mr. Ike, a farmer. ""We have to sell them at a loss, which affects our livelihood.""

""I have had to spend so much money on fuel for my generator to power my shop,"" says Mrs Ngozi, a business owner. ""It's affecting my business and my family's well-being.""

A call to action

The story of the Umuokpo Community is a call to action for the authorities to take responsibility for providing basic amenities to rural communities. It is a reminder that access to electricity is a fundamental human right, essential for the well-being and development of any community.

As Mrs. Okoro says, ""We are not asking for too much. We just want to live a decent life with our children and grandchildren. We want to see the light.""

""We are tired of living in darkness,"" says Mr. Emma Okafor, a community member. ""We want electricity to power our homes, our businesses, and our lives.""

When The Nation reached out to the Network Manager, Mr Kingsley Mba, he stated that he was no longer in charge of the Orlu District and directed the reporter to contact the new manager, emphasising that government is a continuous entity.

Meanwhile, the Transformer Manager, Mr Chris Umuaka, disputed the claim that the community had been without electricity for three years, asserting that they currently have power. He added, ""We didn't disconnect them. They had light last week, so it's incorrect to say they don't have light.""

He also claimed to be unaware of the community's prolonged darkness and their purchase and installation of transformers twice.

""I'm not aware of those claims. Nobody asked them to buy a transformer and take on EEDC's responsibilities. If someone did, they should identify that person.""

Regarding the prepaid meters, the manager in charge urged the community to exercise patience, without providing any specific timeline.

Contrary to the community's claim that 20 subscribers had paid for pre-paid meters, he said only 11 individuals had done so, out of which eight had already been installed.

He assured the community: ""They should be patient and engage with EEDC. We haven't abandoned the project; the remaining three prepaid meters are pending, and we will attend to them soon.""

The provision and installation of transformers and prepaid meters have long been a contentious issue. While many communities are left in darkness waiting for the Enugu Electricity Distribution Company (EEDC) to install their transformers, others have taken matters into their own hands by purchasing and installing them themselves.

According to the guidelines for transformer provision in Nigeria set by the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) and the standard practice of Distribution Companies (DisCo)/EEDC, the ownership and responsibilities for transformers are clearly defined. Transformers are typically owned by the DisCo (EEDC), which is responsible for installing and maintaining them, including replacing faulty or vandalised ones.

Communities may be required to contribute to the cost of replacing or installing new transformers through a collective agreement with a DisCo. However, a DisCo is responsible for regular maintenance and repairs of transformers, while communities are responsible for protecting the equipment from vandalism and theft. A DisCo determines when to upgrade or replace transformers based on factors like load demand, condition and age.

Additionally, a DisCo installs and maintains prepaid meters for consumers, including those in rural communities like Umuokpo, and consumers pay electricity tariffs approved by the NERC, which includes costs for transformer maintenance and replacement. A DisCo is expected to engage with communities and address their concerns, including providing electricity access and resolving issues like transformer vandalism.

Unfortunately, many communities, driven by desperation and lack of knowledge, have taken on the burden of providing essential services like electricity, water, and roads, using their resources and effort, despite the absence of a reliable energy supply.

In contrast, other countries and regions have successfully implemented efficient and reliable electricity distribution systems, not only in their rural communities but also throughout their entire countries, minimising power outages and ensuring a stable energy supply.

For instance, Tanzania has recently shut down five hydroelectric stations to reduce excess electricity supply in the national grid, with the Mwalimu Nyerere Hydroelectric Station alone generating enough electricity to power major cities like Dar es Salaam.

Similarly, Denmark has a decentralised energy system that generates and distributes energy locally, reducing transmission losses and increasing efficiency.

The United States has implemented advanced weather forecasting and predictive maintenance to enhance grid resilience, while Costa Rica has invested heavily in renewable energy sources like hydroelectric power, wind and geothermal energy; reducing reliance on fossil fuels and minimising power outages.

Australia, on its part, has implemented energy storage solutions like batteries and pumped hydro storage to stabilise the grid and ensure a reliable energy supply, while Japan has microgrid systems that can operate independently of the main grid during outages, using local energy sources like solar and wind power.

On the other hand, Singapore has a highly efficient electricity distribution system with a robust grid that minimises power outages, and Germany has smart grids that manage energy distribution efficiently, predicting energy demand and adjusting supply accordingly.

These examples demonstrate that with the right investments and policies in Nigeria, it is possible to provide efficient and reliable electricity distribution systems in rural communities, minimizing power outages and ensuring a stable energy supply.

And with that, communities like Umuokpo would never have to go through the deplorable situations they claim to have been going through.",thenationonlineng.net,news,"Latest Nigeria News, Nigerian Newspapers, Politics",Chris Njoku,-0.2627450980392156,453196956,70,https://cdn.thenationonlineng.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/12084652/Were-tired-of-endless-darkness.jpg,eng-9563416

by Nie Shangyou

HOUSTON, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Offshore wind energy is facing a harsh economic reality in the United States, according to industry leaders at the just concluded Offshore Technology Conference (OTC) held in Houston, U.S. state of Texas.

""2023 has been a tough year for offshore wind,"" said Troy Patton, chief operating officer for the North American division of Danish company Orsted, in a keynote titled ""The Future of Offshore Wind"" during the OTC annual conference, which ran from Monday to Thursday.

""A number of contracts were canceled last year, with penalties,"" Patton told Xinhua after his presentation. These include Orsted's Ocean Wind I and II offshore New Jersey, totaling 2.2 gigawatts (GW) generation capacity.

Orsted, a world leader in offshore wind energy, reportedly wrote off 4 billion U.S. dollars in 2023 due to project cancellations in the United States. Penalties were levied for breaching supply contracts.

British oil giant BP also sold its 50 percent stake in two offshore wind projects, Empire Wind 1 and 2, offshore in Long Island, New York, to Norwegian oil company Equinor.

In return, BP took over 100 percent equity in Beacon Wind to supply power to the U.S. state of Massachusetts. BP reportedly took a 1.1-billion-dollar tax write-off for 2023 and said it would not rush to progress the Beacon Wind project.

These cancellations followed three other project cancellations for the eastern U.S. states of Massachusetts and Connecticut, totaling 3.2 GW. The developers called them no longer financially feasible, citing high inflation for material and equipment, higher interest rates and insufficient supply chain development as crucial factors leading to the cancellations.

The U.S. East Coast has been regarded as an ideal location to accelerate offshore wind development and help reduce dependency on coal-fired power plants. Three key factors behind the success of an offshore wind project are shallow-water continental margins for installing the foundation for the wind turbines, proximity to coastal populations and economic centers, and availability of supporting value chain service providers such as ports and manufacturing.

However, offshore wind projects are capital-intensive long-term projects, experts said, noting that energy providers and consumers need to agree on financial terms years ahead of time before the offshore wind developers and their financial backers can confidently make a final investment decision.

Another critical factor is that offshore wind projects have to compete against power provided by traditional sources. Despite the financial incentives offered by the Inflation Reduction Act introduced by the Joe Biden administration in 2022, some projects still cannot compete against power generated by cheap and abundant natural gas in the United States.

Data from the latest IEA report showed that average gas price in the first quarter of this year was 8.7 dollars per million British thermal units (Mmbtu) in Europe, 9.3 dollars Mmbtu in eastern Asia, but only 2.7 dollars Mmbtu in the United States.

The setback comes as several new offshore wind farms just began generating electricity, such as Vineyard Wind for Massachusetts and South Fork Wind near Long Island in New York, both involving Orsted. Before these new projects, the United States only had two small-scale demonstration offshore wind projects as of 2023.

In the Gulf of Mexico, the U.S. government held the region's first auction to lease offshore areas for wind development last year and only one of the three proposed areas received bids. The Gulf Coast faces competition from traditional oil and gas and onshore wind since Texas has the nation's highest wind generation capacity at 47.8 GW, or about 28 percent of the national total, according to the Energy Information Agency, part of the U.S. Department of Energy.

Currently, there are 11 offshore wind projects along the U.S. East Coast, with a total capacity of 13.7 GW, though only 7.3 GW or 54 percent have offtake agreements in place, according to recent estimates presented by Patton. Offtake agreements must be in place before the developers can make final investment decisions.

One attendee of the four-day OTC echoed the sentiment that the U.S. offshore wind industry is in its infancy and might have grown too fast in the past several years, contributing to the current setback.

The first offshore wind farm was installed in 1991 in Denmark. As a pioneer for offshore wind, European companies, including Orsted, Shell, BP, TotalEnergies, Equinor and EdF, are trying to utilize their experience to help develop the U.S. offshore wind industry thanks to the financial incentives from the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act.

In 2021, the Biden administration announced an ambitious plan to deploy 30 GW of offshore wind capacity to power 10 million homes by 2030 as part of the White House's overall climate initiative.

Industry watchers are skeptical that the 30 GW by 2030 target for offshore wind farms can be achieved, given the years required to build such farms.

Despite the setbacks, OTC participants showed strong interest in offshore wind technology development and deployment, with multiple dedicated sessions such as innovative discussions on combining offshore wind with green hydrogen generation.

Another hot topic is floating offshore wind, which is used for coastal areas without shallow water seabeds and tends to be even more expensive than conventional offshore wind farms built on fixed foundations.",english.news.cn,news,english.news.cn,,0.07450980392156858,453130924,1,,eng-9559409

Israel has imposed a complete siege on the densely populated territory, cutting off fuel, electricity, food, and water to the more than two million Palestinians living there.

Anger and frustration with the suffering of the Palestinian people in Gaza have sparked university protests across the world.

""Tensions are boiling over on university campuses across the US as student protests in support of Palestinians continue to grow, and are increasingly met with police violence despite students and faculty insisting the demonstrations have been peaceful,""

the Guardian reported.

Many universities have called police and other law enforcement agencies onto campus. In the United States alone, more than 2,000 students have been arrested.

Both protests and the campus crackdowns have also spread to other parts of the world - from Canada to Australia, and in multiple European nations. On Monday, students at Oxford and Cambridge in the United Kingdom also set up encampments.

Al Jazeera has reported that students at over 100 universities are protesting across the US. Their counterparts in at least 20 campuses outside of the US are protesting and several of these protests are also encampments.

Students at Harvard, and Brown have joined in pro-Palestinian protests across college campuses. They want their schools to stop accepting funding from groups that directly or indirectly fund the war in Gaza, NBC Boston has reported.

Protesters are demanding that their schools sever any direct or indirect financial and academic links with Israel.

At Berlin's Freie Universität in Germany on Tuesday, hundreds of pro-Palestinian protesters occupied a courtyard.

The protesters set up tents and formed a human chain, chanting slogans such as ""Viva, Viva Palestina"".

Student protests demanding that universities sever ties with Israel over the Gaza war have spread across Europe, sparking clashes and arrests as new demonstrations broke out in the Netherlands, Germany, France, Switzerland, and Austria, the Guardian reported.

In recent days, students have held protests or set up encampments in Finland, Denmark, Italy, Spain, France, and Britain following earlier protests in the US, Euronews reported.

Dublin's Trinity College students in Ireland and Lausanne University in Switzerland have joined US universities in solidarity with the encampments protesting against the Israeli war on Gaza.

On May 7, Dutch police violently broke up a pro-Palestinian demonstration camp at the University of Amsterdam, arresting 125 students.

Students at various European universities, inspired by ongoing demonstrations at US campuses, have been occupying halls and facilities, demanding an end to partnerships with Israeli institutions because of Israel's assault on Gaza.

According to CNN, pro-Palestinian encampments have been set up at the universities of Oxford and Cambridge in England, as students there call on leadership to sever ties to Israel.

The Western media coverage tries to frame the pro-Palestine protesters in Western universities as violent and racist, a social activist from Canada, told Mehr News Agency.

""I think camera phones and social media make the truth much harder to hide,"" Tyler Berglund added.

Dr. Jody Armour, a distinguished Professor of Law at the University of Southern California, told The Tehran Times, ""We spend a lot of time teaching these students to think freely and independently, and then we crack down on them when they put our teachings into practice.""

""The visit can be seen as a measure of KTH's importance for the development of society in Sweden, and of our countries' common interests in the research areas,"" said Anders Söderholm, president of KTH.

Around 60 people accompanied the royal couples, King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia of Sweden and King Frederik X and Queen Mary of Denmark, to attend a specially-organised seminar in the KTH Library on space technology and sustainable transformation.

Joining the royal delegations were Sweden's Minister for Schools Lotta Edholm and Minister for Foreign Affairs Tobias Billström, and Denmark's Minister for Foreign Affairs Lars Løkke Rasmussen. All three ministers delivered remarks to open the event, which was part of the Danish royal couple's two-day state visit to Sweden.

""It was especially nice that we were able to showcase and demonstrate both research environments and concrete innovations in the field,"" Söderholm said.

Söderholm's opening remarks offered an account of the development of engineering sciences at KTH since its main campus was opened in the early 1900s. He also described some highlights of future technology areas such as energy storage, AI, digitalisation and life sciences, and concluded by welcoming the royal couples to the ""KTH factory of the future"".

Edholm said space exploration is an important example of the free pursuit of knowledge and its role in academia. She said space research impacts positively in a number of areas, including the green transition, the security sector and the strengthening of interest in science among children and young people.

After an introduction by Christer Fuglesang, astronaut and professor of spaceflight, and Yifang Ban, professor of geoinformatics, the programme included a panel discussion. Three astronauts discussed the role of space technology for a sustainable future. In addition to Fuglesang, fellow astronauts Marcus Wandt and their Danish colleague Andreas Mogensen also spoke.

One question was about what is most likely to further develop space research. Fuglesang pointed to the rapid development of spacecraft. ""The costs have already decreased tenfold and with the potential to decrease considerably more, which would open up completely new opportunities to explore space,"" he said.

Using AI and machine learning on satellites will also bring huge benefits, he said.

Wandt highlighted the special energy and passion that he said exists among many researchers, innovators and problem solvers in space technology, which can benefit society at large.

""If you hit an obstacle, you don't give up, you keep going, and you use your evenings and weekends to achieve success. Eventually you will reach your goal and you can also benefit from the innovations made along the way in other areas such as technology for sustainability. This is a very powerful tool.""

After the panel discussion, the two royal couples, accompanied by KTH's president and Deputy President Mikael Lindström, moved to a separate part of the library to view an exhibition of six start-up companies based on research and developing technology for a green transition. All with potential for use in space and all supported by KTH Innovation.

At a stand that attracted the attention of the royal couples was Jan Jäderberg, one of the founders of Novatron, which develops technology for fusion power. A test facility is now being built at KTH to validate the technology, with the aim of supplying electricity to the grid by 2040.

""It's great to be able to stand here and have the opportunity to get a message out about sustainable technology. Our ambition and hope is to make fusion a global and dominant energy source,"" he said.

Other start-ups included innovations ranging from wireless communications and sustainable biomaterials to energy storage and reducing methane emissions from cows.",indiaeducationdiary.in,news,"India Education,Education News India,Education News  | India Education Diary",,0.1843137254901961,453102160,4,https://indiaeducationdiary.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/christer_dansk_dr_1000px.jpg?w=640,

This is outside of the fact that, considering the current state of things in Nigeria, he is also an outstanding logician. He is imbued with unassailable line of thought. He recently held Nigeria and Nigerians spellbound with his superb arguments and conclusions on the state of the country's public health sector. He argued so beautifully in favour of what our health sector has been reduced to by years and piles of sheer neglect and poor funding. Dr Tunji Alausa held that the Nigerian public health sector isn't as bad as many disgruntled Nigerians say it is. According to him, oyibos from Europe and many other peoples of the world, especially from the sub-Saharan Africa, now run to the hospitals in our towns and villages to access real and up-to-date healthcare. Oh yes! This, he said, is because healthcare delivery in Nigeria is easily accessible (of course you and I know that our boarders are porous); quite affordable (you see how useful it is to devalue the Naira?) and readily available (if only you knew where to go).

To our oga-at-the-top Alausa, we do not know what we have been enjoying and we also do not know what we have been missing. In addition, we also do not know what we are saying by all those regular complaints against and the loads of unappreciation we have been heaping on the enviable Nigerian healthcare system. By extension, we are not built with the mouth to say 'Thank you, sir' to the lot the government is doing to upscale the healthcare delivery system in our dear country. We are just a bunch of alaimoore -- ingrates!

Are you surprised? Why are you shocked? Why is your mouth agape? Oh, you think he is a Don Quixote? Come on, come off it...! Dr Alausa didn't just catch his logic in the air. He has a bully pulpit because he buttressed his elegant contentions with a supremely fine and, again, unassailable example. Wait let me come closer and whisper the example to your ears only -- you know, just like a mosquito would do when he wants to deal with you personally: Dr Tunji Alausa said our healthcare delivery system is so good that no less a personality than our Number One, the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, also gets SOME of his care in Nigeria!

Ehen now! So, if President Tinubu gets some of his care in Nigeria, what more do you need to believe that we have arrived? So, please tell me, what more do you seek as a citizenry? What more do the ever-lamenting doctors and usually-ungrateful and disrespectful nurses really want?! Should our government kill itself for the health sector? Is health the only aspect of our life as a country? Na health we go chop? Why can't Nigerians see all that the government is doing? For instance, Dr Tunji Alausa sometimes dresses in fine suits as a hardworking doctor and minister of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, but you wouldn't know how much he is sweating for you and I under those suits. The fowl perspires too but the feathers conceal the sweat. The monkey sweats too but we cannot see his perspiration because of his hair. So, what really does our health sector need again since Europeans and Africans now come to Nigeria for care while President Tinubu also receives some care in Nigeria and some in Europe? What do you people really want? Besides, Alausa also hinted us that ""We have a President that is well, that is healthy and leading the country in the right direction."" So, what else do you seek?

Interestingly, Honourable Minister, I also ask the same questions o! We are a people who don't appreciate what we have, especially a welfarist public-servant doctor like you. We also fail to appreciate -- either publicly or privately -- the icing on the cake you have served us in a silver platter, which is your monumental service in this almighty administration of a selfless government. We have also failed to see that the cabinet formed by Asiwaju Tinubu, to which you eminently and competently belong, is a pool of imperial, humane, hardworking and selfless men and women, including Beta Edu. We don't appreciate gems when we encounter them. Alaimoore indeed! If not that you granted interviews recently, not many people would have known you to now be disturbing and disrupting your steady march to effective healthcare delivery system. I think we should warn them as we used to: Caution: Slow, Men at Work!

However, I will say, Dr Alausa, don't mind us, sir. We just rant and fret over nothing. We also rant, fret and protest and make trouble for nothing. Once you echo: E lo f'okàn ba'lè 'go and be rest assured' we would be done with our threats and protestations, and continue to bear our cross.

By the way, what do all these threats or protests or strikes or even the eventual japa of doctors, nurses and other health professionals amount to in the estimation of government? Endless complaining coupled with our everyday strike actions can be said to be us acting like angry Mr Goat. What can Mr Goat, who is showing displeasure and outright annoyance by scratching the ground with his foot, do? Will he bite his owner? So, Dr Alausa, we can complain about healthcare and many other things in Nigeria all we like, would we bite our owners? We cannot! We are that helpless and toothless. You and your people know this fact and you exploit it so very well.

My people in the ghetto, our minister has told us that we have 900 'synthetic hospitals' across the 36 states of the country. Do you know the meaning of synthetic hospital? The ones you understand are not upgraded or modernised. Dr Alausa was in the University College Hospital (UCH) in Ibadan earlier this year. He came to check victims of the Ibadan blast brought to UCH and to also assess the damage done to the federal tertiary health institution by the huge blast. He must have learnt that UCH had been in a running battle with Ibadan Electricity Distribution Company (IBEDC). UCH was without public power supply for some time because the IBEDC disconnected electricity supply to UCH! It took a lot of efforts to get the hospital reconnected. Let's leave the effects of that electricity brouhaha out of today's discussion. But, he who feels it knows it.

The minister wants us to agree with him. We do, but by so doing we have turned ""charity begins at home"" on its head. While he didn't give specific figures about the medical tourists to Nigeria, we also wallow in our own thoughts as to how many Nigerians have access to correct basic healthcare here. How are our hospitals in the big cities faring in terms of personnel and equipment? Forget about the ones in the smaller towns. It is also a thing to wonder about that people would buy flight tickets in a place like, say Denmark, to come to Nigeria to undergo a surgery procedure. Could the people Dr Alausa was talking about be Europeans or Indians that require emergency care? It rankles the brain really, but we don't know what he knows.

We are not in doubt of the minister's words, because he is a US-trained physician, but they also sound illogical and are countering reason. All the equipment and nearly all the drugs we use here or their components are imported. Nigeria's health indicators don't appear appealing enough to attract medical tourism, the type Dr Alausa and co love to embark on. Or, could it be that our minister is talking about Nigerians and others who take treatments when they visit home on vacation? Minister Alausa, we need you to tell us more, sir.

In the meantime, we want to say thank you very much for helping us to appreciate what we have and what we don't have. You know we lack any form of ambulance service; you know we don't have a working health insurance system. You know how it id in the United States of America where you trained after University of Lagos. It would be interesting to hear what you'd say in comparison of the two healthcare systems.

Well, thankfully, Nigerians are a very peaceful (or is it docile?) people. Otherwise, if, like China, Nigeria kills a chimpanzee and show its corpse to the other rampaging chimpanzees, we might have some level of sanctity among our political leaders. We would also experience verbal sanity among Nigerian leaders.

The agreement - between Belgium, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Denmark and Norway - will standardize requirements placed on autonomous vessels sailing in the North Sea. With international regulations still pending for the emerging market, the five countries will set their own technological standards.

Additionally, the countries committed to sharing knowledge with the goal of developing autonomous shipping technology. That could benefit maritime infrastructure in the North Sea, such as offshore wind farms.

""This collaboration can help to establish a new international market for the Norwegian maritime industry,"" Marianne Sivertsen, Norway's minister of Fisheries and Oceans, said. ""The Norwegian maritime industry is far ahead in the development of autonomous solutions.""

Similar to self-driving cars, autonomous vessels can function independently based on artificial intelligence and continuous collection of data. Like self-driving cars, they're manned by operators who control and monitor the ships and intervene if they sail into complications at sea.

Guided by a person sitting in front of a screen in a control room on land, autonomous ships can deliver cargo between nations and continents without a crew. This setup could fundamentally change how maritime vessels are designed and built. Smaller ships - such as those with no need for crew space, for example - require less fuel, resulting in a reduced carbon footprint.

The global autonomous ships market had revenues of more than $89 million USD in 2021. That number is projected to annually grow by 6.81% through 2031, according to Straits Research, a global market research and consulting company.

With the agreement, Norway aims to secure its pole position in the autonomous shipping industry. The technology has taken off in recent years amid worldwide competition, with huge potential for economic gain.

Some of the vessels don't use fossil fuels at all. Already, autonomous ships fueled by electricity are delivering cargo between Norwegian cities.

Kongsberg Maritime, a Norwegian tech firm, estimates the ships could bring big savings, including on energy usage. The company is currently operating two autonomous vessels across the Oslo fjord in Norway. Each trip takes less than an hour, cutting around two million kilometers (around 1.2 million miles) worth of drive times and saving 5000 metric tons (5511 tons) of CO2 a year.

As Norway sails ahead, other nations are catching wind of what is likely to become the future of the maritime industry.

On the other side of the globe, South Korea launched its first containership for autonomous operations in March and aims to demonstrate long-distance autonomous shipping later this year, the U.S. trade magazine Maritime Executive reported.

Back in 2022, the Japanese autonomous containership Suzaku also completed an 800-kilometer, 497-mile journey through the traffic-congested Tokyo Bay.

Assisted by an AI system, the ship completed 99% of the 40-hour-long trip without human intervention. By itself, it was able to make 107 maneuvers to avoid collisions, the Danish trade magazine Ingeniren reported.

The U.S. Navy has also successfully tested unmanned ships. In addition, Boston-based Sea Machine in 2021 tested small autonomous ships off the Danish coast, touting its tech as ready for long-distance voyages.",industriesnews.net,news,industriesnews.net,,0.3960784313725489,453084516,4,,

The turnover continued to grow to 2.9 billion euro, a record in the history of the Group.

This led to an increase in EBITDA with 39% to 610 million euro or 21% on turnover, globally resulting in a strong profit of 296 million euro. These growth figures were achieved in a balanced manner through various innovative projects and reflect the operational efficiency of our teams across all divisions. This despite the current economic and geopolitical turmoil in several parts of the world.

2023 was also the year in which our next-gen offshore installation vessels, Les Alizés and Voltaire, were deployed on their first projects and where Jan De Nul Group ordered an innovative, XL cable-laying vessel, the Fleeming Jenkin.

Looking forward, Jan De Nul Group started the year 2024 with an unprecedentedly high order book of 8.9 billion euro, an increase of 38% compared to last year. These projects are again well spread across all divisions of the Group.

With this impressive orderbook, our characteristic innovative boldness supported by excellent financial structure, and our 'impossible is not possible' mentality, we started 2024 with full confidence.

ACTIVITIES IN 2023

77% of Jan De Nul Group's turnover was achieved by its maritime divisions.

Coastal and shore protection, port infrastructure works, maintaining, deepening or widening waterways as well as land reclamation, are key solutions offered by the dredging division of Jan De Nul Group. In 2023, a multitude of projects was carried out around the world.

Coastal and shore protection works were carried out in Knokke, Belgium, in the form of beach replenishments. In Bangladesh, Jan De Nul Group continued the capital and maintenance dredging works for the access channels to the new Payra Port. Jan De Nul Group was also active in the Middle East, amongst others, for the deepening of the access channels to the port of Jebel Dhanna. In Latin America, Jan De Nul Group is operating and maintaining the access channel to the port terminals of Guayaquil in Ecuador, this under a 25-year concession contract. Port infrastructure works were carried out in the Port of Gdynia, in Poland.

The offshore division deployed its newly delivered next-gen offshore vessels on their first projects. Jack-up installation vessel Voltaire is transporting and installing 277 turbines for the Dogger Bank A, B and C offshore wind farms, while heavy lift vessel Les Alizés is performing the transport and installation of 107 foundations and 1 offshore substation in Germany for the Gode Wind 3 and Borkum Riffgrund 3 offshore wind farms.

An example of our cable installation expertise is shown in the UK. During the summer, a 33 kV-interconnector cable was installed in the Pentland Firth seaway, between the Orkney-island of Hoy and the Scottish mainland. Where necessary, the cable was buried by our trencher Swordfish or protected by rock bags installed by multipurpose vessel Adhémar de Saint-Venant.

Buildings, foundations, transport related infrastructures, water related infrastructures, these are but some of the wide variety of solutions offered by the construction division. Jan De Nul Group focuses on complex design and engineering projects, executed for private and public clients while participating in Public Private Partnerships (PPP). The construction projects remain a constant and solid part of Jan De Nul Group.

In 2023, the construction started on the infrastructure to house and maintain the new F-35 fighter jets. Two identical air force bases are being built, one in Florennes and one in Kleine-Brogel.

Jan De Nul Group was also active on infrastructure works along the highway E40 between Ghent and Brussels. Together with its partner, Jan De Nul Group is replacing two bridges: one of the E40 over the railroad and another over the E40. Furthermore, the Group is participating in the construction of the Oosterweel link, through the construction of the Scheldt tunnel (COTU), which is the connecting element in the link that closes the Antwerp Ring Road, and the Right Bank link (ROCO), which forms the link between the Scheldt tunnel and the R1 both in Northern and Eastern directions.

The environmental division, Envisan, is an important player on the Belgian market. This division has comprehensive experience in handling polluted sites both by remediation in situ or excavation and transportation of the polluted material to one of the Group's six valorisation centres in Belgium and France. Major projects in 2023 include the construction of PFAS water treatment plants and soil remediation for the Oosterweel link and environmental dredging and remediation works in the Walloon region.

PSR, the brownfield development specialist remains focused on the reconversion of polluted sites. In 2023, PSR continued its endeavours with the development of several projects in Belgium amongst others the Albertplein in Knokke, Rives Ardentes in Liege and Malt in Mechelen.

GEOGRAPHICAL PRESENCE

This year Jan De Nul Group undertook 371 projects around the globe. Europe, where all divisions of Jan De Nul Group are traditionally active, represents a strong 44% share of the Group's turnover. Asia and the Middle East was good for 33% of the Group's turnover. A 21% share in turnover was attained by the Americas, while Africa contributed 2%.

HIGH SOLVENCY AND NET CASH POSITION

Traditionally, Jan De Nul Group demonstrates a strong solvency ratio. Also this year the solvency ratio amounted to almost 60%. The Group's equity climbed now to almost 3.4 billion euro, showing a year-to-year increase of 9.6%.

Additionally, the Group's liquidity position remained strong, even after the continuous innovations and investment in new assets. This is demonstrated by a net cash position of 520 million euro. Jan De Nul Group has now been net debt-free for the last ten years. This rock-solid financial structure is a major competitive asset of Jan De Nul Group.

CONTINUOUS INVESTMENT PROGRAMME IN AN IMPRESSIVE AND UNIQUE FLEET

Jan De Nul Group shapes water and land. Therefore, based on the vision to create unique solutions worldwide, connect communities and improve infrastructure, the company continues to invest in the specialized and innovative fleet of tomorrow.

· The Group once again confirmed its contribution to a green future with the order of a pioneering XL cable-laying vessel Fleeming Jenkin. With an unmatched cable-laying capacity of 28,000 tons, this vessel will support the energy and cable industry by installing cables over longer distances and in deeper waters. In addition, state-of-the-art green technologies make the vessel a future-proof asset: ULEv technology, engines that can run on both biofuel and green methanol and a 2,500 kWh energy storage system; these all allow Fleeming Jenkin to operate with remarkably low NOx and greenhouse gas emissions. Fleeming Jenkin is scheduled for delivery in 2026.

· The offshore jack-up installation vessel Voltaire was delivered in late 2022. In 2023, the vessel launched her first mission to transport and install 277 wind turbines for the Dogger Bank offshore wind farm in the United Kingdom.

· The heavy lift vessel Les Alizés was delivered early 2023. Immediately upon delivery, the vessel's mission equipment was installed in Poland. Specifically, an automated monopile handling system was installed on board, consisting of a set of cradles, a skidding system and an upending hinge to handle the XXL monopiles on board. After this, Les Alizés started her first mission to transport and install 107 foundations and 1 offshore substation for the German offshore wind farms Gode Wind 3 and Borkum Riffgrund 3.

Moreover, 2024 will bring more investment opportunities. Currently our in-house newbuilding department has various investment proposals on its drawing board, both for offshore and dredging innovations.

UNPRECEDENTED ORDER BOOK OF 8.9 BILLION EURO

Continuously investing in innovative solutions with the newest sustainable technologies remains key. Combined with its skilled people and in-house technical knowhow, Jan De Nul Group stays focused on the future. This is reflected in Jan De Nul Group's unprecedented order book of 8.9 billion euro, an impressive increase of 38% compared to last year.

Jan De Nul Group has a well-spread project portfolio, including several major projects:

Dredging and offshore activities

· Jan De Nul Group has signed an agreement with RWE for the long-term chartering of its next-generation installation vessels. This to support the future RWE renewable offshore windfarm projects.

· In the first half of 2023, Jan De Nul Group, together with its consortium partners, have been awarded a 525 kV HVDC cable system portfolio for the German electricity Grid by TenneT. Jan De Nul's scope includes the transport, installation, and protection of the cables in the Wadden Sea, nearshore, and offshore sections for the cable system packages of BalWin 4, LanWin 1 and LanWin 5. The offshore operations will start in 2026. The combined DC cable length of the awarded portfolio is almost 2,000 km.

· The Belgian consortium TM Edison, in which Jan De Nul Group participates, was awarded the construction of the world's first artificial energy island, the Princess Elisabeth island. The island's high-voltage infrastructure will bundle the wind farm export cables of the Princess Elisabeth zone in the North Sea, whilst also serving as a hub for future interconnectors with Great Britain (Nautilus) and Denmark (TritonLink). In order to successfully deliver this project, Jan De Nul Group will integrate the expertise from its different divisions: offshore, dredging and civil construction.

· In the United Kingdom, Jan De Nul Group is responsible for the transport and installation of the GE Haliade-X offshore wind turbines at the Dogger Bank offshore wind farm, 130 km off the Yorkshire coast. The transport and installation of the turbines in a period of three consecutive years started in 2023. The 3.6 GW Dogger Bank wind farm, which will be delivered in three 1.2 GW North Sea phases, will be the world's largest offshore wind farm upon completion and is a joint venture between SSE Renewables and Equinor. Once completed, Dogger Bank will generate enough energy to power more than 4.5 million households each year, which is about 5% of the UK's electricity needs.

· At the end of 2021, a joint venture of Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO), Electricité de France (EDF) and Kyushu Electric Power Japan has awarded a HVDC cable installation and convertors package for the ADNOC-TAQA Lightning Project in Abu Dhabi (UAE) to a consortium composed of Jan De Nul Group and Samsung C&T. Jan De Nul Group is in charge of the design, installation, burial and protection of two cable clusters of almost 1,000 km in total, connecting the islands Al Ghallan and Das in the Arabian Gulf to the onshore converter stations at Al Mirfa and Shuweihat.

· In Ecuador, Jan De Nul Group holds a concession for the deepening and maintenance of the 95-kilometer long access channel to the port of Guayaquil. Having completed the deepening in 2019, Jan De Nul Group continues with the maintenance and the operation of the channel for the next 20 years.

· In the United Arab Emirates, Jan De Nul Group is actively working for multiple large dredging and reclamation projects.

· Mid-2022, Jan De Nul Group was awarded the EPCI contract for the expansion of the existing Terminal Cuenca del Plata in Montevideo, Uruguay. In the course of 2023, Jan De Nul Group started with the construction of a second container yard and a second quay wall.

· In Guyana, Jan De Nul Group participates in the project of Vreed-en-Hoop, which entails the dredging, reclamation, construction of a new shorebase, quay wall and access road and revetment works. This project is part of a master plan to help Guyana meet its strategic priorities to boost its economy along with helping the country expand key shipping and shorebase facilities to meet industry requirements.

Construction and environmental projects

· Jan De Nul Group is part of the Scheldt tunnel construction and the Right Bank link of the Oosterweel project in Belgium. The Scheldt tunnel is the most important connecting element in the Oosterweel link and closes the Antwerp Ring Road on the north side. The tunnel has a total length of 1,800 m and will be built according to the 'immersed tube' method. Eight tunnel elements of approximately 60,000 tonnes each will be built in the inner port of Zeebrugge and then towed to Antwerp via the North Sea and the Western Scheldt, where they will be immersed in a pre-dredged trench in the river Scheldt.

· A new prison in Antwerp, Belgium, is under construction by Jan De Nul Group and its partner EEG. This project is part of the federal government's detention masterplan. The new correctional facility in Antwerp will replace the existing obsolete Begijnenstraat jail and will offer space for 440 detainees. The construction of the detention center is a public-private partnership whereby the Hortus Conclusus consortium takes care of the design, build, finance and maintenance of the new jail.

· Jan De Nul Group was engaged by the Belgian Ministry of Defence to provide new infrastructure to house and maintain the new F-35 fighter jets. The Group is building two identical air force bases to house and support the new high-tech F-35 aircraft, one in Florennes and one in Kleine-Brogel. Currently, the construction of the base in Florennes is ongoing, after which the construction of the base in Kleine-Brogel will be kicked off in order to keep the impact on the military operations at both bases under control.

· SPI.R0, a consortium in which Jan De Nul Group participates, was selected for the refurbishment of the traffic interchange on the Brussels Ring at Brussels Airport, Belgium. Thanks to this project, the traffic interchange between the Ring (R0) and the Leopold III avenue (A201) will now take place across one bridge over the Ring.

With the glories of online recordings and AI transcription tools, it's relatively easy to share both the transcript, and also the slides that I used, so I'm making a habit of it.

Most recently, I delivered a talk and held a Q&A session covering my thoughts on a very aggressive grid expansion and optimization for India, focusing on technologies like HVDC, smart dynamic line rating solutions like Heimdahl's magic ball, and modern composite conductors. For those who prefer talk-talk to read-read, here's the recorded video of the presentation and discussion.

Thank you very much for this third edition of this webinar series on climate action that will work. As I said in the introduction of the previous two sessions, at the cost of repeating myself, I would like to reiterate that most of the studies say 2 billion machines that are today running on heat or fossil fuel will get converted into electricity. So electrification of these 2 billion machines around the globe in the next three to four decades would require tripling of our electricity capacity and all the new generation resources which are going to be mostly solar and wind and how do we make them from millions of kilometers, thousands of kilometers away from the loads and the solar farms and the wind farms, what electrons are produced, we have to make it available to the load centers, to the electric vehicles, to the factories, to the offices to the industry, so many places we need to build new grid.

As I said in the previous webinars, the BNEF estimate of November 2023 is that we have to build about 80 million transmission and distribution lines at an estimated cost of $21 trillion in the next 25 years, which is a very tall target and at the same time huge business opportunity.

I would like to take a minute to talk about what India has done. For solar and wind we have about 135 and 237 gigawatts. Wind was built in the last two decades, but most of the solar was built in the last one decade. We have been very successful in moving power generated from the large solar farms and wind farms which are in the northern, western, and southern parts of the country to any part of India.

We have more than 100 gigawatts of inter regional power transfer capacity. That's a transmission planning which India has done. We operate 800 kV HVDC lines, 500 kV HVDC lines, and 765 kV and 400 kV AC lines which are the backbone of the India grid, which covers 3 million km², connecting over 300 million customers and operating in one frequency with a total installed capacity close to 430 gigawatts.

What we have done at the time, when we looked at a big ambitious plan for renewable energy development that was some ten years ago, we looked at for movement of power from large solar farms and wind farms, which are more concentrated towards the west and north and southern part of the country, some eight to ten states. We have to build high capacity transmission corridors, so we call them green corridors. The first phase of green corridors we completed, the second phase we are doing. And these green corridors are not the regular transmission lines because we have the government of India providing viability gap funding. Many of these lines may not be running at full capacity 24/7 because solar generation and wind generation, the capacity utilization factor is in the range of below 20%.

Power Grid Corporation of India is a government-owned company, majority-owned by government, it's otherwise on the stock market. Power Grid Corporation of India planned and built these green corridors, mostly 400 kV some places to 20 kV transmission lines and substations, bringing them connecting the wind farms and solar farms to the main polling stations for which government of India has given viability of funding. This was a major step, a visionary step taken by India so we don't have much of curtailment, in fact almost zero curtailment of power from wind farms and solar farms.

Another thing which we have done is we also set up renewable energy management centers (REMC). They are equipped with sophisticated tools for weather forecasting and they are helping our system operators to forecast generation from solar and wind more accurately. Typically what they do a day, minus two. Today, what we estimate is for Saturday, what is the generation from each of the solar and wind facilities on Saturday we estimate today to give it to the power system operators. And tomorrow, with better data, weather data we fine-tune it. During the day on Saturday, we will do intraday mitigation measures.

As I said, 3 million km² is operating as one grid. The larger the control area, the better it is for addressing the changes in the generation pattern according to the changing weather. This is something which we have done much better than many of the developed countries and power system planners and operators are most welcome to use as an example.

Without taking much of your time, I will hand over to Michael, who will take you through today's session where he'll be talking about HVDC. India started with HVDC way back in 1989 -- the first HVDC bipolar and back to back station was commissioned in those days about 30 years before.

ISGF has been talking of late about the SCADA systems, which you have, it measures only the electrical parameters. That is not enough with the changing weather pattern. We need to measure the physical dimensions. And the atmospheric conditions as well need to come into our SCADA systems. After Michael's presentation, I will request one of our advisors and working group chair, Mister Ravi Siddhabad. He's also incidentally based out of Toronto in Canada. He's on the call. I will request him to talk for about five minutes about what we are talking about. The new generation of SCADA, where physical parameters and weather parameters will be added in addition to the electrical parameters. That's where the latest work is going on. And something about the smart balls. Michael is also going to talk about it, how we in real-time monitor the temperature of the wires and then accordingly load that.

Over to you, Michael, for an interesting session.

Michael Barnard: Thank you, Reji, as always, thank you to you and the ISGF for allowing me to share what I can to assist India in this marvelous journey.

Getting right back to the basics, as we consider electrification, right now there are many places where we have a bottle of gas sitting beside a house and that's providing cooking heat and hot water. We are not going to have that in the future. We're going to have heat pumps that require electricity. We have to think about the grid as an incredibly fractal thing. We think about this massive transmission network, some of the stuff that Reji was talking about with the green corridors, and then we get down to the highest voltage distribution lines, then we get down to the local lines, then we get down to the lines and buildings. It spreads out like the roots of a tree.

It requires the same heartbeat, it requires the same frequency, it requires reliability, it requires the same voltage. When people plug something into the wall plug, it just needs to work. That's not trivial to do, but it's provably easy to do with renewables. If we take Denmark and Germany especially, because it's a more highly populated, more industrialized country, they're over 60% of electricity from renewables these days, and they have a grid reliability of 13 minutes of outages per customer per year on average. That's kind of a level set. If we look at North America, it's averaging about 2 hours of outages per customer per year. We look at Kenya, it's much worse.

But it's all entirely possible. There's nothing about renewables that prevents this. The stuff that Reji was talking about, the two-day-ahead weather forecasting across broad geographical regions to enable grid planning decisions and merit order, stuff that requires transmission. I'm going to be talking about the top layer of this, the transmission layer, today.

There are some really basic value propositions about broad grids. If you have a narrow, constrained geography like one of your states, and you only did grid planning in there, and you only did renewables in there, well, you'd need more renewables and other forms of low carbon generation in order to balance out a greater percentage of those per capita. Similarly, for storage and other backup, you need more backup and storage if you're geographically constrained. Similarly, other ancillary services of frequency and voltage management.

But as you get to that concept of continent-scale grids, like all of India and India plus, then you balance these things out. You find an optimization where you are trading off transmission for generation, for storage, and for ancillary service management. You can find that optimization.

I'll talk about a study out of Africa that talks about that, and it's similar to the studies that India has done, but it means that we have to look at some of the older studies, especially. A lot of them were constrained to small geographies like a US state, and said, well, obviously renewables won't work because they'll be very expensive because they intentionally constrained the geography. We have to think bigger with renewables, as Reji points out.

This diagram is from the global energy interconnection and development and cooperation organization, GEIDCO. It's a China-led, China-created organization with 141 member states, which overlap significantly with the Belt and Road Initiative member states. The ISGF is a member organization in GEIDCO, as are hundreds of other organizations that focus on electricity in grids globally. What they propose is truly a global grid.

You can see India has solar power, wind power, and hydropower bases, and it's connected to the rest of Asia, east and west conceptually. This is the way we need to start thinking about it. Oceania down here in Australia starts being connected into Indonesia. Right now there is a HVDC project called Sun Cable that is expecting to bring electricity into Singapore here, where I lived for a couple of years, simply because Singapore is the richest of the ASEAN nations by far. It's a tiny nation, but it's incredibly wealthy.

As we look at this, you know, what we start seeing is, oh, well, when India is looking at its wind and solar capacity, as in its two days ahead, in the future it'll start being able to have conversations with eastern Africa and Central Asia and the ASEAN nations to start finding ways to supplement, to share excess electricity during the day and to supplement peak demand periods from further abroad.

I like to say that HVDC is the new pipeline. I also say it's the new oil tanker and the LNG tanker. As one of the data points on that, last year we had about 911 very large crude carriers -- the biggest oil tankers -- in operation, and they last only about 25 to 30 years. In any given year, you'd expect 25 or 30 of them to be on order, but only one was on order. The maritime shipping industry knows that oil and gas is going away. 40% of the bulk shipping is of fossil fuels.

We're going to be displacing a lot of that with high voltage direct current transmission, but not nearly as much energy for the simple reason that we can generate a lot more electricity locally. Countries that are poor in fossil fuel resources still have the sun and wind, and so they can generate a lot more locally.

Secondarily, the point of electrify everything everywhere all at once is that an electric pathway from renewables to electric energy services is vastly more efficient than fossil fuels to any services. It's three to six times more efficient to use electricity directly to do something than to use fossil fuels. We don't need as much energy to deliver the same economic and comfort value. We can generate a lot more of it locally, but we still have to share some across borders. HVDC is the mechanism by which that occurs more than not.

For context on HVDC, India has, as you can see, a tremendous number of projects, but it's a global thing. HVDC is literally everywhere. High voltage direct current was originally created by ABB in Sweden. The 75th anniversary of the first installation was last year, I think, to give you a sense of how old that was.

A lot of it was built on the old LCC stuff where it was just big massive plates that were converting between two AC services. They're back to back conversions. One of the first 1st uses of HVDC was to say, okay, we've got a grid region here with one frequency and a grid region here with another frequency. Let's put some HVDC here to have an asynchronous transmission of power between two synchronous grids, so that we can avoid having to match frequency. That's a very useful purpose. As we look at Japan over here, a lot of Japan's HVDC is back to back.

But now we have VSC, which basically digitizes the signal matching. It's a very efficient mechanism that is much more efficient at moving between grids and moving between frequencies. That's one of the key advantages of high voltage direct current, is it doesn't care what the frequency is on either end. The transformer stations match the frequency at either end.

We're starting to see tremendous efficiencies, another advantage of HVDC. One of the biggest transmission lines in China is seeing 1.5% losses over 1000 km. This is a tremendous efficiency for transmission. It's viable because just like high voltage alternating current, the more juice you put through a wire, the better it is in terms of its efficiency, all else being equal. They're proving what can be done. They have 12-gigawatt connectors coming in from the Three Gorges dam into the demand centers over here. There's a tremendous amount of potential with this technology.

As you can see, to Reji's point, India has more high voltage direct current than all of the United States, a full 50% more. India has done a much better job than North America and mostly Europe as well, such as the green corridor transmission. The number of stories out of the developed world about interconnect queues that are a decade long for new renewables projects is indicative that the western world lost track, that the grid is absolutely essential to this transition. Good on India for not losing track of that.

Reji talked about India's efforts with the full national grid. We have the basic regions. Lots of interconnect work has been done. We're now starting to see 1,200 kilovolt and 2 gigawatts as fairly standard for interconnectors. For HVDC, we're starting to see it really ramping up in terms of scale. When I talked to the head of HVDC for DNV, the global firm which does standards for HVDC as for all of energy systems, for shipping, for pipelines, and for transmission, he says 2 gigawatts is the standard now. We're starting to see bigger and bigger because HVDC is not limited in the same way that HVAC transmission is -- high voltage alternating current. Because of the way the alternating current works, little eddies show up in the transmission, and they mean that more and more, it's only the skin of the line that has electricity flowing through it. With HVDC, it doesn't have those effects, so the entirety of the conductor's three dimensional space is actually conducting electricity. Tremendously useful in that regard.

Further, HVDC generates a lot lower magnetic fields and so interacts with its surroundings a lot less. That is part of why it has much lower resistance than HVAC, especially underwater or underground. One of the reasons that offshore wind farms are all connected with HVDC is because you don't lose nearly as much to resistance because the magnetic field is interacting with the water the cable is passing through.

India is doing a good job. It can do more, and it will need to do more because, as Reji said, there's a lot more power that has to go through these things. India is ahead of the game in terms of starting that expansion. This is another place where India is leapfrogging the west, but it still has a lot more to do.

I put this together just to give a bit of an idea of some of the constraints. I looked at the depths of the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal to see if it was possible to connect easily to Malaysia and to Indonesia. And it's not. The Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea are very deep bodies of water. Tight now we are putting HVDC subsea cables down to quite significant depths, as low as a couple of kilometers. But the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea are very deep bodies of water, as you probably know.

The point here is that there's an opportunity for bigger, broader backbones to get further across India and to get into the ASEAN region and Africa. This becomes viable because while India is a big country, I think 7th largest square kilometers in the world, it's not a wide country, it's longer. It's longer top to bottom than east to west. What that means is that eastern sunshine is not that different in terms of time of energy than western sunshine. You can't move electricity from sunshine as easily as the United States can, as China can or as Canada can, because they're broader countries. We have five and a half time zones in Canada, for example, in our absurdly broad country. We also have all of our population within 160 kilometers of the border because the rest of the country is very cold and full of biting insects and large bears. It's mostly inhospitable and empty.

What I suggest is get over here into Oman, then you get into the African grid and that's a viable depth for transmission. Get over here into Myanmar, you've already got interconnectors into Bangladesh and Nepal, you'll be growing those. Grow big connectors east and west at the top, get down to Sri Lanka and then you can start sharing the resources more globally.

As the previous slide showed, you have connectors between the grid regions, but you don't have a big one going all the way from top to bottom or east to west right now. I'm suggesting that's something to think about when we talk about grid in the future. In the future, electrifying everything, we really have to think big.

Here's an example of thinking big and something that is an opportunity. A couple of years ago, a group of Chinese and African energies researchers published a study which looked at putting a big HVDC backbone 12,000 km across twelve countries from sub-Saharan western Africa across into Ethiopia and fairly affluent Kenya, then down that coast into affluent South Africa. They modeled out a mix of generation capacity, both legacy fossil, but also renewables and other stuff, and grid storage that they would put across this interconnector and have it flow north and south as generation opportunities occurred, east and west as solar opportunities occurred. What they found is that mixed grid, a mixed set of generation across those grids was quite reasonable economically.

But there's a problem, and I'm not sure India solved this problem, so I hope somebody will share this with me. They're using European-developed software. This is an African-Chinese initiative under GEIDCO and with Belt and Road eyes on it, which gives it some likelihood of potentially happening, but they had to force the software to do unnatural acts, because most of this grid management software and grid planning software for analysis of these types is really constrained to a country, or one of those regional grids.

It also had limits in terms of the types of storage. It had limits in terms of the types of generation that you could put on, the number of units of generation. It's like Simcity. If anybody ever played Simcity, I just found it distressingly simplistic in terms of the options for electricity and stuff like that.

Even the most sophisticated software struggles with this breadth of terrain and grid solutions. It's certainly not a computational resources problem, but it does require working hard to figure out what that really broad vision is and how you're going to interconnect into it.

My assertion is that 45 of 46 sub-Saharan countries in Africa, that's 45 of 55 total countries in Africa, are members of the Belt and Road Initiative. China is the global leader in HVDC. India is doing an amazing job, but as always, in these cases, when we look at China, it's mind-boggling how much they built. They have their own HVDC technologies. They have their own HVDC cable plants. They have their own VSC technologies.

Every major player like Hitachi, which bought the HVDC portion of ABB a few years ago, has manufacturing facilities in China, as well as in the United States, as well as in Mexico and Europe, so it can avoid some concerns about Chinese technologies.

The point there is that China's technology is probably going to be dominating in sub-Saharan Africa, because that's part of the Belt and Road. New customers for Chinese technologies and locking in resource value propositions, especially for the resources of the future. There's a reason that China has a lock on about 80% of processing of all battery minerals, because the Belt and Road Initiative went in and developed the countries that had those battery minerals, so they could extract them, share the benefits with the local region, and move on.

This then becomes a key pathway for sub-Saharan Africa becoming affluent and also becoming a region for India to connect with, to share electricity across broader east west pieces. Ethiopian sunshine could be powering New Delhi's nightlife, and similarly, nighttime electricity in India in 15 years could be powering Kenya. There's a really interesting opportunity to start thinking more broadly.

This is an older chart from the supergrid organization. Once again, it's talking about how we connect Delhi, Mumbai and Bhutan, the Gobi desert wind farms, the major demand centers of Beijing and Shanghai, and down into Indonesia, the Philippines. These are all very accessible solutions.

When I assess Japan, it's fascinating to see how resistant they are to doing the really obvious thing, because they have very shallow, accessible waters to South Korea, mainland China, and into Russia right now. Vladivostok is a long way from Moscow, so it's less likely to be a bad actor in that regard.

All energy imports and exports are already at risk of global disruption. We saw that with the energy crisis in Europe a couple of years ago after Russia invaded Ukraine. Hedging is done for all energy imports now, when we start interconnecting with other countries, no matter how fractious the relationship frequently is. I believe that there's some fractious relationships between India and neighboring countries that India has been managing since 1947. Those fractious relationships don't mean you don't trade with them. It does mean that when you look at an interconnector for electricity, which is benefiting both, enabling more communication with both, providing economic value for both, you do want to hedge for potential for that connector to be turned off or turned down, just as Nord Stream one and two were turned down by Russia early in the war and then somebody blew them up. I still think it's Russia, but all the investigations have been able to determine is that it was most likely a state actor, but not which state.

Hedging for disruption of your energy services is something we do now and something we'll continue to do in the future.

We already have a lot of transmission of all types globally. India's built a lot. It has a lot of high voltage alternating current, and it has a lot of HVDC, and they have operating parameters. Here's a really interesting thing that's occurring now. Historically, transmission lines have been a core of steel strands because steel is strong, surrounded by strands of aluminum, because aluminum conducts electricity really well and is light. The combination means it doesn't sag too much and it transmits electricity.

But there are a couple of problems with that. One is that both steel and aluminum sag more when they get hotter, and further, the aluminum is unannealed in legacy transmission. As it gets hotter, it anneals, and its efficiency starts to change. The operating parameters start to change.

What we have in advanced conductors is a core of composite materials, carbon fiber, which is incredibly strong, doesn't sag, and is very light. It's lighter and stronger than steel. You don't need it to transmit electricity. We need it for the flexibility, lack of sag, and we want it for lightness. Aluminum is used instead of copper in transmission lines because aluminum is lighter than copper. It really matters when we're putting up pylons and spanning wires across hundreds of meters, that the wires be as light as possible. Secondarily, we change the way that we construct the wires with trapezoidal strands of fully annealed aluminum. What that means is, if they get hot, they don't change the way they operate.

We're starting to see multiple vendors now delivering this. What does that mean? It means if we have existing pylons and lower generation in places that are heat impacted, especially, or places where there's wildfire concerns, well, we can replace the existing line with a higher capacity advanced conductor, and we can get twice the electrical generation through the same transmission corridor across the same pylons.

Further, those conductors will be less subject to sag and less subject to heat extremes, causing degradation of performance. Reconductoring existing lines is this fascinating thing where we start to see significant, rapid improvement. We already have the pylons. We're just replacing the lines with lines of equal weight but greater capacity. The engineering enables us to boost those things, so all the high voltage alternating current lines that India already has could become twice the capacity, potentially even three times.

For new lines, there's another opportunity. New lines pylons can be further apart because once again, it's lighter and doesn't sag as much. So if you put pylons further apart, this more expensive conductor, combined with fewer pylons, can be cheaper overall for new high voltage alternating current transmission lines. The combination means we're starting to see replacement of existing alternating current, and we're going to be able to get a tremendous percentage of our new electricity transmission needs just by putting new wires on old pylons. Tremendous opportunity there, and I'll talk about why that's really fascinating as well, a little bit in terms of risk.

So, once again, replace conductors on existing wires with better ones, which are more fire and heat resistant. So as their temperature extremes increase, as more fires increase, advanced conductors reduce the risk associated with those.

As Reji said, we have to know more closely what's happening with those real lines. This one happens to be from Heimdall. There are a lot of smarter grid components. This is what they call the magic ball. They actually call it a Neuron, like the brain neuron, and it can be deployed by drone. An operator on the ground has a heavy lift drone, flies it up, drops the magic ball on the wire and it clamps on. It takes electricity from the wire through inductance charging, tiny fractions, just electronics and sensors, and there is a heat sensor in there. What it can do is say the line is this temperature right now, and then it has a mesh network which enables it to send data back to the control centers that are managing the transmission lines, and in some cases, the higher voltage distribution lines as well.

That tells the operators exactly what the temperature is, which means they can actually run near the engineering limits, as opposed to the rule of thumb conservative limits. They've actually seen, just by putting these in place with some customers, up to 30% throughput gains on existing lines. Just by putting this in place and getting the data back to the control centers, they can actually put more through. In one case, they had twin lines. They decommissioned one line entirely because it was unnecessary, because the throughput of the single line with more efficient management enabled them to achieve that.

A recent study out of the United States found that 85% of all new electrical transmission requirements could be met by reconductoring and sensors like Heimdall's Neuron magic ball. Where there are robust grids today, they may not be in the right places in all cases, but in a lot of cases, just by making them bigger with reconductoring and managing them more effectively with more sensors on the transmission wires, and getting that data in real time can actually enable them to achieve the end result without building tremendous number of new pylons, because new pylons are frequently problematic.

I want to keep touching on hydrogen. There are a lot of studies that are being done now saying that hydrogen pipelines will carry a lot more energy than high voltage direct current. And they keep making a bunch of the same mistakes. They mistake exergy and energy. Electricity can do work. Hydrogen can produce heat. Heat is not the same as work. Heat is valuable where you need heat. But when you need electricity and you've got heat, you lose 70% of the energy heat just because that's how thermal generation works. Electricity has high exergy, the ability to do work. Heat has low exergy.

Similarly, heat pumps are vastly more efficient than hydrogen or natural gas heaters, three times as efficient, and you have to put a lot more electricity into that. They also make a mistake saying, well, the pipeline goes from A to B. Right now we have pipelines from A to B, transmission pipelines, because we have natural gas fields with massive amounts of natural gas here. We have a massive demand center there. In the future, creating green hydrogen requires lots and lots and lots of broad geographical renewables assets. Why would we build transmission into the end of this hydrogen pipeline as opposed to where the energy is actually needed in more of a mesh grid type of perspective.

I've published on this a few times. You can look up my articles on CleanTechnica to find why the studies which assert hydrogen pipelines are better are flawed in multiple ways. They're starting to get better, but there's some German groupthink which is preventing some rational thought and good analysis coming out of Europe.

A little over two years ago, Bent Flyvbjerg and Dan Gardner reached out to me and said, hey, Mike, we're publishing a book based on Bent Flyvbjerg's work over the past 25 years. Your material on the natural experience of nuclear versus renewables in China is amazing. We'd like to include it in our chapter nine. I said, well, sure, okay. I didn't actually know who Bent Flyvbjerg was when they reached out, but I looked him up and I found out that he's a global megaprojects expert. He and his team out of Europe have been assembling data sets, high quality data sets on megaprojects, billion dollar plus projects for over 25 years. They have over 16,000 projects in their data set now.

They captured the initial budget, the initial schedule, and the projected benefits, and they captured the end cost, the end schedule, and the actual benefits across all 16,000 of those projects. They excluded any projects where they couldn't get high quality data. They grouped them into 25 categories. This chart is sorted from most likely to hit schedule and budget once construction starts to least likely to hit schedule and budget.

I did a little call-out here. Solar, wind, and energy transmission are three of the top four categories of projects that are most likely to hit schedule and budget and to deliver benefits. Flyvbjerg has what he calls the iron law of megaprojects, which is that only 0.5% of megaprojects achieve schedule, budget, and benefits. Well, a lot more of them are solar, wind, and energy transmission than any of the rest. As China or India thinks about nuclear power, it is third from the bottom, and nuclear storage is at the very bottom.

As we think about no regret options, building transmission between wind and solar assets and wind and solar regions is the lowest risk process going forward. Reduction of long-tailed risks and speed to deliver is fundamental to us achieving affluence, achieving electrification, the benefits of electrification, and achieving climate goals.

That's it. Reji, over to you.

Reji Kumar Pillai: Thank you very much, Michael. I would now request Ravi to talk to the evolving SCADA with the physical dimensions and parameters. Over to you, Ravi.

Ravi: Yeah, I think it's fascinating. I was hearing Michael the last time as well, and I think it's teams and thoughts like this that must need to come out to drive policymakers as to where generally sensible work needs to be done. His last slide captures it. In fact, with respect to the top four, he talks of the Heimdall experiment of the Neurons. So in some way, Reji, I mean, thanks to you as you have allowed us to portray thermal inputs as a necessary and sufficient condition for both transmission and distribution. In some ways, four k eighty one is also calling for this, where they're asking for a real-time four-hour forecast of temperature and therefore transmission capability, which would also force some kind of a temperature reading.

If you were to broadly sort the requirement into two or three buckets, the first bucket is the ambient temperature rise. What do we do with existing assets? The theory behind it is, you could just do a rule of thumb and depreciate or derate everything by 15%, but that would be trillions of dollars of balance sheet that gets wiped off utilities. It would make them unviable, literally just in one day. The key question is, how do you manage it? In the last three sessions that our ISUW and distribution utility meet, we've been discussing that we need to manage it. We've got all these access that we built to yesterday's standards, and we need to manage it.

Knowing thermal limits, whether it's a large transformer, large transmission line, or a distribution line, becomes key to knowing when I have pushed it to the limit and when I should not be pushing it to the limit based on what has occurred 4 hours before, based on loading. So that's one.

The second is going forward is as you get more and more renewables, you get volatility in transmission and distribution because of the generation that comes up from time to time. We see that in western India, where 7000 swing currently takes place at least every other month or every three or four times a year. The question is, it has got great transmission, in fact the best in the world, in my view, every other country doesn't match India's interconnectivity, high voltage transmission, but yet it still requires some of these mitigation techniques to say, okay, when can I boost my transmission line capacity?

When would I say it is already fully loaded, I should do something else with it, start another generator or whatever. That volatility is there. In fact, because of renewable energy, at 30, 40, 50% of the total, the volatility continues to rise. That is a second issue.

The third issue is the standards around the world. I sit on some of the IEC standards, including how do we climate proof some of our electrical infrastructure? And it is slow. I'll tell you, it is so slow that if even 10% of Michael's ideas gets implemented, the standards would not change. And you know that, right?

In India, we've been asking for BIS to come in and actually take some leading role in these thoughts, and there is no thought. So the IEC is struggling with it, the Canadian standards, I said on some of the CSA committees is struggling with this as to how to define some of these concepts. By that time, I'll tell you, the grid, a good chunk of the grid would be built for the next 10-15 years. So we are behind the eight ball in defining standards.

The question, I think, is that if we are able to get these physical inputs of ambient conditions and things like that, then we will be able to much better manage our assets, whether it was yesterday's assets going forward, renewable energy that can be actually added on far more with confidence, and we'll be able to manage it in real time much better. I think technology is here. I mean, Heimdall is one of the big ones right now, but we have other fiber optic technologies, right? I advise it. Another one that is fiber optic, temperature distributed temperature using fiber optic. So there are several mechanisms that are available today at a very low cost that we can actually implement, particularly transmission lines.

I think the time has come to take notice that we need to manage these assets and we need to push these assets, as opposed to just saying, let's curtail them. Let's curtail them. So I'll stop here, Reji, and then I won't steal Michael's thunder here.

Reji Kumar Pillai: I could find only one question so far. So he's talking about the difference between DLR dynamic line rating and the smart balls.

Michael Barnard: I would classify, and I urge Ravi to join in as necessary, dynamic line rating and smart balls as part of the continuum of dynamic line rating. Basically it says, what is the ambient temperature? What are the operating conditions we've been putting through the line up till now? What is the actual capacity? What is the sag ratio that is there based on the temperature?

There is a lot of DLR equipment, dynamic line rating technologies, to be applied. The advantage of the smart ball is that it's dirt cheap and easy to install. I think it's about US$32,000 per sensor. But it can be done with a drone. So a linesperson drives her truck out and she pops out of her truck. She pulls the ball out, she pulls the drone out, she sets it up, she makes sure the battery is charged. She controls the drone. It flies up, it drops the ball on the line. The ball automatically connects and locks in place, and she flies the drone down. Does a test to make sure that it's worked, and she drives away. At that point, a mesh network starts communicating back to the control centers.

It's easy to incrementally apply the magic ball technology with very simple modern technology at very low cost, across the highest risk to lowest risk lines, where you have the greatest concerns over possible benefits. I like it.

If we start talking about putting additional conductor, putting additional lines, fiber optics, across parallel to every single line or cross transmission lines, that's a bigger ask than just dropping a ball on a line. Does that mean Heimdall is the best solution all the time? No, not at all. There's a bunch of technologies in here. Everybody realizes, as Ravi was saying, we can manage our existing transmission and high voltage distribution quite easily, and we need to do that because that's going to give us, enable us to avoid curtailment.

As Reji said, India is doing a great job at avoiding curtailment. China has done a great job at avoiding curtailment because they said, oh, well, we need actual transmission if we're going to put renewables on. But the growth of renewables is so fast. It's so easy to put in a wind farm. We can put an offshore wind farm with a gigawatt of capacity in ten months of construction. That's offshore construction.

That's amazing. It just blows the mind compared to the construction timelines of other generation assets, that speed and the cheapness of those generation assets is driving a supply curve line. Geographies like India and China are accelerating electrification with, for example, the 50,000 electric buses that India plans to have on its roads by 2027. That is truly driving those types of things. So we need to really be able to manage that.

Do you want to move on to the second question, Raji?

Reji Kumar Pillai: This talks about, can DLR be as effective in high temperature, low wind area compared to cold and windy areas?

Michael Barnard: I once again encourage Ravi to chime in, but I would say it's more effective in high temperature areas because one of the things, it's the capacity of the line is truly based upon the heat of the line and the sag and the engineering. You have to maintain the distance between the line and the ground. You also have to make sure that it doesn't sag so much that it actually just separates. It gets weaker as it sags. That's what sagging is. In high temperature areas, places where the ambient temperature is high or there's fires or something, throttling that capacity with knowing the exact conditions enables existing lines to last longer to avoid outages in cold areas. While cold areas, you know, you can still get more capacity through, but your ambient temperature is much more generous to the line.

You're not getting heat from the exterior like in Norway, where heat gets sucked off into the air quite nicely, while around New Delhi, well, maybe not so much..

The wind, that's an interesting one, but not one I'd spent time thinking about yet. Ravi might have a perspective on that.

Ravi: The question is great. It helps more in the high temperature, in my view, because transmission lines are considered thermally low inertia. Therefore, even a little bit of wind actually can provide a much better effect on its transmission capability than in the colder areas because you already have the ambient working with you. It is even more important for countries like India now with the CEA thermal map. Reji can elaborate later, we need to now build on that to say, okay, how do we get even a little bit of wind that we can recognize allows for the 10%, 5% capability across. The second question, I think, is respect to across multiple geographies. When you have long transmission lines, you have multiple sensors with multiple temperatures and multiple winds.

Therefore, then the question becomes, how do I manage the tap stations? Some tap stations, I can probably operate more aggressively. The other ones where I have zero wind or very high temperature with zero wind, I may want to mitigate that in a different way. Whether it's powerful power flow controllers, whatever, that might come later. By knowing my asset condition, from tap station to tap station, I just will be able to manage it better. The heat, the high heat with low wind, actually can reveal much better headroom than cold and heavy winds.

I just want to comment on something Michael said about large projects, especially the last slide. I think people should take away the last slide. There's probably much more conversations to be had from policymakers. We, and I don't wish toot our horn here, Larsen and Toubro's power transmission division, on whose board I sit, we install right now gigawatt-scale solar in the Middle East. We have done Ras one, Ras two, all 18 months, 18 to 24 months, end to end. So that scale that we have, if you were to ever go and visit those stations, and, Reji, maybe you may want to.

I've done that twice, and it is amazing that the entire supply chain, the cost methodology of construction, the digitalization of construction, everything allows everything to be streamlined and installed. Two-kilometer rows of solar panels, it moves from what I call the old solar installation method into a bang, bang, literally a much more streamlined way of doing things which allows for lower and lower timelines. So I agree that it is very fast creation of supply. Based on that, Middle East, we have another one in the UAE, they're going to do another one somewhere else. So it is now probably going to be normal in 600-megawatt stations that India did in solar will now be more like 1-1.2-gigawatt solar plants, which will just become the new normal. I think that's perhaps the way to go as well, because the cost of power, the per kilowatt hour that comes from these stations, are even much cheaper than what we can get from smaller stations.

Reji Kumar Pillai: Already the solar wind generation globally is at 3 cents per kWh. It's set to become 1 cent by end of this decade. That will be the cheapest form of energy in human history. It's going to change everything. And storage cost is also falling down fast.

Ravi: That enables hydrogen as well. Right now the Saudi strategy is basically to take the large solar power and then attempt at desalination, attempt at hydrogen, just because the cost of power is so low. But not to transmit hydrogen. I fully agree with Michael. You don't want to move hydrogen anywhere. I've written articles on that for you, Reji, and you would know the key aspect of it is how do I consume it where I am? And so now it enables it. Low cost renewable energy on a marginal basis is far cheaper than fossil plants. Today's large-scale solar, large-scale wind, is allowing us to go and beat that new low with even newer and newer lows on a PPA basis, and which is where aqua and others have actually gone and capitalized for their capital financing for large-scale solar.

Michael Barnard: On that note, Reji is insisting that I'm going to do a single one of these discussions solely on my outlook on hydrogen and pull through some of the threads there. There is a lot of disinformation and hype and hope around hydrogen which needs to be disambiguated. I've spent a fair amount of time on that as well. Do look for that and schedule.

Reji Kumar Pillai: We will have that in one of this series, one of the presentations. So with that, we are come to the end of 1 hour.

COPENHAGEN, Denmark (CN) -- A handful of North Sea neighbors have signed an agreement to streamline operations of autonomous ships in the sea, the Norwegian Ministry of Industry and Fisheries stated in a press release on Friday.

The agreement -- between Belgium, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Denmark and Norway -- will standardize requirements placed on autonomous vessels sailing in the North Sea. With international regulations still pending for the emerging market, the five countries will set their own technological standards.

Additionally, the countries committed to sharing knowledge with the goal of developing autonomous shipping technology. That could benefit maritime infrastructure in the North Sea, such as offshore wind farms.

""This collaboration can help to establish a new international market for the Norwegian maritime industry,"" Marianne Sivertsen, Norway's minister of Fisheries and Oceans, said. ""The Norwegian maritime industry is far ahead in the development of autonomous solutions.""

Similar to self-driving cars, autonomous vessels can function independently based on artificial intelligence and continuous collection of data. Like self-driving cars, they're manned by operators who control and monitor the ships and intervene if they sail into complications at sea.

Guided by a person sitting in front of a screen in a control room on land, autonomous ships can deliver cargo between nations and continents without a crew. This setup could fundamentally change how maritime vessels are designed and built. Smaller ships -- such as those with no need for crew space, for example -- require less fuel, resulting in a reduced carbon footprint.

The global autonomous ships market had revenues of more than $89 million USD in 2021. That number is projected to annually grow by 6.81% through 2031, according to Straits Research, a global market research and consulting company.

With the agreement, Norway aims to secure its pole position in the autonomous shipping industry. The technology has taken off in recent years amid worldwide competition, with huge potential for economic gain.

Some of the vessels don't use fossil fuels at all. Already, autonomous ships fueled by electricity are delivering cargo between Norwegian cities.

Kongsberg Maritime, a Norwegian tech firm, estimates the ships could bring big savings, including on energy usage. The company is currently operating two autonomous vessels across the Oslo fjord in Norway. Each trip takes less than an hour, cutting around two million kilometers (around 1.2 million miles) worth of drive times and saving 5000 metric tons (5511 tons) of CO2 a year.

As Norway sails ahead, other nations are catching wind of what is likely to become the future of the maritime industry.

On the other side of the globe, South Korea launched its first containership for autonomous operations in March and aims to demonstrate long-distance autonomous shipping later this year, the U.S. trade magazine Maritime Executive reported.

Back in 2022, the Japanese autonomous containership Suzaku also completed an 800-kilometer, 497-mile journey through the traffic-congested Tokyo Bay.

Assisted by an AI system, the ship completed 99% of the 40-hour-long trip without human intervention. By itself, it was able to make 107 maneuvers to avoid collisions, the Danish trade magazine Ingeniøren reported.

The U.S. Navy has also successfully tested unmanned ships. In addition, Boston-based Sea Machine in 2021 tested small autonomous ships off the Danish coast, touting its tech as ready for long-distance voyages.",courthousenews.com,news,Court House News Service,Lasse Sørensen,0.4431372549019608,453062198,4,https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Norwegian-ship-Yara-Birkeland.jpg,eng-9556236

Portugal generated an 'historic' 95 per cent of its electricity from renewables in April, according to the network operator REN.

Renewable energy generation averaged just below that for the first four months of the year, covering 91 per cent of the nation's power needs.

It's one national good news story within a great continental shift: fossil fuels provided less than a quarter of the EU's energy for the first time ever last month.

Ember, the clean think tank behind that assessment, also found that more than 30 per cent of the world's electricity is now generated using renewables.

""Solar in particular is accelerating faster than anyone thought possible,"" Ember's director of global insights, Dave Jones told us.

Solar might not have been the star of the show in REN's new stock take.

A third of the way through the year, the renewable made up 7 per cent of Portugal's electricity mix, behind wind at 30 per cent and hydroelectric plants at 48 per cent.

However, ""the solar component continues to grow substantially,"" REN says. April saw the ""highest monthly significance ever recorded"" for solar - when it covered 10.5 per cent of the country's electricity consumption.

Fossil gas met just 9 per cent of demand in the first four months of 2024, with gas consumption in the power sector halving compared to the same period in 2023.

Remarkably, the 94.9 per cent share of the electricity mix that renewables covered in April isn't a national record. That was set 46 years ago in May 1978, when they peaked at 95.4 per cent. REN has been contacted for more information about this historical record.

Portugal has made some huge strides in renewable power, up from 27 per cent in 2005 and 54 per cent in 2017.

It has got serious about decarbonisation in a variety of ways, from phasing out coal-fired generation in 2021, to boosting its large hydropower fleet with added storage capacity.

And since 2019, the state's renewable energy auctions have been increasing utility-scale projects, with clear guidance for green companies.

All this has laid the ground for some milestone moments. For six consecutive days last autumn, for example, renewable energy production actually exceeded the country's electricity needs.

Portugal had the third highest share of wind energy in its electricity mix last year at 29 per cent, behind Ireland (36 per cent) and Denmark (58 per cent).

But, as elsewhere, it's no good a renewable leader resting on its laurels. Ember's new European Electricity Review report notes that Portugal has still not moved past the peak in wind generation it achieved in 2019.

The UK government has announced a new LionLink power line between UK and Netherlands, which will be built under the North Sea, will deliver enough electricity to power 1.8 million homes, more than Manchester and Birmingham combined. The link will carry 1.8 GW of electricity as compared to Germany and Denmark's Kasso-Froslev (Kriegers Flag) link carrying 0.4 GW of electricity.

The new link will be developed by National Grid Ventures and TenneT and begin operations by early 2030. The multipurpose LionLink will join the UK and Netherlands to each other as well as with offshore wind farms of the North Sea.

The project supports the UK's 8.4 GW interconnector capacity and LionLink alone will increase it by up to a fifth and offer more clean and affordable power for UK homes and businesses.

LionLink will be favorable for the UK's coastal communities and the environment by reducing the need for further onshore construction and visible infrastructure, as well as lessening the impact on the North Sea's wildlife.

Britain's innovation, knowledge and skills within the North Sea energy sector is expected to bring $25 billion a year of investment to the UK's coastal regions and create 40,000 green jobs to Britain.

The project was declared as Energy Security Secretary, Grant Shapps accompanied a British business delegation to the North Sea Summit in Belgium to enhance collective energy security through new renewable energy and interconnector projects.

Geo Pomona Waste Management's plan is to get rid of waste, which has been blamed for deadly epidemic outbreaks, like cholera and typhoid, in Harare in the past few years.

The waste will be used for electricity generation for the national grid, according to Nguwaya.

""The City of Harare committed to deliver a minimum of 650 tonnes per day at US$40 per tonne,"" Nguwaya said this week.

""They have been found wanting in respect of waste collection and delivery. This is the basis of the proposal we are currently discussing,"" he added.

Nguwaya explained that the charges set out and agreed to by the City of Harare in the Joint Venture Concession Agreement were ""fairly cheaper"" than those charged in Europe.

""You will be aware that the standards at Pomona are in line with modern European trends in waste management. Below, we put the figures charged per tonne; Austria (US$166), Belgium (US$112), Denmark (US$114), Finland (US$116), France (US$95), Ireland (US$154), Italy (US$127), and the United Kingdom (US$135),"" he said.

Harare mayor Jacob Mafume and top council officials were recently summoned to the Ministry of Local Government and told to relinquish refuse collection to Geo Pomona from next month.

The negotiations come two years after the government handed over managing rights of the capital's main dumpsite in Pomona, Harare, for 30 years to Netherlands-based Geogenix BV fronted by Nguwaya.

The transaction between Geoginx BV, which runs Geo Pomona, and government, has over the years triggered a fierce tussle between government and the City of Harare.

Calculations by the Independent showed that the 650 tonnes of daily waste translate to US$26 000 per day, and US$9,49 million annually.

These are some of the terms of the US$310 million investment deal Geo Pomona agreed with City of Harare in 2019 to transform the Pomona dumpsite.

Between 16 megawatts (MW) and 20MW will be generated and fed into the national grid from the waste-to-energy plant.

Nguwaya said discussions with the City of Harare, which has been struggling to collect waste in the capital, were still underway.

With garbage being a core raw material required to set up the power generation plant, Nguwaya added that Geo Pomona Waste Management would require 1 000 tonnes of waste to generate electricity.

Several other companies have also commenced small scale power generation at their operations for internal consumption, with surplus being directed to the national grid.

Last week, Gloria Magombo, permanent secretary in the Ministry of Energy and Power Development, said small scale power projects like these would be vital to help Zimbabwe deal with power deficits.

Power generation has mainly been affected by droughts, especially at the hydro power station in Kariba. Zimbabwe requires an estimated 4 000MW to power its industries and for domestic use per day.

However, as a result of limited generating capacity, the southern African country bridges its deficit through imports.

""We plan to incinerate 1 000 tonnes per day of solid municipal waste to produce 16MW to 22MW of electricity, which will be fed to the national grid for the benefit of the country,"" Nguwaya said.

""This is a sustainable way of managing waste and reducing the waste that goes to landfills. Previously, the (Pomona) site lacked proper access due to overflowing waste.""

The investment project has triggered fears that City of Harare workers under its public works department may lose jobs when Geo Pomona Waste Management starts to collect garbage.

However, Nguwaya allayed those fears, indicating that the scope of the project entailed retaining jobs.

""These are some of the issues that are under discussion. We do not believe in exclusionary business practices. The plan is to employ the City of Harare workers, who might be directly affected,"" Nguwaya explained.

The decision to pave the way for Geo Pomana Waste Management to start collecting garbage was based on the failure by Harare to effectively collect waste in most parts of the capital, forcing some residents to engage private garbage collectors at monthly costs of around US$90 per household.

In Harare, areas like the central business district suffer from chronic litter and neglect, with piles of refuse accumulating unchecked for extended periods.

Consolidated net sales for Q1 2024 were € 1.97 million, which was a 24% decrease compared to the same period last year (Q1 2023: € 2.60 million). The main business area is the production and wholesale of fibreboard, which recorded sales in Q1 2024 of € 1.95 million (Q1 2023: € 2.60 million). The remaining business area is real estate management of the property owned in Suur-Jõe street in Pärnu, who recorded sales of € 0.01 million in Q1 2024 (Q1 2023: also € 0.01 million).

The main reason for the decrease in sales revenue of fiberboard (comparing the Q1 2023 to the Q1 2024) was the termination of supplies to the major customer in Denmark (supplies ended in June 2023). By the end of the Q1 2024, new customers added have replaced 40% of the sales revenue generated by the major Danish customer in the Q1 2023. The company's primary focus remains on finding new customers, with the goal of expanding its customer portfolio and discovering new business directions.

The consolidated EBITDA of Nordic Fibreboard AS for Q1 2024 was positive € 53 thousand (Q1 2024: negative € 94 thousand). EBITDA margin was positive 3% in Q1 2024 (Q1 2023: negative 4%). The Group's gross margin increased from 11% for Q1 2023 to 19% in Q1 2023, the main reason for the increase in the gross margin was the decrease in the prices of the company's input costs.

The consolidated operating loss of Nordic Fibreboard AS for Q1 2024 was € 75 thousand, (Q1 2023: operating profit € 623 thousand, which includes the one-time extraordinary loss from the resale of electricity).

Group's consolidated net loss therefore for Q1 2024 was € 73 thousand (Q1 2023: loss € 597 thousand). The net loss for the Q1 2024 included the profit from the revaluation of the shares of Trigon Property Development AS (TPD) owned by Nordic Fibreboard Ltd in the amount of € 56 thousand (Q1 2023, the profit from the revaluation of the TPD shares was € 74 thousand).

NORDIC FIBREBOARD LTD: Fibreboard productions and sales

Fibreboard sales for Q1 2024 were € 1.95 million (Q1 2023: € 2.59 thousand). The main reason for the decrease in sales revenue in the Q1 2024, compared to the Q1 2023, was the termination of deliveries to a major customer in Denmark in the month of June 2023. In Q1 2023, sales to Denmark customer accounted for 32% of total sales. Sales to Estonia decreased by 22% in the Q1 2024 compared to the same period last year, and sales to Latvia decreased by 18%, while sales to other European Union countries increased by 107% and sales to African clients began to recover.

The consolidated EBITDA of Nordic Fibreboard Ltd OÜ for Q1 2024 was positive € 62 thousand (Q1 2023: negative € 76 thousand). The increase in EBITDA was due to a decrease in input costs, which in turn proportionally reduced the cost of production.

PÄRNU RIVERSIDE DEVELOPMENT: Real estate management

Pärnu Riverside Development owns the property located at Suur-Jõe 48 in Pärnu. The property has some rental tenants and rental income from real estate management was € 12 thousand in Q1 2024, (Q1 2023: also € 12 thousand).

The real estate management EBITDA for Q1 2024 were negative € 11 thousand (Q1 2023: negative € 13 thousand).

The construction materials market and industrial sector continue to face challenges and general forecasts for the year 2024 do not show a rapid recovery of the market. Although there are some signs of recovery in the market, volume growth remains modest.

Nordic Fibreboard AS is developing a business development strategy aimed at expanding the company's value proposition not only in the construction market but also through strategic activities to gain market share in new business directions in the long term.

The company is mapping out the needs for both team and other supporting resource development to support the implementation of its long-term business development strategy and achieve set goals, which include increasing production volumes and continuously developing the company's value proposition.

The company continues to actively invest in product development to ensure its sustainability and growth in the market. Several important product development projects are in progress or planned, which would expand the product range and increase the application areas of our products, thereby allowing for the expansion of the customer portfolio.

1. Environmentalists Push for White House Ban on New US Oil Ports

- After US President Joe Biden halted approvals for new LNG terminals this January, climate activists are now pushing the White House to implement a similar regulatory pause for crude oil shipping facilities.

- The pressure from Sierra Club comes after the Department of Transportation quietly approved a deepwater port (SPOT) off the coast of Texas developed by Enterprise Products Partners, capable of exporting VLCCs.

- There are currently three other crude export facilities under federal review, proposed by the likes of Energy Transfer, Phillips 66, or Trafigura, which could be halted in case the environmentalists' lobbying is successful.

- Environmentalists argue that the DOT is failing to evaluate the greenhouse impacts of deepwater export terminals, saying that any new port facility would be equivalent to 90 new coal-fired plants over a time span of 30 years.

2. Europe's Gas Outlook Turns Increasingly Bullish

- Even though European gas consumption is lingering in a period of weaker spring demand, hedge funds are increasingly bullish about the region's gas prices, with net length reaching the highest since February 2022.

- According to ICE data, the net-long position in the benchmark TTF gas futures rose for a fourth straight week.

- The European gas balance was also impacted by Denmark's Tyra gas field seeing a slower-than-anticipated ramp-up, reaching peak production only by Q4 due to technical issues with a power transformer.

- This past week has seen an upsurge in October call options at a strike price of €40 per MWh, whilst simultaneously selling €25 per MWh puts, with the overall trade in ICE TTF calls coming in at the highest level since at least 2020.

3. India Faces Worst Summer Power Shortages in Years

- India is bracing for the biggest power shortfall in 14 years next month after drier-than-expected weather has led to a decline in hydropower generation and coal-powered capacity might not be enough to offset those losses.

- The Indian government's Central Electricity Authority expects that peak shortages might reach 14 GW during nighttime hours in June when solar power generation is not available.

- The power supply gap is the widest since 2009-2010 as India's hydroelectricity output, some 12% of the country's electricity matrix, fell at the steepest pace in four decades on erratic rains.

- Coal-fuelled power generation rose almost 14% year-over-year in the year ended March 31, outpacing the 9.7% increase in renewables output and accounting for a whopping 77.2% of India's electricity market.

4. BHP Opened a Pandora's Box With AngloAmerican Bid

- AngloAmerican rejected BHP's initial $39 billion takeover bid, but the expectation of an improved bid, political interference as well as other mining companies trying to outbid BHP have made AngloAmerican the main M&A story of 2024.

- Being founded in Johannesburg and still heavily relying on South African mines, the BHP takeover bid might run into political opposition, too, as South Africa's mining minister Gwede Mantashe indicated he wouldn't support the deal.

- South Africa has had a shaky history with BHP as the Australian major spun off all South African assets from its 2001 BHP-Billiton merger, a fate mostly probably shared by AngloAmerican's assets in the country should the deal go through.

- Following the BHP bid refusal, global commodity trader Glencore has expressed an interest in the company and said it is studying an approach, potentially triggering a bidding war for AngloAmerican.

5. Russia Lifts Export Duties on Coal to Spur Exports

- Russia has temporarily removed tariffs on thermal coal and anthracite exports from May 1 to August 31, seeking to boost coal exports amidst an intensifying market share battle for Asia.

- Coal exports out of Russia have been struggling in 2024 to date, recording only 44.1 million tons compared to 38.5 million tons in January-April 2023, as operations have been marred by rail constraints, sanctions and export duties.

- The removal of tariffs and concurrent decrease in port fees should send Russian coal exports higher as the country lost market share to South Africa, Australia and Colombia, with higher availability pushing coal lower.

- Kpler data shows that Asia's coal imports reached an all-time high of 105 million tons in December 2023, and the continent's purchasing activity moved even higher this year with average imports up 6% year-over-year in January-April 2024.

6. Sparking Fears of Food Inflation, Wheat Prices Are Set to Soar

- Bad weather and capped Ukrainian grain supplies are putting global wheat supply under strain, with weeks of heat and inadequate rain in Russia prompting analysts to drastically cut harvest outlooks.

- Dryness has similarly impacted Ukraine's wheat harvest and total output is expected to drop 6% from a year earlier, with export possibilities still limited by the collapse of the Black Sea Grain Deal in July 2023.

- Aggravating fears of adequate supply, higher-than-usual rains in France have worsened the quality of this year's crop whilst Australia's harvest was adversely affected by parching summer temperatures.

- Chicago wheat futures are up 15% on the month, currently 653 cents per bushel, with hedge funds reversing their bearish bets on the agricultural commodity and the net short of 47,866 contracts in the week ending April 28 is the lowest in two years.

- For the first time since May 2022, copper prices have surged past the $10,000 per metric ton threshold, with key market forecasters such as Goldman Sachs raising their end-year targets to $12,000/mt.

- Softening US jobs data lifted the metals market, reviving speculation that the Federal Reserve interest rate cuts are not that far off, with swaps markets now indicating a 54% chance of a Fed rate cut by the end of 2024.

- The sentiment was also boosted by the unlikely resumption of copper mining in Panama, 5% of global supply, after the country's president-elect Jose Raul Molino ruled out talks with First Quantum until arbitrations are dropped.

- As LME copper inventories declined to 104,375 metric tons, the lowest since September 2023, the metals markets started speculating about a potential stockout episode by Q4, seeing stocks running dangerously low.",oilprice.com,news,OilPrice.com,,-0.06666666666666665,453036762,10,https://d32r1sh890xpii.cloudfront.net/article/718x300/2024-05-10_k5atwhl069.jpg,

GreenLab in Skive is gearing up to provide businesses in the green industrial park with direct access to green electricity from wind and solar power. This involves a EUR 21,45m investment in green infrastructure and the establishment of a new transformer station. Today marks the groundbreaking event. Simultaneously, GreenLab commences its status as a regulatory test zone - a designation given by the Danish Energy Agency in 2021.

""The wind turbines at GreenLab will now drive local green growth and make industrial production more sustainable. We celebrate that, as well as the establishment of Denmark's very first green industrial cluster,"" says Christopher Sorensen, CEO of GreenLab.

A key objective for GreenLab is to ensure access to green electricity for the businesses located in their industrial park and to optimise the utilisation of green power through advanced storage technologies like Power-to-X. To achieve this, GreenLab has invested EUR 21,45m in infrastructure, establishing a direct link between the solar and wind park south of GreenLab and the industrial park itself.

The solar and wind park currently supplies 84MW. This investment covers the purchase of four transformers and the construction of a new transformer station, which will increase capacity to 200MW. This move consolidates GreenLab's position as a leading player in sustainable energy production and utilisation.

In 2021, the Danish Energy Agency appointed GreenLab as a regulatory test zone, and on 1 May 2024, the test zone was officially activated. This enables GreenLab to co-locate energy production and consumption within the green industrial park without negatively impacting the existing collective energy grid. By creating a ""feed-in zone"" for green electricity, it is possible to test new facility possibilities and innovative business models.

The test zone is established in close cooperation with the grid operator, Elnetselskabet N1, and the Danish Energy Agency, both of whom are exploring new ways of developing and building the electrical infrastructure. The goal is for GreenLab to inspire the future layout of the Danish energy system. Co-locating energy production and consumption makes massive investments in expansion of the collective grid unnecessary.

""Projects like these are how Denmark can maintain its green frontrunner position - we have to continuously innovate traditional systems like the national grid,"" says GreenLab CEO, Christopher Sorensen. He adds, ""With the test zone and investment in green infrastructure, we are taking a decisive step with N1 and the Danish Energy Agency towards realising the goal of sustainable industrial production.""

The increased capacity ensures that GreenLab can supply companies in the park with various sources of renewable energy to support their green operations. The goal is also to keep the wind turbines running even when the collective grid is overloaded, as GreenLab will soon be able to store and convert excess power.

Access to hard-to-get transformers secured

Transformers are key to the direct supply of green energy, but they are currently in high demand and have long delivery times. GreenLab purchased its new transformers through their collaboration with N1.

Today's event at GreenLab marked the groundbreaking for the transformer station. N1's new CEO, Lise Søgård Bering, was among the participants along with representatives from companies in GreenLab's industrial park, Skive's mayor, Peder Christian Kirkegaard and CFO in Norlys a.m.b.a Gert Vinther Jørgensen.

The first to do green transition in action in Denmark

GreenLab is known for being a frontrunner in the green transition of industry. Just a few months ago, GreenLab was one of two signatories to Denmark's first Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) between a green energy supplier (Eurowind Energy) and GreenLab as an industrial cluster and consumer. Today's groundbreaking and the test zone commissioning are another vital step in the same direction.

The core inflation rate, which excludes volatile items such as energy, eased to 4.4% in April, according to a statement from the statistics office on Friday. That's just below the Norges Bank's projection of 4.5%, while the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of analysts was for a 4.2% pace.

The data suggest price pressure in the fossil-fuel rich Nordic nation remains more stubborn than in its European peers, at a time a renewed weakness in the krone threatens to fuel imported inflation. It also means there are even fewer factors to sway Norwegian policymakers from their higher-for-longer stance.

""Norges Bank needs to be convinced that core inflation will reach 2% and we believe that is still a long way out with a weak krone, high nominal wage growth and with still high rent increases for some time,"" Nordea Bank Abp's senior strategist, Dane Cekov, said in a note to clients. ""We still believe that Norges Bank won't cut the key rate until next year and see only two cuts to 4% until the end of 2025.""

The Norwegian currency, among the weakest performers in the G-10 space of major currencies this year, strengthened as much as 0.2% after the news, trading at 11.6716 per euro as of 9:19 a.m. in Oslo.

Last week, Governor Ida Wolden Bache and other rate-setters said the recent krone development, along with data on wage growth and a more resilient economy, suggest that the first interest-rate cut may need to be delayed beyond autumn.

Norway's average price growth is still expected to remain the fastest among the G-10 members this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Headline inflation slowed to a seven-month low of 3.6% in April, also slightly exceeding the median forecast by analysts. The decline was mainly supported by lower electricity prices, which aren't included in core inflation data, the statistics office said.

""The rise in prices for Norwegian-produced goods and services is still difficult to bring down,"" Marius Gonsholt Hov, the Oslo-based chief economist with Svenska Handelsbanken AB, said in an emailed comment. ""We expect Norges Bank to keep the interest rates unchanged until at least December.""

In neighboring Denmark, inflation slowed to 0.8% in April, helped mainly by lower costs of furniture and household equipment, according to a statement from Statistics Denmark.

A cyberattack on a payment platform. An earthquake disrupting silicon-chip production in Taiwan. Elon Musk deciding which countries have access to the Internet. At first glance, these things have nothing in common other than their recent prominence in news headlines. But an invisible through line connects them: each one highlights modern society's dependence on complex infrastructure to function. Disruptions in the Panama Canal can delay the delivery of critical shipments around the world. Computer failures can interrupt routine medical care provided by clinics across the United States. A brief halt in the production of semiconductors causes panic. And a billionaire's whim can turn the tide of war.

The complex hardwiring and technological dependency of modern life have made people reliant on a wide array of infrastructure systems, and governments now compete to create and maintain the networks that deliver essential services, from electricity to clean water to telecommunications. A country's power hinges on its ability to influence and manage this vast set of systems. In this infrastructure-dominated world, governments and their officials no longer maintain unilateral control over international relations. Instead, corporations, technology, and environmental conditions combine and interact with governments to shape world order. Even though the landscape of global affairs has shifted, U.S. approaches to policymaking too often remain shackled to outdated conceptions of bipolar competition and great-power rivalry.

It is past time to prioritize infrastructure as the organizing principle of modern life. The infrastructural turn in geopolitics has revealed that the world has a new set of powerbrokers, from multinational banks to satellite operators, and that solving global problems requires new forums and strategies to coordinate the activities of these actors. Infrastructure's central role in today's world also explains why seemingly small bottlenecks, such as the Houthi rebels' attack on Red Sea cargo ships or production delays at a single electronics factory, can unleash ripple effects that imperil international supply chains and upend geopolitics. Adapting to a new infrastructure-dominated reality requires policymakers to, first, reorganize their thinking to account for the complex material and technological interconnections that underlie geopolitical conflicts and, second, work with a new set of powerbrokers rather than rely on the traditional channels of government-to-government dialogue.

Infrastructure isn't new to the twenty-first century. The term became popular among nineteenth-century French engineers to describe the earthworks that enabled the smooth transit of trains, such as the embankments, trestles, and bridges that undergirded railway lines, rather than just the tracks.

Infrastructure entered mainstream English in the early Cold War as NATO negotiators in the late 1940s and 1950s used infrastructure to describe the supporting systems needed to ensure military preparedness in Europe -- air bases, communications networks, and radar systems, for example. In 1950, Winston Churchill scoffed at fellow politicians' use of the term: ""Knowing well that there was no such word [as infrastructure], Mr. Churchill ... said he must reserve his comments till he had consulted a dictionary,"" one report noted. In 1952, U.S. Secretary of State Dean Acheson said he found the term baffling, according to the New York Times. These objections aside, ""infrastructure"" caught on. Since the late 1950s, U.S. politicians have used the term to describe everything from interstate highways to organized crime networks to health-care systems.

Governments' reliance on infrastructure is also a centuries-old story. Throughout the 1800s, the British Empire used its supremacy over infrastructure in banking, telegraph networks, and maritime transportation to control distant colonies and punish rivals. Similarly, the United States consolidated claims over far-flung territories by channeling infrastructural power to build the Transcontinental Railway and the Panama Canal.

The pursuit of infrastructure supremacy is an old story, but what's new about today's infrastructure is both our reliance on it and the interconnectedness and interdependency of networks themselves. Nearly three-quarters of global goods -- 80 percent of the international trade in goods by volume -- move on intricately connected maritime networks. These networks are not naturally occurring, but constructed and maintained through hundreds of intermediaries, technological systems, and processes. Sending a shipment across borders -- flowers from Kenya to the Netherlands, for example -- requires an average of 36 documents and 240 copies.

The world has a new set of powerbrokers, from multinational banks to satellite operators.

And that's just the beginning. The world's most promising breakthroughs in knowledge and technology, from genomics to renewable energy, demand even greater infrastructure complexity. Artificial intelligence computing, for example, relies on billions of ""parameters"" powered by tens of thousands of high-tech processing units. Those processors are manufactured through intricate supply chains involving thousands of Ph.D.'s, rare minerals, and sophisticated machinery -- such as photolithography machines, which require 800 suppliers and can each cost as much as a Boeing 747.

Energy grids, shipping routes, AI networks, and digital payment platforms are, on their own, massively complex systems, and they're also interdependent. Doctors cannot maintain their caseloads without billing software and digital communications. Electronics manufacturers cannot produce smartphones without the international supply chains for silicon chips and strategic minerals. The dense layering of modern infrastructure systems has become so entangled and continuous that it now operates as the substrate of modern existence.

The interconnected networks and systems of modern life enable astonishing complexity, such as gaining permission to cross an international border simply by walking through a retinal scan. But they also create gaping vulnerabilities. For example, a single cyberattack on an Australian port operator imperiled 40 percent of the country's flow of goods. These massive networks of interwoven systems have become so vital to the functioning of U.S. society that the federal government designates 16 domains as ""critical infrastructure,"" meaning their destruction would have a debilitating effect on national security. These include everything from nuclear reactors to financial services.

Who wields more power, Elon Musk or Greece? According to traditional financial rankings, Musk's net worth of more than $200 billion falls within striking distance of Greece's GDP of roughly $220 billion. But examining financial rankings alone misses the interdependence of today's global actors and the importance of infrastructure to shaping world order.

In terms of geopolitical heft, Musk's infrastructural power is dizzying. His decisions influence -- or even outright determine -- whether Ukrainian forces can launch attacks against Russian targets or whether humanitarian agencies in the Gaza Strip can access wireless networks. He wields this power because he controls SpaceX, which provides satellite connectivity via its Starlink service. He decides when and where Starlink's network of low-orbit satellites will provide access to communications networks during a crisis. Musk's infrastructural power far outstrips his wealth.

Furthermore, Starlink is not just an infrastructure system operating in isolation. It depends on and benefits from other systems, from the universities that train its engineers to the U.S. government, which has contracted with SpaceX for classified defense projects for more than two decades, including a recent $1.8 billion deal. Focusing on nation-states as the key actors of global affairs overlooks the layering and interconnections of these new power dynamics.

Thinking in terms of infrastructure pushes beyond ideological binaries.

Traditional international relations tend to distinguish between state and nonstate actors as operating in different spheres, but today, entrepreneurs, investors, or consultants are often every bit as relevant as political officials. Financiers play a particularly important role in shaping infrastructure politics, as infrastructure investing has become central to international finance and global politics. In 2018, the G20 developed the Roadmap to Infrastructure as an Asset Class to encourage investors to fund projects ranging from ports to schools to telecommunications networks, especially in emerging markets. Goldman Sachs and McKinsey have created specialized divisions to focus on infrastructure investment and development. In January 2024, the world's largest asset manager, BlackRock, announced its biggest acquisition since the global financial crisis: Global Infrastructure Partners, the third-largest infrastructure investment firm in the world.

Although infrastructure already provides the backbone of daily life, the recent push to transform it into an asset class also makes it a financial product that can be traded on secondary markets. This dual role -- infrastructure as both a concrete reality and a financial construct -- changes how people interact with large-scale, earth-moving projects in their communities. Decisions about allocating resources and managing the debt of a hydropower project, for example, are shifted to higher, more distant levels of decision-making, where asset managers and consultants can assess the risk profiles and ""bankability"" of projects. The pressure from investors to ""de-risk"" infrastructure can constrain communities' decision-making about what gets built and how it operates. The model incentivizes governments to conform to standards set by the World Bank or the Asian Development Bank, for example, rather than focusing on whether communities' needs are better served by less ""bankable"" projects, such as hospitals and schools.

Today, global power brokers include not only the countries and companies that build complex networks, but also standards-setting entities, such as the International Maritime Organization and the Internet Engineering Task Force, that shape the global protocols for building and operating infrastructure. This shift downgrades the power of local communities and elevates a middle tier of international players -- consulting firms such as EY and KPMG, and multinational law firms such as Clifford Chance and White & Case, as the legal scholar Nahuel Maisley has noted. The push to standardize and accelerate ""green infrastructure,"" for example, can constrain the way cities address housing insecurity, and in the process exacerbate gentrification.

At the heart of the competition between China and the United States is a fight over who controls today's infrastructure. Beijing seems to understand this. But U.S. efforts to counter China's large-scale construction with its own projects suggest that Washington has not mastered the nuances of infrastructure statecraft. U.S. policymakers constantly portray China as an existential challenge to the current world order. It's ""a battle between democracy and autocracy,"" according to U.S. President Joe Biden. This characterization depicts two systems competing for supremacy over limited resources. A win for China, such as its dominance in software for managing logistics operations, represents a threat to U.S. security.

By contrast, thinking in terms of infrastructure pushes beyond ideological binaries to focus on how different actors shape the terms of engagement and the systems that move information, money, and goods. This approach draws attention to the material networks of communications, finance, military procurement, shipping, and manufacturing, rather than fixating on a clash of worldviews.

The power accrued in operating networks often has less to do with the grand designs of master planners than with the second-order relationships, long-term ties, and gradual evolution of a project. After all, infrastructure is not just a one-time investment of pouring concrete or bulldozing a ditch. Projects must be maintained, serviced, and financed over decades. It is often the second-order relationships -- the enduring work of maintenance firms, financial agents, and ancillary services -- that transform isolated procurement contracts into durable connections.

In terms of geopolitical heft, Elon Musk's infrastructural power is dizzying.

Under a traditional view of geopolitics, infrastructure represents just another theater of competition between rivals. But this approach mischaracterizes infrastructure power. Meaningful control depends not just on the nationality of, say, a software platform's owner, but also on the functionality of that platform, whom it empowers, and what activities it precludes or enables.

A more constructive framing would do more than denounce Chinese software or seek to ""reshore"" manufacturing that hasn't happened in the United States since the 1980s (producing, say, container cranes, a market that China now dominates). Instead, an infrastructure-oriented approach would envision a thicket of strategies to ensure that critical networks such as shipping and payment systems are anchored to market relationships, norms, and regulatory systems that provide transparency and accountability.

Infrastructure's functionality depends on how people use it, not just who builds it. The early history of the Internet provides a telling example: its architecture promised an egalitarian, end-to-end design that democratized access to information. Yet this design was soon transformed, as increasingly oligarchic corporations seized on its potential to amass astounding profits for themselves and their shareholders. The mere act of building infrastructure does not predetermine how societies will adopt it.

In the same vein, the Chinese origins of a software program or platform does not mean it should be tallied on a ledger of great-power competition or classified as categorically anti-democratic. Instead, its international adoption shows how central infrastructure control has become to geopolitical rivalries. It is the substrate -- the earthworks and embankments -- undergirding ""strategic competition,"" a buzzword of choice among U.S. and European security planners. For the United States to compete more ably on these terms, policymakers must become attuned to implementation, long-term management, and oversight of modern societies' hardwiring.

In the United States, the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act and the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act committed over $1 trillion to revamping the nation's infrastructure. The European Union has countered with investments in European semiconductor manufacturing, renewable energy, and climate mitigation. But as the world gets rewired, today's global leaders remain bound to outdated conceptions of state-dominated geopolitics. It is time for policymakers to reorient their thinking about where true power lies in the global system and how that power can be harnessed to address today's problems.

First, policymakers must focus on governance more than governments. The decisions of Musk or BlackRock, for example, might carry more weight than those of the United Arab Emirates or Denmark. Once the U.S. government can identify the gatekeepers, designers, financiers, and implementers who control different layers of service delivery, it can better understand how networks are managed and what vulnerabilities they create. In a world where a small group of armed rebels can imperil an artery on which roughly 15 percent of the world's trade depends, flexing hard power to combat the rebels' threat to international shipping isn't enough. After all, the Red Sea region is also a communications chokepoint through which 90 percent of the subsea cable capacity between Europe and Asia passes. Downed ships pose a risk to communications connectivity, as the world learned when several lines were severed in March, disrupting a quarter of data traffic passing between Europe and Asia. Improving resilience means not only addressing the proximate threat but also working with insurers, shippers, cable operators, and others to protect critical infrastructure.

Meanwhile, the complexity of world-spanning problems has only grown. Managing the future of biomedicine -- unlocking the promise of cloning and gene editing, for example, while balancing their risks -- will require high-level negotiations and complex agreements, and not just between governments. Space policy and pandemic response are two areas where it has been demonstrated that, when working in isolation, national governments lack the power and tools to regulate effectively. States will play a leading role in an infrastructural order, but they must learn to work with new partners and traditional adversaries in novel ways.

Policymakers must focus on governance more than governments.

Because infrastructure projects exist in a quasi-public, quasi-private middle ground, they are often shielded from traditional market competition and public accountability. Building large-scale networks tends to be expensive, time-consuming, and dependent on public commitments and licensing. Centralized decision-making can reduce transaction costs, and network operators tend to benefit from rich-get-richer effects. These features do not lend themselves to democratic governance or public accountability. The world needs better mechanisms to ensure that the infrastructure of modern life can answer to communities' calls for justice, transparency, and an equitable distribution of resources.

As infrastructure blocs fracture into U.S.- and Chinese-leaning domains, go-between locations such as Qatar, Singapore, Turkey, and the UAE will gain prominence and neutral intermediaries will become more important, says Alexander Geisler of the German Shipbrokers' Association. The mutual suspicion with which Chinese and U.S. policymakers view each other's infrastructure increases the likelihood that different specifications and patterns of lock-in will emerge. One bloc's payment platform might be organized around the U.S. dollar while an alternative architecture enables the movement of China's renminbi and other currencies.

Similarly, one network of logistics and shipping businesses could facilitate trade between the United States and its allies, while Chinese-backed technologies and hardware could enable connectivity among other maritime centers. Infrastructure competition means battles over standards will likely escalate in the coming years, and places and entities that can work as trusted intermediaries will become more essential.

As global challenges interconnect and amplify one another, world leaders will miss opportunities if they don't see more clearly how infrastructure is operating today. Global power is no longer defined by stockpiling munitions in bunkers, dominating a single supply chain, or wielding dominion over one technology. High-tech networks are central to the basic functioning of modern societies, but today's infrastructure is too multifaceted, layered, and interconnected for any one state to truly control it. In the age of infrastructure, shaping world order requires political leaders find new ways to collaborate with the entrepreneurs, builders, bankers, and operators who manage the interdependent systems that sustain twenty-first century life.",foreignaffairs.com,news,Foreign Affairs,,-0.1843137254901961,453011159,1,https://cdn-live.foreignaffairs.com/sites/default/files/styles/social_share/public/images/2024/05/09/2024-05-04T025316Z_1498504996_RC2ZI7A5UY9O_RTRMADP_3_PANAMA-CANAL.jpg?itok=kheyWGv9,

The move comes as power companies forge cooperation on clean energy development. Among them are a joint project between Global Power Synergy Plc (GPSC), the power generation arm of PTT Plc, and Denmark-based nuclear energy developer Seaborg Technologies, to study small modular reactor (SMR) technology.

SMR refers to a reactor with power generation capacity of up to 300 megawatts per module.

""Nuclear power plants could be a solution for increasing clean power in Thailand as the cost of power production per unit is quite low,"" said Veerapat Kiatfuengfoo, director-general of Eppo.

""Nuclear energy is clean and contributes to national power security due to the availability of uranium from many countries.""

Distributors of uranium include Canada, France, the US, Uzbekistan and South Africa.

Under the new PDP, to be enforced between 2024 and 2037, SMR should be developed between 2036 and 2037, said Mr Veerapat.

The nuclear power plan is required to go through a public hearing because it is a very contentious issue in Thailand.

Nuclear energy was mentioned in the 2010 PDP, as the authorities proposed a nuclear power project with a total capacity of 2,000MW set to start operation in either 2020 or 2021.

However, the project was removed from the PDP in 2011 after the Fukushima incident when a massive earthquake and tsunami triggered a nuclear reactor meltdown and radiation leak at Japan's coastal nuclear facility in March of that year.

According to GPSC, the study jointly conducted with Seaborg Technologies will take four years.

President and chief executive Worawat Pitayasiri said Seaborg Technologies is committed to delivering clean and safe power generation to address the increasing global demand for sustainable energy.

He said the collaboration focuses on the learning and exchange of technological knowledge, aimed at making an informed decision regarding a potential new SMR project in Thailand.

Under the 2024 PDP, the authorities plan to have electricity produced by hydrogen make up 5% of total power supply and increase to 20% between 2035 and 2037, said Mr Veerapat.

Blue hydrogen, which refers to natural gas-based hydrogen production with carbon capture and storage, will be used in the first phase.

The 2024 PDP is expected to be completed by the third quarter of this year.",bangkokpost.com,news,Bangkok Post,Yuthana Praiwan,0.4274509803921569,452991060,1,https://static.bangkokpost.com/media/content/dcx/2024/05/10/5139917_700.jpg,

During this period, battery-electric propulsion becomes affordable for the majority of containership routes around the world. The industry is now shifting rapidly away from traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) powered systems, with even some of the larger vessels undergoing full electrification, both newly built and retrofitted older ships.

Until recently, ship owners often held outdated assumptions on battery costs, energy density values, and available on-board space.* While car, truck, and other road vehicle brands attracted much attention for going electric and hybrid, emerging opportunities in cargo ship transport appeared less obvious. Batteries had long been perceived as heavy, expensive, impractical devices for bulk and container shipping. In reality, however, sea freight lagged only a few years behind land-based vehicles in terms of disruptive trends and would soon be undergoing a major transformation of its own.

Low-tech, short-term measures had initially been introduced to cut ship emissions - such as route optimisation, slow steaming, and hull fouling management. Alternative fuels had also been mandated by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) to lower the sulphur content of fuel for all ocean-going vessels from 3.5% to 0.5%, which came into force on 1st January 2020.*

Some long-haul routes began to use hybrid-electric systems, combining existing generator engines with hydrogen fuel cells and/or energy storage,* but a fully electric configuration remained limited to ferries and small shuttles.

A cargo ship with 100% battery power had been demonstrated in 2021. Yara Birkeland, jointly developed by Norwegian chemical firm Yara International and maritime technology company Kongsberg Group, sailed 35 nautical miles (65 km) around the coast of Norway using 7 MWh batteries. Although relatively modest in scale, with a cargo capacity of 120 TEU (""twenty-foot equivalent unit"") and length of only 79 m (260 ft), Yara Birkeland proved the feasibility of zero-emission cargo shipping and included fully autonomous capability too.*

That same year, a coalition of major companies including Amazon and Ikea announced a new initiative, Cargo Owners for Zero Emission Vessels (coZEV) with a goal of moving to zero-carbon shipping by 2040.*

In 2022, shipping group Maersk announced plans to install hundreds of offshore charging stations around the world, allowing vessels to power themselves with electricity instead of fossil fuels while idling outside ports.*

Another company, Fleetzero, began converting diesel ships to battery-electric in 2025* and designed a new electric ship, the MVE7, for long-distance cargo. Fleetzero also developed a battery-swapping solution that enabled smaller ports to effectively function as charging stations and exchange points.

New environmental regulations, alongside further improvements in cost and energy density, led to booming demand and rapid innovation in battery-electric propulsion systems during the second half of the decade.* Between 2022 and 2029, the economic viability and range of electrified cargo ships roughly doubled, with routes as long as 6,000 km becoming feasible for some size classes.*

These advances continued into the 2030s. An additional economic advantage came from considering the environmental and health impacts incurred during a ship's life cycle, which studies had shown to be 12 times higher for heavy oil and diesel-powered vessels. Governments and international organisations appeared increasingly keen to incorporate these air pollution damages and social costs into their regulatory regimes.

The disparity between traditional and fully electric container vessels only widened, with even greater energy densities and lower costs achieved. In 2029, 40% of the world's cargo shipping routes had become technically and economically viable for battery-electric propulsion.* With a tipping point now reached, the majority (>50%) of routes have either been electrified or are being considered for electrification during the 2032-2037 period. While many older vessels will remain in service for years to come, the global fleet now appears on track to be nearly carbon neutral by mid-century. In 2020, international freight accounted for between 2-3% of global energy-related CO2 emissions. Without decarbonisation, this figure had been projected to reach 17% by 2050.*

Widespread automation is accompanying the increased sustainability of shipping, both in terms of navigation and the loading/unloading process, as well as recharging and battery swapping at ports. In addition, cargo capacities are becoming larger than ever. Some vessels will reach 50,000 TEU by the 2060s.

Larger battery-electric ships can function as emergency back-up power plants during increasingly common extreme events leading to power supply disruptions. Energy storage capacities of 5-10 GWh, achieved during the 2030s, can provide enough generation to mitigate blackouts affecting 1 million or more people.*

Microsoft released Windows 10, the direct successor to its Windows 8.1 operating system, in July 2015. It received positive reviews, surpassing Windows 7 as the most popular version of Windows worldwide by 2018. More than a billion devices were running Windows 10 by 2020, leading to a peak market share of 82% of all Windows PCs in early 2022 and 58% of all PCs (the rest being other Windows editions and other operating systems such as macOS and Linux). This share began to decline as Windows 11, launched in October 2021, became increasingly popular.

Microsoft announced 14th October 2025 as the retirement date for Windows 10 Home and Pro, a little over 10 years after their initial release, which had become the standard lifecycle length for major Windows versions. However, extended support would be offered for enterprise/IoT versions until 13th January 2032 as part of the Long-Term Servicing Channel (LTSC).*

After this date, no new security updates, non-security updates, free or paid assisted support options or online technical content updates are offered. This means that computers without a newer version are now vulnerable to hackers or malware. By 2032, a 14th generation of Windows has become available, as the family of operating systems enters its 47th year.

In July and August 2032, Australia hosts the summer Olympic Games for the third time in its history. The previous two venues had been Melbourne in 1956 and Sydney in 2000. This time, Brisbane is the chosen location, on the country's east coast. This also marks only the second occasion that the Summer Games have been held in a Southern Hemisphere winter, after the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.

In addition to Brisbane itself, events are held at the nearby Gold Coast (to the south) and Sunshine Coast (to the north), using venues from the 2018 Commonwealth Games. A fourth ""Regional Zone"" is established for games of football at more distant locations. Several new sports centres and stadiums are constructed in time for 2032. Transport connections between the three main regions are also improved. The total cost of both the Olympic and Paralympic Games - initially put at $5 billion - subsequently overruns. However, it is far lower than the $26 billion budget for Tokyo 2020, the most expensive Games in history.

A long-stalled bridge between Sicily and mainland Italy is finally completed in 2032.* This crossing had been proposed in ancient times, but the first detailed plans only began to emerge in the 1990s. Following a series of delays and cancellations, Giorgia Meloni's government revived the project in 2023 and construction officially began the following year.*

The Strait of Messina Bridge, costing €4.5 billion ($5 billion), is the longest suspension bridge on earth. Its main span of 3,300 m (10,800 ft) easily surpasses the previous record holders - China's recently completed Zhangjiagang-Jingjiang-Rugao Bridge with its span of 2,300 m (7,550 ft) and the 2,023 m (6,637 ft) Çanakkale Bridge in Turkey, which held the record before that. It also has the tallest structural height of any bridge, with its towers reaching 382.6 m (1,255 ft), exceeding the 341 m (1,119 ft) Millau Viaduct in France. For comparison, this is taller than the roof height of the Empire State Building.

The bridge has three vehicle lanes in each direction (two for regular traffic, one for emergencies), and one for rail. It supports the crossing of six million vehicles and 60,000 trains each year, bringing Sicily's five million residents closer to the rest of the continent. The bridge forms part of the Berlin-Palermo railway axis (Line 1) of the Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T).

With high structural integrity, the Strait of Messina Bridge is designed to withstand earthquakes of 7.5 magnitude. The deck's aerodynamic stability can resist winds of up to 300 km/h (186 mph), corresponding to a return period of over 2,000 years. This megaproject boosts the national economy of Italy by €2.9 billion each year, equal to 0.17% of gross domestic product (GDP).*

By 2032, house prices in the UK have become so unaffordable that the majority of people are forced to take rented accommodation.* This trend first began to emerge during the Blair years of the late 90s and early 2000s. It could be argued, however, that the problem originated as far back as 1980,* when the Conservative government led by Margaret Thatcher passed the Housing Act. This led to a fall in socially rented housing - as council tenants were given the legal right to buy, at a large discount, the home they were living in - while councils were prevented from reinvesting most of the proceeds from these sales into building new homes.* Many tenants who had purchased these council flats later profited from them as buy-to-let landlords* - effectively subsidised by taxpayers - or sold them to speculators, investors and property firms. About 1.5 million council homes were sold by 2003 and this figure had reached 2 million by 2015.

A failure to construct enough new homes,** combined with rapid population growth,* resulted in a serious lack of supply during the early 21st century. Other factors included changes in the employment landscape, a rise in the number of students, later marriage and rising separation rates. Having been relatively stable for most of the 20th century, the average cost of a UK home rose from £50K in 1995 to £184K by 2007.* During this same period, mortgage payments as a percentage of income soared from 18% to more than 50%.* The problem was compounded by stagnant wage growth (below inflation), a decline in the level of household savings (from 16% in the early 90s, to just 6% within two decades) and tighter lending requirements in the aftermath of the Great Recession.*

Subsequent attempts to rectify the situation included policies such as the ""Help to Buy"" scheme, but these only exacerbated the problem by creating artificially inflated demand.* The fundamental issue was lack of supply - but government funding and policies came nowhere near close enough to addressing this point with only a tinkering around the edges to boost housing stock. Because of these failures, less than half - 49% - of UK households are homeowners by 2032 - the first time since the early 70s that a majority of people are renting. One-third of households are now renting privately, twice as many as in 2015. London and the southeast of England have been particularly affected, due to a massive influx of foreign billionaires pouring money into the region and pushing up land values. The gap between rich and poor - and between the younger and older generations* - has now grown to be wider than ever, creating an ever more polarised and unequal society.*

Britain's ash trees have been wiped out by a fungal disease

Ash dieback, caused by the fungus Chalara fraxinea,* killed huge numbers of trees from the mid-1990s onwards, particularly in eastern and northern Europe. Up to 90% of ash trees were affected in Denmark. The fungus was first scientifically described in 2006.

It was discovered in the UK during 2012, initially only on imported nursery stock, but in October of that year it was found on trees at two sites of established woodland in the East Anglia region. This occurred despite clear warnings from ecologists and foresters that imports of seedlings from the continent should be banned in case of infection.*

Despite efforts to contain the disease, it was impossible to stop.* Within a few weeks, Chalara fraxinea was confirmed in dozens of other locations. Over the next two decades, it spread throughout the country, wiping out most of the 90 million ash trees in Britain.*

Many plant species, birds and other animals dependent upon the trees for survival were also lost,* at a time when their numbers were already in sharp decline.** With ash trees forming a significant proportion of the UK's woodland, an eerie silence is descending on many areas of countryside, with birdsongs and other wildlife becoming ever rarer.

Leatherback sea turtles are on the verge of extinction

Growing up to seven feet (two metres) long and exceeding 2,000 pounds (900 kilograms), leatherbacks are the largest turtles on Earth. They can dive to depths of nearly 4,000 feet and make trans-Pacific migrations from Indonesia to the U.S. Pacific coast and back again. These ancient reptiles are the only remaining members of a family of turtles with evolutionary roots going back 100 million years.

After mating at sea, females come ashore during the breeding season to nest. At night, they excavate a hole in the sand, depositing around 80 eggs. This is filled with sand, making detection by predators difficult, before the mother turtle returns to the sea.

Once common throughout the world, their population declined rapidly during the 20th century and into the 21st. At the Jamursba Medi Beach in Papua Barat, Indonesia - accounting for 75 percent of total sightings in the western Pacific - nest numbers plummeted from a peak of 14,455 in 1984 to a low of 1,532 in 2011.

Several major problems faced leatherback turtles: nesting beach predators, such as pigs and dogs that were introduced to the islands, eating the turtle eggs; rising sand temperatures that killed the eggs or prevented the production of male hatchlings; the danger of being caught by fisheries during migrations; and harvesting of adults and eggs for food by islanders.* Plastic debris, mistaken for their favourite food (jellyfish) was another problem. Some individuals were found to have ingested almost 11 pounds (5 kilograms) of plastic into their stomachs.

China's first space station has reached the end of its 10-year lifespan.* After a decade of onboard research, it is abandoned and sent into a decaying orbit. A new, larger and more advanced space station is now in the process of being constructed.

One-third of Saudi Arabia's electricity comes from solar

In 2012, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia had only 0.003 gigawatts (GW) of installed solar energy capacity. More than half of its electricity was created from burning oil. By 2032, however, it has 41 GW of installed solar energy, accounting for a third of the nation's 121 GW total energy demand.* About 25 GW is produced by solar thermal plants, which use mirrors to focus energy from the sun on heating fluids, which in turn run turbines. The other 16 GW is provided by massive photovoltaic farms. This has been a result of considerable foreign investment, as well as the wealth produced by fossil fuels, totalling over $100 billion. Though several other nations have more extensive solar infrastructure, this has been one of the most ambitious projects, especially considering Saudi Arabia's old position as the world's largest exporter of crude oil.

The enormous expanses of desert, as well as measurably more intense sunlight in the equatorial regions, gives the country a huge amount of room to expand further. Even larger projects are now planned. Construction is also underway on high voltage cables connecting Saudi Arabia to neighbouring countries and some in Southern Europe. Eventually, this will be expanded to include all of Europe and Northern Africa.* Alongside solar, another 21 GW is generated by a combination of nuclear, wind, and geothermal power.* Through nuclear cooperation agreements with China, France, South Korea and Argentina, Saudi Arabia has now constructed 16 new nuclear reactors.* Longer term, the country has further ambitions to be powered entirely by renewables. Much of the oil industry in Saudi Arabia is now transitioning away from energy production to the manufacture of plastics and polymers.*

These developments, coupled with the fact that it remains one of the wealthiest countries in the region, are helping Saudi Arabia transition to a more sustainable long-term future. Additionally, its strong military, ties to the West, and extensive desalination infrastructure have allowed Saudi Arabia to remain relatively stable compared to some of its neighbours.

Britain upgrades its nuclear-armed submarine fleet

Britain was the third country (after the U.S. and the Soviet Union) to test an independently developed nuclear weapon, in 1952. From 1969 onwards the country always had at least one ballistic-missile submarine on patrol, creating a nuclear deterrent that the Defence Council described in 1980 as ""effectively invulnerable to pre-emptive attack"".

Until the 1990s, Britain had deployed a variety of nuclear weapons on Royal Navy carriers, V bombers and other aircraft around the world. However, these were gradually withdrawn. The retirement of the WE.177, in both air-dropped free-fall and depth charge versions, was the final stage of this decommissioning process, in 1998. This left a group of four Vanguard submarines (armed with Trident II D5s) as Britain's only nuclear weapons platform. Britain retained a stockpile of about 215 thermonuclear warheads, with 120 operational as of 2016.

A decision to renew the Trident-armed submarines was made in 2006, with Prime Minister Tony Blair warning that it would be ""unwise and dangerous"" for Britain to give up its nuclear weapons. Although the Cold War had ended, the UK still needed nuclear weapons, said Blair, as no-one could be sure another nuclear threat would not emerge in the future. He outlined plans to spend up to £20bn on a new generation of submarines for Trident missiles.

However, the Trident programme was to prove highly controversial, with costs escalating considerably. This was an especially divisive topic in the wake of the 2008 financial crash and the subsequent years of austerity and cuts to public services. By 2016, the Ministry of Defence had revised the cost of building, testing and commissioning the replacement vessels to £31 billion (plus a contingency fund of £10 billion) over 35 years, about 6 per cent of defence spending every year. Nevertheless, MPs voted to back the renewal in a vote of 472 to 117. Alongside this programme, the government reiterated its commitment to multilateral nuclear disarmament, promising to reduce Britain's stockpile of nuclear warheads to 180 by the mid-2020s.

Trident was based on the idea of Mutually Assured Destruction - it aimed to deter a nuclear attack on Britain by guaranteeing a retaliatory strike against any potential aggressor. After succeeding David Cameron as Prime Minister, one of Theresa May's first jobs was to write a ""letter of last resort"" authorising the use of Trident missiles in the event of such a nightmare scenario. Each of the Vanguard submarines contained a safe with one of these sealed letters, which of course it was hoped would never have to be used. David Cameron's previous letters were destroyed.

Previously named Successor class, it was announced in October 2016 that the new submarines would be renamed as the Dreadnought class. After the parliamentary vote on the upgrade programme, construction began soon afterwards.* The first new submarine would begin operation by 2028 and the existing fleet of Vanguard submarines is phased out by 2032,* after more than 40 years of service. Each missile is 13 m (44 ft) long, weighing 58.5 tons (130,000 lb), with a range of 11,300 kilometres (7,000 mi), a top speed of 18,030 mph (29,020 km/h) (Mach 24) and target accuracy to within a few feet.

Despite its diminishing power in the world, Britain retains a nuclear deterrent for long into the future and plays a key role in maintaining global security. Dreadnought-class submarines remain in service until the 2060s,* by which time they are replaced by automated and crewless vessels.

A transit of Mercury takes place when the planet Mercury passes directly (transits) between the Sun and a superior planet, becoming visible against (and hence obscuring a small portion of) the solar disk. During a transit, Mercury appears as a tiny black dot moving across the disk of the Sun.

A transit of Mercury occurs on 13th November 2032.* The last time this happened was 11th November 2019. After 2032, the next occasion is in 2039, with a further eight transits during the remainder of the 21st century. Each transit typically lasts for several hours.

Transits of Venus with respect to Earth can also occur - although these are rarer, since Venus is further from the Sun and orbits more slowly. Rarer still are simultaneous transits of both Mercury and Venus. Such an event last occurred in 373,173 BC and the next occurs on 26th July 69,163.

Currently, an increasing number of nations are committing to tripling installed renewable energy generation capacity by 2030 in pursuit of the 1.5°C climate goal. In addition, consumer demand for eco-friendly products is putting clean energy stocks on Wall Street in the limelight. As a result, at the end of 2023, there were around 1,500 funds focusing on the climate, up from about 200 in 2018.

Yet, it isn't a straight line growth trajectory for renewable energy shares as numerous challenges persist. Industry watchers highlight that clean energy adoption faces short-term setbacks due to high costs and demand fluctuations. In fact, over the past year, the S&P Global Clean Energy Index fell 25%, underperforming the benchmark S&P 500 Index, which returned close to 25%. Nevertheless, many investors recognize the long-term promise of sustainable practices and technologies.

Therefore, let's explore three top renewable energy stocks to buy amid the global green shift.

Among renewable energy stocks to buy, Brookfield Renewable Partners (NYSE:BEP) can be a compelling long-term investment option. BEP owns and operates a diversified portfolio of clean energy assets, including hydroelectric, wind, solar and battery storage facilities. This spread helps mitigate risk by not relying on a single technology. Also, it positions BEP on a strong foothold to capitalize on the overall growth across the renewable energy landscape.

While the broader market for renewable energy stocks has experienced some turbulence especially in the past year, BEP has shown resilience as the recent first quarter results highlighted. Revenues came in at $1.49 billion compared to $1.33 billion for the year-ago quarter. Basic and diluted loss per unit was 23 cents. But, these results were below Wall Street's estimates.

Meanwhile, in early May, Brookfield and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) announced their collaboration to deliver over 10.5 GW of new renewable power capacity globally. Wall Street noted the large size and global scope of this deal with approval.

Since January, BEP stock is down almost 2%, while the dividend yield is a generous 5.5%. Wall Street remains bullish on BEP shares with a 12-month price forecast of $30.50, suggesting an upside potential of 18% from current levels.

Investors may also consider ReNew Energy Global (NASDAQ:RNW). With headquarters both in India and the U.K., RNW mainly provides utility-scale renewable energy solutions in India. With wind, solar and hydro energy projects across India, the company offers a slice of the rapidly growing renewable energy sector in a major developing economy.

The green energy group released the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 results in late February. Total revenue for the quarter was $232 million, compared with $193 million for the same period 12 months ago. Management increased the bottom line guidance for fiscal year 2024 by 2%.

In addition, management recently announced that RNW has completed constructing 1.94 GW of renewable energy assets. This takes the cumulative capacity set up by the company to over 10 GW. Currently, the company provides 10% of the total renewable energy capacity of India.

Despite the growth story, the stock declined almost 17% year-to-date (YTD). Yet, the 12-month median price forecast is at $8.59 suggesting an upside potential of 35% based on current prices.

We conclude today's discussion with a renewable energy sector ETF, namely the Global Energy iShares ETF (NASDAQ:ICLN). Established in June 2008, the fund offers broad exposure with a basket of around 100 companies across the clean energy spectrum. Those include solar, wind and other renewable sources.

Geographically, ICLN boasts a diversified allocation, with the U.S. leading at 35%, followed by Denmark (11%), China (9%), Brazil (8.5%) and Spain (7%). The fund's sectoral breakdown highlights its comprehensive approach, encompassing electric utilities (29%) and renewable electricity (23%). There are also stocks from ancillary industries supporting the clean energy transition such as heavy electrical equipment (10%), semiconductor equipment (10%) and semiconductors (10%).

Potential investors should note that ICLN offers concentrated exposure, with the top 10 holdings comprising over 50% of the fund's net assets exceeding $2 billion. Among them are established players like First Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR) and Enphase Energy (NASDAQ:ENPH). Additionally, the ETF has utility giants like Consolidated Edison (NYSE:ED), and international market leaders such as Spanish renewable energy leader Iberdrola (OTCMKTS:IBDRY) and Danish wind turbine manufacturer Vestas Wind Systems (OTCMKTS:VWSYF).

Since January, ICLN has declined around 10%. Currently, it is changing hands at 14.5 times trailing earnings and 1.6 times book value. Finally, the dividend yield is 1.8% and expense ratio is 0.41%.",investorplace.com,news,InvestorPlace,Tezcan Gecgil,0.411764705882353,452979151,1,https://investorplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/renewable-energy-grid-concept.png,eng-9545731

The UK government has announced a new LionLink power line between UK and Netherlands, which will be built under the North Sea, will deliver enough electricity to power 1.8 million homes, more than Manchester and Birmingham combined.

The power line will not only connect the UK and the Netherlands with offshore wind farms, providing clean affordable and secure energy to Britain but also help reduce household bills. The link will carry 1.8 GW of electricity as compared to Germany and Denmark's Kasso-Froslev (Kriegers Flag) link carrying 0.4 GW of electricity.

The new link will be developed by National Grid Ventures and TenneT and begin operations by early 2030. The multipurpose LionLink will join the UK and Netherlands to each other as well as with offshore wind farms of the North Sea.

The project supports the UK's 8.4 GW interconnector capacity and LionLink alone will increase it by up to a fifth and offer more clean and affordable power for UK homes and businesses.

LionLink will be favorable for the UK's coastal communities and the environment by reducing the need for further onshore construction and visible infrastructure, as well as lessening the impact on the North Sea's wildlife.

Britain's innovation, knowledge and skills within the North Sea energy sector is expected to bring $25 billion a year of investment to the UK's coastal regions and create 40,000 green jobs to Britain.

The project was declared as Energy Security Secretary, Grant Shapps accompanied a British business delegation to the North Sea Summit in Belgium to enhance collective energy security through new renewable energy and interconnector projects.

At the summit, the Energy Security Secretary is not only expected to sign an agreement with Denmark to boost trade in cheaper, cleaner energy but also a Memorandum of Understanding between the UK and Denmark to ensure further collaboration on the transition from fossil fuels to renewable technologies, especially offshore wind.",tdworld.com,news,T&D World,,0.3568627450980393,452974654,16,"https://img.tdworld.com/files/base/ebm/tdworld/image/2024/05/663d10a9636e098ac3adc504-dreamstime_m_199895484.png?auto=format,compress&fit=fill&fill=blur&w=1200&h=630",

I've written about the emergence of offshore wind as a major emerging contributor to decarbonizing the global energy system, but I have been early in my assessments. Perhaps this is not unexpected for new technology investments that require substantial upfront cash. The recent high interest rate environment, combined with supply chain issues resulting from the COVID pandemic, certainly hasn't helped. There have been several technical innovations (e.g. floating and bigger wind turbines) and geopolitical challenges (Russian invasion of Ukraine) which have meant that there is a new urgency to make offshore wind a, if not the, key contributor to exit from fossil fuels. Here I provide an overview of what's happening and how the major offshore wind developer, Orsted (OTCPK:DNNGY) is likely to benefit, notwithstanding that its share price has performed poorly over the past 12 months (down 32.9% year-on-year). Europe continues to spearhead this process by getting momentum to build out its offshore wind infrastructure, but this change is by no means restricted to Europe. The US is at last getting into the game, and developments in Asia, Southeast Asia and Oceania all look like they will become major. Orsted is the world's biggest offshore wind developer and recent reports suggest that after a tough 2023 the wind is beginning to blow in a serious way. I think this is a good time to think again about offshore wind as the industry shows signs of recovery. The plan to treble renewable energy capacity by 2030 suggests that a very favorable environment is emerging.

Wide Alpha has just published a detailed commentary on the traditional metrics of Orsted's business, which led to a Strong Buy rating. I refer readers to the latest Orsted quarterly presentation and Q1 2024 earnings call transcript, along with WideAlpha's coverage for a traditional view of investment information for the company. My focus complements this coverage by providing a bigger picture and qualitative view of the business. Readers will be familiar with my interest in what management says in quarterly reporting, and the latest report from Orsted is no exception.

Emerging areas

AI

CEO Mads Nippers said in the Q&A from Q1 2024 reporting that AI is a huge opportunity that's beginning to become clear. Orsted has 2 GW of capacity for data centers from offshore and onshore renewables already sold. The point is that the companies involved (e.g. Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT) and Google (GOOG) (GOOGL)) are very committed to decarbonization. This brings into focus a lot of expectations from natural gas suppliers about these customers. Since natural gas is a major greenhouse gas emitter (through CO2 and methane) it will be interesting to see where the balance ends up with these data center customers. This opportunity is both in Europe and the US, with data centers close to the node of offtake for offshore wind. The data centers represent a double-digit portion of Orsted's existing offtake already.

New geographic opportunities

There are a lot of opportunities for Orsted because it has coped better with recent challenges for the industry than many of its competitors. Orsted reports construction and operation of offshore wind farms in Denmark, Germany, The Netherlands, Poland, Taiwan, the UK and US. It expects to have 20-22 GW of offshore wind by 2030. Currently Orsted has 8.9 GW installed and a further 10.3 GW under construction or awarded. This means that Orsted's goal of 20-22 GW by 2030 seems pretty certain to be met. It's significantly lower than previous estimates, reflecting the recent tough times for the industry.

Here I note two very recent opportunities that give a flavor of what Orsted's future pipeline might look like, with huge projects up for grabs. There are many more.

The point is that the outcome of the recent COP28 was a renewables and energy efficiency pledge from 133 countries to treble renewable energy capacity to 11,000 GW and to double the rate of energy efficiency. Note that key countries China and India did not sign this commitment, not because they have trouble about trebling renewable energy by 2030 (they will) but because the dramatic improvement in energy efficiency was a bridge too far for these countries.

The scale of the COP28 pledges is astonishing, and offshore wind is an essential key to success of this commitment.

Australia

Australia has outstanding offshore wind opportunities in Southern Australia and six areas have been defined by the Australian Government, several of which are close by coal power facilities due for imminent closure. Two areas are in Victoria (Gippsland, Southern Ocean), two are in NSW (Hunter, Illawarra), one in Tasmania (Bass Strait) and one in Western Australia (Indian Ocean off Bunbury). These six sites have been chosen because they have strong and consistent winds, are close to areas of high electricity demand, have existing electricity transmission infrastructure, have existing transport and port infrastructure, and industry is interested in these areas.

The above is attractive to Orsted and last week the Australian Government provided a site exclusive feasibility license for an offshore wind site 56-100km from the Southern Victorian coast, with a nearby second license likely. However, its experience concerning the US offshore wind industry has made it cautious and the plan is for project completion (if it proceeds) in the early 2030's after participation in an auction in late 2025. Victoria has a 9 GW offshore wind target by 2040. Mads Nipper makes clear the learnings from the US experience have been taken on board by the entire offshore wind industry. Orsted views Australia as a substantial long term opportunity for offshore wind.

The points I make above about the six prospective wind zones in Australia are well understood by Orsted and it's considering carefully the challenges of an entirely new market and building the needed supply chain. Mads Nippers made clear Orsted's interest, but he also stressed that the initial capex to explore the Australian opportunity is quite limited. It's clear that risks involved with new kinds of turbines are front of mind for these long-term projects, getting a good balance between today's technology and the risks of investing early in tomorrow's technology.

Denmark

Denmark has opened an offshore wind tender that will be at least 6 GW and could be up to 10 GW (or more!). The scale of this opportunity is clear when one realizes that currently Denmark has just ~3 GW now. This is a massive opportunity that could trigger investment of more than 13 billion Euro. The Danish state plans to take a 20% stake in each wind farm in this project. The goal is to address climate issues and energy security, notably the deficit from absence of Russian oil and gas in the Danish energy mix.

Mads Nipper indicated in the Q1 2024 earnings Q&A that there has been good dialogue between industry and Government concerning this project. When asked about the possibility of delivering this project by 2030, Mads Nipper indicated Orsted doesn't know enough to assess whether such a tight goal is realistic or not. Clearly, Orsted is the local candidate for a significant role in this development, but it's too early to understand where the project fits in comparison with other international opportunities for Orsted. Note that the Danish Government holds 50.15% of Orsted shares.

Risks

Natural gas/LNG

There's no doubt that currently there is a huge effort by the oil and gas industry to lock in massive natural gas/LNG projects all over the world. These projects invariably attack/dismiss offshore wind as a credible solution, even as offshore wind is clearly an alternative emissions-free solution, especially throughout Asia as well as in the US, Australia, Europe etc.

Australia is a good example of the battle, with big plans for offshore wind being developed by the Australian Government (see above), but at the same time the oil and gas industry commands Australian Government attention through big Natural gas/LNG projects. There's clearly conflict in government, with a lot of press indicating a big future for natural gas.

In the US the very strong reaction to the Biden administration freeze on new LNG export terminal developments shows the oil and gas industry fighting to ignore the climate implications of massive gas expansion. Europe is part of this discussion, but note (above) Denmark's plans to escape LNG dependence by massive expansion of offshore wind.

The point about offshore wind is that it avoids the uncertainty of price experienced with LNG. Singapore with 95% dependence on natural gas/LNG for its electricity experienced massive increases in LNG pricing when Russia invaded Ukraine. It isn't clear to me that Singapore appreciates that LNG produces too many emissions, but the plan to reduce natural gas/LNG from 94.5% to 50% of Singapore's electricity supply by 2035 clearly indicates where this is going.

Technology

New technology invariably encounters challenges from other new technologies. There's competition for offshore wind from onshore big projects based on wind/solar/batteries as these are the cheapest technologies for 24/7 power, but it's not straightforward as the inland stuff has transmission line challenges. I think there's room for both. Note that Orsted does have inland renewables projects as well as offshore wind, with 1.4 GW of such projects in the US due for completion in 2024.

Politics

In the Q1 2024 earnings Q&A, a question was asked about the political risks in the US in this election year. The point was made that part of the problem of establishing offshore wind in the US was exacerbated by the antagonism of the Trump administration to wind power. Mads Nipper indicated that the company was very aware of potential problems arising from a second Trump administration. Orsted's approach is to make sure that all relevant permits are in place before November. The company seems comfortable about having this issue under control. Mads Nipper's view is that, notwithstanding some rhetoric to the contrary, offshore wind is becoming increasingly a bipartisan issue. Both red and blue states are very focused on job creation and offshore wind is seen as a significant job creator in Texas, the Carolinas and the Gulf Coast in general. Orsted is working hard to make these issues concerning job creation visible. The ironic aspect of new job creation is the current program of 800 job cuts... good for the bottom line, but not something to focus on too heavily!

Costs of offshore wind

A question was asked concerning where the cost of construction of offshore wind (globally) has arrived. Mads Nipper made clear that the big issue hinges on interest rates and hence inflation. When asked whether pricing has peaked, he couched his answer on macroeconomic factors especially in relation to inflation. His view was that things may not have peaked, but that inflationary conditions are much flatter than in the recent past. Since offshore wind has big capital costs on construction, after which the costs fall dramatically (as opposed to operating oil and gas which is a continuing cost to harvest, transport and refine), clearly project commencement is a big deal in terms of financing.

What the market thinks

Sometimes I'm puzzled about the world in which I live. Perhaps this reflects the joy of seeing the world from the Australian bush and getting input from furry friends (wombats and kangaroos). Orsted is the company that has most successfully transitioned from the fossil fuel world (it was formerly a major oil and gas company DONG (Danish Oil & Natural Gas) Energy) to being a significant renewable energy company. It's the world's biggest offshore wind project developer, using its skills from the oil and gas industry in the renewables space.

Seeking Alpha seems in another world because just one author (""strong buy"") has covered the stock in the past 30 days and there's only one Wall Rating (""strong buy"") in the past 90 days. More perplexing is the ""sell"" from Seeking Alpha's Quant rating. OK, the company is Danish and the Danish Government has a big influence on the company, but offshore wind is becoming a major part of the energy transition. I don't understand the absence of coverage nor the metrics that lead to a Quant ""sell"" rating. Quant works really well for many companies, but companies that are starting out in areas where there are major transitions coming seem to be poorly analyzed by Quant. I'm with the optimistic (but very limited) coverage of the lone Seeking Alpha author and lone Wall Streeter.

Conclusion

The world is off-balance as the fossil fuel industry seeks to expand greenhouse gas emissions by not transitioning to electrification of wheeled transport (Japanese Government and Toyota (TM) have a big role in this) and expansion of oil and gas production (e.g. Exxon Mobil (XOM), Woodside Energy (WDS). Major governments worldwide continue to invest massively in fossil fuel projects at a time when climate science says that new projects are unthinkable. Key scientists agree that the world is heading for a 2.5C increase in temperature at a time when a temperature increase less than 1.5C is causing widespread climate disasters.

Offshore wind is one of the technologies that are now mature enough to make a major contribution to emissions reductions by substituting coal and gas-driven electricity production. After a hiatus caused by high interest rates, COVID-induced supply chain issues and resistance to renewables by governments and the fossil fuel industry, the stars may be beginning to align for a massive expansion of offshore wind. As the world's biggest offshore wind project developer, Orsted is ready for a major expansion that has to be of interest to shareholders looking for clarity in the energy transition.

I am not a financial advisor, but I follow closely the massive changes happening as the world begins to exit fossil fuels and electrify everything. I hope that my perspective is useful to you and your financial advisor as you consider the role of energy investment in your portfolio.

-Astypalaea, Halki, Tilos and Syros pave the way for sustainable tourism, waste management and technology

Astypalaea, Halki and Tilos. You may not have heard of these small, remote Greek islands in the South Aegean, but they all share something in common: ambitious goals despite their small size.

For decades, islands like these have been considered merely remote stops on ferry routes that had to be supported by state subsidies - no business wants to operate at a loss. They were considered unprofitable compared to the big islands like Santorini and Mykonos, which attract large numbers of visitors.

Today, however, these islands are attracting global attention for their green prospects and innovation-focused initiatives. The trio is adopting a range of measures of environmental conservation, sustainability and innovation, some of which are shining examples of best practice.

Central and northern European countries, such as Austria, Finland and Denmark, have long had high scores for eco-innovation, while Greece has lagged behind. Today, the south-eastern European country is demonstrating how sustainability can be achieved and innovation implemented using smart technology, integrated systems and innovative narratives.

Greece is blessed with unparalleled natural beauty, yet over the last decade, Greece has faced a number of complex challenges related to the environment, energy, natural resources, cultural preservation, agriculture and tourism. Climate change is of particular concern, with scientists noting that the region is warming 20% faster than the global average. In May 2022, Greece passed its first climate law, which outlines specific targets to combat climate change and calls for the phasing out of the use of coal for electricity generation by 2028. Under the legislation, the authorities aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030 and 80% by 2040, before achieving zero net emissions by 2050.

State, regional and local authorities, with the support of the private sector, have tacitly joined forces in recent years to find solutions that strike a balance between preserving the character of islands, reducing emissions and implementing 21st century technological advances.

The three islands are joined by Rhodes and Syros, the capitals of the Dodecanese and Cyclades respectively. Together, they play a key role in shaping the future of the South Aegean and Greece as a whole. These islands create a blueprint that can be shared with the rest of the country and possibly with other countries.

These initiatives are not only aimed at improving the quality of life of local residents, but these islands will certainly prove to be particularly attractive to eco-minded travellers, who are increasingly choosing destinations based on sustainability factors.

Astypalaia: A pioneer in smart technology and green energy

The butterfly-shaped island of Astypalea in the Dodecanese, with an area of 97 square kilometres and 1,334 inhabitants, is taking important steps to become the first smart and sustainable island in the Mediterranean.

A public-private partnership involving the Greek state, the South Aegean Region and the Volkswagen Group, supported by EU funding, is implementing a pioneering project to transform the island into a model for e-mobility, smart mobility and renewable energy.

Four pillars are at the heart of this green energy-focused initiative, namely vehicle electrification, smart mobility, charging and energy and autonomous driving.

Since its launch in 2020, measures taken include the upgrading of the island's energy network and infrastructure, the installation of free public charging stations for electric vehicles and the introduction of e-mobility services. Residents can apply for subsidies for the purchase of an electric vehicle.

The introduction of on-demand buses and car-sharing services has proved to be very successful. Through the Astybus mobile app, residents and visitors can call an e-bus, which is gradually replacing conventional municipal buses, to pick them up from a virtual bus stop. In its first 150 days of operation, AstyBus made 24,370 trips. If you prefer your own means of transport, the AstyMove app allows you to book and pick up an e-car, e-bike or e-scooter for personal use.

At the same time, local authorities hope that by 2026, a hybrid energy system consisting of a photovoltaic station and batteries will cover 80% of the island's total energy needs.

Halki

A model for net zero carbon emissions on the west coast of Rhodes, the hilly Halki bears the title of Greece's first eco-island. Launched in 2021, the national initiative revolves around a circular economy initiative focused on decarbonisation and the transition to green energy. The key objectives are to increase the use of renewable energy sources, sustainable water and waste management, the introduction of e-mobility and the transformation of the agricultural and tourism sectors into ""green"" sectors. What is particularly impressive is that, through the GR-eco islands programme, the island is one of the few places in the whole world that have achieved a zero carbon footprint. That is, the amount of greenhouse gas emissions is offset by an equivalent amount. This is not only a critical step forward for the region, but also a bold challenge for the country and the world at large.

A 1MW photovoltaic power plant has been installed in Halki, allowing virtual net metering and offsetting of energy costs for residents and businesses, who are part of an energy community. Many have seen significant reductions in their electricity bills and some have even received credits.

Smart street and architectural lighting, electric vehicles and mobile device charging through a smart counter are among the aspects of the program. Residents are offered incentives to replace conventional vehicles with electric ones and have access to telemedicine services.

Halki is an example of what can be achieved when local communities and the private sector work together to find solutions to critical issues through the adoption of new technologies and low-carbon energy applications.

Tilos: certified for zero waste

With an area of just 63 square metres, the pristine Tilos may be tiny, but the rocky island of the Dodecanese is leading the way in the region by adopting a circular economy mentality. In July 2023, it was declared the first island in the world with zero waste certification. In just two years, Tilos has reduced its landfill disposal rate from 87% to zero.

Just Go Zero Tilos, a pioneering integrated waste management programme, was launched in December 2021 and includes the closure of the island's landfill. The programme is being implemented by the Municipality of Tilos in collaboration with Polygreen and the South Aegean Region, with the aim of making the island waste-free.

Through the programme, all waste is collected and, based on the principles of the circular economy, reused in order to eliminate its environmental footprint. Residents and business owners sort their waste into bins which are collected from their doorstep on specific days and taken to the Centre for Circular Innovation. There, recyclables are separated and packaged and non-recyclables are sent for waste-to-energy conversion. Organic waste is converted into fertilizer.

Locals can even track recycling efforts through a mobile phone app. Visitors are also required to follow the rules. They are provided with instructions on how to sort their waste. Old clothes, appliances and furniture find new life at the Creative Recycling Center.

The island's 780 inhabitants have achieved an astonishing 90% waste recycling rate, more than double the EU average of around 40%. According to the South Aegean Region, Tilos has the highest recycling rate of any municipality in the world. Tilos aims to produce 20% less waste, use 30% less plastic and recover 90% more waste by 2025. The pilot system is complemented by a hybrid solar and wind power generation system, with energy storage in batteries, which meets the needs of the port city of Livadia, home to around 500 people.

Polygreen was so successful in Tilos that it is now implementing a similar programme in Abu Dhabi.

Rhodes: paving the way for sustainable tourism

The rapid growth of the Greek tourism industry over the last decade has led to issues such as overcrowding in popular destinations and locations and pressure on public infrastructure. Fully aware of these challenges, the South Aegean Region has taken the initiative to research, design and implement measures to make sustainable tourism a present-day reality rather than a distant utopia.

In early 2022, the region signed a strategic partnership agreement with leading tour operator TUI and the TUI Care Foundation to create The Rhodes Co-Lab. The aim was to bring together tourism industry stakeholders to find solutions and create a holistic sustainable business model for travel destinations worldwide. Its three main pillars focus on regenerating the natural environment, enhancing social development and cultural heritage and promoting inclusive economic growth in tourism. Within these pillars there are six strategic priorities and 26 measures aimed at making Rhodes climate neutral in 2030, 20 years ahead of the national target.

A comprehensive, progressive plan designed to focus on green growth and address vital issues such as quality of life, infrastructure development, biodiversity restoration, social cohesion and prosperity is already underway. Among the initial priorities, which will be supported with European and national funding, are reforestation, pollution reduction and the introduction of environmental education programmes for children. The key to a favourable outcome is the active involvement of the community in the consultations. Plans include the creation of an international centre for sustainable tourism development, whose main role will be to create and implement best practices and policies for sustainable tourism worldwide.

Syros: creating a new technology and innovation hub

In January 2023, Syros welcomed the Aegean Neorion Innovation Centre (ANIC), a collaboration between the South Aegean Region, Onex Group & Technologies, Cisco and the University of the Aegean. The centre was created for several reasons: primarily to research, design and implement innovative solutions to the challenges faced by local communities. ANIC is a dynamic, modern technology and innovation ecosystem, whose aim is to act as a key hub for the development of value-added technological solutions at regional and national level.

It was established to provide local businesses with innovative solutions and help them in their digital transformation, while bringing new technologies to areas such as education, health and the environment.

ANIC's first project involved the transformation of Syros General Hospital into a safe, green and smart facility. Tablets and mobile phones have eliminated the use of forms, while sensors track the number of visitors and prevent overcrowding. Smart meters monitor environmental parameters and help reduce energy consumption.

Tilos, Halki and Astypalaia are at the forefront of Greece's efforts towards sustainability and innovation and are proof that small can certainly be powerful. At the same time, Rhodes and Syros are becoming incubators and think tanks for sustainable tourism and technology, respectively, whose impact could well be global.

Contact with visitors from near and distant shores over the centuries has meant that islanders have always been receptive to change, progress and development. This open-minded spirit and willingness to adapt potentially points to a very bright future for the South Aegean and Greece as a whole.",money-tourism.gr,news,ΧΡΗΜΑ & ΤΟΥΡΙΣΜΟΣ money-tourism.gr,,0.388235294117647,452950074,4,https://money-tourism.gr/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/N-AIGAIO-XT-311_02.jpg,

In April 2024, the Ethiopian government and the World Bank signed loan agreements worth $1.72 billion to enhance the country's electricity and water supply. Under the agreement, $523 million will be allocated to expand the country's electricity network and boost renewable energy generation. $500 million will be directed towards facilitating the movement of food to markets.

Meanwhile, the African Development Bank approved a $104 million grant to finance a transmission project to improve Ethiopia's electricity supply. The project will involve the construction of 157km of transmission lines and will include associated substations near the cities of Harar, Jijiga and Farem.

Ethiopia, along with Zimbabwe, signed intergovernmental agreements with Russia in July 2023 to establish a legal framework for the development of nuclear energy in the African country. Additionally, Ethiopia's government signed a grant agreement with Denmark during the same month which would see the mobilization of $10 million towards developing the Danish-Ethiopia Energy Partnership and phase one of the Ethiopian Danish Water Sector Cooperation.

At SSOP 2024, Minister Geleta is expected to discuss the Ethiopian government's plans to diversify its energy mix while delivering a consistent supply of power and unlocking opportunities that will stimulate public and private sector participation in the East African energy landscape.

The Danish billionaire is a major investor in a £23m Danish nuclear company, Seaborg, that is proposing to install up to 9,000 mini nuclear power stations in barges around South Korea, Indonesia, Thailand and elsewhere. Campaigners described floating reactors as a ""disaster waiting to happen"", warning that they could sink, leak radioactivity and contaminate coastlines. They criticised Povlsen for wasting money on a ""shameful"" scheme that will end up dumping radioactive waste on the other side of the world. Povlsen, however, said he was proud to back Seaborg ""to secure a sustainable, affordable solution"" to climate change and ""create a better world"". He stressed the need for ""new clean energy sources"" to enable a ""green climate transformation"". Seaborg argued that its reactors would be ""inherently safe"" and were vital to slowing global warming. Radioactive wastes would be ""chemically bound"" to the fuel so would not leak, the company said - and investors such as Povlsen should be applauded as ""bold and visionary"". Seaborg's plan is to design and manufacture new ""compact molten salt reactors"" to generate electricity from hundreds of barges moored around Asian coasts. Initial agreements have been signed with South Korea, Thailand and Indonesia. Seaborg said in 2021 that it was aiming to bring the reactors to market by 2025. According to one Danish report at the time, the company was aiming to install as many as 8,975 reactors in barges by 2040. Some experts, however, dispute the benefits of molten salt reactors. The nuclear critic, M.V. Ramana, concluded in the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists in June 2022 that they were a ""bad idea"". He maintained they were unlikely to operate reliably and would produce radioactive wastes that would be difficult to dispose of. The French Government's nuclear safety agency, IRSN, said the reactors still had to overcome ""numerous technical challenges"", he pointed out. Campaigners were damning in their dismissal of the reactors. Molten salt reactors were a failed technology and putting them in barges brought risks of leaks, crashes, and sinking, warned Dr Richard Dixon, the former director of Friends of the Earth Scotland. ""Given that Povlsen is an enthusiast for nature it seems bonkers to find him investing in a technology that could contaminate significant areas of coastline if things go wrong,"" Dixon told The Ferret. ""He should stick to protecting nature in Scotland instead of wasting a fortune on a madcap scheme that threatens public health and the environment with risks from thousands of reactors."" Friends of the Earth Denmark described the drive for small new reactors as a ""sham"" which would divert funds from renewables. ""In this case, the only good news is that it is private and not taxpayers' money that is wasted,"" said the group's Niels Henrik Hooge. ""We are surprised that Povlsen is investing money in Seaborg. He is known to be a savvy businessman and here in Denmark, Seaborg and others are not perceived as serious business ventures, only as a distraction from the green energy transition.""",no2nuclearpower.org.uk,news,No2NuclearPower,pete,0.1607843137254903,452942001,4,https://www.no2nuclearpower.org.uk/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/torness-power-station-959431_1920-Image-by-27707-on-Pixabay.jpg,eng-9554888

The timetable to be proposed to the Climate Investment Funds in June aims to ensure the country remains on track to obtain funding under the so-called Just Energy Transition Partnership -- a $9.3-billion pact with some of the world's richest nations. Under the agreement, first announced in 2021, South Africa will receive the assistance on condition it cuts its dependence on coal, which accounts for four-fifths of the nation's electricity output.

Early last year, South Africa told its partners in the pact it planned to delay the planned shutdown of coal-fired plants -- 14 of which are operated by state-owned Eskom -- to address record electricity outages. The authorities didn't set new closure dates.

""What we are presenting to the CIF is an adjustment to the decommissioning plan linked to an emissions target that we have to achieve,"" said Neil Cole, a finance manager at the Project Management Unit, which is overseeing the JETP for South Africa, within the presidency.

If the proposal is accepted, South Africa will secure $500-million of 10- to 30-year loans with an interest rate of less than 1% and a grace period of eight years from the World Bank-affiliated CIF, Cole said in an interview.

That will ""derisk"" concessional loans planned by multilateral development groups such as the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which has pledged $570-million. The African Development Bank has allocated $255-million and the International Finance Corp $70-million.

""We need to unlock the $500-million for the MDBs to take any kind of interest,"" he said.

A further $300-million will come from South African development agencies such as the Industrial Development Corp and the Development Bank of Southern Africa, while $875-million is expected come from private institutions, Cole said.

The funding is part of the JETP, under which France, the US, the UK, Germany and the EU initially agreed to contribute funds to South Africa, with the Netherlands and Denmark joining the pact later. South Africa has communicated its plans to its JET partners.

South Africa will propose that it close Eskom's Camden, Grootvlei and Hendrina power plants between 2027 and 2030, instead of a prior schedule of 2023 to 2027. In addition, in order to meet an annual emission-reduction target of 50 million to 71 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent required by the CIF, the presidency is in talks with Eskom to close a number of units at other power plants. That number has yet to be decided. Eskom didn't respond to a request for comment.

""We hope to have that data"" by June, Cole said. It will be a ""comprehensive shutting down. They won't be brought back into production,"" he said.

The proposal will be considered under the CIF's Accelerating Coal Transition Investment Programme.

Carbon dioxide, which is generated by burning fossil fuels, and a number of other so-called greenhouse gases are responsible for global warming.

Once the CIF hurdle has been cleared, it will be decided which South African entities will borrow the money.

Money used to decommission coal plants and repurpose them for the production of renewable energy may be borrowed by Eskom, while the national treasury may borrow funds to create alternative employment and economic activity in coal-dependent communities.

Some of the money will also be directed to improve the efficiency of municipal grids and to allow them to accept more renewable energy. If those funds are borrowed directly by the municipalities, national treasury will need to provide a sovereign guarantee, Cole said.

While South Africa's electricity cuts have eased -- a result of better performance by Eskom and the increased use of privately owned solar panels -- the JETP has attracted criticism from government ministers and labour unions. They argue the pact will exacerbate outages and cost tens of thousands of coal-mine and power-plant jobs.

""What we are presenting to the CIF is an adjustment to the decommissioning plan linked to an emissions target that we have to achieve,"" said Neil Cole, a finance manager at the Project Management Unit, which is overseeing the JETP for South Africa, within the presidency.

If the proposal is accepted, South Africa will secure $500 million of 10- to 30-year loans with an interest rate of less than 1% and a grace period of eight years from the World Bank-affiliated CIF, Cole said in an interview.

That will ""derisk"" concessional loans planned by multilateral development groups such as the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which has pledged $570 million (R10.59 billion).

The African Development Bank has allocated $255 million and the International Finance Corp. $70 million.

""We need to unlock the $500 million for the MDBs to take any kind of interest,"" he said.

A further $300 million will come from South African development agencies such as the Industrial Development Corp. and the Development Bank of Southern Africa, while $875 million is expected come from private institutions, Cole said.

The funding is part of the JETP, under which France, the US, the UK, Germany and the European Union initially agreed to contribute funds to South Africa, with the Netherlands and Denmark joining the pact later. South Africa has communicated its plans to its JET partners.

South Africa will propose that it close Eskom's Camden, Grootvlei and Hendrina power plants between 2027 and 2030, instead of a prior schedule of 2023 to 2027.

In addition, in order to meet an annual emission-reduction target of 50 million to 71 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent required by the CIF, the presidency is in talks with Eskom to close a number of units at other power plants.

That number has yet to be decided. Eskom didn't respond to a request for comment.

""We hope to have that data"" by June, Cole said. It will be a ""comprehensive shutting down.

They won't be brought back into production,"" he said.

The proposal will be considered under the CIF's Accelerating Coal Transition Investment Programme.

Carbon dioxide, which is generated by burning fossil fuels, and a number of other so-called greenhouse gases are responsible for global warming.

Once the CIF hurdle has been cleared, it will be decided which South African entities will borrow the money.

Money used to decommission coal plants and re-purpose them for the production of renewable energy may be borrowed by Eskom, while the National Treasury may take responsibility to repay funds used to create alternative employment and economic activity in coal-dependent communities.

Some of the money will also be directed to improve the efficiency of municipal grids and to allow them to accept more renewable energy.

If those funds are borrowed directly by the municipalities, the National Treasury will need to provide a sovereign guarantee, Cole said.

While South Africa's electricity cuts have eased -- a result of better performance by Eskom and the increased use of privately owned solar panels -- the JETP has attracted criticism from government ministers and labour unions.

They argue the pact will exacerbate outages and cost tens of thousands of coal mine and power plant jobs.

""The aim is to strengthen the energy sector so that South Africa can comply with the agreed emissions pathway and shut down coal-fired power plants,"" the German Development Ministry said in a response to questions.",mybroadband.co.za,news,MyBroadband,,0.2392156862745098,452930839,7,https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Hendrina-power-station.jpg,eng-9551477

The Danish billionaire is a major investor in a £23m Danish nuclear company, Seaborg, that is proposing to install up to 9,000 mini nuclear power stations in barges around South Korea, Indonesia, Thailand and elsewhere.

Campaigners described floating reactors as a ""disaster waiting to happen"", warning that they could sink, leak radioactivity and contaminate coastlines. They criticised Povlsen for wasting money on a ""shameful"" scheme that will end up dumping radioactive waste on the other side of the world.

Povlsen, however, said he was proud to back Seaborg ""to secure a sustainable, affordable solution"" to climate change and ""create a better world"". He stressed the need for ""new clean energy sources"" to enable a ""green climate transformation"".

Seaborg argued that its reactors would be ""inherently safe"" and were vital to slowing global warming. Radioactive wastes would be ""chemically bound"" to the fuel so would not leak, the company said - and investors such as Povlsen should be applauded as ""bold and visionary"".

He has been feted by some environmentalists for his commitment to ""restore our parts of the Highlands to their former magnificent natural state and repair the harm that man has inflicted on them."" His company, Wildland, manages three large estates in the Cairngorms, Lochaber and Sutherland.

According to the Danish Business Authority's register, as of 15 March 2024 Povlsen owned a 42.42 per cent capital share and had 46.66 per cent voting rights in Seaborg. He first bought a stake in the company in 2020 via his investment firm, Heartland.

Seaborg's plan is to design and manufacture new ""compact molten salt reactors"" to generate electricity from hundreds of barges moored around Asian coasts. Initial agreements have been signed with South Korea, Thailand and Indonesia.

Molten salt reactors are one of a series of new designs of smaller reactors that the nuclear industry hopes will boost the use of nuclear power globally. Instead of using water or gas to cool the nuclear reactions, as existing reactors do, they plan to use molten salts.

Seaborg said in 2021 that it was aiming to bring the reactors to market by 2025. According to one Danish report at the time, the company was aiming to install as many as 8,975 reactors in barges by 2040.

The reactors, however, are still being designed. In July 2023 Seaborg announced that it was changing the type of uranium fuel they would use, as well as the reactor moderators used to slow down nuclear reactions.

The company then appeared to postpone the planned delivery of the reactors, saying in 2023 that the aim was to complete its first plant in Asia ""by the end of this decade"".

Seaborg also wants to introduce its reactors in Europe. In July 2023 it signed a letter of intent with a Norwegian nuclear power company which said it was ""considering how this technology can best be introduced in Norway"".

According to Seaborg, its molten salt reactors on barges would complement renewable energy sources such as wind and solar. ""Our power barge can produce energy where and when it is needed, supporting variable renewables on windless, cloudy days,"" it said.

""The power barge will be able to deliver up to 800 megawatts of electricity as well as clean water from desalination, and district heating"". It could make ""an important contribution to the transition towards a prosperous and emission-free society,"" Seaborg argued.

Some experts, however, dispute the benefits of molten salt reactors. The nuclear critic, M.V. Ramana, concluded in the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists in June 2022 that they were a ""bad idea"".

He maintained they were unlikely to operate reliably and would produce radioactive wastes that would be difficult to dispose of. The French Government's nuclear safety agency, IRSN, said the reactors still had to overcome ""numerous technical challenges"", he pointed out.

Campaigners were damning in their dismissal of the reactors. Molten salt reactors were a failed technology and putting them in barges brought risks of leaks, crashes, and sinking, warned Dr Richard Dixon, the former director of Friends of the Earth Scotland.

""Given that Povlsen is an enthusiast for nature it seems bonkers to find him investing in a technology that could contaminate significant areas of coastline if things go wrong,"" Dixon told The Ferret.

""He should stick to protecting nature in Scotland instead of wasting a fortune on a madcap scheme that threatens public health and the environment with risks from thousands of reactors.""

The veteran Highland anti-nuclear campaigner, Lorraine Mann, argued there was no such thing as an ""inherently safe"" nuclear reactor. ""This appears to be a huge and, frankly, shameful misstep on Povlsen's part,"" she said.

""While he rewilds Scotland his ill-considered nuclear investment will necessitate the dumping of radioactive waste in some other part of the world.""

The Green MSP, Mark Ruskell, thought that the focus had to be on fast and effective action to prevent climate breakdown. ""Floating nuclear reactors are a disaster waiting to happen,"" he said.

""Rather than investing in dangerous and unproven nuclear technology, we should all be supporting clean green renewable energy which is already proven and is already making a big difference.""

Friends of the Earth Denmark described the drive for small new reactors as a ""sham"" which would divert funds from renewables. ""In this case, the only good news is that it is private and not taxpayers' money that is wasted,"" said the group's Niels Henrik Hooge.

""We are surprised that Povlsen is investing money in Seaborg. He is known to be a savvy businessman and here in Denmark, Seaborg and others are not perceived as serious business ventures, only as a distraction from the green energy transition.""

A spokesperson for Povlsen said: ""If we are to protect and preserve nature we need to keep innovating to create new clean energy sources that enable a green climate transformation and support hard-to-reach decarbonisation targets while tackling the planet's biodiversity crisis.

""Seaborg is harnessing new approaches to an established technology with the aim of becoming one of the world's leading clean-tech companies. Their proposition is to secure a sustainable, affordable solution to address climate change and enable the energy transformation that we all want to see.

""We are proud to play our part in supporting those ambitions in the hope that their work can truly create a better world if successful.""

According to Seaborg, nuclear power was vital to delivering more green energy. It was developing a new technology which ""had the greatest potential for achieving the large-scale deployment needed,"" the company's co-founder and lead reactor engineer, Eirik Eide Pettersen, told The Ferret.

""The main benefit of the molten salt reactor is that the exceptionally high level of safety that is expected and required from nuclear power plants is rooted in the laws of physics and chemistry instead of complex and costly engineered safety systems.""

He argued that because radioactive wastes were ""chemically bound"" within the fuel they could not leak in accidents, as has happened in the past. He accepted, however, that Seaborg reactors would produce long-lived radioactive wastes requiring ""timely and responsible handling"".

Pettersen also admitted that ""considerable work and investment remains to further mature and scale up the technology"". More testing was needed to ""bring molten salt reactors to the level of performance that the current nuclear industry achieves"", he said.

""Considering the scale of the global warming crisis we are increasingly experiencing, we strongly believe that the world needs an 'all of the above' approach to curbing emissions,"" he added.

""Nuclear power and molten salt reactors are dependable and competitive low-emission alternatives, with an environmental footprint smaller than any other energy technology. So we applaud the bold and visionary investors that have and continue to support the development of this.""",theferret.scot,news,The Ferret,,0.2078431372549019,452930518,7,https://ez9mxwef6ut.exactdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/iStock-1503875711.jpg,eng-9554888

Cargill Inn and Asia Society for Social Improvement and Sustainable Transformation (ASSIST), a foreign non-governmental organisation, on May 8 announced their partnership and the launch of Green Aqua project which aims to reduce water pollution through promoting the application of sustainable aquaculture practices in the Mekong Delta region.

The project will be implemented until July 2026, initially in Ca Mau province. It aims to provide training for more than 300 shrimp farmers on farming practices towards the Aquaculture Stewardship Council (ASC) standards on responsible aquaculture, as well as animal feed, waste management, and biodiversity preservation.

Ten outstanding trainees will have a chance to attend intensive training, enabling them to transfer farming techniques to their fellows in the following periods.

At the same time, a shrimp farming cooperative will have the opportunity to receive an ASC certificate, while three pilot farms will strive to reduce wastewater by 30% and cut nitrogen and phosphorus emissions by 20% by 2025.

The southernmost province of Ca Mau is the largest shrimp production hub in the country with a total farming area of 280,000 hectares.

During the two years of pilot implementation, the project will focus on supporting shrimp farms and creating a positive impact on the shrimp farming area across the province, while building local farmers' capacity to adapt to climate change.

The project is expected to contribute to coping with climate change challenges, improving the environment quality through promoting and strengthening processes to sustainably use water resources and treating waste in the aquaculture sector of Ca Mau in particular and the Mekong Delta region in general./.

Canada regards Vietnam as gateway to the Indo-Pacific

Quebec always considers Vietnam a gateway to the Indo-Pacific - a rapidly growing and dynamic region, according to Director of the Federation of Chambers of Commerce of Quebec Florent Favrel.

After the successful trip to Vietnam and Malaysia by the Canadian trade delegation, led by Minister of International Trade Mary Ng, Ottawa is actively targeting this region with activities to prepare for the Northern American country's businesses to invest and do business successfully in the Indo-Pacific.

The recent ""Gateway to the Indo-Pacific"" event was jointly organized by the Canadian Chamber of Commerce and the Export Development Canada (EDC) serving as a forum to help Canadian businesses get a deeper insight into business prospects as well as necessary solutions to achieve success in the region that is considered dynamic and extremely rapidly developing.

Vice President of Strategic Policy & Global Partnerships at the Canadian Chamber of Commerce Catherine Fortin LeFaivre highlighted the event ""Gateway to the Indo-Pacific"" held in Montreal as an opportunity for businesses to better understand opportunities in this region, through experts from businesses and research organizations and people with practical experience.

This will help enterprises outline more direction to consider expanding their business activities in the Indo-Pacific.

Canada is currently accelerating the implementation of the Indo-Pacific Strategy, whereby the country has invested around US$2 billion focusing on the trade sector to build more links and strengthen its presence in the region.

In this strategy, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is considered by Canada to play a central role and the two sides have seen significant development in all aspects of the relationship.

Asia-Pacific Foundation of Canada President and CEO Jeff Nankivell commented that one of the elements of the Indo-Pacific Strategy is to organize field trips for Canadian trade delegations, where brings together both government and business representatives.

Canada's trade delegation recently visited Malaysia and Vietnam and is expected to visit Indonesia and the Philippines later this year.

According to Jeff Nankivell, Canada is also opening offices to carry out tasks such as the Ministry of Agriculture in the Philippines, which serves as a center for agricultural products and agri-food products in the region. Vietnam will also play an important role in these activities as it boasts the greatest potential for expanding relationships.

In addition to the Philippines, Canada also has a Southeast Asia Trade Office in Singapore, and an Innovation Office which is about to open in Vietnam. The country is negotiating a free trade agreement with Indonesia in particular and ASEAN as a whole, he said.

According to Olivia Lee, Chief Representative, Southeast Asia at Export Development Canada, this region offers great potential for Canadian firms, especially in three growth areas: infrastructure, farm produce and progressive manufacturing fields.

One of the main things the agency sees in Vietnam at present is the energy transition, including increased development of wind and solar energy, Lee stated.

Nankivell said that Canadian public opinion currently shows a very high level of interest in developing and expanding relations with Vietnam.

Canadian universities and colleges are seeking to attract more students from Vietnam, while Canadian businesses are looking to invest in the Southeast Asian nation and also want to attract Vietnamese investment in a certain new field.

In the agriculture and agri-food sector, potential has also been identified for Canadian businesses and vice versa. With more than 30 years of experience working in the field of Canada - Asia relations, he believes that both sides have the best conditions in the relationship in all aspects.

Director of the Federation of Chambers of Commerce of Quebec Florent Favrel described ""Gateway to the Indo-Pacific"" as an extremely useful event which provided a lot of information about the potential of the Indo-Pacific region, especially Vietnam.

Vietnam is one of the first doors that Quebec businesses should open because of great potential that the nation can bring to them, he added.

Cooperatives urged to focus on branding to expand exports of organic teas

Cooperatives have been advised to focus on branding and improving product quality to expand tea exports to highly-demanding markets, especially organic tea products.

A report by the Center for Digital Transformation and Agricultural Statistics showed that the organic tea cultivation areas remain modest in Việt Nam, estimated at around 8,000ha or 6 per cent of the country's total tea growing area.

In Thái Nguyên Province which is home to the country's largest tea growing area of nearly 23,000ha, there are only 100ha certified organic.

Tea growing area certified organic by the EU is only at 2,500ha.

To expand exports to demanding markets with strict requirements of food hygiene and safety, getting organic certifications is critical.

Trần Thị Bình, director of Thành Đạt Organic Agricultural Cooperative in Thái Nguyên Province, said that they want support to improve product quality and expand exports.

Đào Thanh Vân, Deputy President of Việt Nam Organic Agriculture Association, said Việt Nam has around 100,000ha of tea growing area but the tea export price at US$1.6 per kg is very low.

Phạm Văn Tiến from Cao Sơn Tea Cooperative said that the market remains the biggest difficulty to cooperatives producing organic teas. Another problem is the weak linkage between farmers and enterprises in establishing tea value chains, he said.

Meanwhile, climate change is significantly affecting tea cultivation.

Currently, Việt Nam ranks fifth in the world in terms of tea export but it is mainly exported in raw forms with a lack of originality, making it difficult to compete in the global market so the added value for tea growers and cooperatives remains modest.

According to David Lyons, director at Australian Tea Cultural Society, the focus should be on building brands for Vietnamese tea products to expand exports to strict markets like Australia.

Impressive brands are important to develop loyalty customers, he said, adding that attention should also be paid to packaging.

Thân Dy Ngữ from Hiệp Thành Limited Company said that cooperatives and farmers should connect with each other to increase output and ensure quality for domestic production and exports.

Statistics showed that Việt Nam exported 28,000 tonnes of tea in the first three months of this year, worth $45 million, an increase of 30 per cent and 27.2 per cent, respectively, over the same period last year.

In 2023, tea export was estimated at 121,000 tonnes, worth $211 million, dropping by 16.9 per cent in volume and 10.9 per cent in value over 2022, on falling consumption demand in the global market.

HCM City works to put Metro Line No. 1 into operation soon

Ho Chi Minh City's Metro Line No. 1 (Ben Thanh-Suoi Tien) is close to the finish line but is facing some difficulties, thus the local administration and the investor are making efforts to remove obstacles so that the it can start commercial operation soon.

According to HCM City's Management Authority for Urban Railways (MAUR), 98% of the workload on the project has been completed.

Training for the operation of the metro line and preparation for acceptance work are underway. However, there are problems between contractors and project consultants.

According to the project's investor, contractors and consultants for Metro Line No. 1 have not agreed on the early handover of equipment and infrastructure for training, acceptance, and trial operation, resulting in a possibility that the metro line could not start commercial operations by the end of this year as scheduled.

Earlier in March, the municipal People's Committees set up a task group to settle difficulties related to the project. To date, the task group has held three meetings on the issue.

Chairman of the municipal People's Committee Phan Van Mai also sent a letter to the Japanese Ambassador to Vietnam, in which he affirmed that the city will consider the Japanese side's proposal to resolve disputes through the Dispute Adjudication Board (DAB). The city also asked the Japanese side to pool all resources so that contractor Hitachi can complete the trial operation of bidding package CP3 in May and the handover of a number of carriages and equipment required for the NJPT Consortium, the general consultant of the project, to conduct practical training.

The investor, general consultant and contractor have coordinated with the Fire Prevention and Fighting Police Department to conduct fire prevention inspection and acceptance for each item and the entire project.

Regarding personnel training, training work at Ho Chi Minh City Urban Railways No. 1 Company Limited, which is responsible for operating and managing the metro line, will be finished by the end of third quarter.

The Ben Thanh-Suoi Tien metro line runs 19.7km between District 1's Ben Thanh Market and Thu Duc city's Long Thanh Depot with three underground stations and 11 elevated stations. Work on the metro project started in 2012 and has gone through various delays. Its costs have risen to over 43.7 trillion VND (1.71 billion USD)./.

Appropriate policies needed for harmonized interests between farmers, businesses

For the development of the government's large paddy field in the Mekong Delta, harmonized benefits between farmers and businesses are important; therefore, it needs appropriate policies and other factors.

The workshop on developing sustainable links in the rice value chain was jointly held by the Coordination Office for Agriculture and Rural Affairs in the Mekong Delta under the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, the School of Public Policy - Rural Development and the People's Committee in Can Tho City today in Can Tho City.

Deputy Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development Tran Thanh Nam, representatives from the Vietnam Rice Sector Association; businesses and organizations in the rice industry chain in the Mekong Delta.

According to the Vietnam Rice Industry Association, policies, scientific and technical advances, and capital directly and indirectly affect the purchase of rice in the Mekong Delta and the relationship between farmers, cooperatives, traders, enterprises, distributors and consumers also have an impact on the benefits of farmers and businesses.

Farmers' rice will be distributed through the distribution channel. Accordingly, traders will help sell 49 percent of total rice in the region, while cooperatives 32 percent, milling factories more than 12 percent and rice processing and export enterprises more than 6.5 percent. Meanwhile, the direct consumption channels of cooperatives include businesses accounting for nearly 61 percent, milling factories accounting for more than 22 percent and traders accounting for more than 16 percent.

At the workshop, engineer Vo Quoc Trung from the Agricultural Extension Center in Soc Trang Province talked about the results of the investigation on the role of traders in the rice consumption chain. Accordingly, no farmers have so far contacted businesses directly but brokers. Specifically, rice growers sell rice through consumption channels including agricultural cooperatives (accounting for 5-7 percent) and local brokers (90-93 percent). Agricultural cooperatives and intermediaries will directly work with businesses for export and domestic consumption. Farmers also sell their rice to drying or milling establishments but traders also help farmers connect with these establishments which sell rice for domestic buyers.

Traders act as a bridge, an indispensable link in the current consumption chain, said engineer Trung. Without traders, the province's 2.1 million tons of rice is hardly consumed quickly. Currently, the project of large fields is at risk of destruction as farmers take advantage of sowing seeds and have the mentality of selling early when rice prices are high.

Businesses need to consider maintaining contracts signed with farmers when rice prices increase or decrease, each party bears 50 percent in this part. It is necessary to harmonize the interests of farmers and businesses to develop large fields, said engineer Vo Quoc Trung.

Chairman Huynh Van Thon of the Board of Directors of Loc Troi Group agreed with engineer Vo Quoc Trung's opinion, especially in the context of implementing the project 'Sustainable development of 1 million hectares specializing in high-quality rice cultivation and low emissions associated with green growth in the Mekong Delta until 2030'

Vice Principal Tran Minh Hai of the School of Public Policy and Rural Development said that the present rice chain in the Mekong Delta has seen the participation of many intermediaries. Among them, traders or barn owners, are people who clearly understand the chain. Businesses prefer to buy rice through traders because it helps businesses feel less stressed about spending capital because they do not have to advance money to farmers for a long time (2-3 months) while farmers prefer to sell to traders because they can get money immediately after sell their agricultural products.

The government or responsible agencies should encourage traders to voluntarily gather into groups and clubs to exchange experiences and access training content and technical guidance in preservation, transportation, and processing with the aim of ensuring quality, food safety and hygiene, said Vice Principal Tran Minh Hai.

According to Director Le Duc Thinh of the Department of Cooperative Economics under the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, rice value chain links have improved, with more diverse models and more sustainable models. However, the scale of area, output, and number of farmer households participating in the association are still small. The scale of association of businesses and cooperatives is not as large as expected while not many cooperatives and businesses have linked. Worse, linkage between cooperatives and businesses is not sustainable resulting breach of contracts.

Carbon credit export from rice, coconut production

In 2023, Vietnam achieved its first sale of 10.3 million forest carbon credits (equivalent to 10.3 million tons of CO2), generating around US$51.5 million (VND1.25 trillion).

The development of the carbon market has spurred the growth of green and circular economies while providing substantial financial gains for the nation. The Mekong Delta region, notably, has been identified as having significant potential in this market.

With over 143,000 hectares of forest and forestry land, Ca Mau province possesses significant potential and advantages in the formation and development of the carbon market. Since 2020, the provincial authorities have organized meetings for residents, forest owners, and businesses to hear expert talks and receive advice on carbon market-related issues. According to experts, forest carbon credits stem from greenhouse gas emission reduction projects, reducing deforestation and forest degradation, promoting forest planting, care, protection, and development, and encouraging vegetation regeneration. Forest owners can convert the amount of CO2 absorbed from managed forest areas into carbon credits for trading on the market.

Mr. Le Van Su, Deputy Chairman of the People's Committee of Ca Mau Province, assessed that implementing forest carbon absorption and storage services would provide a significant and sustainable financial source for the locality each year. This funding will support effective forest management, planting, care, protection, and development, reducing pressure on the State-budget-funded investment into the forestry sector. However, the implementation of this activity faces challenges due to the lack of a legal framework and detailed technical guidelines on transfer, benefit sharing, and determining carbon credit prices. Therefore, he hopes that the central government will soon complete the legal framework regarding carbon credit counting, certification, and trading, enabling Ca Mau and other localities to effectively tap into the potential of the forestry economy.

In Kien Giang, the representative from the VnSAT Project Management Board in Kien Giang Province announced that in 2024, Kien Giang would participate with 60,000 hectares of rice cultivation in the Sustainable Development of One Million Hectares of High Quality and Low-Emission Rice Associated with Green Growth in the Mekong River Delta by 2030. Accordingly, they plan to sell carbon credits for approximately 30,000 hectares. By 2025, the province aims to expand the area of high-quality, low-emission rice cultivation to 100,000 hectares, with an estimated sale of carbon credits for around 40,000 hectares.

Analyzing the benefits of carbon exploitation in rice production, Mr. Huynh Van Thon, Chairman of Loc Troi Group, highlighted that rice production currently contributes to approximately 50 percent of greenhouse gas emissions. Vietnam is actively addressing this issue to achieve zero net emissions, as committed. Furthermore, Vietnam is establishing a sustainable rice production ecosystem with internationally recognized farming practices. Specifically, the government has initiated the Sustainable Development of One Million Hectares of High Quality and Low-Emission Rice Associated with Green Growth in the Mekong River Delta by 2030. While the processes and direction are already established, the remaining challenge lies in how managers can effectively organize and mobilize farmers to align with these objectives. By accomplishing this, the utilization of carbon credits in rice production will yield significant future benefits.

According to the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development of Ben Tre Province, there are approximately 78,000 hectares of coconut trees in the province. This presents a favorable opportunity for selling carbon credits derived from these ""coconut fields."" In July 2024, Ben Tre will host a workshop focusing on the establishment and development of the carbon market for coconut trees. While the carbon credit market holds great potential, Vietnamese enterprises encounter various obstacles and financial challenges in entering this market. Therefore, Vietnam needs to strategize and implement solutions to overcome these barriers effectively.

As per the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, to exploit and sell carbon credits from rice production, the rice production region in the Sustainable Development Project for 1 million hectares of high-quality rice cultivation in the Mekong Delta must ensure specific production conditions. These conditions entail reducing rice seed usage to 80kg per hectare, cutting chemical fertilizer application by 30 percent, minimizing chemical plant protection products by 40 percent, and decreasing irrigation water consumption by over 30 percent. Furthermore, the adoption rate of Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) and equivalent practices must reach 100 percent, while the incorporation of advanced technology and digital solutions should exceed 50 percent. Greenhouse gas emissions should be curtailed by over 20 percent, and the collection and utilization of rice straw, covering 100 percent of harvested areas, is imperative.

Banks strengthen information security systems

Banks have implemented many new technology solutions to ensure information security in the context that digital transformation in the banking industry has been promoted strongly.

Phan Việt Linh, director of CDNetworks Vietnam, said the speed of digital transformation in the finance and banking sector in Việt Nam is growing quickly and strongly. At the same time, banks often face attacks from high-tech criminals to steal customer data to conduct property appropriation fraud. Therefore, banks must strengthen defence measures to ensure safety and security in their systems.

Nguyễn Văn Minh, deputy general director of KienlongBank, said KienlongBank has always focused and invested in information security. As a pioneer bank in digital transformation, KienlongBank has deployed technology solutions and modern application systems to handle huge amounts of customer information and transactions. Investment in technology and security systems is a top priority for KienlongBank.

To strengthen solutions ensuring information security and safety, Minh said KienlongBank has proactively strengthened network security systems and built strict information security processes. In the first three months of 2024, KienlongBank has coordinated with experienced partners in the field of security and cybersecurity, such as Viettel Cyber Security, VNPT Information Technology Company, FPT Telecommunications Joint Stock Company, Ernst & Young Vietnam Co., Ltd., and SafeGate Smart Network Security Joint Stock Company, organise system penetration testing to proactively ensure information security.

According to Orient Commercial Joint Stock Bank (OCB), as fraud in the banking and finance sector is on the rise, OCB also continuously implements internal and systematic evaluation and review methods to detect and absolutely prevent customer information being stolen.

Trần Quang Hưng, deputy director of the Ministry of Information and Communications' Information Security Department said information security in the banking system plays an important role. With a large amount of bank and customer data, the security of customer information in particular and banking data in general is mandatory for all credit institutions. Therefore, banks need to be equipped with modern technology and constantly strengthen their capacity as well as invest in security.

The State Bank of Vietnam has also issued many regulations to request credit institutions to implement measures to ensure security and safety in operations, including Directive 02/CT-NHNN on promoting digital transformation and ensuring information security and safety in banking activities.

Central beach city to lure investment from potential partners

The central city's People's Committee has officially issued an investment promotion programme for 2024 aiming to diversify partners and investment flows for new development.

The city said the programme will focus on calling potential domestic investors in hi-tech industries, semiconductor, information technology as well as giant technology companies from the the Europe Union, the US, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, India, and Taiwan (China).

It said the central hub will welcome all investors with planning for investment expansion or fund flow moves in the region.

Đà Nẵng has mapped out its Master Plan in 2021-30 with a vision to 2050, opening smooth options for domestic and foreign partners in line with the city's strategic development plan for the next decades.

In boosting promotion events with partners, the city will seek collaboration with organisations including - the Việt Nam Chamber of Commerce and Industry (VCCI), Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO), the Korean Chamber of Business in Việt Nam (KOCHAM), the American Chamber of Commerce in Việt Nam (AMCHAM), Indian Business Chamber in Việt Nam (Incham); the European Chamber of Commerce in Việt Nam (EuroCham) and the German Chamber of Commerce Abroad in Việt Nam (AHK) - in hosting investment studies and market access research as well as business links.

The investment promotion programme will also include support and positive solutions in clearing barriers in investment procedure for investors.

It also emphasised the importance of building investment links and friendship ties with the US, Australia, the EU, Finland, the UK and Denmark, speeding up possible key investment projects in Đà Nẵng.

The central city signed Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) for comprehensive and sustainable development in the Master Plan 2021-30, vision 2050, at Meet Đà Nẵng 2024.

Đà Nẵng's Semiconductor and AI Centre (DSAC) was also debuted early this year, setting up a foundation for investment flow of semiconductor industry from the US, Taiwan (China), Japan and the EU.

The beach city has been in discussions with TheCityUK, the industry-led body representing UK-based financial and related professional services, in building an international financial centre (IFC).

The National Assembly of Việt Nam has agreed on the pilot project developing Đà Nẵng Free Trade Zone.

To date, the city has attracted 1,016 FDI projects worth US$4.2 billion.

Forecasts upbeat for banks' 2024 profits

Vietnam's banking sector is projecting a period of robust growth and profitability, underpinned by strong first-quarter performances and optimistic forecasts for economic recovery and credit expansion.

At SHB's 2024 AGM last week, CEO Ngo Thu Ha unveiled a pre-tax profit target of approximately $470.25 million, a 22.2 per cent increase over the previous year's performance. Despite global economic uncertainties, Ha is confident in achieving these goals, citing an already robust profit of over $166.67 million by March.

Elsewhere, Nguyen Hoang Linh, CEO of MSB, reported significant growth at the close of the first quarter, with total assets reaching about $11.67 billion, marking over a 4 per cent increase.

""MSB saw a credit growth of over 5 per cent in a slowing sector, with customer loans and deposits growing by 4.7 and 4.1 per cent respectively. MSB's pre-tax profit stood at more than $63.75 million, fulfilling 22.5 per cent of its yearly target,"" Linh shared.

At TPBank, CEO Nguyen Hung announced a 2024 pre-tax profit goal of roughly $312.5 million, a 34 per cent on-year increase. With first-quarter profit of approximately $76.21 million and projected earnings surpassing $104.17 million by April's end, TPBank's targets are within reach.

VIB also showed a strong performance, with a first-quarter pre-tax profit exceeding $104.17 million; SeABank's first-quarter results saw consolidated pre-tax profit of $62.75 million, a nearly 41 per cent increase from the previous year; and VPBank recorded nearly $174.58 million in consolidated pre-tax profit in the period, a 66 per cent increase over the prior quarter and 64 per cent on-year.

LPBank stood out with a first-quarter pre-tax profit of $120.25 million, completing 27.5 per cent of its annual goal and achieving an 84.4 per cent increase on-year. An LPBank executive cited a fourfold increase in net service income from the same period in 2023, alongside strong net interest earnings and efficient cost management as key growth drivers.

These performances highlight a departure from the cautious outlook depicted in earlier surveys by the State Bank of Vietnam, with many banks now pushing aggressively to boost service income to compensate for slower credit growth. For example, TPBank's securities investments and MSB's foreign exchange operations have contributed significantly to their profits.

While some banks like BAC A BANK showed modest growth and others like PGBank experienced declines, the overall trend suggests a positive shift in the banking sector's performance.

Tran Thi Khanh Hien, head of Research at MB Securities (MBS), reported significant early-year advances within the Vietnamese banking sector, leading to notably higher industry valuations.

""Currently, the sector's price-to-book ratio stands at 1.66, marking a 6.7 per cent increase over the annual average, albeit remaining 8.7 per cent below the three-year average,"" she told VIR.

Dr. Can Van Luc, chief economist at BIDV Training School, provided an optimistic forecast, anticipating stronger profits based on the modest growth foundations set in 2023.

""Performance will vary among institutions, with differentiation driven by factors such as financial capacity, approved credit growth plans, asset quality, and fee-based income,"" he said. ""Notably, smaller banks may struggle to accelerate growth and could face deceleration due to competitive challenges in attracting low-interest deposits.""

""Next year's economic recovery is poised to spur credit growth rates to between 14-15 per cent, eclipsing those seen in 2023, thereby bolstering income from core credit services as well as ancillary financial offerings such as payment solutions, digital banking, and foreign exchange activities,"" Luc added.

Despite these positive indicators, Luc cautioned that several challenges could temper growth prospects, including rising risk provisioning in response to bad debts, and potential declines or persistently low values of secured assets. He also pointed out that major revenue streams from previous stages, such as bancassurance and off-balance sheet debt collection, might not quickly rebound.

""Additionally, operational costs are expected to rise owing to investments in technology and increasing salary expenses driven by government guidelines and the need to remain competitive in talent acquisition,"" Luc stated.

Hien of MBS emphasised that certain banks are likely to outperform the industry average. She argued that banks that can maintain a resilient net interest margin, even amid interest rate cuts aimed at fostering competitive credit growth, would likely fare well. These banks typically benefit from a low cost of funds and strong CASA ratios.

""Banks with a stable and expanding credit portfolio, anchored by a loyal customer base, and those that have significantly enhanced their asset quality with substantial provisioning in 2023 are likely to experience reduced provisioning pressures in 2024. This will notably enhance their after-tax profits relative to the broader industry,"" Hien said.

Financial barriers still remain for true industrial symbiosis

Despite having great potential for implementing industrial innovation, Vietnam lacks financial incentives for businesses in executing industrial symbiosis model and preventing them from taping into a circular community.

According to Lien Nguyen, a freelance consultant in renewable energy, the government should have clear and stable policies to support university and research institution engagement with renewable energy ventures.

""Policies for promotion of the recycling industry remain insufficient,"" Nguyen said at a conference on advancing the circular economy in Vietnam's industrial parks (IPs), held in mid-April in Ho Chi Minh City by the Ministry of Planning and Investment and the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO).

""In addition to that, the procedures for reuse and recycling of waste, particularly waste being sent outside companies, as well as market for exchangeable secondary materials and by-products, are all in a shortage,"" Nguyen said.

Industrial symbiosis is a must for an eco-IPs and an integrated part of the circular business model. A subset of industrial ecology, it describes how a network of diverse organisations can foster eco-innovation and long-term culture change, create and share mutually profitability, and improve business and technical processes.

According to Nguyen, the model requires the collaboration of government, universities, research institutions, and industries in upscaling the circular economy.

""Businesses should be guided to use material flow analysis tools in developing strategies to foster the circular economy, including industrial symbiosis,"" Nguyen said.

Vietnam has great potential in this area as it has around 420 IPs throughout the country. It also boasts diverse types of industries in selected IPs and a fast growth of disruptive technologies.

According to Christian Susan, manager of UNIDO's Global Eco-IP Programme, industrial symbiosis is a form that helps companies gain a competitive advantage through sharing services with other companies or with surrounding areas. ""They can also cooperate to exchange specific products, energy, water, and by-products with other companies or regions, thereby promoting comprehensive and sustainable development,"" said Susan.

""IPs with a large concentration of businesses become ideal platforms for promoting business synergy approaches. Symbiotic relationships between businesses help reduce the resource demand and can sustain resource use over longer periods of time and for multiple purposes, thereby promoting circularity,"" Susan added.

Pham Hong Diep, chairman of the board of Shinec, the investor of Nam Cau Kien IP located in thê northern port city of Haiphong, said that industrial symbiosis chains in the IP are implemented with a circular economic model, including metallurgy, mechanical engineering, plastic products, and electrical and electronic accessories. ""Within this year we will move towards zero waste through applying this model,"" Diep told VIR.

In the past, steel slag at the IP had to be processed, and the manufacturer had to pay over $200 million per tonne, but now it can save this fee instead. The purchaser will process steel slag at high temperatures and separate it into other materials to sell to factories that use it to produce magnets and additives for cement production.

Steel scrap is also produced into auxiliary products and components for the electrical industry, including assembling electronic components and equipment for the automobile industry and cable companies.

""Such an example shows that waste becomes a resource through symbiotic waste resources of businesses, and the output is secondary finished products. This also helps create a larger market for recycled raw materials and materials with reliability and high-quality standards,"" Diep said.

With this closed process and circular production, discarded items that previously had no value are now important raw materials, increasing revenues for businesses.

""Thanks to this benefit, Nam Cau Kien IP has occupancy of more than 80 per cent, even though the land rental price here is higher than other parks,"" Diep said.

Rooftop solar power puts IPs on the map

Transferring to renewable energy through installing rooftop solar power systems is set to help foster competitive capacity and further the sustainable development of businesses.

The growth rate of the rooftop solar market in Vietnam is considered one of the fastest-growing segments in terms of new installed capacity in the next 10 years.

With that, the Vietnamese government is promulgating policies to encourage the installation of rooftop solar power systems in industrial parks (IPs). After a meeting on the issue on April 10, Deputy Prime Minister Tran Hong Ha assigned the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MoIT) to coordinate with the Ministry of Justice and relevant agencies to develop a decree stipulating policies to encourage rooftop solar development, to be installed in homes, offices, and IPs.

The MoIT is also assigned to coordinate with relevant ministries and sectors as well as Vietnam Electricity to develop a set of model documents that specifically stipulate standards, technical regulations, and state management requirements in encouraging the development of rooftop solar power. The mechanism is expected to be implemented in the spirit of transparency and openness.

Apple supplier Foxconn is on the journey to install a rooftop solar power system for its factories with a total capacity of 32MWp, accounting for 20 per cent of Foxconn's current factory roof area in Vietnam. From June 2023, it has successfully operated 19MWp of rooftop solar capacity for its factories in the northern province of Bac Giang.

Several global manufacturing giants such as Samsung and LG are following Foxconn's path and plan to announce specific energy transition plans in Vietnam. Additionally, other outsourcing manufacturers for Adidas, Nike, and other apparel and footwear brands have also recently actively switched to rooftop solar.

Chung Dieu Tuan, CEO of foreign-invested enterprise CME Solar, said, ""The main market driver is the increased demand for rooftop solar installations in the manufacturing sectors of foreign-invested enterprises in Vietnam, especially the electronics/ semiconductor and textile industries. As part of the global effort to commit to net-zero emissions, international brands and manufacturers in Vietnam must meet the energy transition requirement to renewable sources.""

CME currently boasts rooftop solar power systems for a series of domestic and foreign-invested groups, such as Hwaseung Vina, an Adidas research and development centre, CJ Vietnam, Puratos Grand-Place Vietnam, Nam Dinh Vu Industrial Park, and Song Hong Garment JSC, among others.

These moves are expected to help realise the target that by 2050, 80 per cent of factories will install rooftop solar power systems, and the ratio for houses and office buildings is 20 per cent.

A Savills 2022 report stated that the total industrial and commercial roof area is about 80,000 hectares and the estimated annual growth rate is 10 per cent, while the total roof area used for the production of solar energy accounts for only 8 per cent.

Statistics from the Vietnam Energy Partnership Group show that as of June 2023, the total installed capacity of solar farms and rooftop solar power is estimated at 8GW, much higher than the 1GW witnessed at the end of 2020.

The market demand for low-emission products is both a pressure and a driving force pushing IPs and tenants to change and shift towards a circular economy, towards sustainable development. Thus, currently, businesses in various industries are in dire need of incentives and procedures to develop rooftop solar power.

Truong Van Cam, vice president of the Vietnam Textile and Apparel Association, said, ""Installing rooftop solar power is in line with the state's policy of reducing energy from fossil fuels, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and implementing the net-zero commitment by 2050. In addition, it also meets requirements in many other garment and textile markets, which require products with a green origin and using renewable energy.""

The textile and garment industry has around 1,200 businesses with over 600,000 workers located in IPs. Currently, about 30-50 per cent of businesses depending on the region have installed rooftop solar power, Cam said.

""Besides the problem of disposing of solar panels, there is also the problem of waste treatment and how to recycle it so as not to be a burden on the environment. Thus, there will soon need to be specific regulations on purchasing and using rooftop electricity in IPs and economic zones,"" he added.

According to Deputy Minister of Planning and Investment Nguyen Thi Bich Ngoc at a forum on promoting the sustainable development of IPs in mid-April, the transition towards green energy is a key factor in increasing competitiveness and ensuring sustainable development for each IP, locality, and the overall economy.

In Vietnam's 16 free trade agreements and negotiation of several others, requirements on clean and green production stages are critical so that businesses can participate in demanding markets. Additionally, the goal of sustainable industrial development has been included in the United Nations' sustainable development commitments.

Retail sales, services revenue up 8.5% in four months

Retail sales and services revenue in the first four months of this year totaled 2.06 quadrillion VND (81.06 billion VND), up 8.5% year-on-year, the General Statistics Office (GSO) said.

In April alone, the value was 522.1 trillion VND, a rise of 9% from the same period last year, with food and foodstuff sales up 10.3%, household utensils 12.9%, garment 12.7%, lodging and catering services 19.1%, and tourism 57.6%.

In the four months, retail sales reached some 1.59 quadrillion VND, up 7.1% year-on-year (up 4.4% if the price factor is excluded).

Sales of food and foodstuffs rose by 11.8%, household appliances 14.9%, garment 10.3%, vehicles (except cars) 0.1%, and cultural and educational products 17.8%. Revenue from accommodation and catering services was estimated at 237.3 trillion VND, up 15.3% year-on-year.

The office said favourable visa policies and tourism stimulus programmes have proven effective, helping lure nearly 1.6 million international visitors in April, up 58.2% year-on-year, and 6.2 million in the four months, up 68.3%.

Tourism revenue in the period was 19.4 trillion VND, representing an increase of 49.3% from the corresponding time last year.

Meanwhile, revenue from other services stood at 211.1 trillion VND, a year-on-year rise of 9.4%.

To ensure the supply of essential goods and boost the domestic market in the remaining months, the GSO suggested the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MoIT) further review, amend and perfect legal documents regarding state management of the domestic market.

The MoIT should continue its coordination with other ministries, agencies and localities in monitoring market developments, and providing consultations in price management, it said.

In an effort to promote consumption demand, Minister of Finance Ho Duc Phoc, authorised by the Prime Minister, submitted a proposal to the National Assembly for extending the cut in value-added tax (VAT) from 10% to 8% on specific groups of goods and services from July 1 until the end of the year./.

PM sets major goals for banking sector in digital transformation

Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh has set three major digital transformation targets for the banking sector, including creating the most favourable conditions for people, businesses and agencies to access banking services.

At an event on digital transformation in the banking industry held by the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) in Hanoi on May 8, the PM said digital transformation should contribute to reducing time and compliance cost for people, businesses and agencies and the banking system itself, while helping control risks and prevent corruption.

The Government leader requested the banking sector to focus on strengthening the perfection of institutions and mechanisms, creating a full legal corridor for the development, expansion and diversification of modern banking services meeting international standards, and promoting the development of the digital banking ecosystem, meeting the growing requirements of the economy.

Alongside, it is necessary to boost electronic payment infrastructure, diversifying banking products and services, creating an important foundation for the development of the digital banking ecosystem and digital economy, while speeding up digital transformation to support banking inspection and supervision, thus enhancing publicity, transparency, and preventing corruption and money laundering.

At the same time, the PM also underlined the need to develop digital human resources in the banking industry, especially high-quality human resources to meet the development needs of the industry and international cooperation activities, along with the enhancement of security and safety in payment, protection of personal data and application of new security standards, ensuring fast, safe, convenient payment at reasonable cost.

PM Chinh emphasised that the banking sector should effectively implement tasks and solutions stated in the national digital transformation strategy, the strategy for banking sector's development, the digital transformation plan in the banking industry, and Directive 18 on strengthening data connections and sharing serving the development of e-commerce, preventing tax loss and ensuring monetary security.

According to the SBV, after three years of implementing the digital transformation plan for the banking sector until 2025 with a vision to 2030, the sector has reaped fruitful results.

To date, more than 87% of adults have payment accounts at banks and many banks have over 95% of transactions processed on digital channels. The average growth in the number of payment transactions via mobile devices and QR code from 2017 to 2023 reached over 100% per year.

Banking technology infrastructure has been upgraded and developed, ensuring continuous, smooth and safe operations. New digital technologies have also been strongly applied to develop new products and services, meeting the increasing needs of people and businesses. Vietnam has completed cross-border payment connections via QR codes with Thailand, Cambodia, and is connecting with Laos, and expectedly with countries inside and outside the ASEAN region, the SBV said.

The banking sector has closely coordinated with the Ministry of Public Security in crime prevention and control and in using residential data to serve customer information data cleaning, authenticating customers' identification, supporting lending activities.

To date, 58 credit institutions have been implementing applications to authenticate customers with chip-embedded ID cards via devices at the counter, and 14 credit institutions are piloting the use of the identification and authentication app (VNeID) in some of their services.

Positive results have also been seen in cashless payment activities. In the first 4 months of 2024, cashless payment transactions increased 56.57% in number and 31.35% in value, the SBV reported./.",vietnamnet.vn,news,VietNamNet News,,0.3333333333333333,452924975,10,https://static-images.vnncdn.net/vps_images_publish/000001/00000Q/2024/5/9/vietnam-business-news-may-92024-2bee1e414c4842cab6de6ca895ee235f-1032.jpg?width=0&s=yLED9ImHwNDnEXRwcLq2Lg,

""All the modelling shows New Zealand's electricity generation will rely on an element of thermal generation for at least the next couple of decades to supplement the growth of intermittent renewable electricity generation sources.

""And with half the carbon footprint of coal, natural gas is by far the far preferable fuel to meet this shortfall,"" he says.

However, the Minister for Resources, Hon Shane Jones, has recently expressed concern at the diminishing supply of natural gas available to keep the lights on.

And yesterday Genesis Energy announced its intention to import more coal to fuel its thermal generation at its Huntly plant, due to the uncertainty of sufficient gas supply.

Clarke says it's reassuring that the Government is concerned about the availability of natural gas in upcoming years, given gas's key role in supporting electricity generation and industry, and has recognised that investment is needed to bolster the ongoing supply.

Meanwhile the future availability of gas as a fuel of choice for smaller consumers is also a priority for the sector, he says.

""Happily, a transition to renewable, net-zero carbon gas is a viable and realistic path for smaller gas consumers such as households and restaurants.""

Potentially New Zealand has enough feedstock to replace natural gas with biogas generated from organic waste to supply these smaller consumers, Clarke says.

And New Zealand energy companies are investing in biogas production facilities.

Biogas sourced from organic waste is increasingly being used internationally to transition away from fossil-sourced natural gas.

Denmark, for example, has already replaced 32 percent of its natural gas with biogas sourced largely from animal waste and has a target of ramping this up to 100 percent by 2030.

With a recent consumer preference study commissioned by the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority (EECA) confirming that most residential owners of gas appliances intend hanging on to them until the end of their service lives, if the potential of biogas is realised, they will be able to keep using their gas appliances indefinitely.

A real advantage of this is they won't have to stump up with the hefty upfront cost of replacing their appliances with non-gas alternatives, Clarke says.

Net-zero carbon biomethane is chemically identical to the natural gas-sourced methane we use today in our homes, and is fully compatible with existing gas appliances.

""Not only is the criticality of a sufficient supply of natural gas as a transition fuel being recognised by the Government for New Zealand's energy security out to 2050, but the decarbonising of gas itself will mean consumers will continue to have a choice of low-carbon energy sources in a decarbonised energy future.""",foreignaffairs.co.nz,news,foreignaffairs.co.nz,Mil-Osi Publisher,0.2941176470588236,452923215,7,,

Previously seen as a reckless and destabilising actor, Riyadh is now in a position to shape regional as well as global trends following the geopolitical shifts triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine and Western retrenchment from the Middle East and North Africa.

By leveraging its energy, financial, and political capital, Saudi Arabia has become a middle power with outsize influence in a multipolar world order. Regional and global leaders have been trekking to the kingdom with new intensity, looking to Riyadh as a key actor to move beyond the war between Israel and Hamas and towards a new, inclusive, and long-term regional security framework.

This greater geopolitical weight has led Riyadh to engage in extreme hedging between rival global and regional players with the aim of securing its own immediate national interests and maximising its influence. In this sense, its new regional and international policy can be defined as 'opportunistic actionism'. Saudi Arabia is working to become the leader and pivot of the wider region and using this role to gain a seat at the global table as the representative of an economically connected and stable Middle East. On the global level, Riyadh's opportunistic actionism has seen it build transactional relationships with various global players in alignment with different Saudi interests and vulnerabilities. Having lost faith in longstanding US security guarantees, Riyadh has focused on maximising its autonomy to extract gains from diverse partners, confident that it can successfully navigate the competing pressures emerging from this approach without becoming entangled in the US-China competition.

These developments have not gone unnoticed in European capitals. European leaders have made several trips to the kingdom over the last couple of years to discuss regional questions of security and stability, including on Gaza and other crises, as well as the delicate question of how to deal with Iran and its proxies. These visits, alongside policy efforts like the European Union's first-ever Gulf strategy published in May 2022, recognise Saudi Arabia's economic and diplomatic firepower, as well as its critical role in regional and global conversations on climate change, economic growth, connectivity, and, of course, energy. But, as the Gulf strategy acknowledges, the EU has not so far pursued the opportunities provided by a more strategic engagement with Saudi Arabia.

This paper will lay out the kingdom's evolving role in a multipolar Middle Eastern and global order, assessing its drivers, assets, instruments, strategies, and ambitions, first at the regional and then at the global level. It will then consider what this new Saudi posture means for European engagement with the kingdom and suggest ways to strengthen Europe's position and relevance in Riyadh in a way that benefits key European interests on energy and climate security, economic growth, and regional security and stability.

For Riyadh, the 2011 Arab uprisings represented a watershed moment in which a decades-old paradigm - being able to rely on external partners to achieve a favourable regional order - collapsed. To prevent the resulting geopolitical vacuum from being filled by rivals aspiring to regional leadership - first and foremost, Iran - Saudi Arabia increasedits traditionally quiet regional engagement. This began a ten-year phaseof polarisation in regional politics, with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates actively confronting both Iran and its regional proxies, as well as Qatar, Turkey, and Islamist groups.

These confrontations took place on many different fronts - including in Egypt, Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, Syria, Tunisia, and Yemen - and played out simultaneously in the economic, military, and political domains. The new Saudi leadership enthroned in 2015 strongly supported this assertive regional strategy. Both King Salman and, especially, his son Mohammed bin Salman - commonly known as MBS - who became the kingdom's crown prince in 2017, pushed back hard against the encroachment of rivals on Saudi Arabia's spheres of influence and interests. Between 2015 and 2017 the Saudi leadership supported a full political boycott and economic embargo of Qatar over its support for Sunni Islamist groups, temporarily forcibly detained Lebanese prime minister Saad Hariri, launched the first-ever Saudi-led military operation against the Iranian-backed Houthi militia in Yemen, and in 2018, supported the withdrawal of the United States from the Iranian nuclear deal, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), under Donald Trump and its maximum pressure campaign on Iran.

However, this assertive posture was met with retributions. Global capitals - particularly in the West - increasingly shunned Riyadh and sidelined its leaders. After having enabled cross-border attacks by the Houthis against Saudi Arabia for years, in September 2019 Iran coordinated a large-scale attack against crucial oil installations in Saudi Arabia. The US, then led by Trump, did not react, arguing that Saudi Arabia should lead the response. This folding of the decades-old American deterrence umbrella left Riyadh exposed and vulnerable. The Biden administration then reinforced this status, declassifying a CIA report indicating that MBS likely approved the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi and withholding defence supplies to Saudi Arabia, which was facing daily threats from Yemen's Houthi rebels.

The outbreak of the covid-19 pandemic in 2020 provided time and space for Saudi Arabia to rethink its assertive approach and launch a strategic pause. Riyadh started to focus less on diminishing the clout of its regional competitors and more on strengthening its own influence, building a less confrontational regional posture that was based on diplomacy and economic statecraft. It began to actively leverage its assets - which were soon enhanced by the global energy crisis triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine - to support new policies aimed at bringing about the social and economic transformation of the country envisioned in MBS's Vision 2030 plan. Doing so would require, first and foremost, guaranteeing security for itself and stability in its neighbourhood.

Step one was mending ties with two regional players with vast partnership potential, Qatar and Turkey. The 2021 Al-Ula declaration, which ended the Qatar crisis, kickstarted a period of close Riyadh-Doha coordination. Qatar started cutting back support for its Islamist partners and downsizing its regional ambitions, prioritising alignment with Saudi Arabia. MBS himself stepped in to repair personal relations with Qatar's Emir Tamin bin Hamad al-Thani, and the two established a Saudi-Qatari Coordination Council to deepen coordination. Meanwhile, Turkish-Saudi tensions significantly subsided as Turkey started again relying on Saudi resources to ease its domestic financial problems. In 2023 MBS and Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan exchanged state visits and signed strategic deals, including a prized defence agreement on technological cooperation with the cutting-edge Turkish drone technology firm Bayraktar. Turkish exports to Saudi Arabia grewby 150 per cent year-on-year.

Saudi Arabia also attempted to lessen its antagonistic relationship with Iran through increased diplomacy. In March 2023, Saudi Arabia and Iran signed a roadmap towards the normalisation of their relations in Beijing. The document came after five rounds of bilateral negotiations hosted by Iraq and Oman, but an external actor - China - was needed to break the impasse by offering credible diplomatic guarantees underwritten by economic leverage, especially over Iran. Tehran successfully pressured Yemen's Houthis to stop cross-border attacks against the kingdom and its interests, while Saudi Arabia pledged to ease the regional isolation of the Iranian regime, which was dealing with an economic recession, domestic protests, and the collapse of negotiations to renew the JCPOA.

Moreover, Riyadh tried to take advantage of the détente with Iran to relaunch its relations with countries under Iran's influence. Extricating itself from the costly and unsuccessful war in Yemen was and remains a priority for Saudi Arabia, so much so that it ended up offering an extremely generous deal to the Houthis. Riyadh then normalised relations with the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad, welcoming it back into the Arab League in 2023, a decade after withdrawing its ambassador from Damascus and actively supporting the Syrian opposition. Saudi Arabia also re-opened its embassy in Lebanon and started engaging again with the country's convoluted politics, which Riyadh had determinedly avoided since its failed attempt to coerce former prime minister Hariri in an existential political fight with Iran-supported Hizbullah. Finally, Saudi Arabia dusted off its engagement with Iraq, signing a range of energy, investment, and infrastructure agreements.

However, for the most part these initiatives quickly stagnated, as Riyadh was unable to get its counterparts on board with its vision quickly or smoothly enough. For instance, the Houthis started stalling on the signing of a deal with Riyadh and the Yemeni peace process was frozen. Relations with Damascus remained hollow as the regime failed to curb the huge volume of drugs smuggled from Syria towards the Gulf. Riyadh's efforts in Lebanon fell flat as Lebanese elites once again rejected Saudi advice to embrace systemic change and reboot their country. Saudi-Iraqi cooperation slowed down significantly under the government of Muhammad al-Sudani, who the Saudi leadership considered too dependent on Iran and unwilling to make space for Saudi influence.

As part of this new vision of a 'pax saudita', Riyadh also began to attempt to move closer to Israel, another crucial partner for its interests of development, growth, and connectivity, as well as its ever-present deterrence needs. Then came Hamas's terrorist attack on Israel on 7 October 2023 and Israel's subsequent all-out military response in Gaza - which caused a major shock to regional politics. Many observers sawHamas's attack as partly orchestrated by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) with the aim of disrupting the ongoing triangular process involving Saudi-Israeli normalisation in exchange for NATO-like US security guarantees, US nuclear technology for Riyadh, and greater access to Israeli defence capabilities. Despite this, the magnitude of Hamas's operation together with the lack of confidence in US protection pushed Riyadh to engage even more closely with Tehran. Iranian president Ebrahim Raisi visited Riyadh for the first time to attend an extraordinary joint Arab and Islamic summit on the Gaza war, and met with MBS. This summit was mostly an opportunity for Riyadh to collectivise regional strengths and weaknesses, neutralising the specific vulnerabilities linked to its normalisation process with Israel, which was not suspended, and rejecting proposals from other countries in the region such as a collective oil embargo, which would significantly damage its interests.

Riyadh did not involve Tehran in any of the following meetings on Gaza, ensuring that it could maintain its leadership of the cause, but increased its engagement with Iran more broadly, reflecting both countries' strong desire to keep tensions under control. Riyadh even served as an indirect de-confliction channel between the US and Iran: when the US and the United Kingdom started an offensive military mission in the Red Sea to fight the Houthis as they held global shipping hostage, Riyadh warned Tehran ahead of the strikes so that it could move its naval assets away.[1] But when Tehran retaliated against the Israeli strike that killed IRGC generals in the Iranian consulate in Damascus, launching over 300 drones and ballistic missiles against Israel, Saudi Arabia joined the US, Jordan, the UK, and France to intercept the Iranian projectiles - showing that Riyadh will do whatever possible to contain an Israeli-US escalation against Iran. Nonetheless, Riyadh's absolute priorityremained protecting its own interests, territory, and critical infrastructure. Fearing Iranian or Houthi retribution, Riyadh decidednot to join any of the Western maritime security missions against the Houthis, even if strictly defensive like Europe's ASPIDES, and instead negotiated assurances from both the Houthis and Tehran that the kingdom would not be targeted.

Saudi Arabia's willingness to emerge as leading the Arab response to the war has been clear throughout the Gaza crisis. Saudi Arabia formed a small contact group on Palestine, including Jordan, Egypt, the UAE, and Qatar. Despite political issues between the members, Riyadh managed to present a post-war plan for Gaza, designed around Palestinian statehood in exchange for the normalisation of Israel's position in the region. Although based on Saudi Arabia's 2002 Arab Peace Initiative, the plan's demands on behalf of the Palestinians go far beyond what Riyadh had previously asked for before Israel's war on Gaza. This is the - at present, unwelcome - burden of Saudi Arabia's new leadership responsibilities: having to compromise on its own agenda for Palestinian interests. And yet, while likely frozen for the foreseeable future, Saudi Arabia's normalisation with Israel remains key to its core interest of rebuilding its dented deterrence.

A significant obstacle to this Saudi vision of a stable region under its hegemony came from an unexpected place, as the UAE emerged as the one regional actor with the strategic ability to compete with Saudi Arabia. The longstanding personal relationship between MBS and Emirati president Muhammad bin Zayed, which was the backbone of the two countries' relations, gradually weakened and from 2019 onwards, the two leaders went from being in constant interaction to having minimal contact. Then, Emirati and Saudi policies started to substantially diverge. Departing from the Saudi-led policy of confrontation and abandoning Riyadh's ally in Yemen, the UAE reached out to Iran months before Riyadh did in 2020. The UAE then normalised relations with Israel in a landmark deal brokered by the US, again without seeking Saudi counsel and undermining the Saudi Arab Peace Initiative, which entailed collective Arab normalisation with Israel under Saudi leadership in exchange for Palestinian statehood. Longstanding divergences in Yemen became an active political confrontation between groups in the south of the country, backed by Abu Dhabi, and the government, supported by Riyadh, further contributing to the souring of relations. The two capitals also supported opposite sides in the 2023 Sudanese civil war, in which Saudi Arabia attempted its first high-level regional mediation, with limited success. A zero-sum geoeconomic competition ensued, based on both capitals' ambition to become the leading key hub connecting Asia, Africa, and Europe in a multipolar globalised international economic system. Saudi Arabia issued a law requiring international firms to establish their regional headquarters - which are typically located in Dubai - in Riyadh in order to be eligible for government contracts, and both countries doubled down on increasing the geoeconomic value of their territory.

Saudi Arabia's recent regional policies reflect an actionist emphasis on dynamism and a rejection of continuity, especially since 2020. MBS has markedly broken away from longstanding axioms of Saudi thinking and begun pursuing bolder policies such as normalising relations with both Iran and Israel in parallel. Riyadh's decisions are evidently guided by opportunism and a Saudi-first mantra. Its policies over this period reflect a desire to become the leader and pivot of the wider region. However, this is not driven by a desire for inclusive or consensus-based regional leadership, nor for solving traditionally 'Middle Eastern' systemic problems including endemic corruption and sectarian divisions. Indeed, Saudi Arabia has shown a lack of strategic patience with regional actors that do not follow its leadership, are anchored to traditional thinking, or unable to overcome their structural obstacles. Rather, Saudi Arabia's regional policies seem to be in service of its ambition for regional leadership in order to secure what it considers to be its rightful place in the new global order as the utmost representative of the wider region in global conversations and as a middle power in a multipolar world order.

Geopolitical changes have helped Saudi Arabia to capitalise on this new regional strength on the global stage. After the US retrenchment from the kingdom in 2019, Saudi Arabia's behaviour reflected both disappointment and distrust towards the US, as well as confidence that it could survive without its close partner in Washington. Saudi Arabia once again modelled itself as a fundamental partner to global powers. Only, this time it pursued not one single partner, but sought à la carte, opportunistic multi-alignment with various emerging global powers. This was aided by the fact that several of these powers - including China, India, and Russia - started actively courting the kingdom as the new regional pivot.

Russia's invasion of Ukraine solidified this trend, as a global energy crisis yielded new power and immense wealth to Saudi Arabia as the world's largest oil producer. Gulf rulers enthusiastically embraced the multipolar world order, believing that they could operate as a bridge between East and West, and between the global north and the global south, and rejecting the premise that they should align with traditional Western partners in the rivalry with Russia or China. Instead, they focused on pursuing their national interests, and selected partners accordingly.

For instance, given its impact on the global energy market on which Saudi Arabia's economic security depends, Riyadh concentrated on influencing Russia's energy policy. After Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Saudi Arabia rejected multiple requests to align with the West against Russia from Biden as well as leaders in Europe such as British prime minister Boris Johnson and French president Emmanuel Macron. Riyadh also resisted pressure from several G7 leaders to boost its oil production in order to weaken Russian finances, which are dependent on oil export money, and instead led oil producers to cut output, driving already-high prices up even further - just two weeks before the delicate US mid-term elections in October 2022. Saudi Arabia then started importing record quantities of under-priced Russian oil products, refining and exporting them at sky-high market prices. However, providing a counterweight to this seemingly pro-Russian bias, Saudi Arabia voted against Russia in key United Nations General Assembly resolutions, pledged aid worth $410m to Ukraine, facilitated a deal for the release of ten foreign nationals fighting alongside Ukraine, and hosted meetings to convey Western and Ukrainian geopolitical outreach to global south officials. Nonetheless, as reflected in recent public opinion polling conducted for ECFR, over half of Saudi respondents believe that the US and the EU are the major obstacles to achieving peace in Ukraine, and an overwhelming majority believes that Russia will win the war by 2028.

This à la carte and opportunistic multi-alignment is also reflected in Saudi Arabia's decision to join BRICS+ in August 2023, alongside the UAE, Egypt, Iran, Argentina, and Ethiopia. As the global south's major platform for political coordination in a multipolar world order, the BRICS+ bloc provides Riyadh with a useful channel to reinforce its outreach to Africa and Latin America and to challenge US dominance. In November 2023 Saudi Arabia also organised the first-ever Saudi-Africa summit, signalling that Africa represents a major new frontier, especially for food security and critical raw materials. Alongside its traditional focus on the Horn of Africa, with which it shares the Red Sea, Riyadh is increasingly looking to South Africa as an actor with political clout in the global south and the G20.[2] In Latin America, meanwhile, Riyadh is stepping up its engagement with the increasingly attractive Brazil. In 2022, for example, Saudi Arabia's state-owned firm Manara Minerals announced its acquisition of a 10 per cent stake in Brazil mining colossus Vale, facilitating access to reserves of critical minerals like nickel, copper, and cobalt.

Saudi Arabia has also tended its relations with India, its third-largest trading partner and a particularly attractive one in terms of connectivity. At the G20 summit in Delhi, India, the US, the EU, France, Germany, Italy, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE unveiled plans for the India-Middle East-Europe economic corridor (IMEC), which aims to enhance connectivity between Asia and Europe via the Arabian Peninsula by building a railway that will supplement existing maritime and road transport routes, enabling transit from India to Europe, via the Gulf monarchies as well as Jordan and Israel. The railway could ultimately be complemented by cables for electricity and digital connectivity, as well as pipes for the export of clean hydrogen. The project was sponsored by the US as a way to entice Saudi Arabia to normalise its relations with Israel, given that IMEC would economically link the two countries with a major global connectivity route. While Israel's military aggression against Gaza has complicated the next steps, making it politically toxic for Riyadh to engage with the project, IMEC remains strategic for Saudi Arabia's geoeconomic plans, especially with the Houthis constantly attacking commercial shipping in the Red Sea. Indeed, in December 2023 the Israeli smart transportation company Trucknet Enterprise signed deals with its Emirati-based counterpart Puretrans FZCO and the Dubai port-operating company DP World to facilitate an overland trade route from the UAE - through Saudi Arabia and Jordan - to the Israeli port of Haifa as a trial run for the corridor. IMEC is exemplary of Riyadh's hedging between global powers; ultimately Riyadh wants the corridor to emerge as an additional network complementing China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and cement Riyadh's position as a fundamental bridge towards the world's largest emerging economies, and has rejected the idea that engagement with India would mean disengagement from China or the BRI.

Indeed, despite Western pressure, Saudi Arabia is clearly working to ringfence its relations with China, which is a strategic partner for Riyadh's economic security. China has been the main buyer of Saudi crude oil since 2019, with Riyadh sending on average a whopping quarter of its oil there. Since 2020, China is also among the top two trade and investment partners for Saudi Arabia, alongside the EU. Despite a general substantial slow-down of funds through China's BRI after the covid-19 pandemic, with countries like Egypt seeing investments fall to zero, Saudi Arabia is the largest recipient of BRI-branded funds, receiving around $5.5 billion, including via the Chinese Cosco Shipping Ports acquiring a 20 per cent stake in Saudi Arabia's Red Sea Gateway Terminal - the largest terminal at the country's largest port. This acquisition is no cause for concern in the kingdom: more than half of the Saudis surveyed by ECFR in 2023 thought that Chinese capital owning a tech company, media organisation, or critical infrastructure in Saudi Arabia was acceptable. The two countries have also been making moves to safeguard their interests in case the West imposes sanctions on China. During his state visit to Saudi Arabia in December 2022, Chinese leader Xi Jinping formally stated his willingness to purchase Saudi oil in renminbi. Saudi officials acknowledged that there are active talks on the matter, and in 2023, China and Saudi Arabia signed their first currency swap agreement worth $7 billion which will be valid for three years.

Beijing also opened up fully to techno-scientific cooperation with Saudi Arabia, becoming a dependable catalyst for technological localisation and granting generous access to know-how even for sensitive technologies that Western states remain reluctant to share, in defence, AI, bio-tech, and cyber-security. The opportunity for such unfettered access and cooperation motivated Riyadh to show a brazen willingness to cross US red lines in getting Chinese digital infrastructure, dismissing American concerns that these could become a backdoor into Western defence systems, and welcoming Huawei's leadership in 5G network development. China is also one of Riyadh's potential partners on nuclear energy cooperation. But, worryingly for Beijing, so are China-sceptic US allies, such as Japan and South Korea, which remain strategic interlocutors for Riyadh.

In addition to their fruitful economic relationship, Beijing also has a strong political appeal in Riyadh with its much-flaunted rhetoric of the Arabian Peninsula as a region of crucial long-term geostrategic relevance and bashing of Washington's posture towards the Middle East. In this regard too, Saudi Arabia is positioning itself as Beijing's first point of contact with the wider region, for example, hosting Xi with all honours for the first China-Arab States summit and a summit with the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) monarchies in December 2022. In March 2023, China brokered a normalisation deal between Iran and Saudi Arabia. This greatly boosted China's diplomatic profile in the region, but also came with Saudi expectations that Beijing would leverage its economic influence over Iran to rein in transgressions of the agreement. Saudi Arabia has given China opportunities for a deeper diplomatic role, visiting Beijing as the first stop on its diplomatic tour to build international consensus on obtaining a ceasefire in Gaza in November, but China has not embraced the chance. After 7 October, for instance, China did little to put pressure on Iran to stop the Houthi attacks. And despite its statements of support for a ceasefire, China had no influence on the Gaza dossier.

In its own way, the war in Gaza has therefore demonstrated that the US is still the indispensable geopolitical and security interlocutor in the region, albeit one that seems increasingly untrustworthy to Riyadh. US standing in Saudi Arabia and the wider Arab world has been severelyundermined by its policy of unconditional support of Israel's all-out aggression against Gaza, despite its violation of international humanitarian law, especially when contrasted with America's lack of interest in preserving Arab stability when engaging in military tit-for-tat with Iranian proxies in Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, and Yemen. Anti-Americanism is now pervasive in policy conversations in Riyadh. And given how US and Saudi priorities and interests have incrementally diverged since Barack Obama's presidency, a world in which the US is no longer a hegemon likely looks more attractive from Riyadh.

Nonetheless, given the lack of viable alternatives, Riyadh has remained determined to maintain - and even strengthen - security ties with the US, while working to beef up its own security and defence capabilities in the long term. Riyadh seems to accept that there still is no alternative to US security guarantees today, hence its eager engagement in the US-mediated process to normalise relations with Israel. However, Saudi Arabia intends to obtain such guarantees without making its relationship with the US exclusive. While it may be willing to comply with specific US redlines on freezing cooperation with China on digital and cyber infrastructures, on the petro-yuan and on ruling about Chinese military bases on Saudi soil, Riyadh has no intention of cutting relations to China and likely realises that the US could not force it to, especially if the kingdom continues to link these guarantees to the ultimate prize for Washington: normalisation with Israel.[3] This belief in multi-alignment with the great powers, even in the event of a serious crisis, is shared by the population. In ECFR's September 2023 polling in Saudi Arabia, 77 per cent of respondents thought it was realistically possible for their country to have good relations with both the US and China, although over half of respondents expect a US-China military confrontation within the next five years. And when asked which country they would want Saudi Arabia to side with if forced to choose, 50 per cent selected the US compared to 39 per cent that chose China.

For Riyadh, multipolarity means no longer blindly accepting US desiderata, but being able to pursue transactional relationships with different global players and, ultimately, setting its own agenda. Saudi Arabia sees a world in which middle powers - preferring multi-alignment - condition superpowers, rather than the other way around. It aims to capitalise on its strategic location between Africa, Asia, and Europe to maintain its geopolitical centrality. While the US and Europe are worried about dependence on China and Russia and the implications of uncontrolled globalisation, Riyadh has therefore been working to further strengthen both globalisation and multipolarity and protect them from what it sees as Western revanchism.

However, while this hedging tactic has so far allowed the country to thrive, it would likely not survive a full-scale escalation of the current simmering tensions, for instance between the US and China, or Iran and Israel. Already in 2023, a prized defence deal between US giant RTX and Saudi Arabia's defence company SCOPA Industries collapsed due to the latter's link to Russian and Chinese firms. Due to similar concerns in the technology space, the US has implemented temporary export control measures on Saudi Arabia for its cutting edge Nvidia semiconductors. Serious concerns about sensitive information being leaked to China or Russia are also preventing Saudi Arabia from joining the fighter jet alliance, Global Combat Air Program, between the UK, Italy, and Japan to develop and export highly advanced sixth-generation combat jets.

Europeans have long struggled to come to terms with the end of America's hegemony in the Middle East and North Africa, as well as with the shift in the balance of power in the region away from countries in North Africa and the Levant, and towards the Gulf. For decades, European states embraced a marginal geopolitical role in the region under the US security umbrella, and focused mostly on the Mediterranean and on issues such as economics, energy, and socio-cultural engagement. This resulted in weak geopolitical influence over the Gulf monarchies, especially once the latter stepped forward to become significant sources of investment and other financial support in Europe during the 2008-2009 global financial crisis.

Elected politicians have also found political engagement with the Gulf to be extremely difficult given the weight of human rights issues in public discourse in Europe. And European countries have tended to pursue the country's formidable economic opportunities bilaterally rather than through the EU. Saudi Arabia was the epitome of this dichotomic approach: with the publication of Vision 2030 in 2016, economic interest in the country went through the roof, but the involution of civil rights under MBS's leadership made outreach politically toxic. France represented an exception, attempting more geopolitical engagement with Saudi Arabia, such as on the crisis in Lebanon.

This dualism between economic and political ties generated controversies. For example, when in 2017 then German foreign minister Sigmar Gabriel condemned Saudi ""adventurism"" in the Middle East and called for an embargo on arms exports to the country, Riyadh withdrewits ambassador from Berlin and prevented major German companies from bidding for government contracts. This pushed Gabriel's successor, Heiko Maas, to resolve the dispute by partially reversing the arms embargo. Former Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi also found himself at the heart of a media storm after joining the Saudi state-led Future Investment Initiative Institute's board of trustees.

Moreover, there was little incentive for European countries to operate through the EU, especially given the Gulf's longstanding resistance to engaging with the multi-layered, hyper-institutionalised ways in which the EU functions. The lack of confidence in the EU persists among the public today, with 62 per cent of the Saudis surveyed in 2023 by ECFR believing that the bloc will fall apart in the next 20 years. However, although the EU does not have a reputation as a solid geopolitical actor, it retains considerable soft power in the country. In the same survey, 31 per cent of respondents said that if forced to live outside of Saudi Arabia, they would like to live in an EU country.

However, the US retrenchment from the region and the undeniable geopolitical rise of the Gulf monarchies changed the calculus in multiple European capitals regarding their relations with Saudi Arabia and the other Gulf states. In 2019, member states gave the EU the mandate to draft its first-ever Gulf strategy. The strategy officially defined key European interests in working with Gulf actors for the first time: developing connectivity; boosting trade and investment; fighting climate change; strengthening energy security and promoting a smooth green transition; scaling up development and humanitarian aid; and pursuing peace, stability, and de-escalation of tensions in the broader region. Containing instability clearly underpins all other interests, including related to energy, economics, and maritime security.

Three years later, Russia's invasion of Ukraine reinforced the centrality of the Gulf monarchies as indispensable energy providers: member states signed new energy deals with the kingdom and the EU unveiled its Strategic Partnership with the Gulf, which included a chapter on energy, in May 2022. The region's strategic ambiguity towards Russia quelled this newfound European enthusiasm towards the Gulf, but there was no denying that the monarchies had become meaningful geopolitical and geoeconomic interlocutors for Europe.

European countries have significant economic interests with the Gulf monarchies: in 2022, the trade between EU and GCC countries made another spectacular jump to €87 billion. In addition to bilateral trade, around 40 per cent of trade between Europe and Asia moves through Gulf waters and ports. The Gulf's centrality in economic connectivity between Asia and Europe will only increase after the implementation of the IMEC in Saudi Arabia and the UAE, making regional de-escalation and maritime security even more important.

With at least a dozen ambitious mega-projects in Vision 2030, Saudi Arabia also offers greatly attractive opportunities for trade, investment, and connectivity. To seize these opportunities the EU is working to overcome decades-old and apparently insurmountable obstacles to the EU-GCC free trade agreement - negotiations over which have been officially frozen since 2008 - as well as the upcoming Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, a tax on imports that rely on polluting, energy-intensive industrial processes, which is bound to affect several Saudi imports, including steel, aluminium, fertilisers, and cement. Saudi Arabia is both a leading oil producer and a first-mover on green hydrogen and is active in a strategic dialogue with the EU and some member states.

Striving to be net-zero by 2060, since 2021 Riyadh has also developed a new interest in being a regional leader on climate change, launching the Saudi and Middle East Green Initiative, the Global Water Organization, and vying to host several UN climate events. Over the past three years, through the King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Center (KSrelief) and the Saudi Fund for Development, Riyadh has emerged as a top official development assistance (ODA) donor, pledging - on average - 1 per cent of its gross national income. Saudi ODA also often targets the same countries across the Middle East and Africa that constitute a priority for Europe, such as Sudan or Tunisia. And yet, Riyadh has so far preferred to work unilaterally. Europeans have been unable to find a way to reconcile their strictly bureaucratised approach with the highly personalised and politicised Saudi attitude, despite the Saudis departing from unrestricted financial assistance towards more results-oriented projects.[4]

Finally, European expectations have grown significantly around the role that Saudi Arabia can play in regional de-escalation and stability. Despite the Iran-Saudi normalisation deal being signed in China, European governments politically supported the deal. They had arguedfor years that the Saudi-Iran rivalry was fuelling regional conflicts and instability in Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, and Yemen, and several governments supported Track II initiatives bringing regional voices together to discuss diplomatic solutions to these conflicts. For example, the idea that regional cooperation was necessary to sustain Iraq after almost two decades of war was central to the French-supported Baghdad Conference for Cooperation and Partnership in 2021 and 2022. The 2021 edition was the first time in years that both the Iranian and Saudi foreign ministers had participated in a political event together.

Preserving the Saudi-Iran détente is also an important way to prevent an expansion of the Israel-Palestine conflict to other regional theatres. Europeans were therefore lukewarm about America's approach to containing the Houthis in Yemen through military force, which could cause new flare-ups of the conflict there and lead to a collapse of Iran-Saudi relations. Instead they launched their defensive maritime security mission in the Red Sea - ASPIDES - mirroring the one operating in the Gulf since 2019, EMASoH, with active participation from Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, and Portugal. Saudi Arabia's engagement with both missions has to date been minimal, despite Europeans seeking greater maritime security cooperation with Riyadh. In the early weeks of the Gaza crisis, Europeans also looked to Saudi Arabia as an actor with the leverage to shepherd a political solution between Israel and the Palestinians, though they possibly overestimated Riyadh's capabilities. In the longer run, Europeans will expect the kingdom to become a more prominent and effective geopolitical interlocutor in the crises of the Red Sea - especially in Sudan - as well as to take the lead in supporting struggling countries in the Middle East and North Africa, such as Iraq, Lebanon, and Egypt in the post-war period.

On the global level, Europeans would benefit from upgrading their engagement with Saudi Arabia to gain influence over a player that can shape global questions - first and foremost on energy security, but also climate and the world economy. Although increasingly clear-eyed about Saudi Arabia's strategic ambiguity in international alignment and suspicious of Riyadh's Russian and Chinese connections, they believethey can become strategic partners-of-choice for Riyadh in technological and scientific global races that are of core value for the kingdom, such as the green transition, space exploration, and the new generation of defence. Saudi Arabia could, in turn, benefit from friendshoring away from riskier countries that are more clearly under Russian and Chinese influence and towards the West. However, given the risk that Saudi companies could serve as backdoors for Russia and China into Western technology, financial trading, and services markets, European countries are unlikely to offer such opportunities to the kingdom. While Europe remains an open system - and, in this sense, is sympathetic to Saudi views on globalisation - economic security threats have irreversibly curbed their enthusiasm for unmanaged globalisation.

In order to enhance their relationship with Saudi Arabia, Europeans need to reset their approach to account for Riyadh's gearshift towards a dynamic actionism that is guided by self-centred opportunism and is pursuing regional primacy as a vehicle to increase its clout as a middle power in a multipolar global order. In light of Riyadh's new foreign policy, European policymakers should consider the following strategies:

Europeans should, in the first instance, swap their order of engagement with Riyadh by approaching Riyadh on global issues, rather than prioritising regional cooperation. Europeans should abandon their traditional focus on seeking Saudi support to alleviate the structural challenges that are typical of their shared neighbourhood, which is problematic in three ways. Firstly, it limits engagement with Saudi Arabia to the Middle East and North Africa region, which Saudi ambitions have far outgrown. Secondly it underestimates the fact that Riyadh shares the ""Middle East fatigue"" that is taking hold in both the US and Europe. Finally, it ignores the historic inability to align European and Saudi thinking and priorities towards regional politics, from how to relate to Iran to how to manage post-Arab Spring Mediterranean countries - a discrepancy which has significantly deepened since Hamas's 7 October attack and Israel's all-out war on Gaza.

This does not mean that Europeans should no longer strive to upgrade their political engagement with Saudi Arabia on regional crises, such as managing Iran or the Gaza war. This can be a key opportunity for constructive Saudi regional leadership on the one hand, and, on the other, showcase how European capitals and institutions can be more useful interlocutors than the likes of Russia and China, which are both clearly disinterested in pushing for regional de-escalation and stability. Ultimately Europeans should support the Saudi-led Arab plan to halt violence in the Palestinian territories and move towards a two-state solution and Israel's integration in the wider region.

Europeans should not shy away from engaging on human rights - but should seek to reframe this conversation around Saudi Arabia's own development plans, both in terms of Vision 2030 and its international soft power campaign, presenting its poor human rights record as an obstacle to these ambitions. Social and economic liberalisation in Saudi Arabia has been accompanied by a significant increase in the repression of political and civil rights. However, European support for Israel has so deeply compromised Europe's credibility on human rights and values to the point that, in the short and mid-term, any hint of lecturing Riyadh on those issues will derail the entire conversation. European governments should focus on where progress is within reach, such as moving towards the abolition of the death penalty for minors, the end of the guardianship system for women, legislated religious freedom, and strengthening the rule of law in business and labour regulations.

Europeans, in practice, should pursue strategic interdependence in their approach towards Saudi Arabia, deepening partnerships in order to protect their interests and increase Europe's own sovereignty while respecting the sovereign desires of middle powers. Europeans should do this by focusing on becoming partners-of-choice in the domains that Riyadh considers critical, including energy, climate, economics and connectivity, and technology. This does not mean becoming exclusive interlocutors, but preferred ones. To compete with other external powers, Europeans should focus on their own added value and reinforce their strengths vis-à-vis the weaknesses of other players' offers by highlighting their shared visions with Saudi Arabia. A binary, zero-sum approach to partnerships is unlikely to work. And accepting multipolar realities creates not just challenges but also opportunities for Europe to strengthen its own role.

Europeans should, for example, play a fundamental role in significantly upgrading Saudi efforts to seek regional leadership in combating climate change, given European policy, scientific, and technical edge in this domain. Alleviating some of the dire challenges emanating from climate change - especially food and water scarcity - would also positively impact stability and security in the region. A high-profile, diplomatic platform on environmental security with a heavy focus on operationalisation could also be a useful way to cement regional de-escalation processes, including that between Saudi Arabia and Iran, which has become ever more important in preventing a regional expansion of the most recent conflict between Israel and Palestine.

Europeans also need to change their approach to seeking Saudi involvement in their projects for development aid and cooperation which currently ignores Saudi Arabia's fundamental desires for an active strategic role and substantial returns. For example, Italy's outreach for Saudi backing on its Mattei plan for Africa could be a significant opportunity to develop tools to get Riyadh on board. The Mattei plan moves away from an aid-focused approach towards a pragmatic, industry-driven one that takes into account business and growth opportunities; it promotes public-private partnerships and the involvement of sovereign wealth funds and investment vehicles; and it tries to slim down the bureaucracy and develop more flexible criteria. However, Saudi Arabia would rather subscribe to initiatives where it can have some input on design and active involvement in execution, and a clear return on its investment, be it in the form of political influence or actual advancement of their core interests, such as in terms of energy, connectivity, and economic growth. Italy and the EU should reframe their outreach to Saudi Arabia towards engagement with the Mattei plan in this context.

A connectivity project like IMEC could therefore be a strategic way to support Saudi Arabia's core aim of becoming a connectivity hub, while also reinforcing regional economic diplomacy. To do so, Europeans should make sure that this project is, as much as possible, inclusive towards non-signatory regional actors who would otherwise present obstacles. Turkey has already expressed its opposition to IMEC because it has not been involved. There is no reason why this should be the case; IMEC's action plan should be left flexible and open to mini extensions to the central corridor, branching out to link Oman to Saudi Arabia, Turkey to Jordan, or Sudan to Saudi Arabia via a sea bridge. This would also be useful in de-risking terms, giving IMEC players options to bypass regional tensions or rivalries, such as the one between Saudi Arabia and the UAE. At the same, given Saudi Arabia's reluctance to loosen ties with China, Europeans should not present IMEC as an alternative project to the BRI.

While accepting the realities of multipolarity and multi-alignment, Europeans should actively involve Saudi Arabia in the geoeconomics conversation, especially about de-risking and mitigating the risks associated with dependencies, mostly by diversifying partnerships and reducing exposure to potential disruptions. Europeans have a wealth of ideas to share on de-risking, and could find common ground with Saudi Arabia, given that they both share an aversion to economic coercion and supply chain bottlenecks.

Europeans should highlight the potential benefits of friendshoring but also the consequences of being viewed as backdoors for Russia and China into Western technology, financial trading, and services markets. Although not a major topic for Riyadh, it is starting to realise the impact of the weaponisation of interdependence and connectivity. In 2023 alone, Saudi firms lost opportunities for accessing know-how on US counter-drone technology, semiconductor technology, and sixth-generation combat jets.

In this sense, Europeans should place Saudi Arabia under further scrutiny for certain critical technologies in the context of the EU's economic security strategy. However, if happening within specific red lines, a diversification of partnerships (or multi-alignment) can indeed become a tool for de-risking for both Saudi Arabia and Europe, by enhancing economic security and the resilience of supply chains. To exploit multipolar opportunities, Europeans should continue thinking about minilateral cooperation with Saudi Arabia and other common partners - such as India, Japan, or South Korea - on shared interests, such as maritime logistics, food security, or the green transition. If Saudi Arabia and the other Gulf monarchies tighten some loose ends and increase the reliability of their systems, the Arabian Peninsula is well-placed to become the principal route for both the US and Europe as they seek to diversify their own partnership options for trading.

South Africa generates around 80% of its electricity from coal-fired power stations.

At COP 26 in November 2021, the governments of South Africa, France, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States of America, along with the European Union, issued a Political Declaration announcing a new ambitious, long-term Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP) with a combined pledge of US$ 8,5 billion in funding. The International Partners Group (IPG) as it is called, aims to accelerate the decarbonisation of South Africa's economy to help it achieve the ambitious goals set out in South Africa's updated Nationally Determined Contribution emissions goals.

Late last year, the South Africa's Cabinet approved the Just Energy Transition Implementation Plan, but there has been a push back from factions within the ruling party. The Secretary General of the ruling ANC party in South Africa, Fikile Mbalula, has slammed the investment partnership offer saying that the pact is responsible for the country's blackouts. South Africa's energy minister, Gwede Mantashe, snubbed US1 billion green energy MOU announcement with Denmark and The Netherlands. Read more

Early last year, South Africa told its partners in the pact it planned to delay the planned shutdown of its 14 coal-fired plants to address record electricity outages. The authorities didn't set new closure dates.

""What we are presenting to the CIF is an adjustment to the decommissioning plan linked to an emissions target that we have to achieve,"" said Neil Cole, a finance manager at the Project Management Unit, which is overseeing the JETP for South Africa, within the presidency.

If the proposal is accepted, South Africa will secure $500 million of 10- to 30-year loans with an interest rate of less than 1% and a grace period of eight years from the World Bank-affiliated CIF, Cole said in an interview with Bloomberg.

A 'Just' approach underpins the Plan, aiming to ensure that those most directly affected by a transition from coal - workers and communities including women and girls - are not left behind. It identifies $98 billion in financial requirements over five years to begin South Africa's 20 year energy transition. Investment will be required from both public and private sectors.

The IPG is mobilising an initial $8.5 billion to catalyse the first phase of the programme.

The funding package will be disbursed through various mechanisms over the five year period including grants, concessional loans and investments and risk sharing instruments. The IPG's funding will align to the Investment Plan and be geared towards: coal plant de-commissioning; funding alternative employment in coal mining areas; investments which will facilitate accelerated deployment of renewable energy and investments in new sectors of the green economy.

In November last year, a joint 12 month update to leaders by South Africa and the IPG summarises key technical progress that has contributed to the development of the JETP Investment Plan. It, and the preceding six month update to leaders, also outline measures undertaken by the government of South Africa to strengthen the enabling environment for South Africa's long-term energy transition.

The IPG's initial $8.5 billion funding package includes:

Some of this funding is already programmed while other parts of it have still to be finalised and programmed in line with the final Investment Plan. Work to programme the full $8.5 billion will continue in coming months.

In addition to the $8.5 billion, the World Bank Board has recently approved the Eskom Just Energy Transition project which is providing $0.5 billion of financing in support of South Africa's Just Energy Transition.

International Partners Group financial support

The IPG has supported South Africa's Just Energy Transition in a variety of ways both directly and indirectly. A fuller description of support is provided below.

Early progress in deploying the $8.5 billion support of Investment Plan

The Climate Investment Fund Accelerating Coal Transition (CIF ACT) Investment plan will provide $2.6 billion in total including $500 million of highly concessional Accelerating Coal Transition funding provided by the CIF. IPG members (Germany, the UK and the US) provide approximately 65% of funding for the overall CIF ACT programme. The CIF ACT Investment Plan will support the decommissioning and repurposing of three coal power stations, community development and energy efficiency projects in Mpumalanga. The World Bank's Eskom Just Energy Transition project will provide finance for decommissioning and repurposing a further coal power station.

France and Germany are providing $600 million ($300 million each) for a concessional policy loan to South Africa to support the JETP. The loan will be formally signed during COP27.

A number of IPG grant funded activities contributed to the development of the Investment Plan and will contribute to ongoing analytical and policy work as South Africa moves towards implementation. These include:

Elements of the $8.5 billion still to be programmed.

A further $2.2 billion of sovereign loans will be programmed by France's AfD, Germany's KfW and the EU's European Investment Bank in support of the Investment Plan. The details of these loans will be announced as they are finalised.

$1.5 billion of Development Finance Institution support for private sector investment is available from the US and the UK. This will take the form of patient investments which will either seek to crowd in private sector investment to new and riskier areas or provide investment where the private sector is currently unwilling or unable to invest. Details of these investments will be announced as they are finalised.

The UK is providing $1.3 billion of guarantees to enable enhanced AfDB lending in support of activities set out in the Investment Plan. Details of the related loans will be announced once they have been agreed between the AfDB and the South Africa Government.

Additional IPG resources beyond the $8.5 billion

Further details of the $8.5 billion package are set out in the Investment Plan. In addition, the following additional resources are being made available by IPG members:

Some IPG contributions will be made in the provider's domestic currency, which may be impacted by fluctuations in conversion against the dollar which means that the numbers may not total exactly $8.5 billion.

The timetable to be proposed to the Climate Investment Funds in June aims to ensure the country remains on track to obtain funding under the so-called Just Energy Transition Partnership - a $9.3-billion pact with some of the world's richest nations.

Under the agreement, first announced in 2021, South Africa will receive the assistance on condition it cuts its dependence on coal, which accounts for four-fifths of the nation's electricity output.

Early last year, South Africa told its partners in the pact it planned to delay the planned shutdown of coal-fired plants - 14 of which are operated by state utility Eskom - to address record electricity outages. The authorities didn't set new closure dates.

""What we are presenting to the CIF is an adjustment to the decommissioning plan linked to an emissions target that we have to achieve,"" said Neil Cole, a finance manager at the Project Management Unit, which is overseeing the JETP for South Africa, within the presidency.

If the proposal is accepted, South Africa will secure $500 million of 10- to 30-year loans with an interest rate of less than 1% and a grace period of eight years from the World Bank-affiliated CIF, Cole said in an interview.

That will ""derisk"" concessional loans planned by multilateral development groups such as the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which has pledged $570 million. The African Development Bank has allocated $255 million and the International Finance Corp. $70 million.

""We need to unlock the $500 million for the MDBs to take any kind of interest,"" he said.

Cole said a further $300 million will come from South African development agencies such as the Industrial Development Corporation and the Development Bank of Southern Africa, while $875 million is expected to come from private institutions.

The funding is part of the JETP, under which France, the US, the UK, Germany and the European Union initially agreed to contribute funds to South Africa, with the Netherlands and Denmark joining the pact later. South Africa has communicated its plans to its JET partners.

Revised schedule

South Africa will propose that it close Eskom's Camden, Grootvlei and Hendrina power plants between 2027 and 2030, instead of a prior schedule of 2023 to 2027.

In addition, in order to meet an annual emission-reduction target of 50 million to 71 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent required by the CIF, the presidency is in talks with Eskom to close a number of units at other power plants.

That number has yet to be decided. Eskom didn't respond to a request for comment.

""We hope to have that data"" by June, Cole said. It will be a ""comprehensive shutting down. They won't be brought back into production,"" he said.

The proposal will be considered under the CIF's Accelerating Coal Transition Investment Program.

Carbon dioxide, which is generated by burning fossil fuels, and a number of other so-called greenhouse gases are responsible for global warming.

Once the CIF hurdle has been cleared, it will be decided which South African entities will borrow the money.

Grid upgrade

Money used to decommission coal plants and re-purpose them for the production of renewable energy may be borrowed by Eskom, while the National Treasury may take responsibility to repay funds used to create alternative employment and economic activity in coal-dependent communities.

Some of the money will also be directed to improve the efficiency of municipal grids and to allow them to accept more renewable energy.

If those funds are borrowed directly by the municipalities, the National Treasury will need to provide a sovereign guarantee, Cole said.

While South Africa's electricity cuts have eased -- a result of better performance by Eskom and the increased use of privately owned solar panels -- the JETP has attracted criticism from government ministers and labor unions. They argue the pact will exacerbate outages and cost tens of thousands of coal mine and power plant jobs.

Definition:

A solar-powered irrigation system refers to a setup that utilizes solar energy to power irrigation systems for agricultural or landscaping purposes. It involves the use of solar panels or photovoltaic (PV) modules to generate electricity, which is then used to operate water pumps, irrigation controllers, and other irrigation equipment. These are the primary components that capture sunlight and convert it into electricity through the photovoltaic effect. Solar panels are usually mounted on a structure or placed on the ground in a location that receives maximum sunlight exposure. A charge controller regulates the flow of electricity from the solar panels to the battery bank, ensuring that the batteries are charged efficiently and preventing overcharging or damage to the system. The battery bank stores the excess solar energy generated during the day for use during periods of low sunlight or at night.

Batteries provide a continuous power supply to the irrigation system, allowing it to operate even when sunlight is not available. A solar-powered water pump, typically a submersible or surface pump, is responsible for drawing water from a water source such as a well, pond, or river. The pump is powered directly by the electricity generated from the solar panels.

Market Trends:

Increasing adoption of solar-powered irrigation systems due to advancements in solar panel technology, making them more affordable and efficient. Integration of smart irrigation technologies, such as sensor-based irrigation controllers and remote monitoring, to optimize water usage and improve irrigation efficiency.

Market Drivers:

Rising energy costs and the need for cost-effective solutions for agricultural irrigation. Growing concerns about environmental sustainability and the shift towards clean energy sources.

Market Opportunities:

Expansion of solar-powered irrigation systems in regions with abundant sunlight and a high dependence on irrigation for agriculture. Adoption of solar-powered irrigation systems in areas where access to electricity infrastructure is limited or unreliable, enabling off-grid and remote irrigation.

Market Challenges:

Upfront installation costs can be a barrier, particularly for small-scale farmers or those with limited financial resources. Variability in solar radiation levels and seasonal changes can affect the consistent and reliable operation of solar-powered irrigation systems.

The aim of this collaboration is to explore whether Port of Karlshamn could be a suitable harbour for the logistics, installation, operations and maintenance activities relating to RWE's planned offshore wind projects in the Baltic Sea. In a first step, the partners will map the requirements and necessary build outs and investments to facilitate the scaling-up of the ports capacity. An early implementation of port capacity will ensure that Sweden is well placed to maximise the potential of the offshore wind industry. This collaboration demonstrates a clear commitment to share knowledge and expertise, in support of broader industrial growth in Sweden.

Matilda Machacek, Vice President of Offshore Development Nordics at RWE Offshore Wind: ""Port capacity and a sustainable supply chain industry are key to the deployment of offshore wind projects. And a new offshore wind farm has the potential to transform a nearby harbour into a dynamic hub that catalyses significantly growth, infrastructure, jobs and economic benefits for the region. That is why we are looking forward to collaborating with Port of Karlshamn to evaluate their potential as future offshore wind hub.""

Anton Andersson, Project Lead at RWE Renewables Sweden: ""Our Karehamn offshore wind farm is a great example also for harbour development. It has been reliably generating green electricity for thousands of Swedish homes for more than a decade. Thanks to the wind farm the old fishing harbour has been revitalised. Based on this success RWE plans to build more offshore wind farms in the Baltic Sea.""

Caroline Säfström, CEO at Port of Karlshamn: ""Port of Karlshamn is proud that RWE, one of the world's leading offshore wind companies, is supporting us in our plans to become a hub for offshore wind. With its natural deep harbour and large shipyard, Port of Karlshamn is well positioned to meet the future needs of the offshore wind industry in the Baltic Sea. We recognise the demand for port capacity related to offshore wind energy, including after-sales services such as maintenance and operations centres. Expanding the port's product portfolio in this direction is a natural step given our previous experience with wind energy projects and logistics. By establishing itself as a hub for offshore wind energy, Port of Karlshamn is also creating employment opportunities for the region and promoting business opportunities for local companies and suppliers, thus contributing to the economic development of the area and strengthening the local economy.""

RWE - an experienced offshore player

RWE is one of the world's largest offshore wind companies with more than 20-year track record of developing, building, and operating offshore wind projects efficiently. The company currently operates 19 offshore wind farms. Two offshore wind farms, Thor (1.1 GW) in Denmark and Sofia (1.4 GW) in the UK, are under construction, and further projects are in development worldwide. RWE plans to grow its global offshore wind capacity from 3.3 GW today to 10 GW in 2030. RWE's experience in deploying seabed-fixed offshore wind turbines, combined with its in-house engineering expertise and global approach, means that the company is particularly well placed to also become a market leader in floating wind and unlock the large-scale potential of deep waters around the world. RWE is actively participating in high-profile floating demonstration projects, each based on different foundation concepts, to gain early floating wind experience and broad engineering knowledge.",evwind.es,news,AEEolica,,0.2862745098039217,452868143,1,,eng-9551555

The timetable to be proposed to the Climate Investment Funds in June aims to ensure the country remains on track to obtain funding under the so-called Just Energy Transition Partnership -- a $9.3-billion pact with some of the world's richest nations.

Under the agreement, first announced in 2021, South Africa will receive the assistance on condition it cuts its dependence on coal, which accounts for four-fifths of the nation's electricity output.

Early last year, South Africa told its partners in the pact it planned to delay the planned shutdown of coal-fired plants -- 14 of which are operated by state utility Eskom -- to address record electricity outages. The authorities didn't set new closure dates.

""What we are presenting to the CIF is an adjustment to the decommissioning plan linked to an emissions target that we have to achieve,"" said Neil Cole, a finance manager at the Project Management Unit, which is overseeing the JETP for South Africa, within the presidency.

If the proposal is accepted, South Africa will secure $500 million of 10- to 30-year loans with an interest rate of less than 1% and a grace period of eight years from the World Bank-affiliated CIF, Cole said in an interview.

That will ""derisk"" concessional loans planned by multilateral development groups such as the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which has pledged $570 million.

The African Development Bank has allocated $255 million and the International Finance Corp. $70 million.

""We need to unlock the $500 million for the MDBs to take any kind of interest,"" he said.

Cole said a further $300 million will come from South African development agencies such as the Industrial Development Corp. and the Development Bank of Southern Africa, while $875 million is expected to come from private institutions.

The funding is part of the JETP, under which France, the US, the UK, Germany and the European Union initially agreed to contribute funds to South Africa, with the Netherlands and Denmark joining the pact later. South Africa has communicated its plans to its JET partners.

Revised Schedule

South Africa will propose closing Eskom's Camden, Grootvlei, and Hendrina power plants between 2027 and 2030 instead of the prior schedule of 2023 to 2027.

In addition, in order to meet an annual emission-reduction target of 50 million to 71 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent required by the CIF, the presidency is in talks with Eskom to close a number of units at other power plants.

That number has yet to be decided. Eskom didn't respond to a request for comment.

""We hope to have that data"" by June, Cole said. It will be a ""comprehensive shutting down. They won't be brought back into production,"" he said.

The proposal will be considered under the CIF's Accelerating Coal Transition Investment Program.

Carbon dioxide, which is generated by burning fossil fuels, and a number of other so-called greenhouse gases are responsible for global warming.

Once the CIF hurdle has been cleared, it will be decided which South African entities will borrow the money.

Grid Upgrade

Money used to decommission coal plants and re-purpose them for the production of renewable energy may be borrowed by Eskom, while the National Treasury may borrow funds to create alternative employment and economic activity in coal-dependent communities.

Some of the money will also be directed to improve the efficiency of municipal grids and to allow them to accept more renewable energy.

If those funds are borrowed directly by the municipalities, the National Treasury will need to provide a sovereign guarantee, Cole said.

While South Africa's electricity cuts have eased -- a result of better performance by Eskom and the increased use of privately owned solar panels -- the JETP has attracted criticism from government ministers and labour unions. They argue the pact will exacerbate outages and cost tens of thousands of coal mine and power plant jobs.

Scan Global Logistics, a global logistics company headquartered in Denmark, is taking new steps toward its sustainability targets and lessening its environmental impact by purchasing renewable energy for its Swedish operations. The global freight forwarder is expanding its renewable energy strategy by entering into a PPA with Better Energy to purchase green energy from a solar park in Sweden.

""This PPA with Better Energy to source renewable energy for our facilities in Sweden is an important part of our sustainability strategy and allows us to contribute to the green transition"" said Martin Andersen, Global Head of Sustainability & ESG at Scan Global Logistics. ""We're pleased to extend our partnership into Sweden as this will be the second Better Energy solar park from which we're offtaking renewable energy from.""

The PPA contributes to establishing a new 23-hectare solar park near Studsvik in Sweden. With an annual production capacity of 25 GWh of renewable energy, the park will be able to produce enough green electricity to cover the consumption of over 4,000 Swedish homes. By the estimated grid connection in late 2024, the solar park is expected to be among the largest in Sweden.

The PPA on Studsvik builds on the existing partnership between the two companies. In 2022, Scan Global Logistics and 12 other companies entered one of the country's first multi-partner PPAs with Energi Danmark to offtake renewable energy from Better Energy's Badskær Solar Park in Denmark. Through the PPA, Scan Global Logistics offtakes renewable energy to supply energy for its 70,600 square meter warehouse and six offices in Jutland.

""It is great to see that our partnership with Scan Global Logistics in Denmark has resulted in welcoming them as a PPA partner in Sweden"" added Mikkel Thorup, Senior Director of Power Purchase Agreements at Better Energy. ""The green transition requires companies of all sizes and varying energy requirements to decide to purchase the greenest form of electricity. Whether it is in Denmark, Sweden or any of the markets, we're striving to offer a practical and attractive solution to our partners.""

As concerns about climate change and environmental degradation intensify, the shift from traditional fossil fuels to renewable energy sources has become imperative. These sources, primarily solar, wind, hydroelectric, and geothermal energy, offer the promise of unlimited energy without the dire environmental consequences associated with coal, oil, and natural gas.

The allure of renewable energy lies in its ability to harness natural processes that are replenished continually. Solar power converts sunlight into electricity using photovoltaic cells or concentrated solar power systems, while wind energy uses the kinetic energy of air in motion to spin turbines. Similarly, hydroelectric power generates electricity from the flow of water in rivers or from man-made installations like dams. Geothermal energy, on the other hand, utilizes the Earth's internal heat to produce power.

The global transition to renewable energy is not merely an environmental imperative but also an economic opportunity. Investments in renewable technologies foster job creation in new industries, reduce energy prices, and decrease dependency on imported fuels. Moreover, renewables reduce pollution and have a significantly lower carbon footprint than conventional energy sources, contributing to a decrease in air quality-related health problems.

Adopting renewable energy also involves challenges such as variability, storage, and integration with existing power grids. However, advancements in technology, improved storage solutions, and innovative policy frameworks are increasingly overcoming these hurdles. Governments worldwide are recognizing the benefits of renewables, implementing incentives for their adoption, and setting ambitious targets for their future contribution to national energy mixes.

As we move forward, renewable energy stands as a cornerstone of sustainable development. It offers a pathway not only towards a cleaner environment but also towards a more resilient and economically diverse global energy landscape.

More than two years after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, nearly 15 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance, according to the UN. This represents about 40% of the population still in Ukraine. The war particularly affects the most vulnerable Ukrainians, including women, children, and people displaced by the war. Therefore, the Danish government is contributing with a new humanitarian support package of 250 million Danish kroner to help meet the basic needs of the most affected Ukrainians.

While Minister for Development Cooperation and Global Climate Policy, Dan Jørgensen, and his European counterparts meet in Brussels today to discuss, among other things, the war in Ukraine, the Danish government is announcing a new humanitarian support package for Ukraine.

""The humanitarian situation in Ukraine is extremely serious. Millions of Ukrainians have been displaced, thousands of homes have been destroyed, hospitals have been bombed, and basic necessities such as water, heating, and electricity are scarce resources for many Ukrainians. In areas close to the front line the situation has especially reached a catastrophic level. Many women and children are particularly vulnerable. With this new support package, we aim to ensure urgent and life-saving humanitarian aid and protection for the most vulnerable groups,"" says Dan Jørgensen.

The package provides basic emergency assistance such as food, medicine, water, and shelter to Ukrainians in the hardest hit areas.

The support focuses especially on protection of the most vulnerable Ukrainians. This includes the millions of children who suffer from the consequences of the war and are in need of a safe environment, social activities, and support to continue their education even as the war rages.

The support package also contributes to efforts to prevent, mitigate and respond to the particular risks faced by women and girls - including the risk of sexual and gender-based violence - and contributes towards provision of e.g. psychosocial support and maternal health care.

Distribution of the humanitarian support package:

In addition, the support package focuses on strengthening Ukrainians' ability to sustain themselves through the coming winter. Ukrainian winters are harsh and cold with temperatures dropping below minus 20 degrees. Over the past few months, Russia has intensified its airstrikes on Ukraine, including on the Ukrainian energy infrastructure that provides both electricity and heating to the population. Initiatives that prepare Ukrainians to get through the cold months are already needed at this point.

Denmark also supports humanitarian mine action in Ukraine. Up to 156,000 km2 - more than three times Denmark's area - is feared to be contaminated with mines and other explosive remnants of war. The extensive presence of mines and explosive remnants of war in civilian areas poses a serious threat to civilians' safety and their return to previously war-affected areas. Mine contamination also poses a serious challenge to humanitarian access and reconstruction efforts in the country.

The contribution is financed through the Ukraine Fund. For press inquiries, contact the press duty officer at pressevagten@um.dk or +45 61 97 92 47.",globalsecurity.org,news,GlobalSecurity.org,John Pike,-0.1372549019607843,452858376,10,,eng-9547082

It symobilizes a website link url.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Julie Williams, 60, a semi-retired woman living in Devon, England, who has used HomeExchange more than 100 times over the last decade to travel the world. The website helps facilitate accommodation exchanges between 150,000 users in 145 countries. Williams estimates she's done about 140 exchanges since joining the site.

I came across HomeExchange about 12 years ago when my husband and I were living in Italy. My daughter was considering going traveling, and I was looking for some low-cost options for her.

We were a bit apprehensive about the website at first. I signed up but didn't pay the subscription. Then HomeExchange sent me an offer, and I said to my husband, ""Shall we give it a go?""

The way it works is you subscribe to the website, make a profile, and list your home. You describe yourself and your traveling members and talk about your home and what you have to offer, as well as where you want to travel. Then, you start looking for people in that area who are on HomeExchange, too.

There are different kinds of exchanges. It's quite flexible. There's a simultaneous reciprocal exchange where you swap houses with another person at the same time, so they come to stay in your house, and you stay in theirs. That works well for families and people who have one home.

There is also a reciprocal exchange where you don't have to swap at the same time, so that's good for people who have second homes. The most flexible way is to use guest points. When somebody comes to stay in your house, the website gives you an allotted amount of guest points, which vary according to how large your home is, how many people you can accommodate, and what facilities you have. You can then use those points whenever you want. That's what we use a lot.

We had been living in Italy up until last year, and we had a much larger home with a separate self-contained apartment. We would mostly swap with people from Australia and New Zealand who liked to come to Italy during our summer, and we wanted to go in their summer, which are different times of the year. So, we would be at home when they came, and they would stay in our apartment.

We moved back to the UK last year. We had our first guest in this house a couple of weeks ago. We did a hospitality exchange, which is where you stay at home and host people. I like to cook and entertain for them. We've got some Australians coming in June.

You meet all sorts of people around the world

It's a complete cross-section of people and all ages. We've met doctors, people who work for NASA, academics, people who aren't necessarily professionals, and even people with plenty of money. We even hosted a senator from the US.

Some people just get fed up being in hotels, especially if they travel a lot. They want to live like locals when they go on holiday. They don't want to stay in a hotel and just be a tourist. We always tell people all the local places to go and things to see that they wouldn't have known about if they weren't staying with us. That's a big driver for people who get the bug for HomeExchange.

We've stayed in places in Australia that are totally off the grid in conservation areas that don't have electricity. That's completely different than being in a hotel and getting dressed up to go down for dinner.

We've kept in contact with some people we've met and even become friends. Our first exchange was in the Caribbean on St. John, which is a US Virgin Island. We stayed with some people there who later came to stay with us in Italy.

We were hooked after our first exchange

We were pretty much hooked after our first trip. The following year, I was coming up on 50 and decided I wanted to go to Australia. I put together a massive three-month trip, 12 weeks of back-to-back home exchanges around Australia and Tasmania. We had a stopover in Singapore on the way back. We couldn't have afforded to do a trip like that if we were staying in hotels.

HomeExchange means we can travel for much longer. The winters in Italy were cold and snowy, so we would often go away for three months.

Throughout my time using the website, I've been to Nevis, St. Martin, St. John in the Caribbean, Australia, Tasmania, New Zealand, Rarotonga, which is a Cook Island, Bali, Singapore, Hong Kong, England, Ireland, France, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, Denmark, Belgium, Holland.

In Western Australia, we once stayed outside a place called Monkey Mia, which is on the way to the Inglou Reef in somebody's beach house. We went to Monkey Mia, where wild dolphins come in to feed. They're completely wild. It was my dream to be picked to stand in the water and hold the fish to see if the dolphin wanted to come and eat it. And it did.

We've been to a fantastic place in Bali where we stayed in a beautiful villa with staff, a driver, and someone cooking for us.

I think we've saved well over £100,000 using HomeExchange. I haven't actually added it up, but we often go away for three months at a time. And we're not just talking about the cost of a double hotel room -- we're staying in whole homes, places with swimming pools, vineyards, and fantastic views.

I'm always telling my friends about how wonderful it is. Even if you make an exchange agreement and, for some reason, the people hosting you cancel, there's a guarantee from HomeExchange that if they can't find you something suitable within a certain radius, they will give you an allowance toward staying in a hotel.",businessinsider.com,news,Business Insider,Erin Snodgrass,0.09019607843137245,452856394,1,https://i.insider.com/663ac0a2f27898f532d4e586?width=1200&format=jpeg,

The global freight forwarder is expanding its renewable energy strategy by entering into a PPA with Better Energy to purchase green energy from a solar farm in Sweden.

""This PPA with Better Energy to source renewable energy for our facilities in Sweden is an important part of our sustainability strategy and allows us to contribute to the green transition,"" said Martin Andersen, Global Head of Sustainability and ESG at Scan Global Logistics. ""We're pleased to extend our partnership into Sweden as this will be the second Better Energy solar park from which we're offtaking renewable energy from.""

The PPA contributes to establishing a new 23 ha. solar farm near Studsvik in Sweden. With an annual production capacity of 25 GWh of renewable energy, the park will be able to produce enough green electricity to cover the consumption of over 4000 Swedish homes. By the estimated grid connection in late 2024, the solar park is expected to be among the largest in Sweden.

The PPA on Studsvik builds on the existing partnership between the two companies. In 2022, Scan Global Logistics and 12 other companies entered one of the country's first multi-partner PPAs with Energi Danmark to offtake renewable energy from Better Energy's Badskær Solar Park in Denmark. Through the PPA, Scan Global Logistics offtakes renewable energy to supply energy for its 70 600 m2 warehouse and six offices in Jutland.

""It is great to see that our partnership with Scan Global Logistics in Denmark has resulted in welcoming them as a PPA partner in Sweden,"" commented Mikkel Thorup, Senior Director of PPAs at Better Energy. ""The green transition requires companies of all sizes and varying energy requirements to decide to purchase the greenest form of electricity. Whether it is in Denmark, Sweden or any of the markets, we're striving to offer a practical and attractive solution to our partners.""

A nurturing hedge fund chops portfolio managers,"There are perhaps two certainties in investment banking compensation. One is that everyone thinks that they have been hard done by, and the other is that the squeaky wheels get oiled. These two facts play together, of course - one of the reasons why bankers complain so much about what other people would regard as extremely generous bonuses is that this is the way to get even more generous treatment next year. As an old proverb has it, the only three words you need to know to discuss your annual bonus letter are ""that's"", ""not"" and ""enough"".

This kind of attitude is not exactly calculated to endear bankers to the general public, but the evidence shows that it delivers the goods. In the 2024 eFinancialCareers compensation report, it was noticeable that Debt Capital Markets (DCM) bankers were among the least satisfied with their bonuses - three quarters of them were dissatisfied, with only equity research, risk and compliance staff feeling more unfairly treated. Now the latest Johnson Associates survey is out, and the early estimates are that DCM bankers are forecast to get the best compensation increases of all - up 25% on this year.

The forecast increase isn't even compared to a low base. According to the same eFinancialCareers report, DCM was one of the best sectors to be in for this compensation round, with average bonuses up 15.5%. It seems like a virtuous circle - the more you get, the more you want, and the more you want the more you get.

It's not really a matter of greed, though. The seeming negative correlation between pay and satisfaction is really more of a timing effect. Last year, DCM businesses were one of the few bright spots in an otherwise extremely forgettable revenue year. That's why they got paid up compared to other sectors, but it's also likely that most firms will have carried out significant redistribution from DCM to other teams' bonus pools. If you've had a record breaking year, but are ""only"" looking at a 15% increase, it's easy to see how you might feel dissatisfied.

Equally, the reason why DCM bankers are likely to be among the best paid this year has only a little bit to do with anyone's subjective feelings about justice, and much more to do with the fact that many of them will have an alternative bid. As well as the private credit industry, several banks are trying to expand their DCM teams, and anyone who cut headcount last year will be scrambling to build their franchise back.

Elsewhere, another truism of the financial sector is that if you want loyalty, get a dog. Point72 had previously seemed like a kinder, gentler kind of hedge fund pod shop, with employees encouraged to ""go to a place of vulnerability"" with their stock picks. And maybe it is, but it is still a pod shop, and that means regular culls. So far, at least seven portfolio managers have been let go, including one eleven-year veteran.

Point72 says that ""the volume of departures in the unit is consistent with past years, and there have been about the same number of portfolio managers exits as there have been hires and promotions this year"". But out of about 100 managers, 7% turnover in slightly more than four months feels like a lot. It seems that rumours of Steve Cohen gradually chilling out as he got older might have been overstated. And that in money management as in baseball, it doesn't matter much whether you win or lose, as long as you win.

Meanwhile ...

One of the problems with cutting staff in a downturn is that it's a lot more expensive to hire them back in an upturn; if you have to reverse strategy you can end up spending a lot more than you saved. In 2020, HSBC's rates trading franchise was one of the first targets of a big cost cutting exercise; now they're hiring again to build the business back. (IFR)

The FDIC's internal investigation into its internal culture is back and it seems really damning; as well as the allegations of strip clubs and excessive drinking that came out earlier in the year, there's evidence of harassment, bullying and even verbal abuse from its chairman. (WSJ)

One possible career move for equity analysts if they get tired of banking is to move over and use their industry knowledge in the industry itself. Andrew Baum has gone from Citi to be the ""chief strategy and innovation officer"" at Pfizer. (Pharmaphorum)

Because it was early to deregulate its electricity grid, and because it has a high proportion of volatile renewables in its generation, Denmark became a mini-hub for energy trading early on. Now Balyasny is going to set up a unit trading power and natural gas there. (Bloomberg)

The share price closed at NOK 623.50, down 6.4% during the quarter, compared to the 1.6% increase in the Oslo Stock Exchange Benchmark Index (OSEBX) and the Brent oil price increasing 12.7%.

The year started with some notable developments in the global economy. In the US, the S&P 500 index increased more than 10% during the first quarter, marking the first time in over a decade that the index has seen consecutive quarters with double-digit increases. This was largely driven by the major tech companies, the so-called magnificent seven, which represent 30% of the index, and the ongoing momentum related to Artificial Intelligence (AI). The Nikkei Index in Japan saw its strongest performance since Q2 2009 and surpassed its previous record high from 1989. But even as risk assets did well, bond markets saw weaker performance, as more persistent inflation and the strength of the economy led investors to price in fewer rate cuts. Furthermore, geopolitical uncertainty remains, especially related to the continued devastating wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, where further escalation could cause renewed disturbances for the global economy.

Moving on to Aker's investment universe. Aker invests along attractive long-term global megatrends, with the potential for secular growth, good profitability, and cash flow generation. One of these megatrends is Energy security, efficiency, and transition. Global energy demand is growing and, as we all know, electricity is central to the functioning of modern societies and economies. Policy, technology, and consumer preferences are all important drivers for further acceleration in demand moving forward. As societies, economies and industry is becoming more digital and more electrified, the demand for electricity is increasing at accelerating pace. As a result, electric utilities have significantly increased their forecasts of how much additional power they will need to supply over the next few years as they confront an explosion in the number of data centers being built, a significantly increased demand for electrification of industry, and millions of electric vehicles (EVs) being plugged in. In Norway, the electrification of the oil and gas infrastructure on the Norwegian continental shelf is also a driver of increased demand for electricity. Somewhat ironically, also the renewables industry itself, and the production of EVs and batteries, with heavy manufacturing involved, are driving further demand for more electricity in its fight for climate change.

Hence, the growth in demand for electricity, which is an energy carrier and not an energy source, could be as much as four times faster than overall energy demand moving forward. And the large users of energy, like data centers, the transition to EV's and heavy industry sectors, are not only demanding more electricity, but most often compete for the same sources of electricity. Thus, ensuring both secure and affordable access to electricity, while at the same time reducing global emissions, is the core challenge of the energy transition, often referred to as the energy trilemma.

Aker has experienced this challenge first-hand. Over the last 1.5 years we have witnessed a negative sentiment for listed renewables companies, including Aker Horizons, and at the same time the need for more and cleaner energy production has probably never been greater. The paradox is that this has developed a significant gap between the market values of renewables companies versus the market opportunities for the same companies. In fact, given the shifts and developments discussed above, many developers are now saying that there have never been more attractive market opportunities for investments in renewable solutions than what they see today. As we have learned from history, these types of market imbalances can give rise to counter-cyclical opportunities. There are several companies in Aker's portfolio that could benefit from it, including Aker Horizons and Aker Solutions. And this is exactly the investment challenge and opportunity that Industry Capital Partners (ICP) was established to tackle, by bringing capital and industry closer together and providing a platform for investing globally in both infrastructure and in quality companies that are positioned to benefit from the transition toward a low-carbon world.

Excitingly, last week ICP announced the appointment of Christian Rynning-Tønnesen as new Senior Partner and CEO of ICP Infrastructure. Christian most recently held the role as CEO of Statkraft over the last 14 years, Europe's largest producer of renewable energy and a leading player in global energy markets. He brings unique knowledge, experience, network, and track-record that ICP will benefit greatly from moving forward. Having had the privilege of knowing and collaborating with Christian for many years during his tenure as CEO of Statkraft, I can attest to the remarkable achievements attained under his leadership, across strategic, value-creating transactions, operational excellence, and international expansion. I am very pleased that Christian has agreed to take the helm of ICP Infrastructure and I look forward to what he and the team will achieve moving forward.

Now, taking a closer look at data centers, which are relevant to Aker in several dimensions, not least through the boom of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) which is a core focus area and capability for Cognite in its quest to democratizing data. Data centers are expected to be a main driver in the increased demand for electricity moving forward and, hence, a key enabler of future investments in new renewable energy production and infrastructure. We are also increasingly seeing that owners of data centers are willing to sign power purchase agreements (PPAs) for up to 15-20 or more years, at good price levels. This can trigger business opportunities for developers, suppliers, and investors, like Aker Horizons, Aker Solutions and ICP.

Over the last year, an extraordinary acceleration in the growth of AI and LLMs (Large Language Models) have captured the technological zeitgeist, transforming the way we will live, work, and interact with technology in the future. Data centers, the digital nerve centers of our modern and increasingly AI-powered economy, play a pivotal role in delivering cloud computing services, managing vast amounts of data, and supporting our digital lifestyles. However, their insatiable appetite for power poses challenges and will add to the growing question of how to power the data revolution, and how to do it in a sustainable way.

For data centers, generative AI is a main catalyst for this development and will create exponential growth in energy demand moving forward. With technology advances and demand for digital services and AI continuing their rapid growth, power usage is becoming an increasingly critical issue:

The AI revolution will only add to this; according to the energy research consultancy, Thunder Said Energy, the average energy use of a Chat GPT query today is 10 times higher than that of a Google search. The rapid development means that a new data center in 2025 is estimated to require around five times more electricity than in 2017 according to Coresite, a leading global provider of data center services and hybrid IT. Hence, Thunder Said Energy predicts that the vast power demands of AI will contribute to the largest growth of new power generation capacity in history, and that power demand from data centers will increase by 1,000 TWh globally already by 2030. By comparison, the annual energy consumption in Germany is around 500-600 TWh.

Due to the number one requirement of a data center, which is stable uptime all the time, they cannot rely solely on intermittent energy sources like solar or wind. And that would be expensive too; if a data center were to be run exclusively on solar or wind power and batteries, it would be significantly more expensive than running it on power from a natural gas power plant; a so- called Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT), since the battery would need to be extremely large and could potentially cost US 35-65 c/Kwh. So where will all the new electricity come from? As much as 40% of the increased energy demand from data centers globally towards 2030 is expected to take place in the US, where 80% of this incremental power most likely will come from natural gas. Hence, the annual sales of CCGT generators in the US is predicted to increase by 2.5 times compared to today. And the same goes for diesel back-up generators, which are a necessity. The larger the data center, the more back-up generators are needed.

Data centers already represent a large share of electricity demand globally, with more than half the OPEX of a data center being power consumption. To look at some examples, data centers today consume 4% of total electricity demand in the EU and 5% in the US. In Denmark and Ireland, data centers already represent 11% and 17% share, respectively, of these nations' total electricity consumption, and they are on track to further increase this towards 20% and 26%, respectively, by 2026. In Norway, a new 240MW data center was recently approved and is already seeking to increase to 840MW, which means this data center would consume more than 7TWh of electricity, equivalent to 5.5% of Norway's total annual energy consumption. It could thus represent Norway's largest single consumer of electricity, illustrating the large growth in incremental energy demand we might see moving forward. At the same time, the challenges that rising electricity consumption pose has driven several countries to introduce new data center restrictions in recent years, and we expect discussions around this to continue going forward, perhaps mostly where increased risk of power shortages is a key topic.

Furthermore, the vast energy consumption of data centers will probably also impact emissions, as their main source of electricity will likely not be renewable energy. Today, very few countries - likely only Norway and Brazil - offer renewable energy grids where hydro power is the main energy source. Data centers are already responsible for around 2% of global CO2-emissions (and rising, according to the IEA), which means it is already at the same levels as the global airline industry. This should come as no surprise as the main source of the large electricity demand from data centers globally comes from the grids and given that the global electricity mix today consists of 61% coal and natural gas. Needing power all the time to maintain their vital uptime, not only when the wind blows or when the sun shines, data centers will also in the future need either a stable grid connection or a standalone power source like the mentioned CCGT natural gas power plants (which could potentially be combined with solar and/or wind power). Being connected to the grid, in turn, also means getting in conflict with impacting other businesses' power needs and the price to the general population. It is, therefore, expected that a growing number of data centers will need to build their own power supply, resulting in increased demand for natural gas.

Moving from the big picture to a snapshot of the Aker universe, a key highlight during the quarter was the deepening of our strong collaboration with SLB through the formation of a joint venture between SLB and Aker Carbon Capture (ACC). The transaction marks another important step to Aker and SLB's existing partnerships, within subsea with Aker Solutions and within digitalization with Cognite. Together, the companies create a diversified, global carbon capture player, better positioned to accelerate international expansion and growth, and which will help bring carbon capture solutions to market more quickly and more economically. SLB will pay ACC NOK 4.12 billion in cash and SLB and ACC will own 80% and 20%, respectively, of the combined company. In addition, ACC will retain NOK 0.4 billion in cash and is entitled to performance-based payments of up to NOK 1.36 billion, subject to reaching certain milestones.

The refinancing of Solstad was completed during the quarter, and Solstad is now reported as part of Aker's Industrial Holdings segment. The NOK 750 million share issue, fully underwritten by Aker, is planned to be completed during June. Following the share issue, the intention is to list Solstad Maritime as soon as possible, and at latest within the following 12 months. With one of the industry's most modern fleets of high-end vessels, a healthy balance sheet, and backed by the Aker group's substantial industrial competence, Solstad Maritime is uniquely positioned for growth. With the strong offshore market as a backdrop, the company's clear ambition is to initiate quarterly dividend payments to shareholders during the second half of 2024.

Overall, Aker's commitment to long-term industrial development and shareholder value creation remains firm. Moving forward our approach will be more focused, concentrated on fewer and larger portfolio companies, prioritizing investments that provide running returns and contribute to increased and diversified upstream cash. The aim is both to increase our ability to seize value-adding investment opportunities and to ensure continued predictable dividends to shareholders in the years to come.",marketscreener.com,news,Market Screener,,0.411764705882353,452850807,58,https://www.marketscreener.com/images/twitter_MS_fdblanc.png,

Outokumpu, the global leader in sustainable stainless steel, is partnering with Tetra Pak, a world leading food processing and packaging solutions company. Outokumpu Circle Green®, with up to 93% lower carbon footprint than the global industry average*, will be used in the production of Tetra Pak's homogenizers. The low-emission stainless steel will be available as an option for all models in Tetra Pak's homogenizer line in Europe from June 2024. This strategic collaboration marks the beginning of a partnership to explore other applications of Circle Green across the Tetra Pak equipment portfolio, helping to further align food and beverage manufacturers with the EU's Green Deal.

""The future of low-emission solutions is heavily dependent on sustainable stainless steel. The global demand for steel is increasing while the steel industry as a whole is responsible for 7-9% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Stainless steel plays a pivotal role in accelerating the green transition, and the food and beverage industry is a good example of where low-emission steel can have a significant impact. We are proud to partner up with Tetra Pak on this transformative initiative and look forward to delivering and developing more sustainable solutions that facilitate the decarbonization across the value chain. The cooperation with Tetra Pak is yet another concrete action towards a better future"", says Niklas Wass, Executive Vice President for Stainless Europe, at Outokumpu.

Circle Green is produced at Outokumpu's plant in Tornio, Finland, and then delivered to Tetra Pak's homogenizer body suppliers in Denmark and Sweden. After manufacturing, the bodies are then delivered to Lund, Sweden, where many of Tetra Pak's homogenizers are assembled. By using Circle Green, Tetra Pak is generating a more sustainable offer for the climate-cautious partners in its value chain, and the machines with low-emission bodies made of stainless steel can be delivered globally to customers.

Stainless steel as an essential material - ensuring durability and hygiene

Food systems are responsible for over one third of the global greenhouse gas emissions**. In this sector, everything from dairy beverages to table sauces relies on homogenization as part of its production process. For example, when processing milk, the homogenizer breaks down fat globules in milk into smaller fragments, resulting in a more stable solution - preventing creaming, and improving texture, flavor and shelf-life. Stainless steel used for homogenizers not only reduces emissions but also stands out as an essential material for the food processing industry because of its exceptional resistance to corrosion, its smooth surface, and its easy-to-clean nature, ensuring durability and hygiene - two indispensable qualities in food processing.

""Innovation sits at the heart of our philosophy as a business and our approach to sustainability. The incorporation of Circle Green into our product portfolio is an important step in leveraging the latest innovations to improve our upstream emission.Working together to help both Tetra Pak and our customers to reach our individual sustainability goals is fundamental to our promise to protect what's good"", says Fiona Liebehenz, Vice President of Key Components Plant Solutions and Channel Management, at Tetra Pak.

Circle Green production was the first of its kind globally, as no other stainless steel manufacturer has been able to produce stainless steel with such low emission levels when taking into account all the climate emissions from raw material extraction throughout the whole production chain. To produce Circle Green and to reach up to a 93% lower carbon footprint, Outokumpu uses 100% low-carbon electricity, low-carbon raw materials, such as recycled steel, and optimized production processes.

Producing all the world's stainless steel with the same methods used for Circle Green would cut global carbon emissions by 364 million tonnes per year. This equals to over 900 million one-way flights of one passenger across the Atlantic Ocean from London to New York.

*) Global average CO₂emissions (2023): 7 kg CO₂e per kg of stainless steel (Outokumpu's calculation based on data provided by CRU, worldstainless and Kobolde & Partners AB). Outokumpu Circle Green CO₂emissions: down to 0.5 kilos of CO₂e per kg of stainless steel.

This result is well in line with what has been reported by various studies of eco-communities that have emphasised sustainable advantages by living in co-housing, eco-communities, and other types of collective housing.

Among the green communities that participated in our survey, the SSV has the lowest carbon footprint per capita among. The total average carbon footprint of the residents of this community is 4.7 tonnes, which is 60% below the average carbon footprint of the Danish population (11.8 tonnes). An independent sample t test comparing the total carbon footprint of the 16 eco-community residents with the 1018 representative Danes (equal variances not assumed) shows that the difference is highly significant: t(26.7) = 12.7, p < 0.001. The SSV is a self-built eco-community established in 2004 by a small group of founders who bought an old farm and 15 hectares of surrounding fields and obtained a municipal permit to build 25 houses on the land. Today, the eco-community has 18 finished houses and four houses that are in the process of being built, with three empty plots still available for future settlers. The vision of the eco-community is to achieve a high degree of self-sufficiency in food, low-income living, a serious approach to community work, and the promotion of independent small enterprises. The land is owned by the community; each family unit rents a plot from the community where they build individual houses and can cultivate their own gardens. Villagers share a communal building, a 250-year old farmhouse with stables where collectively owned tools, freezers, and washing machines are stored. Likewise, facilities such as community gardens with collectively grown vegetables and cows, sheep, and chickens are raised collectively. While many families have their own private car, the community owns a shared car that can be used by members.

The SSV has around 50 large and small working groups that take care of different practical or organisational tasks such as trash sorting, bike repair, crop growing, taking care of the cows, lambs, and chickens, ordering groceries for the food coop, managing the collective launderette, the swap room, or the ecological system that filters used water, maintaining the gravel paths, and so on. All adult residents are expected to work four hours per week for the community in one or several working groups. Each group meets regularly to conduct its collective duties and presents its projects and their budgets for the coming year to a communal meeting that is held at the end of the year. The projects and proposed budgets are discussed at this meeting and adopted or rejected by a vote of the community. The eco-community is registered as a cooperative association headed by an elected board, but in practice, decisions concerning the entire community are discussed in monthly meetings and need a broad consensus to be adopted.

In the following sections we discuss the four subcategories of the carbon footprint survey (energy supply, transportation, food, and other consumption). We explain how this community achieves significantly lower carbon footprints than the general Danish population in all categories through a set of physical and social infrastructures.

A resident of the SSV emits in average 0.31 tonnes of CO yearly based on his/her use of energy, which is more than 70% below the Danish average of 1.06 tonne. The difference is highly significant, as demonstrated by an independent sample t test comparing the energy-based carbon footprint of the 16 eco-community residents with 1018 representative Danes (equal variances not assumed): t(32.8) = 12.6, p < 0.001. Half of the eco-community energy consumption per capita is caused by the communal building, which is an old building with low energy efficiency.

The SSV has designed guidelines that list what is allowed in the community-buildings constructed primarily with natural material such as wood, hay bales, clay, and stone, or with second-hand material such as bricks, windows, and doors saved from destroyed houses. The guidelines advise residents on how to build houses that maximise passive solar heat, for example, by building taller facades that face the south and lower construction facing the north to maximise natural heating from the sun in the winter. Also, many village houses have floors made of clay that cool houses in the summer and keep them warmer during the winter. Houses are heated by mass ovens, or 'flex ovens', that burn firewood efficiently, which reduces the use of firewood (considered as carbon-neutral in our survey) and reduces pollution from solid particles. The ovens do not just heat the houses, they also heat the hot water tanks when there is not enough sun for the solar heater during the winter. Other houses are heated by geothermal heat. Some residents have solar panels, others use the national grid, which gets 52% of its electricity from renewable sources. All these solutions use less energy and use electricity rather than fossil fuel, which leads to lower carbon footprints.

The SSV communal buildings function as an extra, integrated part of the residents' everyday lives. This is where the communal dinner is cooked and served, where food is stored in common freezers and meetings are held, and also where the washing machine rooms, waste sorting systems, and reusable exchange rooms are located. Private guests can stay in the communal buildings' guest rooms, some residents use its rooms as office space, and many children play across ages and families in the living rooms of the communal building. All these communal features mean that the private homes are smaller than they would have been if they had to contain guest rooms, space for washing machines, an office, and playrooms, etc. As our survey shows, the numbers of residents per household are fairly similar (2.1 in the SSV against 2.2 in the reference group), whereas the average number of square metres per house is lower, with an average of 78 square metres in eco-community houses (n = 16) and an average of 117 square metres in conventional Danish houses (n = 1018). The difference is highly significantly, as shown by an independent sample t-test (equal variances not assumed): t(14.2, N = 1034) = 4.7, p < 0.001. This demonstrates how eco-communities can successfully influence relatively fixed social norms regarding housing size and also demonstrates how the communal buildings solve some space issues that occur in every household.

Thus, the lower energy-related carbon footprint in the SSV can be explained in part by the physical collective infrastructure - the multi-use collective building allows smaller private houses and provides energy savings through its collective dining room. But this physical infrastructure is also the result of social infrastructures in the form of bylaws that define building guidelines to ensure that private buildings are smaller, well-insulated, heated by wood ovens or geothermal heat, and designed to maximise passive heat. The social infrastructures are managed by a number of working groups that specialise in building, energy supply, waste filtering, and other building issues, which ensures that both private and collective buildings are built to minimise energy consumption and environmental impact.

The food-related carbon footprint of an average resident in the SSV is almost one-third of that of an average Dane (0.58 tonnes compared to 1.59 tonnes). An independent sample t-test comparing the food-based carbon footprint of the 16 eco-community residents with the 1018 representative Danes (equal variances not assumed) shows that the difference is highly significant: t(16.8, N = 1034) = 16.8, p < 0.001. Eco-community residents eat much less meat and more organic, seasonal, local, fresh and self-produced food than average Danes. The community produces almost half of the food it consumes in its own fields. Some vegetables are produced along permacultural principles, with a focus on perennial plants integrated in a food forest that capture more carbon than they release, but the community also relies on many annual crops (such as corn and other annual vegetables).

A central characteristic of the eco-community is its food store, where residents can freely access all the food produced in the community as well as other basic organic food products, including dairy and groceries, that are not produced by the community. One working group orders these products from a wholesale supplier, a second working group organises the storing in the communal food store and a third organises the baking of rye breads that are also part of the food cooperative's regular inventory. All residents pay a monthly fee of $165, with a reduced price for children, depending on their age. For that price, they can take from the food store whatever food they need in any amount, according to their needs. Every time a litre of milk, a loaf of rye bread, or tomatoes are needed in a private household, residents go to the communal building and pick up what they need. But this covers only basic food products and, as a rule, every private household supplements this basic food supply with food products that they buy themselves for their families in mainstream supermarkets, which is often determined by what their children like or dislike.

The cost of communal meals is covered by the $165 monthly subscription to the food store. Communal eating takes place seven days a week, but residents decide for themselves whether and when they feel like taking part in it. They are allowed to take the collectively prepared food back to their homes and eat in private if they prefer. Communal meals are always vegetarian, but some meat may be served once or twice per week under the condition that only meat from home-bred animals (chickens, pigs, sheep, cows) is prepared, which limits both the amount of meat available and the meat-related carbon footprint.

As we can see, producing, supplying, storing, and preparing food for the community requires different physical infrastructures, including agricultural land, pastures, a collective kitchen, dining rooms, food storerooms, and big refrigerators. But managing these physical infrastructures requires organisation, time and money. It requires a social infrastructure that establishes responsibility, plans the labour involved, and covers the cost of growing food, breeding animals, running the grocery store, preparing communal meals, and cleaning common rooms. Each activity is managed by a working group that meets regularly and devotes substantial time to discuss issues of quality, efficiency, ethics, and sustainability, produce a budget and defend it in the general assembly, organise access, booking, cost-sharing, and so on.

The average transport-related carbon footprint in the SSV is 70% below the national average: 2.0 tonnes compared to 6.73 tonnes (t(30.0, N = 1034) = 9.5, p < 0.001, equal variance not assumed). Transport-related emissions registered by the community's residents come mostly from plane and car travel. The average plane travel of eco-community residents is only 1.6 h annually while it is 13.7 h for an average Dane (t(101, N = 1034) = 11.2, p < 0.001, equal variance not assumed). Likewise, 68.8% of eco-community respondents did not fly in the past 12 months, which this proportion is only 41.7% in the Danish population (χ (1, N = 1034) = 4.7, p = .029). Two factors explain this. On the one hand, there is a strong social norm in the eco-community that flying must be limited. This does not mean that a resident who flies is disapproved of, but there is a tacit agreement among residents that flying is bad for the climate. On the other hand, the average income of eco-community households is about 40 percent lower than in the reference group, which probably limits the frequency of spending holidays abroad.

When it comes to the car-related carbon footprint, the average for residents of the SSV is less than half the national average (1.22 tonnes compared to 2.63 tonnes; t(19.5, N = 1034) = 3.6, p < 0.001, equal variance not assumed). Most households have one car (usually a gasoline-efficient car), which can be explained in part by more resident families having children who need transportation for leisure activities. A few households have two cars and a few have no car at all. Some eco-community residents are committed to biking as much as they can and several residents have bought electric bikes as an alternative to a car.

The community has one shared car that can be used in cases of occasional need and that explains why many families have decided against buying a second car. Using a shared car limits emissions because the full cost of each trip must be paid up front and because the travel needs to be planned in advance to make sure that the car is available, which limits compulsive use. If the shared car is not available, it is a common practice for residents to borrow the car of a neighbour.

Social infrastructures and collective practices also influence car use. For example, it is common for residents to use the internal mailing list to ask other residents for a lift to work or to pick up their children on the way home from an activity. Thus, the lower transport-related carbon footprint can be explained by physical infrastructure (a shared car), by social infrastructure (a working group to organise the use of the shared car and an internal mailing list to organise carpooling), and by the collective norm that plane travel ought to be minimised.

When comparing the consumption of other items, the average carbon footprint of residents of the eco-community is 26% below the national average 1.82 tonnes compared to 2.49 tonnes, t(16.7, N = 1034) = 5.9, p < 0.001, equal variance not assumed. Eco-community residents spend significantly less money on clothes, furniture, electronic equipment, hotels, restaurants, and leisure than average Danes.

One factor that helps explain this lower consumption is that households in the SSV have an average income that is approximately 40% below the national average. There are also physical infrastructures that motivate lower consumption. There is, for example, the swap room, where used garments, books, and other goods that are no longer of use to the owner can be left to be used by others. Family and friends from outside the eco-community also leave their used clothes in the community's clothes swap and pop by when they are visiting to see if there is anything of use to them. The community has also a waste-sorting room, in which items seen as non-reusable are disposed of in specific containers for plastic, metal, paper, cardboard, and electronics. There is also a collective working space with all kinds of do-it-yourself tools.

All these physical infrastructures are managed by a social infrastructure in the form of the aforementioned working groups, who meet regularly to discuss how to organise the service, how to avoid free riding (when someone uses a service without sharing the cost), and so on. Additionally, there is a high degree of sharing of equipment, such as freezers, washing machines, and tumble dryers, trailers, tools, crafting tables, lawn mower and kitchen accessories, which motivates less individual consumption., There is also a common practice of borrowing almost everything from neighbours, which is accomplished either through direct contact between neighbours or by using the internal mailing list.

Another significant factor influencing the degree of reduced consumption is the common ethic among the residents to live a simple, low-income, low-consuming life. A resident of the SSV does not improve his or her social status by buying the newest car or biggest flat screen TV. Instead, social status is achieved and maintained by being able to use your hands to construct a beautiful house, grow vegetables or build the nicest chicken house from re-used materials. Eco-community residents mutually reinforce that ethic by shopping at flea markets and second-hand shops. Material values are not unimportant, but higher social recognition is achieved by demonstrating sustainable and climate-friendly achievements rather than by purchasing goods that are new, big, or flashy.

Living more sustainably requires a lower carbon footprint and therefore, a lower consumption of goods, among other factors. The question here is whether people can live happier with less. Higher income usually translates into more happiness, even though this correlation tends to disappear over time or beyond a certain threshold of income. Our survey did not measure 'happiness' as such, but we asked respondents to state whether they agree with the statement 'I am satisfied with my present life'. As predicted by the income-happiness theory, our survey shows that among the 1018 representative Danes, a higher income correlates with a higher life satisfaction. Remember that our survey shows that the average income in SSV households is approximately 40% below the national average. According to the income-happiness theory, eco-community residents should be less satisfied with their life than the rest of the population. But contrary to this expectation, our survey shows that eco-community residents are even more satisfied with their life than the average in Denmark. Among the 16 eco-community respondents, 88% declare to be very satisfied or satisfied with their life. Among the 1018 representative Danes, 67% report the same. When performing a Pearson chi-square test of independence, the difference is weakly significant at the 10% level: χ (1, N = 1034) = 3.08, p = 0.079.

Because eco-community residents are better educated than the average Dane, their lower income cannot be explained by a lack of skills or income opportunities, but rather as the result of choice residents make about how they wish to live. However, more likely and more in line with the general thesis of this paper, residents' lower income is also the result of their community's social and physical infrastructures. Eco-community residents have access to self-grown food and organic food supplies through their shared-payer food cooperative, shared home appliances, shared cars, and re-used clothes and books, which makes it possible for them to live comfortably on a much lower income than does the average Dane. In other words, residents of this eco-community are under less pressure to make more money because their living situation provides more goods and services than are available outside the community. Working less for wages outside the community also goes hand-in-hand with working more for the community itself (in various working groups or by building and maintaining one's house). Thus, despite being poorer than average, eco-community residents do not necessarily perceive or feel themselves as such. They generally have white-collar jobs and they enjoy a generally normal life in which they can afford most of the things that other Danes can afford (albeit in more limited quantity) because they save every day on costs related to housing, energy, food, and other goods.

Residents of the SSV often declare that they do not think of themselves as reflecting that much on their carbon footprint. As a resident put it: 'We do not wake up in the morning thinking about CO'. It is by spending their energy on making the SSV's social and physical infrastructure work that they achieve major reductions in their carbon footprint - without thinking much about it and without being aware that well-functioning infrastructures are the source of more sustainable practices. Because their lower material consumption and lower carbon footprint derive more from collective infrastructures than from private choices, their lifestyle choices come naturally; residents do not feel that they sacrifice their private comfort to live more sustainably.

In this way, infrastructures are instrumental in shielding residents from the lower life satisfaction that accompanies lower income and consumption in the general Danish population. Social infrastructures also create regular social interactions, and they free up time for members who are not involved in a specific task and can enjoy a service provided by others. This means that residents have a social life that is richer than average around common meals and other collective activities. They also enjoy more leisure time to do things that appear to be more important for their life satisfaction than income and material consumption. The SSV residents' collective engagement in a sustainable initiative can also contribute in and of itself to a meaningful life and to psychological well-being, which can also lead to a higher life satisfaction, as has been documented elsewhere.

Ours results show that a lower carbon footprint can go hand-in-hand with a higher life satisfaction. The SSV and other intentional communities or environmental grassroots collective initiatives seem to support the degrowth argument that another, better, and happier world is possible with lower levels of consumption and resource exploitation.",nature.com,news,Nature,,0.02745098039215677,452844707,10,,

Delivery is scheduled for 2026.

Torghatten has placed its order with Myklebust Verft at Gursken south of Ålesund. This yard is especially well known in the North European commercial fishing industry for building among the finest pelagic super-trawlers in the world.

These are not modest roll-on roll-off ferries; they have been designed by the Norwegian Ship Design Company and will measure 117m in length overall, operate at 17 knots and be capable of carrying up to 120 cars.

They will, when completed, ply Norway's longest ferry and arguably most challenging route of all. Namely between Bodø and the fabled Lofoten Islands north of the Arctic Circle.

Marius Hansen, CEO of Torghatten Nord said in a statement: ""Together with the authorities, we are in the process of setting the standard for a completely new class of ships, with a world-class innovation and climate project.

""At Myklebust, we found an environment with high competence at a sustainable price. I am proud that we have achieved this in Norway, because this is a major boost for the Norwegian technology and shipbuilding community.""

Leiv Sindre Muren, CEO of Myklebust Verft replied: ""We are very pleased to have reached an agreement to build the world's largest hydrogen ships.

""Together with the maritime cluster in Norway, we will develop new knowledge, secure jobs and be able to take on more apprentices with this assignment.

""It will be exciting to deliver something no one has done before us.""

Quite simply, there are no other maritime hydrogen projects internationally that come close to the scale and ambitions of this project.

The suppliers of design, technology, equipment and hydrogen in the project are Norwegian, and the project is also working closely with the Norwegian Maritime Authority and the classification society Lloyd's Register to develop procedures and safety standards for a completely new type of ferries.

A hydrogen storage unit on board the vessel will feed gas to the fuel cells, creating electricity to propel the vessels and power their auxiliary systems, reducing CO2 emissions on the route by around 26,500 tonnes annually. There will be a bio-fuelled diesel-electric backup.

The hydrogen plant will be located at Bodø and operated by GreenH. The port is a key strategic hub in the Salten region of Norway and, according to the firm, the diversity of industrial consumers makes the town a natural hydrogen production centre.

Bodø has ferries and shipping companies, big land-based transport companies with regional warehouses, the most central airport in Nordland, and the terminus of the Nordland railway.

This is not the only innovation by Torghatten Nord. On December 6, the company's brand new 117m electric ferry, MF Hinnøy, was launched from the Cemre shipyard in Turkey.

Hinnøy will join Northern Norway's busiest connection, Bognes-Lødingen. It too has a 120 car capacity while passenger capacity is 399.

Also developed by the Norwegian Ship Design, the double-ender - it has the design designation NSD120CFc, - will normally operate as a zero emissions vessel in exposed waters on the entire one hour transit of the Bognes - Lødingen route at a speed of 13-14 knots.

The transit time (and speed) sets a new record among the growing fleet of Norwegian battery/hybrid ferries of which there are some 80 now operating.

In addition to significant savings in CO2 emissions, Hinnøy is expected to offer greater comfort, more space and universal design.

The connection will also be a milestone for electric ferries, with a charging power of 9,200,000 watts which, as far as is known, sets a new world record in charging power on ferries.

The vessel will normally operate battery-electric with all power originating from the grid onshore through high-capacity automated charging connections.

Cemre has built a number of ferries and energy support ships to Norwegian account. The yard is also building four conventional diesel-fuelled ferries for Scottish company CMAL whose operating arm is CalMac. All are currently ahead of or on schedule for delivery.

To round off, Cemre is also constructing another ground-breaking ferry to Nordic account, this time for Scandlines' new Futura, billed as the ""world's largest zero-emission freight ferry"" and another demonstration of how the shipping industry is seeking to break free of reliance on Big Oil for fuelling.

The 147m shuttle will service the busy Puttgarden in Germany and Rødby in Denmark route and has a designed capacity of 66 freight units, which is 23% higher than current vessels serving the route.

Thanks to its novel design, it will be possible to transport lorries on both the upper and lower decks. Moreover, the modular construction of the vessel means it will be possible to later reconfigure its layout to carry cars as well.

Thanks to the hybrid diesel/battery (10MWh) electric propulsion, Futural will have the capability to feature in two different modes as fully electrical relying on plug-in battery power at 10 knots or plug-in hybrid mode at 16 knots.

The design is also prepared for future upgrades to methanol-fuelled ICE (diesel engine) propulsion.",energyvoice.com,news,Energy Voice,Amy Smith,0.1764705882352942,452844387,1,https://www.energyvoice.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/04/8C19D0C089484E54B4D2E9121F8E6381-1zqkvn6mk.jpg,

The Danes have apparently taken a liking to Meadowville Technology Park.

Denmark-based Topsoe announced Wednesday its plans to build a $400 million, nearly 280,000-square-foot facility at the Chesterfield industrial park to manufacture solid oxide electrolyzer cells, which use electricity to generate what the company calls ""clean hydrogen"" that is used as a fuel source.

The factory is slated to rise toward the northern end of Meadowville on an undeveloped 57-acre site. Topsoe is under contract to buy the land from the Chesterfield Economic Development Authority in a deal expected to close in the coming weeks, Economic Development Director Garrett Hart told BizSense.

Construction on the facility is expected to start this summer, Hart said.

The future Topsoe site is made up of parcels at 11700 and 11720 Meadowville Lane and portions of other plots.

Topsoe's project site is across the road from the property that fellow Danes at toy company Lego have secured for a $1 billion manufacturing plant.

Topsoe said that 150 jobs will be created by its project in Chesterfield. The planned facility would be the company's first location in the Richmond region and its largest investment to date in the United States.

The factory's cells are aimed at heavy-industry users such as chemical and cement makers, as well as the transportation industry. Those sectors are major contributors to greenhouse gas emissions and are in need of fossil fuel alternatives like hydrogen, according to Chesterfield's project announcement.

Topsoe CEO Roeland Baan said in a prepared statement that efforts by the United States to position itself as a ""clean energy leader"" will be boosted by Topsoe's plant in Chesterfield.

""With strong support from individual states like Virginia the country's clean energy future looks bright. With our strong dedication to scientific research and innovation, we will help the U.S. achieve its goals of driving down the cost of clean hydrogen and delivering clean energy jobs,"" Baan said.

Gov. Glenn Youngkin, whose office announced the project Wednesday, approved a $6 million grant from the Commonwealth's Opportunity Fund to help Chesterfield lure Topsoe. The fund is a pot of money the governor can use to entice a company's entry into Virginia or expansion of existing operations in the state.

The Greater Richmond Partnership and Virginia Economic Development Partnership assisted Chesterfield in landing the project.

Topsoe will be able to take advantage of benefits from the Port of Virginia Economic and Infrastructure Development Grant Program, as well as recruitment and training services by way of the Virginia Talent Accelerator Program. Topsoe is planning to use $136 million in federal tax credits to help fund construction of the facility in Chesterfield.

This week's announcements from the governor's office and Chesterfield followed an announcement by Topsoe in April that it intended to establish a factory in Chesterfield. At the time the company declined to comment on the specific location of the planned facility.

Topsoe said it will launch a scholarship program in which it will award five one-year scholarships worth $10,000 apiece to high school seniors at Chesterfield Public Schools who want to study a STEM field in college. The first awards are expected to be provided in the spring of 2025 for the following academic year.

Recipients wouldn't be required to work for Topsoe after graduation, according to a company spokesman.

Topsoe, which was founded in 1940, is based in Denmark and has more than 2,800 employees. The company also has a U.S. manufacturing plant in Texas outside of Houston.

Keeping mother tongue alive among OVs in Denmark

A Vietnamese language class for the overseas Vietnamese (OV) community in Denmark has been opened in Copenhagen, aiming to keeping and promoting the language as well as the nation's cultural identity in the European country.

Speaking at the event held at the Vietnamese Embassy, Ambassador Luong Thanh Nghi hailed organisers and teachers' efforts in opening the class and highlighted the significance of maintaining the teaching and learning of Vietnamese as the language is a special bond connecting overseas Vietnamese, particularly young generations, and their roots.

September 8 has been designated as the day for honouring the Vietnamese language for communities abroad.

Currently, there are more than 16,000 OV living and working in Denmark. They have deeply integrated into the host society, and been highly appreciated by local authorities for contributions to the economic and socio-cultural development of Denmark.

For the more than 5.3 million overseas Vietnamese living in more than 130 countries and territories worldwide, the Vietnamese language is a means for them to preserve their traditional culture and establish themselves while integrating into the local communities. The language is also a bridge to connect OVs all over the world with their Motherland./.

A man has been sentenced to two years in prison for people smuggling

A man has been jailed for two years for Việt Nam people smuggling.

The People's Court of Trần Văn Thời District of southern Cà Mau Province opened a mobile court session to hear the first instance of a case of organising and brokering for others to escape to abroad or stay illegally in a foreign country.

The jury sentenced defendant Phạm Văn Nghệ, 53, from Bến Tre Province, temporarily residing in Sông Đốc Town of Cà Mau Province, to two years in prison for arranging for others to flee abroad.

The fishing boat used was also confiscated by the court.

The court heard that in August 2019, a man named Lê Quốc Khánh went fishing illegally in Malaysian waters and was arrested and sentenced to six months in prison by the Malaysian authority.

After being released from prison, Khánh returned to Việt Nam and met Lê Thị Đẳng (also known as Nguyễn Thuỳ Trang) who is living in Malaysia.

Trang hired Khánh to go to Malaysia to catch fish for her and asked Khánh to find a captain and fishermen to work for her.

On February 9, 2023, Đẳng and Nghệ arranged for Khánh and Huỳnh Văn Lâm to use the fishing boat going from Sông Đốc estuary to Malaysia to catch seafood.

On April 24, 2023, Nghệ drove a boat with Lê Quốc Khánh, Đào Quốc Dương, Nguyễn Văn Lam, Phạm Văn Út, Nguyễn Chí Tâm and Ngô Doãn Công to illegally return to Việt Nam by sea.

On May 2, 2023, the Sông Đốc Border Guard Station were on patrol when they spotted the boat and Nghệ was arrested in November later that year.

Nghệ was convicted of the crime of ""organising for others to escape abroad"".

Workers Month begins in HCM City

Labour unions at various levels in HCM City are organising a number of activities to provide better care for workers during Workers Month in May.

At a ceremony to kick off Workers Month at industrial parks and export processing zones in the city on Sunday, nearly 700 workers who suffered work-related accidents and serious illnesses and 1,780 others who had put in outstanding performances at work received gifts.

The HCM City Export Processing and Industrial Zones Authority (HEPZA)'s trade union will spend VNĐ2 billion (US$79,000) on workers' welfare during the month.

The Action Month for Labour Safety and Hygiene is being held concurrently.

The Tân Bình District Labour Federation on Sunday organised a fund-raising walk that attracted more than 1,500 union members and raised more than VNĐ300 million ($11,800) for Workers Month.

The Tân Phú District Labour Federation on Sunday kicked off the month with a number of activities for workers such as a sports event and price-stabilisation sales programmes.

It offered vouchers worth VNĐ100,000 to 1,000 workers to buy goods and gave gifts to nearly 100 disadvantaged workers.

Hà Nội has 38 bus routes using electronic tickets

There are a total of 38 bus routes using electronic tickets under the pilot programme on the multi-modal ticket system for public transport in Hà Nội, said Nguyễn Phi Thường, director of the Hà Nội Department of Transport.

Electronic bus tickets are one of the important solutions helping transform Hà Nội into a smart city, bringing many benefits to the city and public transport users, Thường said.

Since November last year, in addition to the ten electric bus routes using these type of tickets, the city has expanded the pilot to other 18 regular bus routes, bringing the total number of routes piloting electronic tickets to 28 regular routes and the BRT line.

Passengers can buy chip cards or online tickets via the website, mobile applications or at ticket counters. The system accepts many forms of non-cash payments such as bank cards, e-wallets and QR codes.

""The multi-modal electronic ticket system, in addition to making ticket sales and checking quick and convenient, also meets the management and operation requirements of the route network, allowing the creation of a flexible ticket mechanism to attract people into using public services,"" Thường said.

The pilot programme aims to help create a foundation for an inter-connected ticket system across the city.

Việt Nam, Belarus celebrate major anniversaries

The Việt Nam Embassy in Belarus and the Association of International Friendship and Cultural Exchange of Belarus on May 6 held a ceremony to mark the 79th anniversary of Victory Day over Fascism in the Great Patriotic War (May 9, 1945 - 2024), the 70th anniversary of Điện Biên Phủ Victory (May 7, 1954-2024), and the 49th anniversary of the liberation of the South and the national reunification (April 30, 1975-2024).

Ambassador Nguyễn Văn Ngữ highlighted similarities between the victories of the two countries and affirmed that in world history, the victories do not only belong to the peoples of Việt Nam and Belarus but also to all peoples who love peace, freedom, and justice.

He emphasised that the Vietnamese people always remember the pure solidarity and valuable support and assistance of the Soviet people, including the people of Belarusia as well as peace lovers worldwide, adding that Việt Nam values traditional friendship and multi-faceted cooperation with Belarus.

He said Việt Nam hopes to work with Belarusian friends and partners to continue nurturing the bilateral friendly relations.

Representatives of the Belarusian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Defense, and Belarusian guests showed their love and admiration for the Vietnamese as well as their glorious victories and great achievements in the cause of national defence, construction, and development.

The event wrapped up the series of the events in the ""Việt Nam Day in Minsk"" organised from April 15 by the embassy and the association.

Earlier, the embassy and the Việt Nam Trade Office in Belarus held talks with Belarusian economic agencies and representatives of nearly 30 enterprises that have business relations with Việt Nam in such fields as economics, trade, and tourism.

Kim Đồng Publishing launches late writer's diary

A new book launched by Kim Đồng Publishing House offers bookworms a chance to know more about late writer Nguyễn Huy Tưởng.

Nguyễn Huy Tưởng (1912-1960) was a popular writer and playwright responsible for masterpieces including Vũ Như Tô, Đêm Hội Long Trì (Long Trì Festive Night), Lá Cờ Thêu Sáu Chữ Vàng (The Flag Embroidered with Six Golden Words) and Sống Mãi Với Thủ Đô (Live Forever With the Capital).

The writer was one of the first people to be awarded Hồ Chí Minh Prize and State Award for Literature and Arts.

The book entitled Con Đường Văn Sĩ (The Writer's Path) is Tưởng's diary from 1938 to the first half of 1945 and is compiled by his son Nguyễn Huy Thắng to commemorate the writer's 112th birthday anniversary.

""My father died when I was five years old so I almost don't have memories about him,"" said Thắng. ""The diary helps me to understand him.""

Tưởng came to writing quite late and in his youth participated in patriotic movements in Hải Phòng to spread the national language.

In 1943, he joined the secret National Salvation Culture group. In August 1945, he was sent to attend the National Congress in Tân Trào, then when the August Revolution succeeded, he became a key leader of the National Salvation Cultural Association and a delegate to the 1st National Assembly in 1946.

After 1954, he was a founding member of the Việt Nam Writers Association and became a member of the association's executive committee.

During those young years, he channeled his enthusiasm and desire to contribute, while suffering from anxiety about how best to express those emotions, into a diary.

The diary pages written during the years 1938 through to the August Revolution illuminate the path of a civil servant at the Tax Department working towards becoming a writer.

In the book there are also sketches about a generation of pre-war writers and historical details from the August Revolution of the urban intellectuals.

The writer did not expect that one day his diary would be published, so the writings are innocent and unfliltered, according to Ph.D in Literature scholar Đỗ Thanh Nga.

""The diary is therefore attractive because it is concise but vivid,"" Nga said. ""With realistic and emotional details, the diary pages are valuable documents about social life, civil servant life and partly outline the picture of Vietnamese literature before the August Revolution.""

Tưởng died of cancer in 1960 in Hà Nội. In his 20-year career, he left a huge literary legacy including six plays, five novels and nearly ten literary works for children and others.

Bến Tre Province secures water for agriculture, household use amid saltwater intrusion

Bến Tre Province has taken a number of effective measures to prevent saltwater intrusion this dry season, mitigating its impacts on agriculture and daily life.

The Cửu Long (Mekong) Delta province has faced severe saltwater intrusion up its rivers.

Trần Ngọc Tam, chairman of the province People's Committee, said a programme to encourage the public to store water from rains and other sources for irrigation and household use has proven extremely effective.

People have used containers and huge plastic bags and dug ponds in orchards to store water.

The province has built new irrigation works and upgraded existing ones.

Nguyễn Thành Tấn of Chợ Lách District's Hoà Nghĩa Commune said he dug a pond in his 4,000sq.m durian orchard.

The pond holds 500 cu.m of water, enough to irrigate the orchard for one to two months, according to the farmer.

He has also invested in an automatic irrigation system to save water and grows grass in the orchard to keep the soil moist.

The province Department of Agriculture and Rural Development has helped farmers switch to crops that can cope with saltwater.

It has also developed effective farming models to improve production efficiency.

A salinity of four grammes per litre was found 42-54 km inland in many major rivers on May 2, according to the province Centre for Hydro-Meteorology Forecasting.

It was 54 km deep into the mouth of the Hàm Luông River in Châu Thành District.

Most plants can only survive four grammes.

The province has 67 water supply plants with a total capacity of 250,000cu.m a day.

Last month it decided to reduce by 10 per cent the tariffs for tap water supplied by the Provincial Centre for Rural Water Supply and Sanitation in March and April.

The province has an estimated 25,000 households facing a water shortage this dry season.

It has set up 165 sites in Giồng Trôm, Ba Tri, Chợ Lách, Thạnh Phú, Châu Thành and Bình Đại districts to supply free water to locals.

It has also organised vehicles to transport water for people living in areas affected by saltwater.

Many philanthropists and organisations have also set up water tanks and provided water to people living in areas with water shortages.

At the end of last month the province Youth Union and philanthropists did so in Mỏ Cày Nam District's An Định Commune.

Last week the Central Committee of the Hồ Chí Minh Communist Youth Union (HCYU) and the Việt Nam Young Entrepreneurs Association donated water tanks and water bottles in Ba Tri District.

HCYU also donated money to assist locals, including for building a bridge and a children's playground in An Hiệp Commune, in addition to VNĐ1 billion (US$40,000) each to help poor households breed cattle for beef and provide soft loans for young people looking to set up start-ups.

The second stamp, named, Cả nước ra trận (The whole country to the front, shows a group of volunteers loading food and weapons for the front lines. The Điện Biên Phủ Campaign is depicted on the stamp's backdrop, which shows soldiers taking control of the French command bunker and hoisting the flag above it.

The third is called Bài ca không quên (Unforgettable song) and has as a backdrop the signing of the Geneva Accords, which declared the end of the French resistance war and shows a group of veterans visiting the old battlefield.

The final and fourth stamp is called Phồn vinh, hạnh phúc (Prosperity and happiness). A Thái ethnic woman is welcoming children from all groups into school with a blooming banyan tree in the background, planted above the site of the former Điện Biên battlefield.

The stamps, which cost VNĐ4,000, VNĐ4,000, VNĐ6,000 and VNĐ15,000 each respectively, will be available from the postal services until December 31, 2025.

An 800-document exhibition

Eight hundred documents are displayed at 'Điện Biên Phủ Victory -Việt Nam's Strength and the Stature of the Times' at the Việt Nam National Library.

The documents are divided into four parts, including the Resistance against French colonialism and Vietnamese military art, the actual Điện Biên Phủ Campaign and Victory, Symbols of Wisdom and Patriotism, and Echoes of Điện Biên.

The Director of the National Library of Vietnam Nguyễn Xuân Dũng said the whole history of Việt Nam in the 20th century is tied to the historic victory of Điện Biên Phủ -- a symbol of the nation's desire for peace, independence and freedom.

Điện Biên Phủ victory celebrated in Laos

A grand meeting was held in Vientiane, Laos on Tuesday to mark the 70th anniversary of the Điện Biên Phủ Victory in Việt Nam (May 7, 1954).

This was one of the activities of the Lao People's Revolutionary Party, State and Army to celebrate the historic victory that forced France to sign the Geneva agreements ending the war in the whole Indochina and recognising the independence, unity and territorial integrity of Việt Nam, Laos and Cambodia.

Recalling the enduring war of the Vietnamese people as well as their 56-day ferocious battle against the French enemy, Vice President of Laos Pany Yathotou affirmed that the Điện Biên Phủ Victory is a manifestation for not only Việt Nam's solidarity strength and aspiration for peace and independence but also the courage and growth of its armed forces.

She went on to say the Điện Biên Phủ victory is a victory of the solidarity of Việt Nam, Laos and Cambodia during the struggle against the French colonists, which not only contributed to overthrowing the old-style colonialism in the world but also set an example for other countries to fight against oppression and colonial rule, contributing to the great struggle for peace, democracy and social progress of the humankind.

Seventy years have passed but the spirit of the Điện Biên Phủ Victory remains intact and has been a source of encouragement for the three Indochinese nations, she said, adding Laos has been proud to join the Vietnamese voluntary soldiers in the battles in Laos, creating favourable conditions for the Vietnamese army to win the Điện Biên Phủ campaign.

She laid a stress on the close ties between Việt Nam and Laos, which were built by the blood of thousands of Vietnamese and Lao soldiers, on the foundation laid by President Hồ Chí Minh, President Kaysone Phomvihane and President Souphanouvong, and have been nurtured by generations of peoples from both sides.

Despite the rapid and complicated changes in international and regional situations, the two countries should preserve and strengthen their great friendship, special solidarity and comprehensive cooperation for mutual development, she said, affirming they should enhance solidarity and raise the awareness of their peoples, especially the young, about the special relations.

Việt Nam's human rights record hailed at UN review

A Vietnamese delegation led by Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Đỗ Hùng Việt attended a dialogue on Việt Nam's national report under the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC)'s fourth cycle of the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) mechanism in Geneva on Tuesday.

In his opening speech and presentation of Việt Nam's national report, Việt expressed the pride in engaging in the dialogue with other countries on the day of the 70th anniversary of the Điện Biên Phủ Victory, at the UN headquarters which witnessed the negotiation and signing of the 1954 Geneva Accords, and significant historical events in the national liberation struggle and anti-imperialist fight of the Vietnamese people and many other nations around the world.

Affirming Việt Nam's consistent policy of protecting and promoting human rights, placing people at the centre, goal and driving force of its renewal and development process, he highlighted Việt Nam's journey from a poor country to one of the fastest-growing economies deeply integrated into the global community.

Since the third UPR in 2019, Việt Nam has continued fine-tuning its legal system and policies regarding human rights, leading to tangible progress. The rights to healthcare, education, social security, freedom of religion and belief, press freedom, and Internet access and gender equality have all made significant progress. Việt Nam's rankings in the UN's Human Development Index (HDI) and Gender Equality Index (GEI) have also improved, he said.

He further added that the Vietnamese Government has enforced many policies and measures to protect people's health, boost post-pandemic socio-economic development, actively promote the transition to a green and digital economy, and fulfil Việt Nam's commitments in line with international human rights conventions.

The event garnered high interest from over 130 participating countries. They congratulated Việt Nam on its 70th anniversary of Điện Biên Phủ Victory and acknowledged its achievements in human rights, economic development, social justice and human rights education.

The Vietnamese delegation answered many questions, providing additional information about issues of shared concern, including sustainable development goals, inclusive and green economy, Internet and social network development, freedom of speech and information access, labour rights, the role of the Supreme People's Court and the Supreme People's Procuracy, freedom of religion and belief, basic conventions of the International Labour Organisation (ILO), human trafficking prevention and support for ethnic minorities.

At the dialogue, Việt Nam received about 300 recommendations encompassing a wide range of human rights issues.

On May 10, the UNHRC's UPR Working Group will consider a report on Việt Nam's review, and then to submit it to the UNHRC for the official adoption at the council's 57th session in September-October.

Vietnam hands over four illegal migrants to China

The police force of the northern province of Ha Giang and the border post at the locality's Thanh Thuy International Border Gate handed over four illegal Chinese migrants back to their home country on May 7.

On April 25, the local police discovered that Tho Mi Sinh and Vu No Po, residents in Dong Van district, arranged for the four Chinese nationals to enter Vietnam illegally through the district.

Sinh and Po were then prosecuted and put into temporary detention, while the Chinese nationals got administrative fine and were sent back home in accordance with regulations./.

Argentinian media praises Dien Bien Phu victory

The Dien Bien Phu victory 70 years ago created a premise for the signing of the Geneva agreements on ending war and restoring peace in Indochina, according to Radio National Argentina (RNA).

In his article posted on the RNA's e-newspaper, journalist Gaston Fiorda recalled the moment when the red and gold star flag flew on the roof of the French commander bunker in Dien Bien Phu at 17:30 on May 7, 1954, and all French troops at the base surrendered and were captured.

The article said the modern history of Vietnam is connected with the 100-year French colonial rule and the Vietnamese people's resistance war against the invaders. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and President Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnamese army and people successfully conducted the August Revolution in 1945 and the Dien Bien Phu campaign, which showed that a small nation is able to defeat a global military power.

Summarising three phases of the Dien Bien Phu campaign at Muong Thanh valley, Gaston Fiorda wrote that with their courage, intelligence and creativity, the Vietnamese army and people completely destroyed the Dien Bien Phu stronghold.

The campaign was the last chapter of Vietnam's nine-year resistance war against the French colonialists, and the beginning of the breakup of the colonial institution across the globe, he wrote, describing the victory as a largest military feat in Vietnam's Indochinese war (1945-1954).

Seventy years have gone by, the historical lessons of the global-shaking victory still echoed and become a source of encouragement for the Vietnamese people and peace loving nations in the world, he underlined./.

Lao media continue highlighting 70th anniversary of Dien Bien Phu Victory

Vietnam's 70th anniversary of the Dien Bien Phu Victory has resonated in Laos, with major newspapers and state media outlets dedicating significant coverage to the historic event.

The May 7 editorial of Pasaxon, the official newspaper of the Lao People's Revolutionary Party Central Committee, positioned the Dien Bien Phu Victory as the ""pinnacle"" of Vietnam's fight for national liberation, a decisive blow against old-style colonialism and the intervention of new-style imperialists, etching a permanent mark on Vietnamese and global history in the 20th century.

The editorial concluded by once again underscoring the victory's paramount role in fostering the special solidarity and combat alliance between Laos and Vietnam, highlighting the mutual support and collaboration that secured a shared triumph over a common enemy.

The Lao News Agency's Pathet Lao newspaper echoed this sentiment with a front-page article the same day. Declaring May 7 a ""historic day for the people of the three Indochinese countries"", the article underlined the invaluable lessons the Dien Bien Phu Victory imparted on the national liberation movements in the region, including the establishment of the Lao People's Democratic Republic (LPDR).

Another Pathet Lao article, published a day earlier, delved into the enduring lessons of the longstanding friendship and solidarity between Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia, especially the combat alliance forged between Vietnam and Laos, from the Dien Bien Phu campaign to the present day.

The Lao national radio and television network also joined the celebratory chorus, dedicating considerable airtime to broadcasting news and articles related to the anniversary events. They gave much praise to this victory that ""resounded across the five continents and shook the globe""./.

Art exhibition features traditional art, life of northern Việt Nam

The ""Nguyễn Linh 6"" solo art exhibition by northern Vietnamese artist Nguyễn Linh is depicting the rural landscapes, daily life, and cultural activities of Việt Nam's northern region.

The exhibition, his sixth solo and first in HCM City and southern Việt Nam, was launched at An Gallery in District 1 on May 5.

The exhibition showcases over 70 artworks, including both large (170-250 cm) and small (45-50 cm) sizes, created using mixed media on canvas.

These artworks range from portraying the familiar lives of locals to capturing artists embodying national traditional art forms such as tuồng (classical drama), chèo (traditional opera), or moments of ritualistic ceremonies like hầu đồng (also known as lên đồng).

Artist Trịnh Tuân, the curator of the exhibition, said, ""Artist Nguyễn Linh has been known as a painter with a rare abundance of creative energy, capable of producing hundreds of paintings of considerable size in just a few seasons. But for me, his talent does not solely lie in the enormous quantity, diverse subjects, and monumental scale of his works. The 'strength' in his creativity lies in his mindset, his knowledge, and a solid cultural foundation.""

Linh Nguyễn, Managing Director of Linh Nguyễn Art House and daughter of artist Nguyễn Linh, said during the opening ceremony that her father did not pursue an artistic career from the beginning but spent over 20 years of his life taking care of his family. It was only after his children had grown up that he decided to return to his artistic path.

The exhibited artworks are considered as ""folk treasures"" of Nguyễn Linh, representing his dedication and love in creating and expressing the unique life and cultural traits of Việt Nam's northern region.

""This exhibition aims to help both local and international friends gain a deeper understanding of the life and cultural artistic forms of northern Việt Nam through these paintings,"" she said.

Artist Nguyễn Linh was born in 1961 in Hà Nội. He graduated from the Hà Nội University of Fine Arts in 1983. He previously worked for Việt Nam Architecture Magazine. However, by 1990, he redirected his full passion towards fine art.

The exhibition is organised by Bến Thành Art Gallery and will be open until May 19.

35 localities piloting four-wheel EVs for tourists, despite no official legal regulations

Deputy Prime Minister Trần Hồng Hà on Tuesday chaired a meeting to discuss the results of the pilot operation of four-wheel electric vehicles for transporting tourists in restricted areas.

According to the report submitted to the Government by the Ministry of Transport, these vehicles have been used for this purpose since 2010 in the capital city, and to date, 35 out of 63 localities have received approval from the Prime Minister to pilot the operation of four-wheel vehicles powered by electricity or gasoline engines to serve tourist transportation within restricted areas.

Most localities have implemented the pilot project well and have issued regulations on the scope of operation and managing the number of vehicles registered, reads the report.

The Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, and the Ministry of Public Security, along with local authorities have all assessed that these vehicles are safe, environment friendly, cause little pollution and noise and thanks to its low speed there have been no accidents causing injuries or damages to other vehicles, making a convenient and civilised mode of transport, according to the deputy transport minister Nguyễn Duy Lâm.

However, the transport ministry acknowledges that since these types of vehicles are not yet accounted for in the Road Traffic Law, it is difficult for both Government agencies and businesses to implement procedures such as registration, issuance of licence plates, safety inspections, imposition of taxes and road tolls and collection of road maintenance fees.

Some localities, due to practical tourism needs, have used this model of transportation in their own way, with vehicles lacking the required documents for registration and inspection, and some localities have not managed well the number of vehicles participating in the pilot.

The ministry said it has received requests to allow pilot operations from six additional localities, Vĩnh Long, Phú Thọ, Bình Thuận, Trà Vinh, Quảng Trị, and Hà Nam, and asked the Prime Minister to give the green light to their use until official regulations are established.

Deputy PM Hà said the operation of these vehicles followed green transport trends, urging the transport ministry to coordinate with the public security ministry to specify regulations for four-wheel electric vehicles in the Law on Order and Safety of Road Traffic and the Road Traffic Law, which will be submitted to the National Assembly for reviews.

He also urged the transport authorities to consider more general, future-proof regulations that may cover novel modes of transport such as AI-powered, self-driving or flying vehicles, or ones that use new forms of energy.

The development and issuance of standards for four-wheeled electric vehicles should adhere to the principles of harmony, acknowledgment and recognition based on the origin, assessing the quality of this type of vehicle in developed countries, the Deputy PM said.

Regarding the continuation of the trial, Deputy PM Hà demanded that vehicles must comply with origin and quality standards in line with developed countries as well as with Việt Nam's.

Drivers must have valid driving licences as prescribed, while organisations and units operating, using and managing four-wheeled electric vehicles must be responsible for the real-life scope of operation of this type of vehicle.

Binh Thuan works to stop fishing vessels from infringing on foreign waters

The People's Committee of the south-central province of Binh Thuan on May 7 requested extra efforts to resolutely not let any local fishing vessels and fishermen violate foreign waters so as to fight illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing.

In an official dispatch to relevant units, the committee asked border guard, fisheries and police forces, and local authorities to investigate, verify, clarify, and strictly handle ships that stay unconnected to the province's vessel monitoring system (VMS); and continue to closely monitor fishing vessels operating at sea through the VMS to keep them from surpassing the allowed sea boundaries.

The units were required to seriously implement the registration, registering, and issuance of fishing licenses to vessels according to regulations and fully update the national fishing vessel database VNFishbase.

Meanwhile, fishermen and businesses were guided to implement the electronic catch documentation and traceability (eCDT) under the direction of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development.

With over 7,800 fishing vessels and 44,500 labourers engaged directly in fishing activities, Binh Thuan is one of the leading localities nationwide in terms of fishing capacity and seafood output.

According to the provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, thanks to the serious implementation of urgent measures along with the efforts of the entire political system, the locality has recorded positive results in preventing IUU fishing.

Notably, since January 2023, no fishing vessels have been detected violating relevant regulations./.

An interactive exhibition of the impressive panoramic painting depicting the Điện Biên Phủ Campaign, which captivated visitors at the Điện Biên Phủ Victory Museum in the northern province of Điện Biên, has been launched at the Nhân Dân (The People's) headquarters in Hà Nội.

The exhibition brings together cutting-edge technology, including augmented virtual reality with a 360-degree panorama painting. This unique application allows viewers to vividly relive the 56 days and nights that led to the glorious victory of Việt Nam's military and people.

At the exhibition inauguration, Editor-in-chief of Nhân Dân newspaper, Lê Quốc Minh said that the exhibition is among the special activities held by the newspaper to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the glorious victory (May 7, 2024).

""We spent six months preparing for this, starting with the launch on March 13 of a special website that provides information about the historical military campaign Điện Biên Phủ,"" he said.

Today a special printed issue of Nhân Dân newspaper has been published with four pages presenting the entire progress of the Điện Biên Phủ Campaign. The 56-day-and-night progress, from March 13, 1954 to May 7, 1954 will be issued in both Vietnamese and English in the form of 56 diary entries.

""This special issue also includes four pages featuring all the four sections of the panoramic painting Điện Biên Phủ Campaign,"" Minh said.

The chief editor hopes that the exhibition and other activities held on the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the Điện Biên Phủ Victory, will inspire the younger generation to better understand the country's history.

The Điện Biên Phủ Campaign original oil-on-canvas version on display at the Điện Biên Phủ Victory Museum was created by 200 painters and is 132m-long and 20.5m-high, covering a total area of over 3,200sq.m.

Does Ms Chambers not realise that the EU leaders know well that Ireland has a history of gross mismanagement of our indigenous energy since the 1950s when Fianna Fáil gave away our entire offshore resources for a pittance?

Is she not aware that, as a result, today and for the foreseeable future, Ireland's energy security is on a permanent knife-edge with no natural gas storage and dependent on 100 per cent import of oil and 80 per cent of natural gas, vital back-up transition fuels over the next two decades at least? At the moment, 20 per cent of our electricity is imported directly from Britain.

Would she not agree that there is a pathetic irony in that the Coalition is content to be totally dependent on the increasingly chaotic and unreliable British establishment for our energy supply and security through increasingly vulnerable pipelines?

She must be aware that the coalition's recent decision, in a spate of mindless and irresponsible grandstanding, to cease issuing oil and gas exploration licenses off our coast has increased our vulnerability and dependence on Britain, further exacerbated by the irresponsible dogma-driven refusal to allow further exploration of the Barryroe field just off the Cork coast, which would have guaranteed decades of native energy security by 2026.

Ms Chambers bases her request on Ireland's ""access to a high-quality wind corridor off the west coast delivering not just for Ireland but for but for Europe as a whole"".

Those in the renewable industry are too well aware and totally frustrated that Ireland is far behind the rest of Europe in terms of preparation, planning and offshore infrastructure. Recently as a result, two of the largest operators, Equinor and Shell have left our shores and abandoned future developments.

Ms Chambers would do well to peruse the official EU Wind Europe site (windeurope.org) which shows that Ireland at present generates on average only 35 gigawatt hours (GWh) from wind per day whereas the top ten EU countries generate over 2500 GWh. Germany, UK, Denmark, Netherlands Belgium and France already have substantial off- shore wind generating capacity and rapidly developing more.

It is naive, therefore, on the basis of our historical and current mismanagement of our own energy, that Ireland would be considered for the European Commission energy portfolio. - Yours, etc,",irishtimes.com,news,The Irish Times,,0.05882352941176472,452823474,1,https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/r1l_CkmutaYvY1vjt2VnJ4xW1yY=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/irishtimes/VHFAVTA4U5C7FE2ZTPOGOKHXN4.jpg,

About 40% of Ukraine's population is in need of humanitarian aid, the ministry said, citing U.N. data.

""The humanitarian situation in Ukraine is extremely serious,"" said Dan Jorgensen, the Danish development cooperation minister.

""Millions of Ukrainians have been displaced, thousands of homes have been destroyed, hospitals have been bombed, and basic necessities such as water, heating, and electricity are scarce resources for many Ukrainians.""

The humanitarian package will include food, medicine, water, and shelter for Ukrainians in the hardest-hit areas. It is focused on the protection of the most vulnerable citizens, including children and women, and will also include psychological support and maternal healthcare, according to the statement.

The federal government this month issued what it has called the first round of feasibility licenses to six companies to explore offshore wind farm projects off the coast of Victoria.

Yet amid this promising development, the scarcity of undersea power cables poses a looming challenge for the industry - not just their installation, technically difficult as that can be, but also their protection.

Unlike telecommunications or data cables, which now receive considerable attention due to their role in the intensifying US-China technological competition, the security implications of submarine power cables connected to offshore wind farms are often overlooked. Converting wind energy into electrical power requires a network of high-voltage direct current (HVDC) submarine cables and substations that facilitate the transmission of electricity over long distances from the turbines to the shore. From onshore substations, the electricity is then fed into the existing grid for distribution to consumers.

Unlike underwater data cables, the prospect of cyber security threats to submarine power cables does not immediately spring to mind, however the danger is still apparent. Offshore wind farms can be vulnerable due to their remote location and complex communication systems required to operate safely. Unlike onshore wind farms, those located at sea require extensive digital infrastructure to connect with onshore systems, maintenance vessels or drones, which increases the potential risk. In the United States, offshore wind farms are increasingly viewed as a national security concern. The reliance on critical components sourced from China for turbine manufacturing further highlights the intricate interplay between energy and security.

But these geopolitical considerations are secondary to the immediate challenges facing the offshore wind farm industry. A global surge in wind projects has intensified demand for cables, with forecasts indicating this could double by 2030. Three European companies - NKT (Denmark), Prysmian (Italy), and Nexans (France) - dominate 75% of the HDVC market. However, the Financial Times noted recently that production capacity for most submarine power cable manufacturers is fully booked until the late 2020s. This could see countries other than China face HVDC cable shortages. China has managed to avoid cable shortfall issues having devoted substantial resources to bolstering its HVDC sector over several years. Additionally, China boasts homegrown companies that predominantly cater to the domestic market.

Moreover, technological needs further compound the problem, as larger, longer, and higher-voltage cables are required for bigger and more distant offshore wind farms. Upgrades to manufacturing equipment and bespoke cable production can exacerbate supply chain challenges. The looming shortage of cables not only threatens project timelines but also raises concerns among insurers, driving up premiums and leaving projects without cover.

Then there is the challenge of laying the cables. Only a limited number of vessels exist that are capable of laying, repairing, and maintaining these cables - a little over 60 such ships operate worldwide, the majority of which are aging. This shortage hinders the progress of offshore wind farm developments. And with competing priorities around the installation of data submarine cables, there can potentially emerge competition between data and HVDC submarine companies as both sectors experience growth in demand.

This competition underscores the broader challenges facing the offshore wind industry and highlights the need for careful planning and collaboration to address capacity constraints. For Australia, a commitment to green energy will require government support and effective collaboration with private sector to avert potential cable shortages in the industry, as well as managing the availability of ships able to lay down the lines.

The need is urgent. This could be considered as part of the government's drive for a ""Made in Australia"" industry policy, emphasising the importance of domestic manufacturing and job creation. Moreover, it aligns with a broader global initiative aimed at ensuring fair competition and fostering collaborative efforts among nations transitioning to sustainable energy sources. By actively participating in this global push, Australia can not only strengthen its renewable energy sector but also contribute to the collective global goal of combating climate change. These cables will be an essential infrastructure network, can help Australia propel its renewable energy agenda at home and also support clean energy development for the broader region.",lowyinstitute.org,news,Lowy Institute for International Policy,,0.1529411764705881,452798426,4,https://www.lowyinstitute.org/sites/default/files/2024-05/GettyImages-1734348234.jpg,eng-9559409

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark reports this, according to Ukrinform.

""The situation in Ukraine is incredibly dire. Numerous Ukrainians have been displaced, countless buildings lie in ruins, hospitals have been targeted, and necessities like water, heat, and electricity are scarce for many people. In areas near the front line, the situation is catastrophic. Women and children are particularly at risk. Through this new support package, we aim to provide urgent humanitarian assistance and protection for the most vulnerable groups, potentially saving their lives,"" said Danish Minister for International Development Dan Jorgensen.

It is noted that this package provides essential emergency assistance in the form of:

Special attention is paid to protecting the most vulnerable sections of the population. These include millions of children who suffer from the effects of war and need a safe environment, social engagement, and support to continue their education even during the war.

The support package also contributes to efforts to prevent, mitigate, and respond to the specific risks faced by women and girls, including the risk of sexual and gender-based violence. It contributes to the provision of psychosocial support and maternal and childhood care.

According to the UN, more than two years after the beginning of the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, almost 15 million people need humanitarian assistance. This is about 40% of the population of Ukraine. The most vulnerable Ukrainians, including women, children, and people displaced by hostilities, are particularly affected by the war.

For reference:

It should be noted that Ukraine will receive 42 American F-16 fighter jets from the Netherlands and 19 aircraft from Denmark.

Furthermore, Ukrainian pilots who have received training on F-16 fighter jets in Denmark and the United States are currently practicing the tasks they will encounter in Ukraine. This includes conducting strikes on Shahed drones and missiles.

In addition to funds for military aid, the Danish government also allocates additional funds for the Danish-Ukrainian fund, which helps attract investments from Danish companies to Ukraine.

The UK's newest electricity interconnector, which stretches for 757km to join rural Lincolnshire with Revsing in Denmark, has been named as the longest land and subsea HVDC interconnector.

Members of the project team were joined by a GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS™ adjudicator at the UK converter site in Bicker Fen on 30 April to officially receive the title and certificates.

Record-breaking Viking Link is jointly owned and operated by National Grid and Danish system operator Energinet and became operational on 29 December. So far it has transported more than 1,800GWh of power between the two countries - a figure that will only increase over time.

Construction on the link began in 2019 and a bespoke vessel, the Leonardo De Vinci, was commissioned to install the cable, which weighs 40kg per metre and stretches further across land and sea than any other of its kind.

More than four million working hours were spent bringing the project to life - with many of the team working on the link since the beginning.

National Grid Construction Director Gareth Burden said: ""This is a huge achievement for the whole team and we are thrilled to be recognised by GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS™.

""Viking Link is an incredible feat of engineering, bringing cleaner, greener and more affordable energy to consumers as well as increasing energy security for both countries.

The race is on to transform logistics and public transport for the better. Converting to electric heavy transport vehicles presents a huge opportunity for reducing carbon emissions, but also a suite of challenges to overcome.

But before we get to the latter, let's talk about the former: the net positives that will come from converting the largest vehicles on our roads to cleaner, greener energy.

Right now, these vehicles represent just 2% of all traffic, but they produce around 25% of road emissions. That's a big deal when we think about the wider context - that is, global targets for lowering emissions and reducing reliance on fossil fuels.

The Paris Agreement, for example, has set a goal of ""holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels"".

In Denmark, meanwhile, the diesel tax is set to increase in 2025 with a view to making electric alternatives much more appealing. Sweden is now prohibiting petrol and diesel-powered commercial vehicles from entering a specific area of central Stockholm.

Initiatives like these will help stem the flow of climate change, but there are two key challenges to overcome when it comes to electric heavy transport infrastructure: cost and energy availability. So let's dive into each.

Mitigating the cost of EV infrastructure

Investing millions in widespread electric heavy vehicle infrastructure - and the vehicles themselves - can seem daunting. That's especially the case when, as we'll discuss, accessing the energy you need can present its own challenges.

But there are ways to shrink that investment and, in some cases, even turn an eventual profit.

One proven strategy here is to make heavy vehicle chargers available to the public. By necessity, large vehicles need DC fast chargers, and these are in high demand by EV drivers looking to charge up quickly.

One Scandinavian bus company partnered with Spirii to provide a great real-world test case here. To help finance its electric transition, the company has allowed other companies to use its chargers at set times during the day. With buses normally charging at night, that means maximised station usage and a constant revenue stream that can help mitigate upfront costs.

Future-proofing grid management

How energy infrastructure can handle connecting more and more chargers and vehicles to the grid is a challenge that the entire industry has to overcome. More vehicles typically means more grid strain and an increased demand for power, so we must find solutions that can help ease things during this transitional period.

One solution is to turn to alternative power sources, such as solar energy. A public transport company from the Benelux region, has installed solar panels on its building roofs to supplement electricity from the grid.

When combined with battery storage and smart software it becomes a lot easier to distribute power to chargers without challenging the grid. But this solution also helps with another solution: grid balancing.

We tend to view the relationship between chargers and the energy grid as a one-sided draw. However, technologies like frequency regulation enable companies with heavy transport chargers to play a vital role in stabilising the national grid by adjusting their charging network's energy consumption in response to the grid's fluctuating demand.

This proactive approach to grid management is not only beneficial for the stability of the energy supply but also financially advantageous for the companies involved. By participating in frequency regulation programmes, they receive financial incentives, which can significantly offset the costs of their initial infrastructure investment.

If we are to succeed in rapidly and effectively electrifying heavy transport, we need to develop and implement more innovative strategies that minimise the strain on the power grid, while maximising return on investments.",fleetnews.co.uk,news,FNN - Fleet NewsNet,,0.3176470588235294,452782657,1,https://fncdn.blob.core.windows.net/web-clean/1/root/opinion-revolutionizing-heavy-transport-innovative-strategies-to-accelerate-electrification-fleet-news-tore-harritshj-spirii.png,eng-9542150

RenewablesNow discussed the topic with Simen Bomnes Valamo, Director Market Intelligence at Kyoto Group on the sidelines of the recently held Energy Tech Summit 2024 in Bilbao, Spain.

Kyoto Group AS is a Norwegian company that develops solutions to capture and manage energy from renewable energy sources and apply it to reduce the carbon footprint for industrial process heat. Its proprietary development is Heatcube, a thermal energy storage solution that uses electricity from surplus solar or wind generation and molten salt to produce heat in the form of steam. The product is offered to industrial customers, providing them with technology to lower both their costs and CO2 emissions for producing process heat using renewable energy instead of fossil fuels. Heatcube, which can be configured with storage capacities from 16 MWh to over 120 MWh, is being installed commercially in Hungary.

Q: As it appears that a considerable portion of industrial energy demand is driven by the need for heat, not electricity, do you think thermal energy storage is the missing piece in the puzzle to link renewable energy production and industrial processes on a larger scale?

Correct. Heat is the dominating part of the industrial energy demand. The industry will need to decarbonise this heat demand and to do so, they will need a viable and affordable solution to fuel switch with and Thermal Energy Storage is the most prominent solution to do so. Thermal Energy Storage systems like Heatcube connect the varying renewable energy production with the stable energy demand in the industry - it enables electrification of the industrial heat demand with the lowest possible cost while at the same time solving the flexibility challenges in the power system.

Q: How do you see the product's future role in the decarbonisation of industrial processes?

Half of the global primary energy consumption is in the form of heat. Almost all this heat is produced by combustion of fossil fuels, making up 40% of the global CO2 emissions. In other words, decarbonisation of heat production is key to reaching any emission reduction targets. The lowest-cost solution for decarbonisation of industrial heat production is electrification with renewable power. However, the industry needs a stable and continuous heat supply while renewables produce energy only when the sun shines and the wind blows. This is exactly what Kyoto Group solves with our Thermal Energy Storage solution - Heatcube. Heatcube sources renewable electricity whenever it is available, either off-grid or through the power market, stores the energy in the form of heat and discharges this heat for use in industrial processes whenever the industry needs it.

Q: The solution bets on using the abundance of renewable energy in off-peak hours. How does it increase the value of grid stabilisation and promote grid balancing?

One of the biggest challenges with the future power system is the increasing need for flexibility that arises from intermittent renewables. Historically, the primary source of flexibility in the power system has been fossil-based power production that is now being replaced with intermittent production. As Heatcube can provide heat 24/7 while using electricity only 4-10 hours of the day, it provides new flexibility to the system and creates value for the grid in two ways. First, it enables load shifting from the hours with high grid load and low power supply to the hours of the day when there is abundance of power production, matching the electricity consumption with the electricity production. Secondly, Heatcube is highly responsive and with the flexibility in storage it can offer ancillary services for the grid operators on a continuous basis. The ability to offer balancing services to the grid benefits not only the grid operators but also the industrial customers who are being remunerated for the service.

Q: What is your opinion about the integration of AI-driven technologies, do you think they could contribute to overcoming the challenges in improving grid flexibility and resilience? Are you using AI-based technologies for that and what are Kyoto Group's endeavours in that direction?

In the transition towards a more distributed energy system, it follows a necessary integration of smart technologies to fully enable the system flexibility potential and we believe that AI-based solutions will play a central role in this. The power system requirement is reflected in the power markets that are moving towards more flexible products. This is why we have developed an AI-based platform for the operation of Heatcube, ensuring full utilisation of the opportunities in the current power market structure and preparing for future energy market changes.

In Kyoto Group we see AI as an integral part of the future energy system, and we have based our product development on AI technologies. Our commercial Heatcube installation in northern Denmark is the world's first AI-powered Thermal Energy Storage asset with fully digitalised operation and energy trading. With an AI-based platform for the operation of Heatcube we can optimise performance and minimise operational costs, while also enabling easy integration of AI-based energy trading systems.

Q: Last year, Kyoto Group received an order to install Heatcube commercially in Hungary to reduce natural gas supply for a client? How do you estimate the technology's potential on a large-scale industrial basis?

Yes, we are installing a Heatcube in Hungary to reduce the natural gas use for KALL Ingredients, a corn processing company using steam to produce sugar products, where Heatcube will reduce their annual CO2 emissions by up to 8,000 tonnes. This is the second commercial installation of Heatcube and we have announced several additional projects that are in the final stage of development. This demonstrates the attractiveness and profitability of Heatcube in the market today and we are continuously maturing the pipeline of projects to be realised in the coming years. The market for green industrial heat is immense, with our Heatcube we target industrial heat in the temperature range 135-400 degrees Celsius which represents a serviceable market of more than 11,000 TWh/year. This is equal to 370,000 Heatcubes installed.",renewablesnow.com,news,Renewablesnow.com,Veselina Petrova,0.4666666666666666,452768620,16,https://cdn.aiidatapro.net/media/ce/de/a0/t780x490/cedea0365cc69fd125dc2d5cdfc3aeee.jpg,

About NewHydrogen, Inc.

NewHydrogen is developing ThermoLoop - a breakthrough technology that uses water and heat rather than electricity to produce the world's cheapest green hydrogen. Hydrogen is the cleanest and most abundant element in the universe, and we can't live without it. Hydrogen is the key ingredient in making fertilizers needed to grow food for the world. It is also used for transportation, refining oil and making steel, glass, pharmaceuticals and more. Nearly all the hydrogen today is made from hydrocarbons like coal, oil, and natural gas, which are dirty and limited resources. Water, on the other hand, is an infinite and renewable worldwide resource. Currently, the most common method of making green hydrogen is to split water into oxygen and hydrogen with an electrolyzer using green electricity produced from solar or wind. However, green electricity is and always will be very expensive. It currently accounts for 73% of the cost of green hydrogen. By using heat directly, we can skip the expensive process of making electricity, and fundamentally lower the cost of green hydrogen. Inexpensive heat can be obtained from concentrated solar, geothermal, nuclear reactors and industrial waste heat for use in our novel low-cost thermochemical water splitting process. Working with a world class research team at UC Santa Barbara, our goal is to help usher in the green hydrogen economy that Goldman Sachs estimated to have a future market value of $12 trillion.

About NewHydrogen, Inc.

NewHydrogen is developing ThermoLoop™ "" a breakthrough technology that uses water and heat rather than electricity to produce the world's cheapest green hydrogen. Hydrogen is the cleanest and most abundant element in the universe, and we can't live without it. Hydrogen is the key ingredient in making fertilizers needed to grow food for the world. It is also used for transportation, refining oil and making steel, glass, pharmaceuticals and more. Nearly all the hydrogen today is made from hydrocarbons like coal, oil, and natural gas, which are dirty and limited resources. Water, on the other hand, is an infinite and renewable worldwide resource. Currently, the most common method of making green hydrogen is to split water into oxygen and hydrogen with an electrolyzer using green electricity produced from solar or wind. However, green electricity is and always will be very expensive. It currently accounts for 73% of the cost of green hydrogen. By using heat directly, we can skip the expensive process of making electricity, and fundamentally lower the cost of green hydrogen. Inexpensive heat can be obtained from concentrated solar, geothermal, nuclear reactors and industrial waste heat for use in our novel low-cost thermochemical water splitting process. Working with a world class research team at UC Santa Barbara, our goal is to help usher in the green hydrogen economy that Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) estimated to have a future market value of $12 trillion.

This open-source data visualization project has been around since 2016. But companies like Google and Samsung are increasingly relying on this rich data set to hit their sustainability goals and empower their own users.

There are currently 20 people working for Electricity Maps and the company has been profitable for a few years. But TechCrunch has exclusively learned it recently raised a $5.4 million (€5M) funding round from Transition and Revent, to take things up a notch by investing in the product and the business. Electricity Maps is now both a data visualization tool and an enterprise API for data-driven decarbonization -- and one wouldn't work without the other.

Founded by Olivier Corradi, a French and Danish entrepreneur and data scientist who previously worked for voice assistant startup Snips, Electricity Maps started from an itch to know more about electricity production and consumption. ""There were articles in the press saying that Denmark ran on 100% renewable energy for a day. So I was wondering whether this was true and how long it lasted -- how many hours in the day,"" Corradi told TechCrunch.

Electricity Maps aggregates real-time data for electricity production in more than 50 countries around the world. While the company uses open-data sources, employees and community contributors had to build dozens of parsers to standardize this data.

As renewable energy depends on weather conditions (for wind and solar energy in particular), the mix of energy sources constantly evolves. It means that the carbon intensity of the energy produced also changes with the time of the day and the current conditions. And, as you may have guessed, as electricity works a bit like tap water flowing through a vast network of tubes, the CO2 emissions related to the electricity you consume can vary greatly.

Calculating the CO2 emissions can be complicated as there are also a lot of cross-border flows for electricity -- some countries produce more electricity than they actually consume while others have larger electricity needs than production capacity. Electricity Maps has designed its own flow-tracing model to understand which power plant contributes to the electricity you're consuming right now.

""We're going to process all this in our system with what we call a flow-tracing algorithm, which lets us tell you where the electricity is coming from depending on where you are. It can be produced locally, but it can also come from Germany. But Germany imports from Poland, so it could potentially come from Poland, etc. So we need to perform some modelling,"" Corradi said.

The company also stores historical data and uses machine learning algorithms to provide 24-hour forecasts. Just like weather APIs are now a big industry, electricity forecasting APIs could become essential business tools in the future.

Electricity Maps founder and CEO Olivier Corradi (Image Credits: Electricity Maps)

The reason why the open-source data visualization project is an essential part of the company is because Electricity Maps wants to achieve as much consensus as possible. Calculating the lifecycle emissions for electricity generation requires peer reviewed studies.

The company shares all its sources for emission factors. It also means that these calculation methods can evolve over time as researchers release new studies with more accurate results. The community can discuss and submit potential changes that will be reflected in Electricity Maps' data.

As for the commercial part, being able to know the carbon intensity of the electricity that is available at a specific place and a specific time can be a sort of super power.

""With all the renewable energy installation goals, we're going to find ourselves in a world where the quantity of intermittent renewable energy will triple by 2030,"" Corradi said.

""The good thing is that this demand is flexible because it's going to be electric cars and you can change the time at which they charge. It's going to be AI training and you can choose the time at which you're going to train these big models,"" he added.

Google, one of Electricity Maps' most important clients, partnered with the European startup to calculate the carbon intensity of the electricity powering its data centers.

For some tasks, such as indexing the web or training a new AI model, Google can use Electricity Maps' data for load shifting. When there's more wind, it's time to boot up additional servers. Or when it's nighttime in the U.S., Google can move some compute-intensive operations to European data centers.

But Google's own clients will also benefit from the company's partnership with Electricity Maps. With the EU's Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, many companies will soon have to publish carbon accounting reports. As many companies rely on Google Cloud for their hosting needs, they will need data to calculate their scope 3 emissions. Thanks to Electricity Maps' historical data, that carbon data will be more accurate.

Samsung, another client for Electricity Maps, uses the startup's data to show users the electricity usage and carbon footprint of their Samsung devices. In that case, this is more about educating users.

But Electricity Maps is much more than an educational tool. It can act as the information layer that decides whether it's a good time to turn on millions of electric devices -- or, at least, if it's a good time to have as little impact as possible on the planet.

Why is a profitable company raising? The funding injection is aimed at dialling up Electricity Maps' own impact by stepping on the gas so it can meet rising demand for smarter climate tools, per Corradi. ""The reason we raised is simply that the amount of renewable energy now in the system is starting to be so significant that you're starting to have an opportunity to activate the flexibility of the appliances you have at home, or in the industrial sector.""",yahoo.com,news,Yahoo,,0.2156862745098038,452763889,100,https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/9IPVwe9VoN2a8TiXEJAIYA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03OTQ7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/techcrunch_350/b1e60324d8ed29d80fe0c41501eb1684,

This open-source data visualization project has been around since 2016. But companies like Google and Samsung are increasingly relying on this rich data set to hit their sustainability goals and empower their own users.

There are currently 20 people working for Electricity Maps and the company has been profitable for a few years. But TechCrunch has exclusively learned it recently raised a $5.4 million (€5M) funding round from Transition and Revent, to take things up a notch by investing in the product and the business. Electricity Maps is now both a data visualization tool and an enterprise API for data-driven decarbonization -- and one wouldn't work without the other.

Founded by Olivier Corradi, a French and Danish entrepreneur and data scientist who previously worked for voice assistant startup Snips, Electricity Maps started from an itch to know more about electricity production and consumption. ""There were articles in the press saying that Denmark ran on 100% renewable energy for a day. So I was wondering whether this was true and how long it lasted -- how many hours in the day,"" Corradi told TechCrunch.

Electricity Maps aggregates real-time data for electricity production in more than 50 countries around the world. While the company uses open-data sources, employees and community contributors had to build dozens of parsers to standardize this data.

As renewable energy depends on weather conditions (for wind and solar energy in particular), the mix of energy sources constantly evolves. It means that the carbon intensity of the energy produced also changes with the time of the day and the current conditions. And, as you may have guessed, as electricity works a bit like tap water flowing through a vast network of tubes, the CO2 emissions related to the electricity you consume can vary greatly.

Calculating the CO2 emissions can be complicated as there are also a lot of cross-border flows for electricity -- some countries produce more electricity than they actually consume while others have larger electricity needs than production capacity. Electricity Maps has designed its own flow-tracing model to understand which power plant contributes to the electricity you're consuming right now.

""We're going to process all this in our system with what we call a flow-tracing algorithm, which lets us tell you where the electricity is coming from depending on where you are. It can be produced locally, but it can also come from Germany. But Germany imports from Poland, so it could potentially come from Poland, etc. So we need to perform some modelling,"" Corradi said.

The company also stores historical data and uses machine learning algorithms to provide 24-hour forecasts. Just like weather APIs are now a big industry, electricity forecasting APIs could become essential business tools in the future.

The reason why the open-source data visualization project is an essential part of the company is because Electricity Maps wants to achieve as much consensus as possible. Calculating the lifecycle emissions for electricity generation requires peer reviewed studies.

The company shares all its sources for emission factors. It also means that these calculation methods can evolve over time as researchers release new studies with more accurate results. The community can discuss and submit potential changes that will be reflected in Electricity Maps' data.

As for the commercial part, being able to know the carbon intensity of the electricity that is available at a specific place and a specific time can be a sort of super power.

""With all the renewable energy installation goals, we're going to find ourselves in a world where the quantity of intermittent renewable energy will triple by 2030,"" Corradi said.

""The good thing is that this demand is flexible because it's going to be electric cars and you can change the time at which they charge. It's going to be AI training and you can choose the time at which you're going to train these big models,"" he added.

Google, one of Electricity Maps' most important clients, partnered with the European startup to calculate the carbon intensity of the electricity powering its data centers.

For some tasks, such as indexing the web or training a new AI model, Google can use Electricity Maps' data for load shifting. When there's more wind, it's time to boot up additional servers. Or when it's nighttime in the U.S., Google can move some compute-intensive operations to European data centers.

But Google's own clients will also benefit from the company's partnership with Electricity Maps. With the EU's Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, many companies will soon have to publish carbon accounting reports. As many companies rely on Google Cloud for their hosting needs, they will need data to calculate their scope 3 emissions. Thanks to Electricity Maps' historical data, that carbon data will be more accurate.

Samsung, another client for Electricity Maps, uses the startup's data to show users the electricity usage and carbon footprint of their Samsung devices. In that case, this is more about educating users.

But Electricity Maps is much more than an educational tool. It can act as the information layer that decides whether it's a good time to turn on millions of electric devices -- or, at least, if it's a good time to have as little impact as possible on the planet.

Why is a profitable company raising? The funding injection is aimed at dialling up Electricity Maps' own impact by stepping on the gas so it can meet rising demand for smarter climate tools, per Corradi. ""The reason we raised is simply that the amount of renewable energy now in the system is starting to be so significant that you're starting to have an opportunity to activate the flexibility of the appliances you have at home, or in the industrial sector.""",techcrunch.com,news,TechCrunch,Romain Dillet,0.1843137254901961,452759643,88,"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/dragos.jpg?resize=1200,794",eng-9540777

From the cost of goods and services like groceries and electricity, to inflation, more Canadians say they're worried about making ends meet than in previous years, Ipsos data shows.

And recent reports, such as this one from the National Bank of Canada, paint a bleak picture of our country's economic performance --  particularly in terms of labour productivity, which is a key standard of living metric.

According to the bank's findings, 2023 marked the third consecutive year of decline in labour productivity, exacerbating an already troubling trend that is also evident when looking at other key indicators of prosperity such as health care and education (more on this below).

Engaged women have told us they want trade-offs to be made to ensure our country's economic success and prosperity, so this standard of living crisis is one we're looking to governments to address in new provincial and federal budgets.

One big way government budgets can tackle these challenges is to support sound energy policies that bolster our economy, create jobs, and bring in critical tax revenues to fund our social services.

Several key indicators of prosperity in Canada have been concerning in recent years. As Frank Stronach noted in a recent National Post article, two of the most important metrics are health and education.

Health care is facing significant shortcomings compared to other Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries, reports the Canadian Medical Association Journal.

Canada has the lowest total number of physicians per capita, and along with the UK and Denmark the lowest number of hospital beds per capita, says the report.

While each province or territory is responsible for managing its own health care system, the provinces rely on transfer payments to fund health care, and more than 70% of health care spending is publicly funded through general tax revenues.

These costs ae expected to rise 5.2% every year for the next 10 years, according to the Canadian Medical Association.

Education is another critical standard of living metric and it's also experiencing setbacks and funding issues.

Recent OECD reports show a concerning decline in math scores among Canadian high school students over the past two decades. This deterioration of educational standards not only undermines individual opportunities but also poses long-term risks to Canada's economic competitiveness.

And once again, funding shortages are affecting education systems across the country, exacerbating teacher shortages in elementary and secondary schools, raising the cost of tuition for some post-secondary students and causing university staffing cuts.

Challenges like these disproportionately affect average Canadians ""on the lower and middle rungs of the socioeconomic ladder,"" Stronach notes in the National Post.

""They're the ones lying in a hallway on a stretcher outside the critical care unit for hours on end. They're the ones scrambling to find a family doctor. And they're the ones who are increasingly struggling to buy groceries because sky-high inflation has eroded their spending power.""

What can be done to turn the page and drive more prosperity for all Canadians? Clearly additional funding is needed to support integral social services like health care and education. And that funding is significantly tied to the success of our economy.

This is where policies that boost our economic growth, and thus tax revenue, come in.

A robust energy sector can be a catalyst for economic revival and improved standards of living.

The energy industry has long been a cornerstone of Canada's economy, contributing significantly to government revenues and economic activity.

According to the Canadian Energy Centre, the sector contributed $755 billion to Canadian government revenues between 2000 and 2021, underscoring its pivotal role in helping to fund and sustain public services and social programs.

The oil and natural gas sector in particular remains a key driver of economic activity, supporting jobs and investment across the country.

The sector directly employs 290,300 people and indirectly supports more than 405,800 jobs, says the Canadian Centre for Energy Information.

Canada's natural gas industry is expected to generate billions in government revenues and capital spending through 2050; conservative estimates suggest more than $227 billion in government revenues are expected from the natural gas sector, and an additional $420 billion from the oil sands.

With its contribution to GDP, job creation, and tax revenues, sound energy policy can be a springboard for Canadian prosperity. And with these tax revenues, education and health care can be better supported.

Strategic energy policies that embrace energy transformation can diversify the economy, create new employment opportunities, and positively impact the standard of living for Canadians coast-to-coast.

They can also foster advances in technology and innovation that will enable a reliable supply of energy, while reducing emissions.

Finally, sound energy policy also encourages development of a diverse energy mix - think renewables and low-carbon, non-renewable sources that combined meet our ever-growing need for more power.

With the right policy approaches and investments, Canada can emerge stronger, more resilient, and more prosperous than ever before.",digitaljournal.com,news,Digital Journal,"Paul Wallis, Agence France-Presse",0.2392156862745098,452746456,1,https://www.digitaljournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Family-1024x576.jpg,

It's been running annually for close to a decade, and with COVID it transitioned to virtual and won't be going back. That event occurred a couple of weeks ago, and I was privileged to present my optimistic perspective on the transformation between RMI CEO Jon Creyts and Jeremy Rifkin, author and advisor to governments on multiple continents. Over a thousand participants were online for the virtual event. The following is the lightly edited transcript of my remarks and the question and answer opportunity.

For those who like videos and talk talk, here's the YouTube.

Thank you for the wonderful introduction, and thank you, Jon, for the overview of the excellent work that RMI has done and continues to do. I have more future-oriented stuff. You'll see a lot of themes out of Jon and RMI's excellent work that will be projected forward into the future. Our low carbon future is coming fast, and it's coming amazingly quickly, and it's very spiky. I look for pockets of the future, and the pockets of the future are very broad.

I like to start with this. It's not as bad an eye chart as some, but this is a Sankey diagram of energy in the United States for 2022. What it says is, here's all the energy that comes in on the left hand side into the United States economy. This is extrapolatable to every economy. The energy goes through electrical generation, goes into residential, commercial, industrial, and transportation and use cases and comes out here.

The reason this is important is because of this big gray box up here on the right, rejected energy. Rejected energy is the energy that comes in out of primary energy, which Jon mentioned, but we don't actually get any use out of it. That's because virtually all this stuff down here in the lower left, the petroleum, the coal, and the natural gas., when we burn it for energy, that's a very inefficient process. We throw away a lot of the energy as waste heat, and we actually make a lot more carbon dioxide.

This is why we've got a problem today as we consider those energy pathways. One of the ways I like to describe fossil fuels is that when we burn them, they create CO2 and waste heat. And, oh, by the way, some useful work for us. That's something that's going to change.

As we look by comparison at those low carbon forms of generation up in the upper left hand corner -- solar, nuclear, hydro, wind, and geothermal -- there's a lot less rejected energy. We don't actually have to replace all of the energy on the left, we just have to build out the much more efficient pathways, drive them through electricity, and electrify all these end points, and we get to radically lower energy requirements for the same economic and comfort values for a society.

I've done the math on this. I do napkin math on enormous numbers of subjects, which is part of the reason I'm privileged to be here today with Jon and with Jeremy Rifkin, who follows me. But other people have done really deep math on this, like Mark Z. Jacobson and team out of Stanford. They are the ones who are responsible for the projections of 100% renewables by 2050. A very credible scenario, imperfect in some ways, as are all of mine, and I'll share mine, but they've done the same math. And under 50% of the primary energy coming into the United States is actually required when we move to renewables and when we move to electrified energy services. Saul Griffiths also did that work, and he calculates that only 42% of the energy we actually use today is required to get everything we need and to not lose any comfort.

This is why I annoy long-term efficiency boffins, because I consider efficiency to be a secondary question. Electrification is first, efficiency is used to make it cost beneficial and more economical.

A heat pump takes three units of energy from the environment for every one unit of electricity, because we can do that with electricity. So all of the transportation is three to four times more efficient when electrified than non-electrified. Is that an efficiency measure, or is it an electric benefit of electrification? I tend to call it a benefit of electrification, which is why my short list of climate actions that will work starts, as so many do, with electrify everything.

Of course, the big question is, what electrical generation are we going to do? Jon talked about the plummeting costs of wind, solar, and batteries. That's been absurdly beneficial. We now are building more wind and solar than the rest, than anybody could have projected.

The IEA got it wrong, famously, as Jon pointed out with one of his charts, but they're getting better. The IEA was formed as an oil, gas, and coal organization about 50 years ago, and Fatih Birol is slowly turning the helm of an ultra-large crude carrier.

More to the point, we see amazing grid reliability. All the questions, all the concerns about intermittency of renewables are being answered. California is seeing 100% delivery of electric generation needs by renewables for many days, for many hours over many days.

Over the past few years, Denmark regularly sees over 100% from wind energy alone, and Germany is now approaching 60% renewables on its grid. Denmark and Germany have among the most reliable grids in the world, 13 minutes of outages per customer per year. This is not actually that hard to do. It's a transformation. We are transforming our grids and our generation, but we're doing it very effectively.

The more renewables are on our grid, it turns out the slightly more reliable the grid becomes. The transformation enhances things. This is an indication that this is where we're going. I'm not going to dwell on it, because it's one of the more obvious things.

But what about longer duration storage? One of the big questions is how do we store all this electricity? What happens when the wind doesn't blow and the sun doesn't shine? There are a couple of answers to that. This is my projection of grid storage requirements through 2060. It's slightly adjusted based on the decline in cell-based battery costs recently, but it still holds true in my opinion.

The first question about intermittency that we have to ask is how intermittent are wind and solar in reality? The wind doesn't blow all the time. That's not quite true. The wind doesn't blow as strongly all the time. The sun doesn't shine as brightly all the time. And at night, of course, it doesn't shine at all. Wind farms actually generate electricity 85% of the year, just not at 100% of their maximum potential.

We actually get 85% coverage of some demand from wind farms. And for solar farms? Whenever the sun is shining from the beginning of the day to the end of the day, some electricity is coming out of solar farms. So we actually have overlapping curves with wind and solar, which are easier to accommodate than you might think. It's not like a nuclear plant. If the nuclear plant shuts down, as happened in Texas a couple years ago in the ice storms, that's just off. There's no degradation, there's no slow ramping down of a nuclear plant.

But what will work? Pumped hydro is going to be the dominant one for energy storage on grids, just as it is today, just as it's been since 1907 when the first one was built. This is a highly commoditized solution. It's great for coal country. I'm fascinated that the discourse in the United States does not include turning coal workers in coal country to building pumped hydro more. It's just an obvious thing using very strongly overlapping skills and domain knowledge.

It's going to continue to grow. I have a proof point for that. One of the things I'm doing is an ongoing series of discussions with India's utilities under the auspices of India Smart Grid Forum. That means I'm spending more time learning about India.

They have 19 gigawatts of pumped hydro under development, and they have projected a capacity of 106 gigawatts. I think that's light, based upon the work of the Australian National University. Their GIS model shows enormous closed loop off-river pumped hydro resource capacity just north of the highly populated New Delhi region in northern India. I'll be talking about that explicitly within a couple of weeks.

We also have redox flow, which is basically big tanks of chemicals with the battery part in between instead of all the chemicals inside the battery. You can scale up energy storage and have the power storage decoupled from that. I'm bullish on redox flow as we move forward.

Cell-based batteries are really hot right now, lithium-ion especially, but they have limits. They are cost effective for 4 to 8 hours. They're great for putting sunshine from the afternoon into the evening, but we need longer duration than that.

When I talked to Mark Wilson of Intelligent Land Investments in Scotland recently, he had just sold his developed pumped hydro facility on Loch Ness to Norway's Statcraft, which is building pumped hydro globally. Mark and company are also delivering cell-based battery solutions at a tremendous rate in the UK. His perspective, however, is that the entire projected demand for that short term battery storage, which is so highly valuable in the UK, will be finished in 2028 or 2029. It's a short term opportunity to put those in. Then it's a replacement as they age out.

The growth potential for cell-based grid storage is not nearly as big as assumed. Some of that is because we're going to build more renewables, and some of it is because we're going to build a lot of high voltage direct current interconnecting major geographical regions.

I like to say that high voltage direct current transmission is the new pipeline, but it's also the new oil tanker and LNG tanker. As we generate a lot more electricity inside countries and because we're using it so much more efficiently in electrified solutions, we don't actually have to import as much energy into fossil fuel poor areas.

Every place has sunshine. I lived in Singapore, the tiny dot at the bottom of Malaysia here. Even Singapore can reach 15% of its electricity demand today with solar, and it's building a lot of solar on top of all its rooftops. Local renewables inside a country, and much more efficient use through electrified systems, means a lot less energy needs to come into the country or region through pipelines or tankers or LNG tankers.

This diagram is from GEIDCO, which is the global energy interconnection development cooperation organization. It's a UN organization, but it was kicked off by China in 2015 or 2016. To consider how seriously China takes this, the premier of China was at the launch. The executive chairman of GEIDCO is the single person at the top of all grid planning and development and deployment in China, and the person responsible for the development of the Asian Supergrid. This is a massive component of what we're talking about.

As one proof point on this, the Belt and Road Initiative is in almost the same countries as GEIDCO. The Belt and Road Initiative and GEIDCO were involved in a 12-country, 10,000-kilometer sub-Saharan Africa Supergrid assessment to link the western sub-Saharan part of Africa across to the east, into Kenya and down south into South Africa, providing a strong backbone for electricity sharing across renewable zones in Africa to assist in electrifying the billion people that live there.

There's a tremendous amount of work that's being done in this space and it is somewhat invisible to North American audiences. There's really good news happening globally around the world with these types of things.

When we start talking about the efficiencies of use, I always like to start with transportation. This is a fun ChatGPT and DALL-E generated image of a futuristic San Francisco with all electrified transportation.

Right now, battery-electric cars have won globally. There is no alternative that is delivering the same value proposition. Their range is increasing. Prices are coming down. There's a blip in the west around slowing purchasing of electric vehicles right now, but I like to compare that to when I flew from Singapore to Las Vegas in 2014 for WindPower 2014 under the auspices of the American Wind Energy association.

Everybody in Vegas was depressed because of the looming end of the investment tax credit. And I was wandering around thinking, why is everybody so down-faced? Because I'd been in Singapore and I was paying attention to China's wind energy development, to Latin America's wind energy development, where I spent time in São Paulo talking wind overlapping with hydro in that great country, and also looking at Australia, and everywhere else wind was booming.

What we're seeing in terms of the narratives around electric vehicles right now, in other words, are a blip and they're more of a geographically constrained blip. Growth in the biggest car market in the world, China, is not of internal combustion vehicles and EVs are not slowing down. Similarly, India, where I'm spending a fair amount of my attention these days, they're expected to have 50,000 electric buses on the roads by 2027. And they actually have thousands of electric buses on their roads right now.

One nice thing that India has is they don't have the expectations that we have of having a 100% replacement for our current best-in-breed solution. They're much more interested in right-sizing. One of the things that they've done with their buses is they said, how much battery do we need to service our different routes? They've bought buses with smaller batteries for shorter routes, medium batteries for medium routes, and bigger batteries for bigger routes, and put a lot more buses on the roads. Instead of having every bus be able to service the maximum route, they have buses to serve their minimum routes. It's an obvious thing, not really done in North America or Europe in the same way, but tremendous stuff there.

Similarly, on trucking I spent quite a lot of my time in the past six months going through international organizations and research papers on electrification and decarbonization of freight trucking on the ground. I was involved with a Swedish study, which was simulating all freight trucking for Europe. Once you tear apart the assumptions, the reality is battery-electric freight trucking is going to dominate.

We're already at a point where in the North America, the North American Council for Freight Efficiency's Run on Less program in September of 2023, a couple of Tesla semis had service days of over 1000 miles each. That was an electric truck with two or three drivers over the course of the day, a couple of fast charges, driving 1000 miles in a single day, delivering lots of Pepsi, flats of Frito Lay, and the like. While the Tesla Semi is head and shoulders above the rest, because it's built from the ground up for battery-electric trucking, it is not alone. There were five or six other vendors, all strong battery-electric trucks. All were doing service deliveries of 500 miles a day.

It is obvious that with the battery improvements that we're seeing and megawatt-scale charging, like the 960kW liquid cooled charging system that a Chinese manufacturer just unveiled, which provides 400 kilometers or 250 miles of range in 36 minutes of charging for a freight truck that's bigger than a class eight freight truck in the United States, that this is all technically doable -- it's engineering and economics.

The rest of the world outside of North America is just electrifying railroads. The Trans Siberian railroad, 9300 km through some of the most inhospitable terrain in the world is running, is electrified. China's massive growth of high speed rail, now 45,000 km, is all electrified. India is actually going to be finished electrifying all of its heavy freight rail this year. I will say the United States is really recalcitrant on the point of electrifying rail. There are reasons for it, but the United States is lagging in terms of rail and it's lagging in terms of freight trucks and buses. China has 1.2 million electric trucks and buses on its roads while the United States is just getting started.

So great news around the world on ground transportation. But what about the hard-to-abate sectors like maritime shipping? There's some great news there too. Did you know that 40% of bulk shipping that's crossing our oceans is coal, oil, and gas? And that's going to go away in the next few decades. In other words, all the fossil fuels we burn to move bulk cargo across the oceans are going to diminish naturally as we stop using fossil fuels. And that's not all. Another 15% of bulk is raw iron ore. Most of those ship loads are steaming to the same ports the coal ships are going to, where they're put into blast furnaces. As we decarbonize maritime shipping, the cost of fuel will go up a bit.

As we decarbonize raw steel, which I'll talk more about later, we're going to stop using coal for that and we're going to start using green electricity for it in a couple of different ways. That means we'll actually be able to process the raw iron ore into iron, or even steel products much closer to the mines, and ship just container loads of iron as opposed to bulks of iron ore.

While container shipping of processed and finished goods will increase, it won't increase as rapidly. We had a very rapid increase from 1980 to 2019, but a lot of that was due to the unprecedented speed of growth of China's manufacturing capabilities and delivering stuff to the west for our consumer economies. While India, Brazil, and Indonesia are growing, they don't have the conditions for success to grow as rapidly as China did. Their growth will be slower than China's, while still enviable to those in the west whose rapid growth periods are mostly behind us. They're going to be bringing their populations out of poverty, and as Jon said, leapfrogging, in most cases more slowly than China.

The combination is really good news as we move forward, but there's also more good news. We don't actually have to burn fuels in a lot of the ships. In my projection of maritime shipping through 2100, I looked at all inland, short sea, and deepwater shipping requirements, and I worked out the math on it. I unified the datasets because they're different segments in the way the shipping industry thinks of them, so they don't have a unified data set. And all the inland shipping, the stuff that goes up the Mississippi or the Yangtze, that can all electrify. Most short sea shipping, like in the Caribbean, for example, or between Norway and Germany or Denmark and Sweden, that can all electrify. These are routes that are just not that long.

But length of routes isn't really the point, it's the economics. A 2022 study that was published in Nature did the math and said, if we had batteries that cost $100 per kilowatt hour of capacity, for example a Tesla 60 kWh battery pack would cost $6,000, if we had that freight journeys of up to 1,500 kilometers, about 900 miles would be viable with batteries with virtually no loss of cargo capacity.

When we talk about batteries and ships, ships carry massive amounts of stuff, and they have lots of volume. Batteries don't take away that much space. $100 per kWh was breakeven for 1500 km, except that we're already below $100 now. This year CATL, which Jon mentioned a couple of times, are projecting that they're going to be selling their basic batteries for $56 per kilowatt hour this year. We're seeing very likely $30 per kilowatt hour, a third of that $100 breakeven point, in 2030. The transformation in this space is going to be tremendous.

Here's another proof point. Last year, a Chinese shipping organization launched two 700-container ships. They're not huge. The biggest container ships are 24,000 containers. But 700 containers is not something you put in your garage. This is 700 containers that are eight and a half feet tall, eight and a half feet wide, and 20 to 60 ft long. 700-container ships, two of them, they're traveling 1000 km -- that's 600 miles -- routes on the Yangtze with containerized batteries. They winch the battery container off and drop it on the transshipment port where it gets plugged in to recharge, and they winch a full battery back onto the ship. This is very easy to do. It's already being done.

That doesn't mean that we don't need some burnable fuels for crossing oceans, but we need a lot less than most people think. In my projections, I don't claim to be right, I merely claim to be less wrong. Take this as a projection that is likely from one individual. There are other projections which should also inform any strategic decision making you make.

But if my projection is accurate, we only need about 70 million tons of maritime diesel or equivalent to burn for all shipping in 2100. And per the International Energy Agency's renewables update from late last year, we already make 70 million tons of biodiesel, we just waste it on ground transportation, which as I shared, is all going to be electric.

So there's really good news. That means the carbon curve for shipping is going to plummet. Biofuels are becoming increasingly beneficial as we use them with waste biomass. I'll talk a bit more about that later.

But what about aviation? What can we do with aviation? It's another hard-to-abate segment.

COVID was proof that we don't have to fly as much as we do. We just like to fly. The recovery from COVID isn't finished, and it's not going to have the growth projections that it had in the past. Once again, the rate of global change of affluence between 1980 and 2019 was unprecedented. I don't expect it will continue as much.

There are several inhibitors on the growth of aviation. One of the key ones is simply that as we decarbonize aviation and we replace that with sustainable aviation biofuels, they're going to be more expensive than current fuels. The airline industry has 19% of their expenses as fuel. If that doubles or triples in price, those get added to tickets. It's a significant enough purchase for most people that it will reduce their likelihood of taking flights.

Further, high speed rail is growing globally. We're seeing enormous numbers of passenger miles being taken in China, where people have just said, why would I bother to fly when I can go downtown by subway, get on a train, get off a train without going through much security. A couple hours later and I'm in Beijing. It's just more convenient to take the train if the train is going 350 kilometers per hour. We're seeing a significant reduction in flight growth there.

There's more high speed rail in India, Indonesia, and even in Africa than there is in all of North America, which is quite remarkable to me. Europe has about 19,000 kilometers of high speed rail and is seeing a significant shift of passenger aviation, passenger movement to rail through policy and governments. France has made it a policy that if there's a rail line that goes between two cities, and under 2.5 hours, they're not going to allow flights between those places. Why would we support aviation between those when the train gets here fast enough?

The battery energy density that Jon was talking about, in terms of CATL's 500 watt-hours per kilogram. Many organizations thought we wouldn't see that till 2050, and we saw it in 2023. We're seeing much more rapid progress than most thought. Battery-electric drivetrains are vastly more efficient. They're 80% to 90% efficient versus 50% efficient for modern jets when the modern jets are at 38,000ft at optimum cruising speed.

Battery-electric is just as efficient on the tarmac when it's taxiing, when it's taking off, and when it's landing. We'll start with smaller airplanes. Battery energy density right now are sufficient for a hybrid drivetrain in a turboprop that would carry 100 passengers 600 km, with divert and reserve.

That we're not doing that already is in part because of certification to ensure safety, in part because the major OEMs in aviation have unfortunately had some really interesting times and are having trouble innovating. They can invent and they can do demonstrations, but the challenges that Boeing had recently with its major new airplane are indicative of a problem in the aviation industry that's going to go away.

Only about 110 million tons on top of the 70 million tons of diesel for maritime use is required at peak. We already make 100 million tons of biofuels, and we have a lot of waste biomass capacity, which I'll talk about a bit more.

Here's the CO2 projection. It goes down a lot. Contrails go down, the nitrous oxides go down, and agriculture and waste biomass derived fuels actually could arguably make aviation fuel carbon negative.

This is a positive story about aviation growing more slowly, but still growing, and decarbonizing much more rapidly than you might think. This is real zero, not net zero, in my projection. We don't get down to real zero in 2050, but we're close.

Singapore Airlines has Neste providing 1.5 million tons of sustainable aviation biofuels in Singapore for its operations today. There will be carriers who are actual zero by 2050 quite easily.

What about the minerals? Thank you to Visual Capitalist for the infographics. Over on the left, we have about 20 billion tons of fossil fuels between coal, oil, and gas that we extract, process, refine, and distribute, mostly to burn once. It's not reusable, there's no recyclability.

Despite discussions about carbon capture and carbon capture use, we can't reuse or recycle that much waste because 20 billion tons, when we burn them, turns into 40 to 60 billion tons of carbon dioxide. The entire global market for carbon dioxide today is 230 million tons, many orders of magnitude below that. About 90 million tons of that CO2 is used for enhanced oil recovery. Be skeptical every time somebody says we're going to capture carbon and sequester it as a way out of our dilemma.

On the right, here's some quantification of that question that was asked earlier. The industrial metals are 0.2 billion tons, three orders of magnitude below fossil fuels. Recyclable long term durable goods, aluminum, copper, chromium. Technology metals, which is to say the battery metals like lithium, is 0.002 billion tons.

It's a rounding error compared to the extraction of fossil fuels today. The range between those two is enormous. Yes, we have to double or triple our extraction of some of those metals, but it's from a very small base. Part of the reason our lithium shortage last year and the blip in battery prices disappeared was because firms just turned on more capacity.

There are a lot of minerals under the earth, and there's something else going on, material substitution. Material substitution says, I have a copper electricity wire. Well, I could have an aluminum wire instead. Most overhead wires that we see as we drive around actually have aluminum cores with steel for a bit of reinforcement.

Now we're seeing composite transmission lines and reconductoring. The composite cable has a carbon fiber core instead of a steel core, with annealed aluminum conductors around it. It's stronger and lighter than steel core transmission cables, doesn't sag as much when it heats and can tolerate higher heat. We can actually reconductor existing transmission lines with these new composites and put 30% or 40% more electricity through them quite easily.

We can build new transmission lines with the pylons further apart, and they're cheaper. So in the space of electrification, we have vast ability to substitute while in the space of fossil fuels, you can burn coal or you can burn liquid natural gas or you can burn crude oil, but you don't have much other substitutability there. Substitutability is a key message that gets missed in the materials discussion.

We're already recycling enormous percentages of metals. There's a disinformation meme out there saying we're only recycling 5% of batteries. That's the 5% of the batteries in my Apple Watch. When we come to EVs, where there are big batteries, we're already at 95% recycling of EV batteries, even at this nascent stage, because there's so much high quality, pure minerals in them in a single accessible ton.

The last lever is just reuse. Call it 80 kilograms of lithium in a battery in a Tesla Model 3. It operates for ten years and gets recharged thousands of times. It's just being used over and over again without being depleted at all, without creating CO2. Then, we will take a bunch of them out of the Model 3s at end of life and stack them all together and create a behind-the-meter battery storage facility for a light industrial site so that we don't have to increase transmission to it. We use it for another ten years until it's degraded to 70 or 80%, and then we mine those batteries and turn them into new batteries.

Michael Liebreich refers to this as one of the superheroes of the transition. As we get even more efficient at all these things, we get close to the point where we have a fully circular economy for battery minerals. The degree of disinformation in this is rife.

To pull a thread from the beginning, we don't have to replace the energy in 20 billion tons of fossil fuels, we have to replace the energy services because of all the waste that comes from those. Then we get over and over and over reuse, we get material substitution and we get recyclability. Our requirements for minerals are a tiny fraction of fossil fuels, and we'll just be using them more and more.

I promised a bit on biofuels. This is the chart from the International Energy Agency 2024 Renewables update. If you count it all up, we're already manufacturing 100 million tons of biofuels annually, and about 70 million tons of it is biodiesel. Between renewable and renewable diesel, there are different categories and ways to cut it. We're already bunkering biokerosene in jet aircraft and biodiesel in ships.

Here's a slightly stinky story. The EU has 1.4 billion tons of livestock dung waste a year now. Livestock dung, you think? One of the things you can do is turn it into kerosene for jets. It's an engineering problem and an economic question, not a scientifically difficult thing. It's just biomass. Every ton of dried biomass turns into about 0.4 tons of high quality biofuels. And so if you have 1.4 billion tons of livestock dung and say 50% of that mass is water you're down to 700 million tons. At 0.4 tons of biofuel per ton of dried biomass, that's 280 million tons of biofuels just from livestock done in Europe, which right now emits a lot of high global warming potential methane.

That's not the only waste stream. We also have 2.5 billion tons of food waste. That's a full third of the calories we manufacture every year globally. We throw it in landfills. There is no caloric poverty, there is a distribution problem when it comes to calories. There is no ""biofuels competing with calories for people"" problem except in micro local places. We're wasting vast amounts of biomass, which frequently turns into methane, and we have to fix that. Part of the fix is turning it into the relatively small numbers of biofuels we require for long haul aviation and shipping when we electrify everything we can.

But what about heating? I'd like to draw your attention down to the bottom left corner of the sexy versus meh, practical versus foolish quadrant chart. I did a series of these charts across multiple decarbonization dimensions, and I've iterated them couple of times. Just look at all the technologies in the practical and meh quadrant.

Heat pumps, they're amazing. 45% of industrial heat is under 200° Celsius. We have heat pumps that can deliver 200° Celsius heat.

Induction stoves are better to cook with than gas innumerable ways, and they're all over much of the rest of the world. I was doing a digital nomad spell in New Zealand last year for a few weeks, doing a speaking tour about transformation of radical electrification of transportation and other things. Every unit we stayed in had an induction stove. It's just common across Asia. Electrode boilers, electric arc furnaces. I'll talk a bit more about the up to 3,000° Celsius heat used in electric arc furnaces for scrapping steel. We have all the heating solutions we need. District heating is huge. Combined heat and power with biomass, as long as it's combined heat and power, I'm somewhat okay with it, but I'm considering moving it over to the foolish quadrant.

Electric plasmas are now up to the temperature of the sun and are used for certain classes of ceramics that are fascinating. Electromagnetic frequency, like microwaves. Industrial microwaves are there. And yes, insulation. Insulation helps too.

We also have the emerging area of heat storage. It's not a slam dunk, it's a bit overhyped in some ways. It's too much into the sexy and foolish space, especially when it talks about being used for storing electricity and then retrieving electricity, that's a very inefficient pathway for electrical storage. But when we talk about industrial heat, where we have one process which creates heat, and a process a few hours later which needs heat just because of the mechanisms, heat storage makes sense. Heat storage makes sense even down at the domestic level. I spent time with Harvest Thermal's CEO, and they've built a hot water heater that's a CO2-based heat pump that puts hot water into a big tank of water and then uses that for domestic heating and domestic cooling. California innovation and now being applied to mobile unit residential buildings in Brooklyn and elsewhere.

One of the things I did is a broad view of steel. I looked across all the existing steel, the growth of steel since 1990 over here, and that rapid ramp-up when China was building absurd amounts of infrastructure. Here's a data point for Americans. At the beginning of 1988, China did not have a highway. Now it has 177,000 kilometers of highways, second only to the United States in length of highways. The United States has, I think, 350,000 km. That's part of China's massive infrastructure buildup.

In 2007, they didn't have high speed rail anywhere. Now they have 45,000 km of high speed rail, they've built cities, they built highways, they built railroads, they built bridges, they built enormous amounts of stuff, and that's what that curve is. But they're at the end of that curve. Their domestic demand for infrastructure is now tailing off. They've built enough infrastructure for their entire economy and their entire population, and now they're replacing things like the worst coal plants that they built with hyper critical coal plants.

On that note, by the way, coal is projected to peak in China this year. Gasoline was peak last year in China, per the head of Sinopec, the biggest gasoline refiner and retailer in China. And as Fatih Birol has pointed out, the International Energy Agency says peak fossil fuels is this decade. After this, the decline.

For steelmaking, we already make 100 million tons with direct reduction of iron. That's basically taking a synthetic gas and mixing it with a high temperature process with raw iron ore and derusting it, turning rusty iron ore into unrusted iron. We put that into steel manufacturing facilities.

The nice thing about DRI, that synthetic gas currently comes from methane from coal or natural gas. We can use biomethane instead. We also have, and I've looked at and done the math on the HyBrit green steel solution and H2Green Steel solution, northern European green hydrogen reduction of iron ore to create iron, to create steel. I've also looked at the Boston metal solution and the Fortescue solution, which used electrolysis and no hydrogen at all to turn any grade of iron ore into iron, and then hence steel.

There's another piece, the EAF piece here. EAF is electric arc furnaces, electric steel mini-mills. This is a place where the United States has been leading globally for a long time. This is a place where the United States can definitely pat itself on the back. 70% of US steel demand is met from steel from electric arc furnaces. Comparably, Europe is only 40%. That means they're not scrapping their steel and making new steel with it. They're making new steel from iron ore for their steel demands.

The optimum is probably about 75%. That electric arc furnace 1500° to 3000° Celsius heat can be powered by renewable electricity and increasingly is, so great news there.

Once again, a plummeting carbon dioxide emissions from steel. In the coming decades, we'll see a flattening of demand, we'll see much more scrapping, especially of fossil fuel infrastructure, like the 912 very large crude carriers floating around the world, or the 3 million miles of pipeline of fossil fuel pipelines in the United States. I like to think of them as linear mines that are buried 6ft deep. And so they'll stop being needed because HVDC is the new pipeline. Why do we need pipelines when we have electrons? We're going to be starting to see much more scrapping and much more low carbon production with DRI of multiple types.

Steel is actually a solvable problem with technologies we have in hand. It's an economic and transformation and capital question, not a technological one. This might be a bit optimistic, but it's entirely doable.

A bit on agriculture. This is another DALL-E generated image I put together for my India discussions. Agriculture is a major climate problem. Green ammonia made from green hydrogen is a big part of the climate solution, but drone-based agriculture is also a big part of it.

We're already doing drone seeding across large farm areas. We're seeing Hylio, out of the United States, with 200 pounds of product being applied from a single 14-foot-diameter wingspan hexacopter and two of those units with all the base station and everything costing about 200 grand. A tractor from Jon Deere, which can do the same spraying per day and compacts the soil when used, is about $700,000 to buy. The tractor burns about 13 gallons of diesel an hour. Drones sip at electricity.

Drone-based agriculture is an amazing transformation. We're seeing crop dusting replaced with electrically powered drones. We're seeing aerial surveillance and oversight for data gathering, for precision agriculture, replaced with drones with sensor packages. We're seeing that all integrating in online platforms powered by machine learning. It's a tremendous area of growth and a tremendous area of decarbonization.

And once again, agricultural waste. When we divert that into biofuels, it doesn't turn into methane and it stops being a greenhouse gas problem.

We don't have an arable land problem. What we have is a lack of most effective automation for industrialized agriculture. We need to move subsistence farmers off the land. This is all solvable. It's all occurring just because of demographic trends. The rural areas globally are diminishing in population. Cities are burgeoning. Automation is occurring.

This is a heterodox projection on hydrogen through 2100. The thing that doesn't get told often enough in the hydrogen story is that right now it's a climate change problem on the scale of all of aviation, about 1.5 billion tons of carbon dioxide and equivalent per year from manufacturing hydrogen. There's a really good news story about how we're going to solve that problem.

Part of it is a full third of that is being used in refineries to make gasoline, diesel, and kerosene for jets. And guess what? Well, that's going away. We're not going to be eliminating refining fossil fuels because we still need petrochemicals. But we're not going to be taking Alberta's crude out of the ground and spending lots of hydrogen on it to turn it into diesel for tractors or gasoline for cars. The use cases are going down. As we decarbonize hydrogen, it will be more expensive, so the petroleum we extract will be the lighter, lower sulfur crudes which don't need as much hydrogen.

Next is fertilizer. A full quarter of hydrogen today is used for ammonia and that comes from natural gas or coal. When we make that into green hydrogen, it's more expensive. But with precision agriculture we reduce the requirement for fertilizer for the same crop yields. Biogenetic solutions, like Pivot Bio out of the United States, turn off the nitrogen sensor in microbes that exist around plant roots anyway so they keep fixing nitrogen regardless of how much fertilizer we add. Normally, if there's enough nitrogen, they say, I'm just going to get fat, happy, and multiply. Instead, they just keep making more nitrogen at the root of plants where it's needed. Pivot Bio already has over a million acres of corn in the United States under use with their product and are seeing a 25% reduction in fertilizer.

Hydrogen is going to stop being a problem, but it isn't a transportation or energy solution. To be really clear, this is a case where electrification is being proven so effective and so efficient there are very few use cases left and every one proposed keeps falling off.

I have ten minutes or so for questions, so let's talk.

Host Question: Michael, thank you so much. Just like with Jon, your presentation was riveting and my head is spinning. You did a wonderful job of outlining the market factors that are driving these enabling technologies and creating transformation. So thank you so much for that. So many good details. I have one question and then I know Mike has a question for you as well. So let's see if we can get to both of those in the few minutes that we have left. You had mentioned that you don't think that carbon capture is feasible. And I certainly understand that because we're talking about technologies at scale that are very expensive. And you clearly outlined that there are better ways to phase out highly emitting products, production, things like steel. And we all know concrete's in there as well, looking at solutions that inherently reduce carbon emissions.

But I am curious to hear a little bit more about why you think that carbon capture at scale is not feasible and that you don't believe the hype.

Answer: Let's be clear about what I assert about carbon capture and sequestration. It's entirely possible to capture carbon dioxide. We've been doing it in industrial processes for 150 years. The Solvay process, which makes the baking soda we put in our fridges to keep them odor-free, that captures CO2 in one part of the process, to use it in the next step in a process. We know how to do this, and we've been doing it at industrial scales for a long time.

Similarly, we've been shoving carbon dioxide underground for decades as well, in enhanced oil recovery, and we've been putting it in pipelines for that purpose as well. None of this is technically non-viable. There are significant problems of economics and alternatives. It gets really expensive really fast and there are alternatives.

Boundary Dam in Saskatchewan tried to plug carbon capture onto its coal plant in order to use it for enhanced oil recovery to get some economic benefit out of it. And they, at the end of the project, said we're never going to do this again because it's too expensive and it's a waste of time. This is a coal plant that wants to persist, and enhanced oil recovery that wants to persist. They said, this is just economic suicide.

Similarly, as we look around the world, the places where you can put carbon dioxide in high volumes are rarely near where the carbon dioxide is created. A cement plant has to be near to the market for cement because cement is a really heavy substance. You want to minimize the transportation of it. But cement plants aren't near great places for carbon capture and sequestration -- under the North Sea in Europe, for example. You have to build massive CO2 pipelines.

Satartia, Mississippi, is a cautionary tale for CO2 pipelines. It's a tiny town, population 41, halfway up Mississippi on the western side. A CO2 pipeline that's used for enhanced oil recovery in the region had dense phase CO2 in it, which means it was compressed and liquefied. The pipeline sheared because of a landslide because of excess rain. That dense phase CO2 turned into 590 times the volume of gaseous CO2. CO2 is heavier than air.

It rolled downhill in a thick blanket into Satartia a mile away across a highway, put 46 people into convulsions, unconscious on the ground, and caused the evacuation of over 200 people. 46 people were hospitalized for observations and probably have some significant ongoing health challenges. Internal combustion, emergency vehicles, and evacuation vehicles didn't work because they need air too.

Any significant growth of carbon capture sequestration would require significant numbers of CO2 pipelines through heavily populated areas in North America and Europe in order to get the CO2 from where it's being created to where it needs to be sequestered. The safety concerns are not a policy discussion right now and must be.

This doesn't mean we won't use carbon capture and sequestration. You mentioned cement. Once we electrify everything else in a cement plant, when we bake the limestone to turn it into quicklime, that chemical process releases a lot of carbon dioxide, but it's almost pure, easy to capture. We still need to do something, but even there, that's much more expensive than today, because they just use the atmosphere as an open sewer today. In the future, what alternatives exist and will they be cost competitive?

My assertion is, in many cases, alternatives to carbon capture will be cost competitive, and so we will use electrochemistry and other solutions instead of traditional solutions bolting on carbon capture.",cleantechnica.com,news,CleanTechnica,Michael Barnard,0.3411764705882352,452717399,52,https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Screenshot-2024-05-06-at-7.17.29 AM-800x452.png,

And perhaps you are also familiar with the famous idea that this is due to a misplaced comma in a work on the amounts of this nutrient in vegetables published in 1870 by Emil Wolff.

Curiously, Popeye was created because of that erroneous belief and contributed to an increase in spinach consumption by a third in the US. They are myths upon myths, proof that sometimes what we have known ""all our lives"" He stands on feet of clay.

Wolff's study, which was accepted as good until the 1930s, contained an error in a table, but this affected equally all the foods whose nutritional value was reported. Thus, the history of the decimal point is a simplification from 1981 that reinterprets other errors when dealing with a few data.

For his part, Popeye did not start eating spinach until 1932, three years after the comic's creation. But not because of iron but because of vitamin A, the same one that was later used - this time deliberately - in the carrot myth.

By then, spinach consumption had already increased because the iron fallacy had become popular, although many children continued to ""suffer"" from a diet rich in spinach thanks to the recommendations of the strict vegetarian sailor.

Another example of a rocky decision based on tenuous data concerns a belief that has an entire industry regulated by law: that frozen foods should be kept at -18°C or colder.

Why precisely this temperature? It would be expected that, as a result of scientific studies or experience in the sector. After all, if this were not the case and a few degrees up or down mattered little, why is it set so rigidly?

First of all, Microbiology tells us that the microorganisms that spoil food stop their growth when cold. But as was demonstrated years ago, keeping products at -12 °C is enough for bacterial growth and activity to stop.

Another scientific discipline, nutrition, explains that some vitamins remain stable at -18 °C for a year, but others can degrade significantly even at -60 °C after a few months without a few degrees above or below changing much. the result.

So, why was the temperature of -18 °C chosen as a reference to achieve the necessary food safety? According to a recent study signed by the director general of the International Institute of Refrigeration (an independent intergovernmental organization that gathers scientific and technical evidence on cooling) and five co-authors, it seems that it was selected in the mid-20th century because within the temperatures considered safe it corresponds precisely at 0 degrees Fahrenheit.

So it would have been a case of easy-to-remember rounding. Engineers would have picked up the gauntlet, routinely designing equipment and processes based on that mythical 0°F temperature, and legislation would have done the rest.

However, if we introduce Ecology into our narrative, we could consider that refrigeration implies heating the sink to which the removed heat goes, which is the environment, as well as consuming energy resources to do so. Although Engineering constantly increases the efficiency of equipment, there are insurmountable physical limits.

All energy consumption translates into an impact on the environment that, today, can very frequently be measured in carbon footprint. But what if it didn't need to cool so much? Would it be possible to keep frozen foods safely at a higher temperature and, in the process, reduce energy consumption? The answer seems to be yes, and it is proposed that it be with the reference of -15 °C so that, in the event of a problem, it takes time to reach the still safe (microbiologically) limit of -12 °C.

The aforementioned report shows that this simple measure would mean almost a 5% reduction in what is consumed to maintain the cold chain at the current temperature. We would save 25 terawatt hours (TWh) per year (one terawatt hour is equivalent to the annual electricity consumption of 150,000 people living in the EU), equivalent to 10 million tons (Mt) of greenhouse gases, or what three million emit of cars, as many as circulate in all of Denmark. It would, therefore, be another reasonable step on the path that takes us in the direction of reducing the human footprint on the environment.

Living sustainably costs, but it will cost more to do so in an unsustainable way. The more the different branches of science help each other to dismantle legends, the sooner we will achieve the objectives of sustainable development that are more necessary than ever.

8113754803,eng,False,2024-05-06,12:10:38,2024-05-06T12:10:38Z,2024-05-06T12:10:14Z,news,0.6941176652908325,https://www.popsci.com/environment/ocean-power-scotland/,Testing the waters: Scotland surges ahead on ocean Power,"By quirk of geography, the Orkney islands, located off the northern tip of Scotland, are unusually well positioned to bear witness to the ocean's might. On the archipelago's western shores, waves crash relentlessly against the rocks. And within its numerous channels, the tides push an enormous volume of water from the North Atlantic to the North Sea and back again, twice every day, squeezing between and around the islands of Rousay, Westray, Eday, and a myriad of other ones.

No wonder the European Marine Energy Center, one of the world's leading agencies for developing and testing wave and tidal power technologies, chose to set up shop here; the nonprofit agency hosts both wave and tidal power testing facilities on Orkney.

EMEC's wave-energy testing site is at Billia Croo, located on the western shore of Orkney's largest island. On a relatively calm day last spring, Lisa MacKenzie, EMEC's marketing and communications manager, surveyed the gray waters from the Billia Croo site. ""We get an average of 2-to-3-meter wave height,"" she said, or roughly 6.5 to 10 feet. ""But we've had waves of over 20 meters"" -- more than 65 feet -- during ""really extreme conditions over the winter.""

The surrounding landscape is windswept and nearly treeless. Were one to sail directly west from this spot, ""the first bit of land that you would hit is Canada,"" MacKenzie said.

EMEC was founded in 2003 following a recommendation by the U.K. House of Commons Science and Technology Committee (now known as the Science, Innovation, and Technology Committee). To date it has received about $53 million in public investment; its funders include the European Union, the U.K. government, the Scottish government, and the Orkney Islands Council. More than 20 corporate clients have used EMEC's facilities, and more ocean energy converters have been tested at the center than at any other site in the world.

The Billia Croo facility opened in 2004 on land rented from a local farmer. An array of transformers, housed in green bins each the size of a compact car, lines the perimeter of the site's small parking lot. A modest stone-wall hut, which blends into the landscape, houses the facility's control center and is filled electronic switching equipment. The testing berths are offshore, where EMEC's clients can test all manner of wave-energy conversion devices, with cables running along the seabed to the control hut. Any electricity produced can also be fed directly into the U.K. national grid.

Waves, like the wind that produces them, are not a constant; both are inherently variable. And they are linked: Wind imparts energy to the ocean, which then dissipates as waves over a longer time scale. As MacKenzie puts it, waves are the aftermath of wind.

Harnessing the energy of waves is one way to draw power from the oceans; another is to exploit the energy of the tides. Of the two energy sources, tidal is more constant, given the tides' regular-as-clockwork response to the push and pull of the moon and sun.

EMEC runs a grid-connected tidal energy test facility located off the southern tip of Eday. ""We get a peak tidal flow over 4 meters per second, which is about 8 knots,"" MacKenzie said. ""So about half a billion tons of water passes through there, every hour, at peak tide.""

And that flow is comparatively predictable -- far more so than, say, wind or solar, which are stymied by calm or cloudy conditions. ""We can predict the tides 200 years into the future,"" MacKenzie said. ""Which means that we can predict how much power can be derived from the tides, 200 years into the future.""

There is no question that the planet's oceans contain enormous amounts of energy. According to a 2021 study published in Proceedings of the Royal Society A, tidal stream energy alone could provide the equivalent of 11 percent of the U.K.'s annual electricity needs. Power from the oceans is ""the largest untapped resource of renewable energy on the planet right now,"" said Rémi Gruet, CEO of Ocean Energy Europe, the world's largest network of ocean energy professionals.

The question is, can that energy be harnessed economically -- or is the idea of pulling watts from the water doomed to be a mere sideshow in the quest for green energy? After decades of testing at tidal energy facilities like EMEC and other smaller-scale facilities around the globe, only a handful of commercial wave and tidal power facilities are online, and they contribute a miniscule amount to the world's energy production. Even in Orkney, a leader in the quest to extract energy from the ocean, wave and tidal power account for just a fraction of the islands' energy consumption.

Notably, wave and tidal lag behind other forms of renewable energy. ""It's fair to say that we're nowhere near a wind or solar industry at this point,"" says Carrie Schmaus, a marine energy technology manager at the U.S. Department of Energy's Water Power Technologies Office.

Still, for the technology's supporters, the ocean is seen as a virtually limitless source of energy waiting to be tapped, if only governments step up with the public investment needed to kick the industry into high gear. ""There's an energy resource there,"" says Andrew Scott, CEO of Edinburgh-based Orbital Marine Power Ltd. ""The question is, what are you prepared to pay to extract that energy?""

On paper, the power of the world's oceans is indisputable: Tidal stream energy is estimated to represent a global resource of some 1,200 terawatt-hours (a terawatt is one trillion watts) per year, while wave power is even more abundant, adding up to almost 30,000 terawatt-hours per year -- enough, in theory, to meet all of humanity's energy needs 10 times over.

As promising as tidal and wave energy may seem, the list of obstacles to widespread adoption is significant: the formidable cost of scaling up the technology; bureaucratic hurdles; environmental concerns, including possible effects on fish and sea mammals; and, in the case of tidal power, geographical restrictions. There are also fears that rising sea levels could substantially alter ocean movements in a way that could impact current or planned tidal power facilities. In a 2022 paper published in the journal Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, Danial Khojasteh and his co-authors noted that ""long-term management decisions associated with harnessing the potential of tidal energy schemes within estuaries should be made with caution.""

The question of cost is paramount. Even though the cost of tidal and wave energy may be dropping, the cost of wind and solar are dropping even faster, said Brian Polagye, a University of Washington mechanical engineer who studies marine renewable energy. That means tidal and wave energy can be seen as succeeding and failing at the same time.

""Until your price comes down to the point where you're competitive with other forms of generation -- either because you're directly competitive, or you're being subsidized until you get to that point -- the technologies really can't take off,"" Polagye said. Nonetheless, he added, ""I do feel these are technologies that have a long-term role to play in our energy systems.""

Schmaus, at the Water Power Technologies Office, describes wave and tidal power as a nascent industry (as did others interviewed for this story). By way of comparison, she pointed out that in the early days of the wind power industry, all manner of turbine designs were tested. ""And then at some point that technology converged,"" she said. ""Now we have the three-bladed turbine we all know and love. Marine energy is still in that ideation kind of area. We have not had technology convergence yet.""

One of her department's goals, she says, is to learn from small-scale demonstration projects, scale up designs, and bring down costs. This scaling-up is just what Scott's Orbital Marine is trying to achieve in Orkney. They're the company behind the O2 tidal stream energy generator -- the world's most powerful such device -- located in the Fall of Warness, south of Eday, and connected to the grid via EMEC's tidal energy test site. (MacKenzie described the project as ""one of our biggest success stories."") The O2 is a 240-foot-long structure shaped like a submarine (though it stays on the surface), with two submerged arms, each supporting a twin-bladed turbine. In an interview in a cavernous exhibition hall at the annual All-Energy conference in Glasgow last spring, and later by email, Scott spoke of his vision for the company, and the potential of tidal stream power. He said that Orbital Marine hopes to add another six turbines to the Fall of Warness site over the next few years, and, in time, perhaps another dozen.

Scott acknowledges the forbidding technical challenges -- especially the difficulty of designing machinery that can withstand seawater's salt and grime for months or years on end. And he has seen his share of unrealistic proposals over the years. At times ""it was a bit of a joke,"" he recalled. People saw how much traction wind energy was getting, he says, and figured wind's success could be readily duplicated beneath the waves.

""People would say, 'Just go and 'marinize' it, and it will be equally successful in the tidal application,"" he continued. ""It was as naïve as that.""

But many of those early challenges have been overcome, Scott said. He noted that O2 is currently providing about 10 percent of Orkney's electricity, enough to power about 2,000 homes. Because the islands are sparsely populated, and rich in wind energy, Orkney actually produces more energy than is needed locally, which means the islands are already a net contributor to the U.K. grid -- and some of that energy comes from O2. Scott said he foresees Orbital Marine generating about $17.5 million from electricity sales per year, over the turbine array's projected 20-year life. ""We're effectively at that critical stage where we start to grow commercial revenues and profits,"" Scott said.

Of course, most parts of the world are not blessed with Orkney's extreme tidal flows. ""It is niche,"" Scott acknowledged. ""But where it does exist, it represents a phenomenally dense form of renewable energy. Because water is 800 times the density of air.""

While some regions have more powerful tides than others, waves can be found pretty much everywhere that ocean meets land. During a visit to the FloWave Ocean Energy Research Facility on the campus of the University of Edinburgh, a crew from a company called Mocean Energy tested a floating wave-energy converter in a massive circular water tank, some 80 feet across. Paddles along the perimeter of the tank create waves that strive to mimic the conditions of the open seas.

So far, there's no one preferred way to extract energy from waves -- just as there's no one preferred way to build a tidal stream turbine -- so various designs are being tested. The one Mocean was testing uses a simple electrical generator to convert the kinetic energy of the waves into electricity. As Mocean's converter bobbed in response to the waves, Chris Retzler, the company's technical director and co-founder, spoke of the path to commercialization, saying he hoped to have a product on the market in 12 to 18 months, and ""a much larger-scale, grid-connected machine"" in three to four years.

For now, both wave energy and tidal energy lag behind wind in terms of investment and commercialization, but the gap may be closing, Retzler said. ""The wind industry, of course, has been phenomenally successful -- but it started in much the same way, with small-scale experimentation, gradually building up,"" he says. ""And we're following a similar pattern here. We learn by doing.""

Retzler also noted that there is a natural symbiosis between wave energy, with its long-term dependability, and wind and solar, which have much greater hour-to-hour and day-to day fluctuations. ""The ocean is storing wind energy over time,"" he said. ""Waves take a while to build up, and then a long while to decay. That smooths out the production of energy. So wave energy can provide a more stable contribution, and therefore can fill in the gaps that are left by wind and solar.""

The United States has not traditionally been a big player in ocean power technologies, though that may be changing. An established testing facility known as PacWave North, located off the coast of Oregon, will soon be joined by PacWave South, a larger facility now under construction in deeper waters south of Newport. PacWave, funded by the Department of Energy, the State of Oregon, and other public and private entities, bills itself as the first pre-permitted, utility-scale, grid-connected, open-water test facility in the U.S.

Burke Hales, an oceanographer at Oregon State University and PacWave's chief scientist, describes PacWave as conceptually similar to Scotland's EMEC, which was one of PacWave's design partners. ""PacWave will be bigger, [with] more total power capability, more berths, more individual devices,"" he says. Hales cites figures from the Department of Energy that suggest wave power could meet 15 percent of the nation's electricity demand.

While the Oregon coast is synonymous with pounding waves, other locations may be better suited to small-scale projects that take advantage of the local geography. For example, in the village of Igiugig, in southwestern Alaska, there's a demonstration project that draws energy from the estuary of the Kvichak River, via underwater turbines. That's seen as a vast improvement on the current situation, in which the community trucks in diesel fuel at great cost.

And other U.S. projects may be on the horizon. In 2022, the Department of Energy pledged $35 million in funding ""to advance tidal and river current energy systems"" in a move that represents the largest such investment in the nation.

Back in Orkney, a company called SAE Renewables announced last winter that they'd hit the milestone of producing 50 gigawatt-hours of electricity with their tidal stream array in the Pentland Firth, the strait that separates Orkney from the Scottish mainland. Further north, in Shetland, Nova Innovation added a sixth turbine to its tidal array last year, which has been powering homes and businesses in the area since 2016.

Across Europe, some 2.2 megawatts of tidal stream capacity were added in 2021, up from just 260 kilowatts the year before. By comparison, Europe installed more than 17 gigawatts of wind power capacity in 2021 (87 percent of them on-shore). By 2022, wind accounted for well over a third of Europe's energy consumption.

Tidal stream and wave power are not the only ways to extract energy from the oceans. In estuaries or bays with high tides, tidal barrages are another option, a practice dating back as far as 619 A.D. The idea is simple: Find an inlet with significant tides, and build a barrier with sluices that can open and close (similar to a traditional hydroelectric dam). Open the valves as the tide comes in, then direct the water through turbines as the tide goes out. So far, tidal barrages have historically seen more commercial use than tidal stream projects, notably in France (the world's first commercial tidal power project, on the estuary of the Rance River, dates from 1966), and in South Korea.

As with tidal stream power, tidal barrages could be a natural fit in specific environments. For example, as low-lying countries like the Netherlands and Belgium look to build dikes and barriers to protect against rising ocean levels, tidal barrage generators may be a natural addition to already-planned projects. There is concern, however that tidal barrages can impact salinity and sediment levels and disrupt coastal ecology.

Interestingly, the spot with the world's highest tides -- the Bay of Fundy, which separates the Canadian provinces of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia -- has also seen the most disappointment. The volume of water that whooshes through the bay twice each day could, on paper, generate up to 2,500 megawatts of power -- roughly equivalent to two large nuclear reactors, enough to meet Nova Scotia's electricity needs.

But efforts to harness those tides have been fraught. A tidal barrage power station opened on the bay in 1984, but ceased operations in 2019 following technical problems and concern over harm to fish in the bay. Tidal stream projects have been attempted in the bay as well, but have likewise struggled. Last year, a company called Sustainable Marine Energy Canada pulled the plug on its floating tidal turbine platform in the bay after five years of testing and $45 million in investment, citing bureaucratic barriers put in its way by the Canadian government. The company declared voluntary bankruptcy last spring, and in November one of its floating turbine platforms broke free from its mooring and ran aground on the bay's south shore.

One thing industry insiders agree on is that, for all forms of wave and tidal energy, the path to commercialization requires significant public investment. A 2019 study pegged the cost of tidal energy for one commercial-scale project at $130 to $280 per megawatt-hour, compared to $20 to around $40 per megawatt-hour for wind. But according to Scott at Orbital Marine, it's misleading to speak of tidal power as being expensive and wind and solar as being cheaper, because so much more investment has been pumped into the latter compared to the former. The green energy sector ""has all this legacy background in terms of state intervention and subsidy,"" he said. ""And the whole thing is structured around taxation and subsidy.""

The path to commercialization for ocean energy projects can seem like a paradox, said Polagye. ""Economies of scale occur because you're building a lot of things,"" and ""you tend to build a lot of things because they're the most cost-effective thing to build,"" he said. ""So it's a chicken and egg problem, right?""

Gruet similarly sees the supposed lagging-behind of wave and tidal power as the result of a lack of public investment. ""The industry has not received any subsidies in any shape or form in a similar way that the wind or solar industry have received in the early stage of their development,"" he said. ""And that has slowed down our development tremendously.""

He added that the cost of tidally generated power is already on par with that for floating offshore wind platforms. ""So tidal and wave are not lagging behind,"" he said. ""It took the wind industry 20 years to get commercial and 40 years to get cheap, between the 1980s and today, so we are still well ahead of the curve.""

For EMEC's MacKenzie, the latent energy of the world's oceans represents a chance for her own country to make up for past mistakes in the race for renewables. She recalled an incident in 1987, when the U.K. secretary of state for energy, Cecil Parkinson, spoke in the House of Commons about the potential of wind power. Sure, it was a good idea in principle, he said, but he ""cannot see the day when we shall be generating large quantities of electricity from wind.""

The U.K. hesitated -- and Denmark jumped in. ""Denmark absolutely won that race,"" MacKenzie says. ""And this is what we're really keen to make sure doesn't happen with wave and tidal."" (Today, wind power provides about one third of the U.K.'s electricity production. About 40 percent comes from coal, oil, and natural gas, while nuclear power and bioenergy provide about 15 percent and 11 percent respectively.)

For Scott, the power latent in the world's oceans is an important resource in the fight against catastrophic climate change, even if its total contribution remains small compared to that of other renewables. ""Inaction is not an option,"" he says.",popsci.com,news,Popular Science,,0.01960784313725483,452693438,31,https://www.popsci.com/uploads/2024/05/30/Orbital-02-generating-at-EMEC-Credit-Orbital-Marine-Power_2000.jpg?auto=webp,eng-9543845

Thanks to a docking mechanism, its sensors, and artificial intelligence system, the drone can recognize a power line every time it needs to recharge its batteries, approaching the high-voltage cable, and clinging to it from below, sucking electricity like some kind of electric vampire.

""The drones would be able to essentially live on the grid and operate completely autonomously for extended periods of time with no need for human interaction,"" the development team explained over email.

The concept of using power lines to charge drones originated in 2017, when Emad Ebeid -- a professor at University of Southern Denmark (SDU) -- was exploring drone applications and found power line inspection to be an area of interest. According to the drone developers, Ebeid noted that the current inspection process, which relied on helicopters and ground personnel, was both costly and inefficient. He thought of drones as the natural alternative to this very expensive maintenance effort. These flying machines can be remotely controlled or even fly autonomously to watch over the lines.

There was only one problem: Drones have very limited battery life -- a maximum of 40 minutes, with most industrial-level models dropping off at around 30 minutes of run time.

The Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) last month certified the case, which alleges that Italy's Prysmian, France's Nexans, and Denmark's NKT overcharged British consumers.

The ruling was published on 3 May, setting the stage for a trial that seeks damages on behalf of about 30 million consumers in Britain.

The lawsuit is led by Clare Mary Joan Spottiswoode, the former head of Britain's gas regulator.

It stems from the European Commission's 2014 decision, which found that Prysmian, Nexans, NKT, and other companies were involved in a decade-long power cable cartel.

The legal team representing the consumers contends that the inflated costs for cables were ultimately borne by the end-users, a claim the defendants contest.

While the defendants' lawyers did not object to the certification of Spottiswoode's case, they expressed concerns regarding the distribution of any potential damages.

The CAT has stipulated that the case's certification is contingent upon the claimants' lawyers presenting a more detailed plan for the allocation of damages to the affected consumers.

The lawsuit, which includes interest, could amount to as much as £790m. The case is now set to advance towards a comprehensive hearing, although it is not expected to commence until late 2025 at the earliest.

Representatives from Nexans and NKT are yet to issue a statement regarding the tribunal's decision. Similarly, Prysmian has not responded to requests for comment on the matter.

Spottiswoode was quoted by Reuters as saying: ""This is an important legal milestone toward the claim's goal of achieving justice for the millions of UK electricity customers who suffered from the damaging anticompetitive behaviour of corporates at the top of the supply chain.""

The Iberdrola group, a leading Spanish multinational electric utility company, inaugurated the plant, Europe's largest, in 2022. With around 1.5 million solar panels imported from China, the plant's clean energy output is substantial, catering to the needs of 334,000 households and creating over 1,500 jobs.

As exemplified by the Spanish PV plant, China's rapid progress in the renewable energy sector has played a pivotal role in advancing the European Union's (EU) green transition.

WIN-WIN GREEN COOPERATION

The European Green Deal, launched by the European Commission in 2019, targets net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. To achieve this, the EU has pledged to increase the binding renewable energy share to at least 42.5 percent by 2030. However, with the current renewable energy share at approximately 23 percent, innovation is urgently needed.

Walburga Hemetsberger, CEO of SolarPower Europe, an association for the European solar PV sector, has warned that Europe must ramp up its solar deployment to meet the necessary targets, while WindEurope, a major wind energy association, also stressed the need for immediate action.

China's green energy equipment manufacturing industry is well-established and competitive. Chinese solar products and wind turbines would be indispensible for EU to achieve its 2030 emission reduction targets, said Qin Yan, a lead analyst at Refinitiv and researcher at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies.

In fact, many European countries have reaped the benefits of green energy collaboration with China in recent years.

Pedro Amaral Jorge, president of the Portuguese Renewable Energy Association, highlighted the growing cooperation between China and Portugal in the solar energy sector, as Portugal aims to install approximately 8 gigawatts (GW) of solar power by 2026 or 2027 and reach 22 GW by 2030.

""To achieve the objectives set for increasing installed capacity, cooperation with China must increase,"" Jorge told Xinhua in an interview.

In Croatia, the Chinese-built Senj Wind Farm, inaugurated in December 2021, produces about 530 million kilowatt-hours (kWh) of green electricity each year and reduces Croatia's carbon dioxide emissions by about 460,000 tonnes per year.

""These are projects where the benefit of cooperation with large countries like China, which have the knowledge and potential to realize such large projects, can be seen,"" said Mladen Plese, Croatian political analyst and Asia expert, in an interview with Xinhua.

For Zlatko Prpic, chief engineer of the Senj Wind Farm, the project, the largest of its kind in Croatia so far, represents a ""miracle"" and a shining example of China-Croatia cooperation.

China's Norinco International, a civil engineering company, has been the main contractor and builder of the farm.

As Croatia and the EU ramp up their transition to green and renewable energy, it presents a significant opportunity for Norinco International and other Chinese firms to demonstrate their cutting-edge technology and equipment in large-scale projects, Prpic said.

BRIGHT PROSPECTS FOR COOPERATION

The United Nations has urged countries to accelerate the transition to an affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy system by investing in renewable energy resources, prioritizing energy efficient practices, and adopting clean energy technologies and infrastructure.

In the global drive towards a greener future, China assumes a pivotal role in facilitating the transition for both developed and developing nations, experts said.

""The future of Europe and the world hinges on them,"" said Plese, underlining the necessity for a united front transcending borders and political affiliations in combating climate change.

""China is developing technology and we need the cooperation of Chinese companies in that area as well,"" he said. ""Croatia has the potential for similar green energy projects and cooperation with China is still welcome.""

The 2021 report from the China Chamber of Commerce to the EU highlighted the impressive growth of China's PV cells and modules industry over the past decade. With affordable prices and significant economies of scale, Chinese enterprises emerge as the prime choice to complement the EU industrial chain, meeting the region's escalating demand for PV products.

The project involves the installation of 5,400 solar panels on the building's 10,000-square-meter steel roof. Under the Belgian regulations on the preservation of cultural heritage, the look and feel of the original building cannot be altered, so the design team at ESE customized a batch of special solar panels manufactured in China.

""It is a very good example of how to secure a listed building by using state-of-the-art architectural solutions,"" said Paul Thielemans, director of public relations at the Anderlecht Abattoir.

Climate change cooperation, which enjoys bright prospects, has emerged as a focal point in the comprehensive strategic partnership between China and Europe.

In April, a delegation of climate envoys from the EU and member states including France, Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark visited China and had productive discussions with their Chinese counterparts. Both sides were committed to intensifying climate dialogue and cooperation to bolster global climate governance.

In December 2022, the federal government launched the Canada Growth Fund (CGF), a $15 billion arm's length public fund designed to accelerate the deployment of innovative emission reduction technologies in Canada. The Public Sector Pension Investment Board, a federal Crown corporation first established in 2000, is responsible for managing the CGF. The 2023 Fall Economic Statement announced that the CGF will be the principal federal entity to issue carbon contracts for difference (CCfDs), which are designed to backstop the future price of carbon and provide certainty to businesses for the purposes of de-risking emission reduction projects. The CGF will allocate up to $7 billion of its current $15 billion in capital to issue all forms of CCfDs and carbon credit offtake agreements.

On December 20, 2023, the CGF announced a $200 million strategic investment in Entropy Inc. (Entropy), an Alberta-based carbon capture, utilization and sequestration (CCUS) project developer. In addition to the investment, the CGF and Entropy entered into a fixed-price carbon credit purchase commitment whereby the CGF will purchase up to 185,000 tonnes per year of carbon credits for 15 years, at an initial price of $86.50 per tonne. The scale, length and fixed-price nature of this commitment renders it a one-of-a-kind transaction in the global compliance carbon market.

The federal government further affirmed its commitment towards the promotion of CCfDs in Canada's 2024 federal budget (2024 Federal Budget). In the 2024 Federal Budget, the federal government announced its intentions to strengthen the CGF's role as the federal issuer of CCfDs through a number of initiatives. First, the CGF will develop an expanded offering of CCfDs that can better service a wider breadth of industries and markets. Second, the CGF is assisting provinces ""contributing significantly to greenhouse gas emissions reductions"" by curating and offering tailored CCfD offerings and carbon credit offtake agreements. Of note, one such approach that the CGF may take in expanding its role as the federal issuer of CCfDs is to develop off-the-shelf CCfDs for certain jurisdictions. Third, the CGF's increased capacity to offer CCfDs may include the implementation of a government backstop of the CGF's CCfD liabilities.

CCfDs are seen not only as a useful tool for governments seeking to mobilize capital for clean growth projects, but also for project proponents looking for revenue certainty and to share project risk. In new modeling released by Clean Prosperity and Navius Research in February 2024, researchers found that Canada could miss out on up to 33 megatonnes of emission reductions per year by 2030 unless governments expand the use of CCfDs. This article will take a closer look at CCfDs, including (i) an overview of CCfDs and their utility, (ii) current CCfD programs, and (iii) key legal considerations in CCfDs.

CCfDs find their origins in the financial markets, where contracts for difference are used to hedge against price volatility in shares or commodities. According to the Canadian Energy Centre, CCfDs allow emission offset project developers to secure a stable and predictable carbon price for the duration of the contract and for the lifespan of the project. In essence, CCfDs work to hedge against changes in carbon pricing policies or against carbon market risks. Depending on the issue being addressed, there is flexibility in designing CCfDs. For example, the arrangement between the CGF and Entropy addresses the potential policy risk associated with the benchmark federal carbon price - if the benchmark federal carbon price does not rise to $170 per tonne by 2030 as planned, Entropy can move forward with the project knowing that the CGF is committed to purchasing the contracted carbon credits at a certain price. CCfDs can also be tailored to the pricing of carbon credits in provincial markets, or on other commodities such as clean electricity.

Under the federal program, the agreed upon carbon price - often referred to as the strike price - effectively acts as the floor price on carbon, meaning that the CGF will pay the price difference to the proponent in the event the federal carbon price falls below the strike price. Since the price of carbon is guaranteed, this insulates the project developer from policy-related risks and allows them to continue with the project. This does not mean that the CGF alone must bear all the risk. In circumstances where the federal price of carbon exceeds the strike price, the contract may require the project proponent to pay to the CGF the price difference between the federal carbon price and the strike price.

Aside from policy-related risks, CCfDs may also insulate parties from market volatility, such as changes in provincial carbon credit markets. In this case, the parties will agree to a strike price for carbon credits based on the market price (as opposed to the benchmark federal price). Such a fixed pricing mechanism may help alleviate common challenges with regulated carbon markets, such as oversupply and low prices for carbon credits.

To date, a number of countries have committed significant funds to CCfDs for both carbon credits and clean-technology related commodities. As noted above, Canada announced in its 2023 Fall Economic Statement that up to $7 billion of the $15 billion in the CGF will be dedicated to CCfDs. Acknowledging that CCfDs can provide insurance for corporations looking to de-risk emission reduction projects, the Canadian government believes that this investment can encourage decarbonization efforts across industries, as well as help stimulate the development and growth of a low-carbon economy. In Europe, both Denmark and the Netherlands have CCfD programs, and France has plans to introduce CCfDs.

In 2014, the United Kingdom (UK) introduced one of the earliest CCfD schemes. The UK scheme focuses on supporting large-scale renewable energy projects (as opposed to carbon) and is the UK government's main vehicle for incentivizing low-carbon electricity generation. Under the scheme, a government-owned company (the Low Carbon Contracts Company) enters into agreements with low-carbon electricity generators. The CCfDs backstop the price of electricity by ensuring that the electricity generator will be paid out in the event the price of electricity is so low that the electricity generator suffers a business loss. In other words, the UK government will pay out the price difference between the price the electricity generator must receive in order for the clean electricity investment to be commercially feasible and the market price for electricity. This price certainty enables project proponents to help drive down electricity costs through borrowing at lower interest rates and attracting new entrants that increase market competition.

More recently, Germany committed to increasing investment through CCfDs. In June 2023, the Government of Germany announced that it would be investing $50 billion Euros over a 15-year period to support decarbonization efforts across energy-intensive industries including steel, paper, chemical and cement production. Through CCfDs, the German government will pay out to companies any additional costs incurred during the course of constructing and operating facilities that are more climate friendly. If the operation of the climate-friendly facility imposes lower costs on the company than the operation of the original facility did, the company may instead be required to pay back to the government the subsidies it received. The first round of bidding was launched on March 12, 2024, which will be followed by a second round of bidding towards the end of 2024.

There are a number of legal considerations that parties entering into CCfDs should take into account, including:

There is flexibility in designing CCfDs, which makes it an important policy tool to achieve emission reductions across a range of industrial sectors, while spurring investment in lower-carbon technologies and efficiently allocating both project and political risk between parties.",mondaq.com,news,Mondaq Business Briefing,,0.388235294117647,452655274,31,https://www.mondaq.com/images/Mondaq_Share.jpg,eng-9537185

Korea Hydro and Nuclear Power (KHNP), ARC Clean Technology (ARC), and New Brunswick Power (NB Power) this week signed a trilateral Collaboration Agreement to further cooperation between the three parties.

It has the goal of establishing teaming agreements for global SMR fleet deployment. The Collaboration Agreement was signed at the Reuters SMR and Advanced Reactor 2024 Conference in Atlanta, Georgia.

South Korea has several separate efforts underway to develop SMRs using light water reactors design principles. This is the first time a South Korean firm has committed to co-develop an advanced SMR design with the objective of building a fleet of them on a global basis.

Southeast Asian countries including the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore have all indicated interest in SMRs as being more affordable that full size 1,000 MW+ light water reactors. In particular the megacities of Southeast Asia are hungry for carbon emission free power to support their growth.

Scope of the Agreement and Capabilities of the Partners

The three-party agreement establishes firm commitments to deliverables, processes, and timelines to advance discussions for participation and potential investment in the deployment of ARC units, starting with the commercial demonstration unit in the Province of New Brunswick. The three companies bring significant capabilities in the technical design, operation, and construction of nuclear facilities.

KHNP is the largest electric power company in Korea and one of the world's largest nuclear operators. The company has acquired world-class capabilities in the construction and operation of nuclear power plants globally.

ARC is developing the ARC-100, a versatile Generation IV advanced sodium-cooled fast reactor suitable for on-grid and industrial applications. The first deployment of the ARC reactor is an on-grid commercial demonstration unit serving NB Power, one of Canada's three nuclear operators, at the site of the Point Lepreau Nuclear Generating Station. In 2023, NB Power's license to prepare site application for the ARC-100 was the first application submitted by a nuclear operator for a Generation IV advanced reactor.

The ARC-100 is a 100 MWe sodium cooled, fast flux, pool type reactor with metallic fuel that is based on the 30 year successful operation of the EBR-II reactor in Idaho. ARC was formed to bring back and commercialize a technically mature, advanced reactor technology that was created and proven by a U.S. prototype reactor that ran successfully in the United States for 30 years which is the Integral Fast Reactor (IFR) which was developed at the Argonne West field station on the Arco Desert 27 miles west of Idaho Falls, ID.

ARC has made significant proprietary advances to the original EBR-II design in order to create the ARC-100.

The ARC-100 design creates a ""walk away"" passive safety system that insures the reactor will never melt down even in a disaster that causes a complete loss of power to the plant site. In addition, it can be fueled with the nuclear waste produced by traditional reactors, and its 20 year refueling cycle offers new levels of proliferation resistance.

The company has a goal of deploying the first unit at the Point LePreau site by 2030.

Regulatory Status of the ARC-100

In February 2022 the ARC-100 entered Phase 2 of Vendor Design Review at the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is currently engaged in pre-application activities interactions with ARC Clean Technology (ARC) for the ARC-100 Sodium-Cooled Fast Reactor. The firm's Regulatory Engagement Plan was filed with the NRC in April 2023 ML23120A001 It contains a proposed schedule for submittal of the white papers and technical and topical reports identified as of that date.

(NucNet) Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power (KHNP) has submitted a binding offer for the construction of new nuclear units in the Czech Republic. The South Korean state company said on social media that in addition to a planned fifth unit at the Dukovany nuclear site, the offer includes binding options for three additional units -Dukovany-5 and Temelín-3 and Temelín-4. KHNP said its offer was for the APR1000 reactor technology, which has an output of 1,050 MW and has already been certified in Europe.

""The plant has been designed by KHNP specifically for export to European countries and has been localized to meet European conditions and comply with requirements based on the latest International Atomic Energy Agency and Western European Nuclear Regulators Association standards,"" KHNP said in a press statement.

The firm said it said it has been developing relationships with the Czech government, universities and potential suppliers.

""Cooperation with Czech companies is a long-term priority for KHNP,"" the the firm said adding, ""Since 2016, KHNP has identified over 200 potential Czech suppliers and signed more than 50 memorandums of understanding as a basis for future cooperation.""

KHNP said it is the only bidder counting on a Czech company for the delivery of the turbine, which is one of the most important and largest components in a nuclear power plant.

The offer from KHNP was announced as France's state energy company EDF submitted an updated offer for the delivery of up to four new nuclear power units in the Czech Republic. The EDF offer is for up to four EPR1200 reactors at the Dukovany site - Units 5 and 6 - and at the Temelín site - Units 3 and 4.

Details Of New Build Plans Remain Unclear

Exactly how many new nuclear plants the Czech government is planning to build, and at which sites, remains unclear. Also unclear is how the Czech government plans to finance the massive new build. A decade ago the government walked away from a similar new build worth$25 billion at the time .

The government had previously been looking for binding bids for a single new 1,200-MW Dukovany unit with the possibility for non-binding offers for an additional three units split between the Dukovany and Temelín nuclear stations. EDF and KHNP are both proposing two units at each site.

Dukovany is about 50 km west of Brno in the south of the country and Temelín more than 100 km south of Prague in the southwest.

Czech prime-minister Petr Fiala told journalists earlier this year that building up to four new reactor units ""in one package"" is economically advantageous and estimated to push the total cost down by 25%. The government set an ambitious agenda of deciding on the winner and the size of the contract by the end of 2024.

(NucNet) A US Court of Appeals has has denied a challenge to a license renewal application extension granted by the federal government for the two-unit Diablo Canyon nuclear power station in California.

In an opinion written by US circuit judge Consuelo Callahan, the three-judge panel found that the NRC had not acted arbitrarily nor capriciously. The agency ""adequately explained why California's changing energy needs constitute a special circumstance, and why the record supported its findings of no undue risk to the public health and safety.""

The 36-page decision written by US circuit judge Consuelo Callahan, said;

""We conclude that NRC's issuance of the NEPA categorical exclusion is supported by the record. Despite Petitioners' arguments to the contrary, there is nothing in the language of the categorical exclusion that limits its use to certain types of exemptions. Additionally, NRC historically has approved timely renewal exemption requests using the very same NEPA categorical exclusion.""

""This is a singular case. In circumstances like these where NRC's decision has the almost guaranteed practical effect of extending the operating timeframe of a license beyond its original expiration date, such a decision is directly reviewable in our court under our broad and liberal reading of the Hobbs Act. Additionally, we hold that at least two of the Petitioners have standing.""

""[The] NRC was not required to provide a hearing or meet other procedural requirements before issuing the Exemption Decision because the Exemption was not a licensing proceeding. NRC adequately explained why California's changing energy needs constitute a special circumstance, and why the record supported its findings of no undue risk to the public health and safety.""

""NRC was not required to provide a hearing or meet other procedural requirements before issuing the Exemption Decision because the Exemption was not a licensing proceeding. NRC adequately explained why California's changing energy needs constitute a special circumstance, and why the record supported its findings of no undue risk to the public health and safety.""

Three green groups - Mothers for Peace, Environmental Working Group, and Friends of the Earth - filed a motion asking for the immediate closure of Diablo Canyon based on it posing an ""unacceptable safety risk.""

It remains a mind boggling mystery why so-called ""green groups"" continue efforts to stop the use nuclear energy to provide carbon emission free power in place of fossil fuel plants.

Diablo Canyon owner and operator Pacific Gas and Electric is planning to keep Unit 1 operational until October 2029 and Unit 2 until October 2030. It may keep it open longer depending on the outcome of a separate NRC licensing process.

California governor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, signed legislation in 2022 that reversed a 2016 agreement between the state, PG&E and environmental groups to retire the facility. Newsom, once a leading voice to close the facility, said Diablo Canyon's power is needed beyond 2025 to ward off possible blackouts as California moves to solar and other renewable energy sources.

Newsom's administration has cited ""unprecedented stress"" on the state's energy system as a reason for keeping open Diablo Canyon, which alone accounts for 9% of the state's generation and 17% of its electricity from carbon-free sources.

Translation - It is a fact that voter will take their ire over blackouts on current elected officials.

The Bloomberg Wire Service reports that a month after the US offered $1.5 billion to restart Holtec's Palisades nuclear power plant, there's a growing sense among officials in the industry and government that it may not be the last.

""There are a couple of nuclear power plants that we probably should, and can, turn back on,"" said Jigar Shah, director of the US Energy Department's Loan Programs Office.

""A lot of the other players that have a nuclear power plant that has recently shut down and could be turned back on are gaining that confidence to try,"" said Shah in an interview with Bloomberg. He declined to name specific plants.

Shah's exuberance has support from DOE's Office of Nuclear Energy. According to the Bloomberg report, while the federal government has not made a wholesale effort to revive shuttered plants, it sees reactors and their carbon-free power as ""extremely valuable assets,"" said Michael Goff, principal deputy assistant secretary for the Energy Department's Office of Nuclear Energy. Some closed plants clearly have the potential to be reopened, he said.

""Unless you do something irrevocable, they can be turned around,"" Goff said.

The US nuclear energy industry's trade group in Washington, DC, also weighed in.

""The environment has shifted significantly in a really short period of time,"" said Doug True, chief nuclear officer for the Nuclear Energy Institute trade group. ""I think there are companies that are looking at whether a restart makes sense.""

True estimates there may be only five reactors suitable for resurrection. He declined to name them.

(NucNet) Thai power company Global Power Synergy Public Company Limited (GPSC) has signed a memorandum of understanding with Denmark's Seaborg Technologies to explore the potential deployment of Seaborg's compact molten salt reactor (CMSR) floating ""power barge"" in Thailand. Under the MOU, GPSC and Seaborg will assess how the CMSR power barge could be used in Thailand to support the Southeast Asian country's transition to net-zero.

On April 24, 2024 Mr. Worawat Pitayasiri, President and Chief Executive Officer of Global Power Synergy Public Company Limited signed the memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Mr. Klaus Nyengaard, Chief Executive Officer of Seaborg Technologies ApS, the developer of SMR technology in Denmark. The signing ceremony, presided by H.E. Mr. Jon Thorgaard, Ambassador of Denmark to Thailand and Cambodia, was organized at the Royal Danish Embassy, Sathorn, Bangkok, Thailand.

The study - expected to take about four years to complete - is intended to explore the use of electricity generated from Seaborg´s Power Barge to feed directly into the grid and to explore the potential use of the steam generated during operations. Thailand has no commercial nuclear plants,

The US said in 2022 it was planning to help the government build capacity for the deployment of advanced nuclear reactor technologies. US Vice President President Kamala Harris visited Thailand in November 2022.

At the time she said US assistance was part of its Net Zero World Initiative, a project launched at last year's Glasgow climate summit in which the US partners with the private sector and philanthropists to promote clean energy. She did not name any potential US partners for a Thai nuclear power project. Thailand does not have a 123 Agreement with the US. The two countries will need to work together to sign off on one.

Seaborg's design is for modular CMSR power barges equipped with between two and eight 100 MW CMSRs, with an operational life of 24 years. In a CMSR reactor, the fuel is mixed with molten fluoride salt, which also acts as a coolant. The Power Barges are modular and can produce from 200 to 800 MW of electricity.

Last year Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power and shipbuilder Samsung Heavy Industries of South Korea announced a consortium with Seaborg to develop floating nuclear plants using Seaborg's CMSR technology.

Floating nuclear plants are seen as a potential method of providing power to isolated regions and also for industry, mines, armed forces and disaster relief. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, they can be built in a factory, assembled in a shipyard and transported to a site, all of which may help to speed up construction and keep costs down.

According to wire service reports, Rolls-Royce has scaled back plans to build two new factories for its small modular reactor (SMR) program in the UK. It cited delays to a government design competition. This is the second time the UK government has frustrated private sector efforts to build SMRs in a fleet program.

Rolls-Royce has proposed building 16 470 MW PWRs at multiple locations around the UK for a total of 7.5 GW of carbon emission free electrical generation capacity. If built, the fleet would exceed the potential power once represented by the now cancelled four 1,350 MW BWRs slated for Wylfa and Oldbury under a previous ambitious UK government plan for 19 GW of nuclear power. It sank without a trace when the government failed to address a mechanism for covering anticipated cost increases and schedule delays in the first of a kind the massive project.

The company said it has been waiting for the outcome of an ongoing SMR design competition in the UK - first announced by the Government in 2015 - before it makes a decision on the pressure vessel plant.

The competition has been repeatedly delayed, with the UK government's Great British Nuclear ministry only formally created last summer. The ministry has a provisional award date of summer 2024. Six firms, including Rolls-Royce, are competitors for government funds.

Rolls-Royce had originally proposed one factory to make reactor pressure vessels for its SMRs and another to make the building other components for nuclear reactors. It reportedly had drawn up a final shortlist of multiple locations for the pressure vessels factory.

Rolls told wire services that it no longer intends to proceed with that plan because there is no longer time to build the factory and make the first pressure vessels for the early 2030s, when it hopes to complete its first SMRs. It will now buy its heavy pressure vessels from a third party supplier.

That supplier is most likely Sheffield Forgemasters which was nationalized by the Ministry of Defense in 2021. The firm has earned NQA-1 ASME certification to manufacture nuclear reactor components. The key question is whether Sheffield can scale up to meet demand and whether the government will fund the now nationalized plant to do so.",energycentral.com,news,Energy Central,,0.5137254901960784,452650085,13,,eng-9545936

Amid lush greenery, fragrant flowers, and the gentle murmur of grazing flocks of sheep lies an endless array of photovoltaic panels, creating a mesmerizing scene of sustainable energy production at the Francisco Pizarro photovoltaic (PV) plant in southwest Spain.

The Iberdrola group, a leading Spanish multinational electric utility company, inaugurated the plant, Europe's largest, in 2022. With around 1.5 million solar panels imported from China, the plant's clean energy output is substantial, catering to the needs of 334,000 households and creating over 1,500 jobs.

As exemplified by the Spanish PV plant, China's rapid progress in the renewable energy sector has played a pivotal role in advancing the European Union's (EU) green transition.

WIN-WIN GREEN COOPERATION

The European Green Deal, launched by the European Commission in 2019, targets net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. To achieve this, the EU has pledged to increase the binding renewable energy share to at least 42.5 percent by 2030. However, with the current renewable energy share at approximately 23 percent, innovation is urgently needed.

Walburga Hemetsberger, CEO of SolarPower Europe, an association for the European solar PV sector, has warned that Europe must ramp up its solar deployment to meet the necessary targets, while WindEurope, a major wind energy association, also stressed the need for immediate action.

China's green energy equipment manufacturing industry is well-established and competitive. Chinese solar products and wind turbines would be indispensible for EU to achieve its 2030 emission reduction targets, said Qin Yan, a lead analyst at Refinitiv and researcher at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies.

In fact, many European countries have reaped the benefits of green energy collaboration with China in recent years.

Pedro Amaral Jorge, president of the Portuguese Renewable Energy Association, highlighted the growing cooperation between China and Portugal in the solar energy sector, as Portugal aims to install approximately 8 gigawatts (GW) of solar power by 2026 or 2027 and reach 22 GW by 2030.

""To achieve the objectives set for increasing installed capacity, cooperation with China must increase,"" Jorge told Xinhua in an interview.

In Croatia, the Chinese-built Senj Wind Farm, inaugurated in December 2021, produces about 530 million kilowatt-hours (kWh) of green electricity each year and reduces Croatia's carbon dioxide emissions by about 460,000 tonnes per year.

""These are projects where the benefit of cooperation with large countries like China, which have the knowledge and potential to realize such large projects, can be seen,"" said Mladen Plese, Croatian political analyst and Asia expert, in an interview with Xinhua.

For Zlatko Prpic, chief engineer of the Senj Wind Farm, the project, the largest of its kind in Croatia so far, represents a ""miracle"" and a shining example of China-Croatia cooperation.

China's Norinco International, a civil engineering company, has been the main contractor and builder of the farm.

As Croatia and the EU ramp up their transition to green and renewable energy, it presents a significant opportunity for Norinco International and other Chinese firms to demonstrate their cutting-edge technology and equipment in large-scale projects, Prpic said.

BRIGHT PROSPECTS FOR COOPERATION

The United Nations has urged countries to accelerate the transition to an affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy system by investing in renewable energy resources, prioritizing energy efficient practices, and adopting clean energy technologies and infrastructure.

In the global drive towards a greener future, China assumes a pivotal role in facilitating the transition for both developed and developing nations, experts said.

""The future of Europe and the world hinges on them,"" said Plese, underlining the necessity for a united front transcending borders and political affiliations in combating climate change.

""China is developing technology and we need the cooperation of Chinese companies in that area as well,"" he said. ""Croatia has the potential for similar green energy projects and cooperation with China is still welcome.""

The 2021 report from the China Chamber of Commerce to the EU highlighted the impressive growth of China's PV cells and modules industry over the past decade. With affordable prices and significant economies of scale, Chinese enterprises emerge as the prime choice to complement the EU industrial chain, meeting the region's escalating demand for PV products.

Converting the roof of Brussels' 130-year-old Marche des Abattoirs into one adorned with solar panels from China and high-power density inverters produced by Chinese telecom giant Huawei, the Belgian renewable energy specialist ESE Group demonstrates the efficacy of these products in sustainable energy solutions.

The project involves the installation of 5,400 solar panels on the building's 10,000-square-meter steel roof. Under the Belgian regulations on the preservation of cultural heritage, the look and feel of the original building cannot be altered, so the design team at ESE customized a batch of special solar panels manufactured in China.

""It is a very good example of how to secure a listed building by using state-of-the-art architectural solutions,"" said Paul Thielemans, director of public relations at the Anderlecht Abattoir.

Climate change cooperation, which enjoys bright prospects, has emerged as a focal point in the comprehensive strategic partnership between China and Europe.

In April, a delegation of climate envoys from the EU and member states including France, Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark visited China and had productive discussions with their Chinese counterparts. Both sides were committed to intensifying climate dialogue and cooperation to bolster global climate governance.

Denmark is on the right track to reach its 2025 and 2030 climate goals.

This is shown in the latest Climate Status and Projection (KF) for 2024, the annual Danish estimation of how CO2e emissions will develop towards 2035 based on existing agreements and initiatives. According to the projection, Denmark is expected to reduce its emissions by approximately 68 percent by 2030 compared to 1990 levels. In comparison, the Climate Law Agreement of 2019 anticipated a reduction of 45 percent of emissions by 2030 compared to 1990 levels.

Additionally, the projection shows that the 2025 target of reaching a 50-54 percent reduction of emission is expected to be met with a reduction of approximately 55.5 percent.

Related news: Another record-breaking year for solar and wind power in Denmark

""With the new climate projection, we expect to meet the 2025 target. At the same time, we are well on our way towards the 2030 target. The CO2 reductions are the result of ambitious agreements and a broad political responsibility for climate action together with ongoing better knowledge of the emissions. We must not take our foot off the accelerator, because we are neither at the finish line nor sure that there won't be a detour or two along the way,""

says Lars Aagard, Minister for Climate, Energy and Utilities.

In particular, the green transition of the energy sector, will drive the reduction of CO2e emissions across other sectors towards 2030. Electricity and district heating are to become greener, and with the phase-out of the remaining coal power plants, a 100 percent renewable energy share is estimated by 2029. Similarly, the ongoing reduction of Danish gas consumption combined with increased biogas production will lead to an estimated 100 percent green gas supply from 2029. This development supports the electrification of the Danish society with increased incentives for electric cars and trucks, heat pumps, and electric-based solutions within the business sector as well as the transportation sector.

The reduction in the shortfall from last year to this year is due, in part, to a new model for calculating how much CO2e forest trees absorb as well as new knowledge about emissions from low-lying soils.

Within the European Union, Hungarian residents had to pay the least for electricity at the end of last year, and the country fared similarly well when it comes to the price of gas, too.

As per the latest Eurostat report, the price of electricity and the cost of gas in the EU started to rise just before the Ukraine war and reached a massive peak in 2022. Costs began to fall in the second half of 2023, as the price of supplying energy managed to stabilise at the beginning of the year.

At the same time, when compared to tariffs prior to the climax in 2022, the costs of energy, supply, and network are still relatively high.

Residential electricity prices fell between 2022 and 2023 in 23 European Union member states. The average household electricity price in the region was EUR 28.5/100 kWh in the second half of 2023, down from EUR 29.4/100 kWh in the first half.

Gas prices showed a similar trend in some countries in the region, mainly due to lower energy costs and cuts in taxes. 12 countries reported price increases, while the other 12 countries using gas reported price decreases. The average household gas price fell to EUR 11.3/100 kWh in the second half of 2023, down from EUR 11.9/100 kWh in the previous six months.

In Poland, prices were 32 percent higher, in Slovakia and Germany 22 percent higher, while Greece, Denmark, and Bulgaria saw the largest price decreases, around 40 percent reduction in the case of each country. In the industrial sector, all but three countries reported decreases, indicating a clear downward trend in gas prices.

Eurostat highlights that Hungary had the lowest average household electricity prices with EUR 11.3/100 kWh in the second half of 2023. The second lowest price of electricity was in Bulgaria (EUR 11.9), and the third lowest in Malta (EUR 12.8).

The carbon neutral goal is an elusive one, but progress has been reported in some unexpected spots. One of those is the European nation of Cyprus, which was hovering around rock bottom for renewable energy just a few years ago. Now the country has been picking up steam. In the latest development, Cyprus is trialing a new large scale, long duration compressed air energy storage system that leverages the water pressure of the ocean for maximum effectiveness.

Among European nations, Iceland hit the 100% renewable energy target all the way back in 2015. However, since Iceland is not a member of the European Union, the race to be the first EU nation to ditch fossil fuels from the power generation landscape is still wide open.

For a while there it looked like Cyprus was almost ready to give up the ghost. Nevertheless, on February 24 the Guardian took note of renewable energy progress in the EU, listing Cyprus among the nations reporting big gains.

There is still a long way to go, as the Guardian puts it. A rundown of the data from 2022 shows EU electricity consumption averaging about 41% from renewable resources, with Sweden and Denmark leading the pack at 83.3% and 77.2% respectively. Down at the bottom were Malta (10.1%), Hungary (15.3%), the Czech Republic (15.5%), and Luxembourg (15.9%), with Cyprus easing ahead of the bottom-dwellers at 18%.

A healthy dose of long duration energy storage would help nations like Cyprus climb the renewable energy ladder more quickly. Unlike lithium-ion battery systems that typically last about 4-6 hours, a long duration energy storage system can produce clean kilowatts for longer periods, lasting up to full days, weeks, or even seasons. At that level, intermittent sources -- namely, wind and solar energy -- could provide for nuclear-style stability, continuity, and reliability at a fraction of the cost of a new nuclear power plant.

The long duration energy storage field has been attracting furious activity on the part of investors and innovators, with some of the latest activity focusing on new long duration technologies that deploy the physics of heat transfer.

The natural systems of the Earth are also rich territory for long duration innovators. Pumped hydropower, for example, has been getting a second look in recent years. This decades-old, mature technology is a perfect fit for wind and solar power. It relies on the force of gravity to shunt water from an upper reservoir to a lower generating station. Ideally, the upper reservoir is refilled only when excess renewable energy is available to run the pumps (see our long duration archive here).

Compressed air is another long duration technology that has been getting a workout in the 2000s. Some of the earlier compressed air attempts have fallen by the wayside, but new iterations keep popping up.

Compressed air systems can leverage underground rock formations or human-made structures as storage platforms, though each has drawbacks. In underground storage the containerization is durable and readymade, and there is less potential conflict with land use on the surface. However, rock formations are geo-specific. Human-made platforms can potentially cover a much wider range of site options, but they are expensive and can run into roadblocks from competing land uses.

One solution that has crossed the CleanTechnica radar is underwater storage. Back in 2022 we took note of a bladder-based energy storage system that is sort of an underwater version of pumped hydro, leveraging water pressure instead of gravity.

Another take on deploying water pressure for energy storage comes from the Israeli startup BaroMar, which has come up with a simple sounding tank-based compressed air system. The system is designed for use at coastal areas and islands adjacent to deep water. The plan is to locate the tanks in depths of around 500 feet, where the water pressure is sufficient and conflicts with marine life are less in evidence.

""The hydrostatic pressure of the surrounding water enables construction of long-lasting large tanks at very low cost,"" BaroMar explains. Also assisting on the cost-cutting end of things is a design strategy focusing on eliminating underwater moving parts and subsystems. The tanks are constructed on shore, using marine-proven concrete and steel, then towed into place.

That sounds simple enough, though the devil is in the details. Earlier this week, the engineering firm Jacobs let word slip that it BaroMar selected it to produce the preliminary design for the Cyprus project, billed as a ""first-of-its-kind underwater large-scale, long-duration energy storage pilot project.""

Jacobs observes that BaroMar's energy storage solution deploys mature technologies in the fields of power, energy, and marine engineering. However, combining them with the hydrostatic pressure of seawater is a delicate act.

""This project requires extensive geophysical, geotechnical and bathymetric surveying, investigation, feasibility studying and permitting for tank installation at deep depths for onshore mechanical and electrical equipment needs,"" explained Jacobs Vice President Fiachra Ó Cléirigh.

As described by Jacobs, the Cyprus project will consist of large, rigid tanks ballasted on the seabed with a combined capacity of 4 megawatt-hours.

""The tanks are designed to resist loads imposed by the marine environment as well as the compressed air and hydrostatic water pressure, during both installation and operational conditions,"" Jacobs adds.

Excess electricity from wind and solar resources will be shunted by subsea cable to the tanks, where it feeds compressors. When more electricity is needed, the compressed air is fed back to land where it is expanded and fed into a generator.

Last September the nonprofit organization ISRAEL21c interviewed BaroMar founder Yonadav Buber, who explained that undersea tanks are less expensive to construct because the pressure of seawater acts as a stabilizer. Though site selection is limited to coasts and islands, these same locations are notoriously crowded. Opportunities for large scale, land-based energy storage are difficult to find.

""This is a really genius solution, because it circumvents the problem in a very elegant way. It also creates the possibility of more or less endless energy storage, because we're talking about the seabed, which is not exactly hot real estate,"" Buber told ISRAEL21c writer Naama Barak.

Buber emphasized that the technology components are mature and are not in need of extensive development, unlike some of the other new long duration energy storage technologies emerging today. He noted that marine-related regulatory and engineering requirements are the main challenges that lie between the pilot project and commercial deployment.

When Buber spoke to ISRAEL21c last fall, he indicated that Cyprus meets the three main client categories targeted by BaroMar. One consists of renewable energy producers with surpluses on hand, and the second consists of large scale energy consumers including port facilities and other large industrial complexes.

""And our third type of customer is governments,"" Buber added. ""We're in discussions, for example, with the government of Cyprus, to make them the first member state of the European Union to run on 100 percent renewable energy by 2030.""

Whether or not that ambitious goal is possible remains to be seen. However, in February our friends over at PV Magazine reported that Cyprus already expects to curtail a good 28% of its renewable energy production in 2024, so it clearly has a hefty surplus on hand.

PV Magazine cited a lack of energy storage facilities and the absence of sufficient interconnections with other countries as the main drivers of renewable energy overproduction in Cyprus.

If you're thinking green hydrogen could help soak up some of those excess clean kilowatts, Cyprus is one step ahead of you. In 2022 Cyprus earned the title of ""laggard"" in a rundown of EU national hydrogen strategies, but the very next year a consortium of 27 nations organized to tap Cyprus to host the EU's first ""Hydrogen Valley"" in Cyprus. We'll be keeping an eye out for next steps but so far the focus is on green hydrogen sourced from water, leveraging power from renewable resources.

This is the first in a series of articles, each of which will take an in-depth look at the failing institutions, infrastructure and other parts of the public sector that typify the idea of 'Broken Britain'

On an overcast day earlier this month, Mark Morrell was standing on Kingsley Road in Silverstone, Northamptonshire, surrounded by a film crew and pointing to a stretch of the street that has been repaired so many times it resembles a cross between a patchwork quilt and a lunar landscape.

It was all in a day's campaigning for the former utility engineer, who is widely known as Mr Pothole and has been making as much noise as possible about the parlous state of Britain's roads for the best part of 12 years. But this time there was a twist.

Morrell's crusade began when his then-teenage daughter, who had just passed her test, became worried drivers were swerving towards on-coming traffic to avoid a pothole near their home. Morrell complained to the council, got nowhere and eventually informed the police, ""which is, in reality, the only way you're going to get an emergency repair done these days,"" he says.

He started small with a Facebook page but clearly has a gift for publicity: early on he baked a birthday cake for a pothole that hadn't been fixed by the local council for more than a year. The stunt caught on elsewhere in the country and Morrell's national profile grew as the state of Britain's roads deteriorated.

But this time the film crew was from state-owned FranceTV, our cross-Channel neighbour's equivalent of the BBC. That's right, the utterly calamitous state of Britain's roads is no longer merely a national embarrassment; the humiliation is about to go global.

Perhaps the only surprise is that it took other countries so long to notice. The UK's road quality ranks just 37th in the world - a bit better than Lithuania, a bit worse than Slovenia. But those French television producers clearly know a good metaphor for modern Britain when they drive over one (and top marks for irony to the producer who decided to film the segment in the town that hosts the British Grand Prix).

Our most visible crisis

Britain can boast cutting-edge capabilities in areas such as artificial intelligence, pharmaceutical innovation, finance, filmmaking and even some aspects of car manufacturing. And yet this country doesn't build enough houses and its roads are falling apart; modern Britain is an advanced society that is immiserating itself through poor land use and inadequate infrastructure.

A lot of the UK's problems - long NHS waiting times and crumbling schools, for example - are huge issues for those directly affected but can be somewhat abstract to the general public. There is, however, no hiding the state of Britain's crumbling roads. Michèle Dix, a former managing director for planning at Transport for London and now a commissioner at the National Infrastructure Commission (NIC), says the state of the UK's roads highlights broader neglect of our transport links. Too often the focus and funding gets directed at building something new rather than maintaining something old, she argues.

Potholes have always been with us; some historians believe the term dates back to potters digging out the clay that formed the base of Roman roads. But the situation has never been worse. There was a 62 per cent increase in the number of potholes recorded by councils in Britain last year, according to analysis conducted by the pressure group Round our Way based on Freedom of Information requests.

The AA dealt with more than 630,000 pothole-related incidents in 2023, up 16 per cent on the previous year. The damage to cars is estimated to have added up to nearly £480 million last year alone. The Asphalt Industry Alliance's (AIA) aptly acronymed Annual Local Authority Road Maintenance survey calculated that the amount of money needed to fix the backlog of problems on local roads has now reached a cool £16.3 billion, a 16 per cent increase from last year.

Public ire

No wonder the nation's road users are so angry. Photos of stony-faced motorists pointing at asphalt cavities have become a mainstay on the front pages of local newspapers. Politicians gather around in high-vis jackets, stroking their chins and staring into grimy puddles as if they are font of all human knowledge. Last year the bonfire society in Lewes, East Sussex, famous for its topical effigies, burned ""Pothole Pete"", who was dressed as ""an indistinguishable civil servant"", on Guy Fawkes night.

A few months earlier, Sir Rod Stewart was spotted raking gravel after struggling to drive his Ferrari down a road near his house in Harlow, Essex. In many parts of the country local residents have started putting down their own traffic cones to warn drivers about the most dangerous potholes. In Lostwithiel, Cornwall, a ""phantom filler"" has started taking matters into his own hands and is fixing roads under the cover of night.

""People have had enough,"" says Morrell. ""There's long been plenty of anger about potholes, but now it's reaching boiling point. People spend a fortune on fuel duty and road tax but the problem just gets worse.""

The issue was brought into sharp focus on Friday when it emerged that police were investigating whether an accident that resulted in the death of a 74-year-old Porsche driver was caused by the man swerving to avoid a pothole, near the Sussex village of Petworth.

All this ire is a particular problem for the Conservatives. Many of the party's traditional supporters live in the countryside and rely on cars to get around. Scores of Northern ""Red Wall"" seats the Tories won in the 2019 election are located in some of the most pothole-blighted parts of the country. The state of Britain's roads has become a key issue on the doorstep and Labour was punching the bruise in the lead up to the local elections, with claims there are 100 times more potholes on British roads than craters on the Moon.

The Tories have long been alive to the danger. Three years ago Rishi Sunak promised to fill in 50 million potholes. Last year, he earmarked £8.3 billion of the money saved from scrapping the northern leg of HS2 to fix roads. Esther McVey recently said this was ""the biggest ever funding increase"" for road improvement. ""We've given councils the cash to fix potholes,"" the minister without portfolio/for common sense wrote in The Telegraph. ""Now they need to get on with it.""

Scale of the problem

Clearly, £8.3 billion is a lot of money and motoring groups are broadly agreed it will make a big difference. But they also say it must be put in context. By McVey's own admission, the extra HS2 money will only pay to resurface around 5,000 miles of road, which is just 3 per cent of all council-managed roads in England, and will be dripped out over the course of 11 years. The trouble is, the AIA believes that around 107,000 miles of roads, about 53 per cent of the total network, will reach the end of their structural lives within the next 15 years.

""The scale of the problem now facing councils is truly gargantuan,"" says Simon Williams, the RAC's head of policy. ""The status quo is not sustainable. The longer the Government fails to grasp this reality, the bigger the eventual cost to the public purse."" When it comes to this nation's roads, the UK failed to fix a stitch in time and is now left holding a bill for nine.

It's still worth doing though. The UK's pothole epidemic is costing the economy £14.4 billion a year, according to the first analysis of its kind conducted by the Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR). This took into account the damage to vehicles, accidents, extra emissions and more than 1.3 billion hours in additional journey time as the result of bad roads.

Douglas McWilliams, the economist who conducted the research for the CEBR and recently completed the Peking-to-Paris car rally, says: ""My take is that our roads are now worse for potholes than anywhere on that rally, apart from the far west of China and Mongolia, and notably worse than in both Russia and Kazakhstan - let alone western Europe.""

How did it get this bad?

We motorists tend to think of roads as horizontal. But from an engineering point of view they are very short and extremely wide vertical structures. Take a cross section of your local road and you'd see three distinct layers. At the bottom is the compacted subgrade soil. The middle layer, or road base, is graded gravel that will likely have been mixed with cement. On top is a covering of permeable asphalt.

That all sounds relatively simple, but there can be quite large variation in both the quality of the materials and techniques used to build the roads. And, according to Dr Benyi Cao, a research fellow at the Royal Academy of Engineering, the UK has quite the reputation for scrimping on both compared with other European countries.

For example, after compacting the subgrade level, road builders will conduct quality control for water content to ensure that the base is neither too wet nor too dry. But there's a big difference in testing every few hundred metres, which Cao says would be considered best practice, and every mile or so, as sometimes happens. Similarly, if the road base isn't thick enough it will be more prone to flexing, resulting in cracks quickly appearing on the surface. Lower quality bitumen will become brittle more quickly.

Morrell, who worked in the utilities industry for 25 years before becoming a campaigner, has seen first-hand how road-building standards have slipped. ""When I had to dig up roads in London that were built 50 or 60 years ago it would break my heart. Those guys knew how to build roads that would last.""

Potholes start to develop because fatigue cracking, ageing asphalt and/or poor drainage results in water entering and remaining in the subgrade and base layers. The weather obviously presents its challenges. As you may have noticed, it rains a lot in the UK. Surface flooding is getting worse because of ""urban sprawl"", poorly maintained drains and climate change. The temperature also bounces around 0C (32F) for months at a time, creating a continuous freeze-thaw cycle during which water will repeatedly expand and contract, forcing cracks farther apart.

British roads are also among the busiest in the world. Lots of freight travels by lorry or van because the rail network is so unreliable. We're buying increasing numbers of SUVs and electric cars, which are heavier and therefore put more stress on the roads. Research by University College London suggests that the increasing reliance on satnavs is resulting in heavier traffic on minor country roads and urban ""rat runs"".

The UK also has more ducts and pipes carrying our gas, electricity, water and broadband laid under the roads than in other countries. Frequent excavations by utility companies and their poor-quality repairs further diminish the integrity of the carriageway. Some 55 per cent of all potholes in urban areas are caused by utilities digging up the roads.

Responsibility shifted to utility firms

Part of the issue is a little-known change in the law in 1991. Prior to this, companies had to pay highway authorities to repair roads after they'd been dug up. Westminster council charged £120 per square metre for this work. But under the New Roads and Street Work Act of 1991, utilities could reinstate their own openings. Costs dropped to an estimated £40 per square metre.

In theory the savings should have resulted in lower bills (or fatter margins for the utility companies). But the change in the law clearly had a number of unintended consequences. First, utility companies became less hesitant about digging up roads. Second, it was clearly in their interests to repair the damage they caused as cheaply as possible. And, third, the councils lost an important source of revenue that many in the industry believe was subsidising their other road maintenance work.

Politicians are now having to deal with the fallout. When he was transport secretary, Chris Grayling promised to make utilities put their pipes under pavements rather than roads - until it was quietly pointed out that utilities would love to do that, because it would vastly improve access, but unfortunately there's not enough space. Grant Shapps, one of Grayling's successors, threatened to slap companies that bodge their repairs with financial penalties. But this relies on councils having enough inspectors to assess the work. And, because of budget cuts, many don't.

Funding shortfalls

Successive governments have been squeezing local authority budgets for decades. Statistics from the Covid years can be fairly misleading. But the trends from before the pandemic tell a clear tale. Central government grants to local authorities have collapsed from £46.5 billion in 2009/10 to £28 billion in 2019/20 in today's prices, according to the Institute for Government.

Part of this 40 per cent drop was offset by increases in council tax. But even when this is taken into account, local authorities are staring down the barrel at an average funding shortfall of nearly 18 per cent. Many have understandably prioritised schools and children's social care, meaning the axe has fallen particularly hard on things such as road maintenance.

""Roads don't collapse dramatically, they just progressively get worse and worse, so it is easier to kick the can down the road a bit farther when times are hard,"" Rick Green, the chairman of the AIA, told The Telegraph last year. This is precisely what's happened.

Recent analysis by the Local Government Association (LGA) found that this reduction in funding to repair local roads was bigger than in almost every other country in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development club of wealthy nations, resulting in the UK falling from ""top to almost bottom of the league"" over two decades, according to Shaun Davies, the chairman of the LGA. Only Italy and Ireland had cut their budgets by a similar amount over that time, while the United States, Japan, New Zealand, Sweden and Denmark had all increased theirs by more than half.

There are various ways to crunch the numbers on this. Despite the Government's claim that the £8.3 billion diverted from HS2 would pay for the resurfacing of 5,000 miles of road, we know that just 1,123 miles of road were resurfaced in the 2021/22 financial year, compared with 1,588 miles in 2017/18, according to research conducted by the RAC based on government data. That's a drop of 29 per cent. Multiply that by 11 and you get 5,115 miles - more than the HS2 money will pay for.

Or you can look at the combined annual funding shortfall in the road maintenance budgets of local authorities in England and Wales. This now adds up to £1.3 billion, according to the AIA. If you again multiple that number by 11 you get to a figure of £14.3 billion. So, even with the HS2 money added to the pot, there's still a £6 billion gap.

""The Government is pushing this narrative of record investment in our roads,"" says one transport expert. ""But it doesn't make up for the cumulative cuts in funding that have been made over the years.""

Inadequate fixes

The result has been an over-reliance on patching potholes and making repairs rather than resurfacing roads, says Dix. Again, this can be done badly or well. The quickest and cheapest method involves shovelling cold-lay Tarmac into a hole, which workmen then, in the words of Morrell, ""tread down with their size nines"". Using hot Tarmac is marginally better. Cutting out a section of the road and then compressing hot Tarmac into the neat hole is best.

But if a pothole has formed, it almost certainly means the integrity of the road surface is already compromised. It will therefore only be a matter of time before the repair wears out or a new hole appears close by. The AIA likens patching to ""icing a rotten cake"". Edmund King, the president of the AA, says: ""Currently we often have a vicious circle of pothole formed, damage caused, pothole patched, pothole reappears with more damage caused - when what we need are more permanent repairs.""

What's to be done? The NIC has recommended councils outside London receive five-year budgets for road maintenance and that total funding be increased from £6.5 billion a year to £8 billion. The RAC has also been calling for a fundamental overhaul in how road maintenance is funded, perhaps by ring-fencing a proportion of the money the Treasury raises from fuel duty. Both proposals would provide councils with the longer-term certainty needed to better plan programmes rather than having to cope with ""boom and bust"" funding cycles.

New technology

Researchers are working on innovative solutions to our pothole problems. Rubberised asphalt, for example, adds shredded tyres to the bitumen mix in order to make the road surface more elastic and stop it cracking so easily. Some councils are already experimenting with adding a graphene-based material to asphalt. This is about a fifth more expensive but lasts twice as long.

A company called Roadmole makes a remote-controlled contraption that cuts circular sections out of the road surface around potholes rather than the usual squares, whose corners can become weak points for water seepage. The JCB Pothole Pro can fix a pothole in just eight minutes at a cost of £30. Stoke-on-Trent City Council's highways team is the first in the country to use this bit of kit and is already exceeding its repair targets.

The Nu-phalt Thermal Road Repair heats up a damaged patch of the road to recycle existing macadam and ensure it bonds better with new material. Then there's the Kiely Multipatcher from Australia, which needs only one person to operate it, combines pothole repair with small-scale surface dressing, and can mend about 100ft of road in under three minutes.

More Tomorrow's World solutions include a ""self-healing"" asphalt with steel fibres and epoxy capsules infused in the materials that repairs itself when heat is applied. Capsules containing bacteria can also be added to cement-based road materials. When they crack, the bacteria are released and start producing calcite (a form of limestone) as a natural byproduct of their metabolism.

Cao is experimenting with using ground-source heating and cooling systems to help regulate the temperature of the road surface to stop it melting in the summer and to break the freeze-thaw cycle in the winter.

However, Dix warns that the authorities need to remain mindful of more basic fixes. ""There are lots of things we can do [to prevent potholes], but digging drains by the side of the road should be first on the list,"" she says.

Whether the solutions are cutting edge or more rudimentary, they all cost money. There's not a lot of that to go around at the moment. But the alternative is, well, just take your car for a drive, your bike for a ride, or tune in to French television, to see what systematic under-investment looks like.

And, according to Dr Benyi Cao, a research fellow at the Royal Academy of Engineering, the UK has quite the reputation for scrimping on both compared with other European countries.

For example, after compacting the subgrade level, road builders will conduct quality control for water content to ensure that the base is neither too wet nor too dry. But there's a big difference in testing every few hundred metres, which Cao says would be considered best practice, and every mile or so, as sometimes happens. Similarly, if the road base isn't thick enough it will be more prone to flexing, resulting in cracks quickly appearing on the surface. Lower quality bitumen will become brittle more quickly.

Morrell, who worked in the utilities industry for 25 years before becoming a campaigner, has seen first-hand how road-building standards have slipped. ""When I had to dig up roads in London that were built 50 or 60 years ago it would break my heart. Those guys knew how to build roads that would last.""

Potholes start to develop because fatigue cracking, ageing asphalt and/or poor drainage results in water entering and remaining in the subgrade and base layers. The weather obviously presents its challenges. As you may have noticed, it rains a lot in the UK. Surface flooding is getting worse because of ""urban sprawl"", poorly maintained drains and climate change. The temperature also bounces around 0C (32F) for months at a time, creating a continuous freeze-thaw cycle during which water will repeatedly expand and contract, forcing cracks farther apart.

British roads are also among the busiest in the world. Lots of freight travels by lorry or van because the rail network is so unreliable. We're buying increasing numbers of SUVs and electric cars, which are heavier and therefore put more stress on the roads. Research by University College London suggests that the increasing reliance on satnavs is resulting in heavier traffic on minor country roads and urban ""rat runs"".

The UK also has more ducts and pipes carrying our gas, electricity, water and broadband laid under the roads than in other countries. Frequent excavations by utility companies and their poor-quality repairs further diminish the integrity of the carriageway. Some 55 per cent of all potholes in urban areas are caused by utilities digging up the roads.

Part of the issue is a little-known change in the law in 1991. Prior to this, companies had to pay highway authorities to repair roads after they'd been dug up. Westminster council charged £120 per square metre for this work. But under the New Roads and Street Work Act of 1991, utilities could reinstate their own openings. Costs dropped to an estimated £40 per square metre.

In theory the savings should have resulted in lower bills (or fatter margins for the utility companies). But the change in the law clearly had a number of unintended consequences. First, utility companies became less hesitant about digging up roads. Second, it was clearly in their interests to repair the damage they caused as cheaply as possible. And, third, the councils lost an important source of revenue that many in the industry believe was subsidising their other road maintenance work.

Politicians are now having to deal with the fallout. When he was transport secretary, Chris Grayling promised to make utilities put their pipes under pavements rather than roads - until it was quietly pointed out that utilities would love to do that, because it would vastly improve access, but unfortunately there's not enough space. Grant Shapps, one of Grayling's successors, threatened to slap companies that bodge their repairs with financial penalties. But this relies on councils having enough inspectors to assess the work. And, because of budget cuts, many don't.

Successive governments have been squeezing local authority budgets for decades. Statistics from the Covid years can be fairly misleading. But the trends from before the pandemic tell a clear tale. Central government grants to local authorities have collapsed from £46.5 billion in 2009/10 to £28 billion in 2019/20 in today's prices, according to the Institute for Government.

Part of this 40 per cent drop was offset by increases in council tax. But even when this is taken into account, local authorities are staring down the barrel at an average funding shortfall of nearly 18 per cent. Many have understandably prioritised schools and children's social care, meaning the axe has fallen particularly hard on things such as road maintenance.

""Roads don't collapse dramatically, they just progressively get worse and worse, so it is easier to kick the can down the road a bit farther when times are hard,"" Rick Green, the chairman of the AIA, told The Telegraph last year. This is precisely what's happened.

Recent analysis by the Local Government Association (LGA) found that this reduction in funding to repair local roads was bigger than in almost every other country in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development club of wealthy nations, resulting in the UK falling from ""top to almost bottom of the league"" over two decades, according to Shaun Davies, the chairman of the LGA. Only Italy and Ireland had cut their budgets by a similar amount over that time, while the United States, Japan, New Zealand, Sweden and Denmark had all increased theirs by more than half.

There are various ways to crunch the numbers on this. Despite the Government's claim that the £8.3 billion diverted from HS2 would pay for the resurfacing of 5,000 miles of road, we know that just 1,123 miles of road were resurfaced in the 2021/22 financial year, compared with 1,588 miles in 2017/18, according to research conducted by the RAC based on government data. That's a drop of 29 per cent. Multiply that by 11 and you get 5,115 miles - more than the HS2 money will pay for.

Or you can look at the combined annual funding shortfall in the road maintenance budgets of local authorities in England and Wales. This now adds up to £1.3 billion, according to the AIA. If you again multiple that number by 11 you get to a figure of £14.3 billion. So, even with the HS2 money added to the pot, there's still a £6 billion gap.

""The Government is pushing this narrative of record investment in our roads,"" says one transport expert. ""But it doesn't make up for the cumulative cuts in funding that have been made over the years.""

The result has been an over-reliance on patching potholes and making repairs rather than resurfacing roads, says Dix. Again, this can be done badly or well. The quickest and cheapest method involves shovelling cold-lay Tarmac into a hole, which workmen then, in the words of Morrell, ""tread down with their size nines"". Using hot Tarmac is marginally better. Cutting out a section of the road and then compressing hot Tarmac into the neat hole is best.

But if a pothole has formed, it almost certainly means the integrity of the road surface is already compromised. It will therefore only be a matter of time before the repair wears out or a new hole appears close by. The AIA likens patching to ""icing a rotten cake"". Edmund King, the president of the AA, says: ""Currently we often have a vicious circle of pothole formed, damage caused, pothole patched, pothole reappears with more damage caused - when what we need are more permanent repairs.""

What's to be done? The NIC has recommended councils outside London receive five-year budgets for road maintenance and that total funding be increased from £6.5 billion a year to £8 billion. The RAC has also been calling for a fundamental overhaul in how road maintenance is funded, perhaps by ring-fencing a proportion of the money the Treasury raises from fuel duty. Both proposals would provide councils with the longer-term certainty needed to better plan programmes rather than having to cope with ""boom and bust"" funding cycles.

Researchers are working on innovative solutions to our pothole problems. Rubberised asphalt, for example, adds shredded tyres to the bitumen mix in order to make the road surface more elastic and stop it cracking so easily. Some councils are already experimenting with adding a graphene-based material to asphalt. This is about a fifth more expensive but lasts twice as long.

A company called Roadmole makes a remote-controlled contraption that cuts circular sections out of the road surface around potholes rather than the usual squares, whose corners can become weak points for water seepage. The JCB Pothole Pro can fix a pothole in just eight minutes at a cost of £30. Stoke-on-Trent City Council's highways team is the first in the country to use this bit of kit and is already exceeding its repair targets.

The Nu-phalt Thermal Road Repair heats up a damaged patch of the road to recycle existing macadam and ensure it bonds better with new material. Then there's the Kiely Multipatcher from Australia, which needs only one person to operate it, combines pothole repair with small-scale surface dressing, and can mend about 100ft of road in under three minutes.

More Tomorrow's World solutions include a ""self-healing"" asphalt with steel fibres and epoxy capsules infused in the materials that repairs itself when heat is applied. Capsules containing bacteria can also be added to cement-based road materials. When they crack, the bacteria are released and start producing calcite (a form of limestone) as a natural byproduct of their metabolism.

Cao is experimenting with using ground-source heating and cooling systems to help regulate the temperature of the road surface to stop it melting in the summer and to break the freeze-thaw cycle in the winter.

However, Dix warns that the authorities need to remain mindful of more basic fixes. ""There are lots of things we can do [to prevent potholes], but digging drains by the side of the road should be first on the list,"" she says.

Whether the solutions are cutting edge or more rudimentary, they all cost money. There's not a lot of that to go around at the moment. But the alternative is, well, just take your car for a drive, your bike for a ride, or tune in to French television, to see what systematic under-investment looks like.

On an overcast day earlier this month, Mark Morrell was standing on Kingsley Road in Silverstone, Northamptonshire, surrounded by a film crew and pointing to a stretch of the street that has been repaired so many times it resembles a cross between a patchwork quilt and a lunar landscape.

It was all in a day's campaigning for the former utility engineer, who is widely known as Mr Pothole and has been making as much noise as possible about the parlous state of Britain's roads for the best part of 12 years. But this time there was a twist.

Morrell's crusade began when his then-teenage daughter, who had just passed her test, became worried drivers were swerving towards on-coming traffic to avoid a pothole near their home. Morrell complained to the council, got nowhere and eventually informed the police, ""which is, in reality, the only way you're going to get an emergency repair done these days,"" he says.

He started small with a Facebook page but clearly has a gift for publicity: early on he baked a birthday cake for a pothole that hadn't been fixed by the local council for more than a year. The stunt caught on elsewhere in the country and Morrell's national profile grew as the state of Britain's roads deteriorated.

But this time the film crew was from state-owned FranceTV, our cross-Channel neighbour's equivalent of the BBC. That's right, the utterly calamitous state of Britain's roads is no longer merely a national embarrassment; the humiliation is about to go global.

Perhaps the only surprise is that it took other countries so long to notice. The UK's road quality ranks just 37th in the world - a bit better than Lithuania, a bit worse than Slovenia. But those French television producers clearly know a good metaphor for modern Britain when they drive over one (and top marks for irony to the producer who decided to film the segment in the town that hosts the British Grand Prix).

Britain can boast cutting-edge capabilities in areas such as artificial intelligence, pharmaceutical innovation, finance, filmmaking and even some aspects of car manufacturing. And yet this country doesn't build enough houses and its roads are falling apart; modern Britain is an advanced society that is immiserating itself through poor land use and inadequate infrastructure.

A lot of the UK's problems - long NHS waiting times and crumbling schools, for example - are huge issues for those directly affected but can be somewhat abstract to the general public. There is, however, no hiding the state of Britain's crumbling roads. Michèle Dix, a former managing director for planning at Transport for London and now a commissioner at the National Infrastructure Commission (NIC), says the state of the UK's roads highlights broader neglect of our transport links. Too often the focus and funding gets directed at building something new rather than maintaining something old, she argues.

Potholes have always been with us; some historians believe the term dates back to potters digging out the clay that formed the base of Roman roads. But the situation has never been worse. There was a 62 per cent increase in the number of potholes recorded by councils in Britain last year, according to analysis conducted by the pressure group Round our Way based on Freedom of Information requests.

The AA dealt with more than 630,000 pothole-related incidents in 2023, up 16 per cent on the previous year. The damage to cars is estimated to have added up to nearly £480 million last year alone. The Asphalt Industry Alliance's (AIA) aptly acronymed Annual Local Authority Road Maintenance survey calculated that the amount of money needed to fix the backlog of problems on local roads has now reached a cool £16.3 billion, a 16 per cent increase from last year.

No wonder the nation's road users are so angry. Photos of stony-faced motorists pointing at asphalt cavities have become a mainstay on the front pages of local newspapers. Politicians gather around in high-vis jackets, stroking their chins and staring into grimy puddles as if they are font of all human knowledge. Last year the bonfire society in Lewes, East Sussex, famous for its topical effigies, burned ""Pothole Pete"", who was dressed as ""an indistinguishable civil servant"", on Guy Fawkes night.

A few months earlier, Sir Rod Stewart was spotted raking gravel after struggling to drive his Ferrari down a road near his house in Harlow, Essex. In many parts of the country local residents have started putting down their own traffic cones to warn drivers about the most dangerous potholes. In Lostwithiel, Cornwall, a ""phantom filler"" has started taking matters into his own hands and is fixing roads under the cover of night.

""People have had enough,"" says Morrell. ""There's long been plenty of anger about potholes, but now it's reaching boiling point. People spend a fortune on fuel duty and road tax but the problem just gets worse.""

All this ire is a particular problem for the Conservatives. Many of the party's traditional supporters live in the countryside and rely on cars to get around. Scores of Northern ""Red Wall"" seats the Tories won in the 2019 election are located in some of the most pothole-blighted parts of the country. The state of Britain's roads has become a key issue on the doorstep and Labour was punching the bruise in the lead up to the local elections, with claims there are 100 times more potholes on British roads than craters on the Moon.

The Tories have long been alive to the danger. Three years ago Rishi Sunak promised to fill in 50 million potholes. Last year, he earmarked £8.3 billion of the money saved from scrapping the northern leg of HS2 to fix roads. Esther McVey recently said this was ""the biggest ever funding increase"" for road improvement. ""We've given councils the cash to fix potholes,"" the minister without portfolio/for common sense wrote in The Telegraph. ""Now they need to get on with it.""

Clearly, £8.3 billion is a lot of money and motoring groups are broadly agreed it will make a big difference. But they also say it must be put in context. By McVey's own admission, the extra HS2 money will only pay to resurface around 5,000 miles of road, which is just 3 per cent of all council-managed roads in England, and will be dripped out over the course of 11 years. The trouble is, the AIA believes that around 107,000 miles of roads, about 53 per cent of the total network, will reach the end of their structural lives within the next 15 years.

""The scale of the problem now facing councils is truly gargantuan,"" says Simon Williams, the RAC's head of policy. ""The status quo is not sustainable. The longer the Government fails to grasp this reality, the bigger the eventual cost to the public purse."" When it comes to this nation's roads, the UK failed to fix a stitch in time and is now left holding a bill for nine.

It's still worth doing though. The UK's pothole epidemic is costing the economy £14.4 billion a year, according to the first analysis of its kind conducted by the Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR). This took into account the damage to vehicles, accidents, extra emissions and more than 1.3 billion hours in additional journey time as the result of bad roads.

Douglas McWilliams, the economist who conducted the research for the CEBR and recently completed the Peking-to-Paris car rally, says: ""My take is that our roads are now worse for potholes than anywhere on that rally, apart from the far west of China and Mongolia, and notably worse than in both Russia and Kazakhstan - let alone western Europe.""

We motorists tend to think of roads as horizontal. But from an engineering point of view they are very short and extremely wide vertical structures. Take a cross section of your local road and you'd see three distinct layers. At the bottom is the compacted subgrade soil. The middle layer, or road base, is graded gravel that will likely have been mixed with cement. On top is a covering of permeable asphalt.

That all sounds relatively simple, but there can be quite large variation in both the quality of the materials and techniques used to build the roads. And, according to Dr Benyi Cao, a research fellow at the Royal Academy of Engineering, the UK has quite the reputation for scrimping on both compared with other European countries.

For example, after compacting the subgrade level, road builders will conduct quality control for water content to ensure that the base is neither too wet nor too dry. But there's a big difference in testing every few hundred metres, which Cao says would be considered best practice, and every mile or so, as sometimes happens. Similarly, if the road base isn't thick enough it will be more prone to flexing, resulting in cracks quickly appearing on the surface. Lower quality bitumen will become brittle more quickly.

Last year the bonfire society in Lewes, East Sussex, famous for its topical effigies, burned ""Pothole Pete"", who was dressed as ""an indistinguishable civil servant"", on Guy Fawkes night.

A few months earlier, Sir Rod Stewart was spotted raking gravel after struggling to drive his Ferrari down a road near his house in Harlow, Essex. In many parts of the country local residents have started putting down their own traffic cones to warn drivers about the most dangerous potholes. In Lostwithiel, Cornwall, a ""phantom filler"" has started taking matters into his own hands and is fixing roads under the cover of night.

""People have had enough,"" says Morrell. ""There's long been plenty of anger about potholes, but now it's reaching boiling point. People spend a fortune on fuel duty and road tax but the problem just gets worse.""

All this ire is a particular problem for the Conservatives. Many of the party's traditional supporters live in the countryside and rely on cars to get around. Scores of Northern ""Red Wall"" seats the Tories won in the 2019 election are located in some of the most pothole-blighted parts of the country. The state of Britain's roads has become a key issue on the doorstep and Labour was punching the bruise in the lead up to the local elections, with claims there are 100 times more potholes on British roads than craters on the Moon.

The Tories have long been alive to the danger. Three years ago Rishi Sunak promised to fill in 50 million potholes. Last year, he earmarked £8.3 billion of the money saved from scrapping the northern leg of HS2 to fix roads. Esther McVey recently said this was ""the biggest ever funding increase"" for road improvement. ""We've given councils the cash to fix potholes,"" the minister without portfolio/for common sense wrote in The Telegraph. ""Now they need to get on with it.""

Scale of the problem

Clearly, £8.3 billion is a lot of money and motoring groups are broadly agreed it will make a big difference. But they also say it must be put in context. By McVey's own admission, the extra HS2 money will only pay to resurface around 5,000 miles of road, which is just 3 per cent of all council-managed roads in England, and will be dripped out over the course of 11 years. The trouble is, the AIA believes that around 107,000 miles of roads, about 53 per cent of the total network, will reach the end of their structural lives within the next 15 years.

""The scale of the problem now facing councils is truly gargantuan,"" says Simon Williams, the RAC's head of policy. ""The status quo is not sustainable. The longer the Government fails to grasp this reality, the bigger the eventual cost to the public purse."" When it comes to this nation's roads, the UK failed to fix a stitch in time and is now left holding a bill for nine.

It's still worth doing though. The UK's pothole epidemic is costing the economy £14.4 billion a year, according to the first analysis of its kind conducted by the Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR). This took into account the damage to vehicles, accidents, extra emissions and more than 1.3 billion hours in additional journey time as the result of bad roads.

Douglas McWilliams, the economist who conducted the research for the CEBR and recently completed the Peking-to-Paris car rally, says: ""My take is that our roads are now worse for potholes than anywhere on that rally, apart from the far west of China and Mongolia, and notably worse than in both Russia and Kazakhstan - let alone western Europe.""

How did it get this bad?

We motorists tend to think of roads as horizontal. But from an engineering point of view they are very short and extremely wide vertical structures. Take a cross section of your local road and you'd see three distinct layers. At the bottom is the compacted subgrade soil. The middle layer, or road base, is graded gravel that will likely have been mixed with cement. On top is a covering of permeable asphalt.

That all sounds relatively simple, but there can be quite large variation in both the quality of the materials and techniques used to build the roads. And, according to Dr Benyi Cao, a research fellow at the Royal Academy of Engineering, the UK has quite the reputation for scrimping on both compared with other European countries.

For example, after compacting the subgrade level, road builders will conduct quality control for water content to ensure that the base is neither too wet nor too dry. But there's a big difference in testing every few hundred metres, which Cao says would be considered best practice, and every mile or so, as sometimes happens. Similarly, if the road base isn't thick enough it will be more prone to flexing, resulting in cracks quickly appearing on the surface. Lower quality bitumen will become brittle more quickly.

Morrell, who worked in the utilities industry for 25 years before becoming a campaigner, has seen first-hand how road-building standards have slipped. ""When I had to dig up roads in London that were built 50 or 60 years ago it would break my heart. Those guys knew how to build roads that would last.""

Potholes start to develop because fatigue cracking, ageing asphalt and/or poor drainage results in water entering and remaining in the subgrade and base layers. The weather obviously presents its challenges. As you may have noticed, it rains a lot in the UK. Surface flooding is getting worse because of ""urban sprawl"", poorly maintained drains and climate change. The temperature also bounces around 0C (32F) for months at a time, creating a continuous freeze-thaw cycle during which water will repeatedly expand and contract, forcing cracks farther apart.

British roads are also among the busiest in the world. Lots of freight travels by lorry or van because the rail network is so unreliable. We're buying increasing numbers of SUVs and electric cars, which are heavier and therefore put more stress on the roads. Research by University College London suggests that the increasing reliance on satnavs is resulting in heavier traffic on minor country roads and urban ""rat runs"".

The UK also has more ducts and pipes carrying our gas, electricity, water and broadband laid under the roads than in other countries. Frequent excavations by utility companies and their poor-quality repairs further diminish the integrity of the carriageway. Some 55 per cent of all potholes in urban areas are caused by utilities digging up the roads.

Responsibility shifted to utility firms

Part of the issue is a little-known change in the law in 1991. Prior to this, companies had to pay highway authorities to repair roads after they'd been dug up. Westminster council charged £120 per square metre for this work. But under the New Roads and Street Work Act of 1991, utilities could reinstate their own openings. Costs dropped to an estimated £40 per square metre.

In theory the savings should have resulted in lower bills (or fatter margins for the utility companies). But the change in the law clearly had a number of unintended consequences. First, utility companies became less hesitant about digging up roads. Second, it was clearly in their interests to repair the damage they caused as cheaply as possible. And, third, the councils lost an important source of revenue that many in the industry believe was subsidising their other road maintenance work.

Politicians are now having to deal with the fallout. When he was transport secretary, Chris Grayling promised to make utilities put their pipes under pavements rather than roads - until it was quietly pointed out that utilities would love to do that, because it would vastly improve access, but unfortunately there's not enough space. Grant Shapps, one of Grayling's successors, threatened to slap companies that bodge their repairs with financial penalties. But this relies on councils having enough inspectors to assess the work. And, because of budget cuts, many don't.

Funding shortfalls

Successive governments have been squeezing local authority budgets for decades. Statistics from the Covid years can be fairly misleading. But the trends from before the pandemic tell a clear tale. Central government grants to local authorities have collapsed from £46.5 billion in 2009/10 to £28 billion in 2019/20 in today's prices, according to the Institute for Government.

Part of this 40 per cent drop was offset by increases in council tax. But even when this is taken into account, local authorities are staring down the barrel at an average funding shortfall of nearly 18 per cent. Many have understandably prioritised schools and children's social care, meaning the axe has fallen particularly hard on things such as road maintenance.

""Roads don't collapse dramatically, they just progressively get worse and worse, so it is easier to kick the can down the road a bit farther when times are hard,"" Rick Green, the chairman of the AIA, told The Telegraph last year. This is precisely what's happened.

Recent analysis by the Local Government Association (LGA) found that this reduction in funding to repair local roads was bigger than in almost every other country in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development club of wealthy nations, resulting in the UK falling from ""top to almost bottom of the league"" over two decades, according to Shaun Davies, the chairman of the LGA. Only Italy and Ireland had cut their budgets by a similar amount over that time, while the United States, Japan, New Zealand, Sweden and Denmark had all increased theirs by more than half.

There are various ways to crunch the numbers on this. Despite the Government's claim that the £8.3 billion diverted from HS2 would pay for the resurfacing of 5,000 miles of road, we know that just 1,123 miles of road were resurfaced in the 2021/22 financial year, compared with 1,588 miles in 2017/18, according to research conducted by the RAC based on government data. That's a drop of 29 per cent. Multiply that by 11 and you get 5,115 miles - more than the HS2 money will pay for.

Or you can look at the combined annual funding shortfall in the road maintenance budgets of local authorities in England and Wales. This now adds up to £1.3 billion, according to the AIA. If you again multiple that number by 11 you get to a figure of £14.3 billion. So, even with the HS2 money added to the pot, there's still a £6 billion gap.

""The Government is pushing this narrative of record investment in our roads,"" says one transport expert. ""But it doesn't make up for the cumulative cuts in funding that have been made over the years.""

Inadequate fixes

The result has been an over-reliance on patching potholes and making repairs rather than resurfacing roads, says Dix. Again, this can be done badly or well. The quickest and cheapest method involves shovelling cold-lay Tarmac into a hole, which workmen then, in the words of Morrell, ""tread down with their size nines"". Using hot Tarmac is marginally better. Cutting out a section of the road and then compressing hot Tarmac into the neat hole is best.

But if a pothole has formed, it almost certainly means the integrity of the road surface is already compromised. It will therefore only be a matter of time before the repair wears out or a new hole appears close by. The AIA likens patching to ""icing a rotten cake"". Edmund King, the president of the AA, says: ""Currently we often have a vicious circle of pothole formed, damage caused, pothole patched, pothole reappears with more damage caused - when what we need are more permanent repairs.""

What's to be done? The NIC has recommended councils outside London receive five-year budgets for road maintenance and that total funding be increased from £6.5 billion a year to £8 billion. The RAC has also been calling for a fundamental overhaul in how road maintenance is funded, perhaps by ring-fencing a proportion of the money the Treasury raises from fuel duty. Both proposals would provide councils with the longer-term certainty needed to better plan programmes rather than having to cope with ""boom and bust"" funding cycles.

New technology

Researchers are working on innovative solutions to our pothole problems. Rubberised asphalt, for example, adds shredded tyres to the bitumen mix in order to make the road surface more elastic and stop it cracking so easily. Some councils are already experimenting with adding a graphene-based material to asphalt. This is about a fifth more expensive but lasts twice as long.

A company called Roadmole makes a remote-controlled contraption that cuts circular sections out of the road surface around potholes rather than the usual squares, whose corners can become weak points for water seepage. The JCB Pothole Pro can fix a pothole in just eight minutes at a cost of £30. Stoke-on-Trent City Council's highways team is the first in the country to use this bit of kit and is already exceeding its repair targets.

The Nu-phalt Thermal Road Repair heats up a damaged patch of the road to recycle existing macadam and ensure it bonds better with new material. Then there's the Kiely Multipatcher from Australia, which needs only one person to operate it, combines pothole repair with small-scale surface dressing, and can mend about 100ft of road in under three minutes.

More Tomorrow's World solutions include a ""self-healing"" asphalt with steel fibres and epoxy capsules infused in the materials that repairs itself when heat is applied. Capsules containing bacteria can also be added to cement-based road materials. When they crack, the bacteria are released and start producing calcite (a form of limestone) as a natural byproduct of their metabolism.

Cao is experimenting with using ground-source heating and cooling systems to help regulate the temperature of the road surface to stop it melting in the summer and to break the freeze-thaw cycle in the winter.

However, Dix warns that the authorities need to remain mindful of more basic fixes. ""There are lots of things we can do [to prevent potholes], but digging drains by the side of the road should be first on the list,"" she says.

Whether the solutions are cutting edge or more rudimentary, they all cost money. There's not a lot of that to go around at the moment. But the alternative is, well, just take your car for a drive, your bike for a ride, or tune in to French television, to see what systematic under-investment looks like.

BRUSSELS, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Amid lush greenery, fragrant flowers, and the gentle murmur of grazing flocks of sheep lies an endless array of photovoltaic panels, creating a mesmerizing scene of sustainable energy production at the Francisco Pizarro photovoltaic (PV) plant in southwest Spain.

The Iberdrola group, a leading Spanish multinational electric utility company, inaugurated the plant, Europe's largest, in 2022. With around 1.5 million solar panels imported from China, the plant's clean energy output is substantial, catering to the needs of 334,000 households and creating over 1,500 jobs.

As exemplified by the Spanish PV plant, China's rapid progress in the renewable energy sector has played a pivotal role in advancing the European Union's (EU) green transition.

The European Green Deal, launched by the European Commission in 2019, targets net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. To achieve this, the EU has pledged to increase the binding renewable energy share to at least 42.5 percent by 2030. However, with the current renewable energy share at approximately 23 percent, innovation is urgently needed.

Walburga Hemetsberger, CEO of SolarPower Europe, an association for the European solar PV sector, has warned that Europe must ramp up its solar deployment to meet the necessary targets, while WindEurope, a major wind energy association, also stressed the need for immediate action.

China's green energy equipment manufacturing industry is well-established and competitive. Chinese solar products and wind turbines would be indispensible for EU to achieve its 2030 emission reduction targets, said Qin Yan, a lead analyst at Refinitiv and researcher at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies.

In fact, many European countries have reaped the benefits of green energy collaboration with China in recent years.

Pedro Amaral Jorge, president of the Portuguese Renewable Energy Association, highlighted the growing cooperation between China and Portugal in the solar energy sector, as Portugal aims to install approximately 8 gigawatts (GW) of solar power by 2026 or 2027 and reach 22 GW by 2030.

""To achieve the objectives set for increasing installed capacity, cooperation with China must increase,"" Jorge told Xinhua in an interview.

In Croatia, the Chinese-built Senj Wind Farm, inaugurated in December 2021, produces about 530 million kilowatt-hours (kWh) of green electricity each year and reduces Croatia's carbon dioxide emissions by about 460,000 tonnes per year.

""These are projects where the benefit of cooperation with large countries like China, which have the knowledge and potential to realize such large projects, can be seen,"" said Mladen Plese, Croatian political analyst and Asia expert, in an interview with Xinhua.

For Zlatko Prpic, chief engineer of the Senj Wind Farm, the project, the largest of its kind in Croatia so far, represents a ""miracle"" and a shining example of China-Croatia cooperation.

China's Norinco International, a civil engineering company, has been the main contractor and builder of the farm.

As Croatia and the EU ramp up their transition to green and renewable energy, it presents a significant opportunity for Norinco International and other Chinese firms to demonstrate their cutting-edge technology and equipment in large-scale projects, Prpic said.

The United Nations has urged countries to accelerate the transition to an affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy system by investing in renewable energy resources, prioritizing energy efficient practices, and adopting clean energy technologies and infrastructure.

In the global drive towards a greener future, China assumes a pivotal role in facilitating the transition for both developed and developing nations, experts said.

""The future of Europe and the world hinges on them,"" said Plese, underlining the necessity for a united front transcending borders and political affiliations in combating climate change.

""China is developing technology and we need the cooperation of Chinese companies in that area as well,"" he said. ""Croatia has the potential for similar green energy projects and cooperation with China is still welcome.""

The 2021 report from the China Chamber of Commerce to the EU highlighted the impressive growth of China's PV cells and modules industry over the past decade. With affordable prices and significant economies of scale, Chinese enterprises emerge as the prime choice to complement the EU industrial chain, meeting the region's escalating demand for PV products.

Converting the roof of Brussels' 130-year-old Marche des Abattoirs into one adorned with solar panels from China and high-power density inverters produced by Chinese telecom giant Huawei, the Belgian renewable energy specialist ESE Group demonstrates the efficacy of these products in sustainable energy solutions.

The project involves the installation of 5,400 solar panels on the building's 10,000-square-meter steel roof. Under the Belgian regulations on the preservation of cultural heritage, the look and feel of the original building cannot be altered, so the design team at ESE customized a batch of special solar panels manufactured in China.

""It is a very good example of how to secure a listed building by using state-of-the-art architectural solutions,"" said Paul Thielemans, director of public relations at the Anderlecht Abattoir.

Climate change cooperation, which enjoys bright prospects, has emerged as a focal point in the comprehensive strategic partnership between China and Europe.

In April, a delegation of climate envoys from the EU and member states including France, Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark visited China and had productive discussions with their Chinese counterparts. Both sides were committed to intensifying climate dialogue and cooperation to bolster global climate governance.

Oxford has a severe housing problem. With house prices 12 times the average salary, it has become one of the least affordable cities in the country. Its council house waiting list has grown to more than 3,000 households, with many having to live in temporary accommodation. An obvious solution is to build more homes, but those trying to do this face a big barrier: electricity. ""When I talk to developers or potential developers, one of the first questions they now ask me is about grid capacity,"" says Susan Brown, leader of Oxford city council. With housing developments competing for power against energy-hungry tech companies and the city's increasingly electrified transport network, connection prospects are a matter of concern for housebuilders. ""The problem [for developers] is securing sufficient energy, and the time it takes to connect to the grid,"" Brown says.

Here's what they did next,"As caretakers on the epic Kerry island for six months, Emily Campbell and Daniel Regan were taken by the simple life, and found it hard to adjust back to city living

How would you survive for six months living on the edge of Europe without electricity or running water? Teachers Emma Melay and Darren McFadden are now finding out, after beating off thousands of applicants to become this year's caretakers of the Great Blasket Island. They are now the island's only permanent residents and for six months they will run its three holiday cottages and coffee shop. The island, once home to author Peig Sayers, was deserted in the 1950s, but got a new lease of life in 2014, when Billy O'Connor and his partner Alice Hayes began renting out the holiday cottages.

Emily Campbell and Daniel Regan know exactly what's in store for the island's newest residents as they were last year's caretakers. They left the island in October and say the experience has changed their lives.

Campbell, from Bandon, Co Cork, was working in Great Ormond Street Hospital and Londoner Regan was working as a civil engineer, when they swapped city life for the windswept island almost 5km from the tip of the Dingle peninsula. The couple had always wanted to visit the island but had never expected to be chosen as caretakers.

""It was such a shock when we got the job - we were delighted and terrified,"" Campbell recalls.

Not surprisingly, it took them a bit of time to get used to their new surroundings. ""It can be really tough work at times, and it takes some adjusting at the beginning,"" she says. A small wind turbine provides enough power to charge a phone, but they were reliant on candles and stoves for light and heat.

""The simple convenience of flicking on a light switch is gone but that is what makes things so special. For us, the sudden shift in environment was really welcomed and we were just so grateful every day to be there.""

And the inclement weather didn't dampen their enthusiasm. ""Even when the wild Atlantic storms roll in it's a truly breathtaking place. You're at the mercy of the sea and the weather and that was a very humbling and enjoyable experience for us,"" Campbell recalls. ""Waking up in the night to the sound of Manx shearwater [seabirds] roosting, seeing the seals on the beach have their pups, watching basking sharks feed in the bay, and the lambs play in the fields - it can be so idyllic and magical there.""

So what advice would they have for the new caretakers? Campbell says they have already been in touch with their successors and they seem to be settling in well. ""I think we mostly told Emma and Darren to bring good-quality waterproofs and wellies, and to enjoy,"" she says. ""It's such a brilliant time and I don't think anything we would have said could prepare you for it.""

The new caretakers must adapt to having no fridge or freezer, something Campbell and Regan struggled with when the temperatures rose.

[ Couple on career break from teaching to become this year's caretakers on Great Blasket Island ]

""Billy and Alice were amazing, though, and in the height of summer ferried out fresh milk and ice packs every day.""

Asked if there were any other challenges, Campbell says most visitors were just delighted to experience the island but some did not keep a respectful distance from the seal colony.

""Like with any heritage site or national park, sometimes it can be taken for granted how lucky we are to share the space with the natural wildlife, so we really struggled when people got too close,"" she says. ""It's such a sight to behold and, in our opinion, a national treasure, but a lot of people aren't aware of how easy it can be to distress or spook them, so that was something we were quite passionate about, working with the Office of Public Works and the National Parks and Wildlife Service to try and rally for more education and protective measures.""

And what was the best bit of the experience? ""The nature,"" she says. ""Going for swims and hikes, and fishing for mackerel in the summer. It was so nice to enjoy eating meals outside and appreciating everything we had. Because it's so difficult to get things on and off the island, the fresh bag of groceries is something you savour and don't take for granted.""

Campbell loved meeting the day-trippers who called to the coffee shop, as well as the guests who stayed for longer. ""We met some incredible people and heard the best stories, and really made some friends for life.""

I think it truly teaches you to enjoy the little things in life and savour all of the small moments, to cherish interactions and respect the environment and the beautiful world we live in

-- Emily Campbell

Being alone on a deserted island sounds like a plot for a horror movie, but she says they never felt uneasy when they had no overnight guests. ""We loved being there alone, even though you're always in the company of all the sheep and other wildlife. It was a magical feeling to have the freedom of knowing for a short time you have this beautiful, vast space to yourself.""

And they never knew when they might have company. She remembers a sea kayaker from Cornwall unexpectedly landing on the beach, just before a storm.

""He was circumnavigating Ireland in his kayak. Mikey ended up camping on the island for two nights. We had the best time sharing meals with him, in exchange for some incredible stories of how he was taking on new challenges after retirement.""

She says the Blasket experience has definitely changed their outlook on life. ""I think it truly teaches you to enjoy the little things in life and savour all of the small moments, to cherish interactions and respect the environment and the beautiful world we live in.""

Not being able to run to the shop also made the couple more resourceful in the kitchen. ""There's been some interesting recipes created from the Blasket days, and we still say things like 'will we do the Blasket curry tonight?'""

[ Travel The new Blasket Island caretakers applied three times for the 'unique opportunity' ]

They found it very strange to be back on the bustling streets of London after they left the island in October. But it wasn't for long, as they spent two months in Lombok and Bali in Indonesia, while they decided what to do next.

Now they are living in an old scout cabin at a lake, half an hour from Copenhagen in Denmark.

""It's perfect for us because we can work, but we're also surrounded by nature and fresh air,"" Campbell says. ""Our landlord gave us fair warning before moving in that it can be rustic and cold, but when we explained about living on the island, he was quickly reassured.""

Regan is still working as a civil engineer while Campbell is working as a nanny and learning Danish with a view to getting a nursing job.

""We're just taking it as it comes, enjoying Denmark and we've lots of plans to tour Scandinavia and see where the future takes us,"" she says.

""The dream would be to live in our own version of the Blaskets someday. We look back now with such fond memories.

The DWP is looking at alternatives that could see ""stopping regular cash payments"", which can reach up to £737 a month, and instead providing other forms of support for disabled people.

PIP is the main disability benefit for those of working age, although some people still receive its precursor, the Disability Living Allowance. Demand for the benefit is seeing 70,000 new applications each month.

This has led the DWP to voice concerns about the existing system's ""sustainability"". It is exploring ""improved models of assessment, treatment and support.""

Read next: DWP confirms payment boost for eight benefits due to start this month Read next: DWP can pay up to £434 per month to anyone with these 10 common conditions

In a Green Paper outlining potential changes, the DWP said it has considered PIP equivalents in other countries to find potential improvements to support people with with disabilities, BirminghamLive reports. The document said: ""We want to consider whether supporting people through direct, regular cash payments is still the best approach, or whether other approaches would better target our resources, delivering the right support to the people who need it most. We want to know whether there are potentially groups of people who might need more than the current system provides, and what kinds of support they need.""

It continued: ""Different models are used in other countries. For instance, in New Zealand, people submit supporting medical evidence verifying their health condition and also provide estimates of their additional costs (e.g., £50 per month for physiotherapy), which are then approved for an ongoing award. In Denmark, awards for extra costs are determined on a case-by-case basis and issued by local government.

""In the United Kingdom, we have had a predominantly cash transfer system for extra costs since the introduction of Attendance Allowance and Mobility Allowance in the 1970s. Given there are other models of support used internationally, and the changes in disability benefit caseloads over time, we think it is right to ask about other models of support and the impact of these approaches, including stopping regular cash payments, if they were to be adopted here.""

What are the PIP equivalents overseas and how do they work?

France

Payment: Five elements at different rates based on actual costs.

Assessment: Yes, usually in person.

The French system (Prestation de compensation du handicap or FR-PCH), offers financial assistance to cover additional costs associated with loss of independence due to disability. To qualify, individuals must show an absolute difficulty in performing one of five areas: mobility, personal conversation, communication, tasks and general requirements, and relationships with others, or a 'serious difficulty' (requiring assistance) in at least two of these activities.

While FR-PCH is not means-tested, it does consider income. It comprises five parts, each paid at varying rates: human aids, technical aids, housing adaptations, transport assistance, and animal help.

Applications for FR-PCH are made online and require a medical certificate less than a year old. Assessments are typically conducted in person by multi-disciplinary teams including professionals such as clinicians, social workers, and academics.

People are evaluated using a scoring guide for disability assessment and impairment. They are also required to submit a 'life plan', detailing their goals and what they wish to achieve but currently cannot due to their disability.

Following an evaluation, individuals are given a personalised compensation plan, devised by the professional panel, which outlines the duration of each component. Support can go beyond financial assessment and is largely influenced by the life plan. FR-PCH can be granted for life if a person's condition cannot improve, or for a maximum period of 10 years if this is not the case.

Denmark

Payment: Monthly sum based on actual costs.

Assessment: Yes.

The DK-MTV (Merudgiftsydelse Til Voksne) is a monthly cash benefit distributed at a local level, designed to help people with the additional costs associated with disability. The aim of the benefit is to help individuals achieve a quality of life equal to others of the same age and circumstance.

There is a focus on providing people with the opportunity to decide how best to meet their needs. While the state has overall responsibility for the benefit, it is distributed by entities equivalent to local authorities.

DK-MTV is intended to cover necessary additional costs, with no maximum award. Costs must reach a minimum threshold for eligibility. A full list of costs is not provided, but may include medicine, commuting to work, leisure activities and disability-oriented courses.

The process of benefit localisation means that assessment procedures can vary slightly, but generally, individuals submit a written application and are assigned a social worker who helps identify their needs. The award is determined on an individual basis by the social worker, who also decides what evidence is required.

This could include notes from a GP, or meetings with the individual and healthcare professionals. In cases where the need is evident, such as for amputees, the assessment can be conducted solely by the social worker without the need for additional evidence.

Norway

Payment: Monthly amount with six rates based on actual costs.

Assessment: Yes, on paper.

In Norway, disability support is provided through the Basic Benefit (NO-BB). This is a monthly cash payment at one of six set rates designed to cover, fully or partially, extra expenses incurred due to illness, injury or congenital defects and disabilities.

Assessments are carried out on paper without a face-to-face evaluation. Individuals must provide a letter from their own GP detailing the nature of their condition and the associated extra costs, and receipts may also be required.

IAdditional expenses related to a medical condition such as a permanent injury, illness or functional impairment must be sustained for 2-3 years. Individuals can receive financial aid for various needs including the use of assistive technology (like electricity required for charging a wheelchair), transport costs, special diet foods, clothing, bedding, and shoes. A doctor contracted to the Norwegian equivalent of DWP reviews the evidence and makes the final decision on entitlement.

Sweden

Payment: Monthly amount with three rates based on actual costs.

Assessment: Yes, on paper.

In Sweden, a monthly cash payment is provided at one of three set rates for individuals who have a disability or illness and consequently require assistance or have extra expenses. To qualify, the disability should be expected to last for at least a year.

Additional costs are those that arise due to the disability and exceed what is anticipated for people of the same age. These costs cover a broad range divided into seven categories: health, medicines and foods; wear and tear and cleaning; travel costs; assistive devices; assistance in daily life; housing; or other purposes (additional costs which do not meet the above criteria).

To apply, individuals complete an online form and calculate their extra costs, before submitting a medical statement describing their disability. Costs can be estimated online using data provided by the Social Security Insurance Agency.

Individuals have the option to verbally detail their costs instead of submitting them with their application. The form is then evaluated to ensure that the costs stated are due to a disability, exceed what is expected in non-disabled individuals of the same age (using information from agencies such as the Swedish consumer agency), and that the cost is reasonable or fair.

USA

Payment: Monthly sum which is means-tested.

Assessment: Yes, may include medical examination.

There are two federal disability benefits in the USA. Supplemental Security Income (SSI) is the one most similar to PIP.

This is a monthly payment given to adults who have a disability or blindness and have little or no income and resources. It takes into account the individual's ability to work and their earnings. It can be paid to people who are working, but their income is considered.

Disability is assessed based on:

The individual's current work activity (if any). A person must demonstrate they are unable to engage in substantial gainful activity, measured as a varying amount of monthly income based on impairment type; The severity of their impairment(s); A determination of whether their impairment(s) meets or medically equals an entry on the list (see below); The individual's ability to perform their past relevant work; Their ability to do other work based on age, education, and work experience.

There is a list of eligible conditions split into 14 categories. If a person's condition is on the list, that is usually enough to establish that a person who is not working is disabled. If a person's condition is not on the list, the assessor moves on to the next step and applies other rules in order to resolve the issue of disability.

People apply through an online form, telephone or at a social security office, and are asked to provide their medical history, contact details for medical professionals and give permission to access medical records. They are also asked to provide their work history for the past two years and evidence of any other financial resources.

If the medical evidence is unavailable or insufficient to determine eligibility for SSI, they may be asked to attend a consultative examination. SSI is paid by the federal government. Many states pay a supplemental benefit to people in addition to the federal payments.

Other states manage their own programs and make their payments separately. More information can be found on SSI at the US Social Security website here.

New Zealand

Payment: Weekly or fortnightly amount which is means-tested and based on actual costs.

Assessment: No.

The New Zealand Disability Allowance (NZ-DA) is designed to assist individuals with the ongoing, additional costs associated with having a disability expected to last at least six months. Applications can be made online or via a paper form and, unlike PIP, applicants are not assessed but are categorised based on their health-related needs.

The amount of Disability Allowance paid is calculated based on actual extra costs. These costs must be confirmed by the individual's health practitioner as being a result of the person's disability, ongoing, and necessary and therapeutically beneficial for the individual.

Costs that can be covered include clothing, counselling, medical alarms, gym/swimming pool fees, power (gas and heating), special foods and prescriptions. All costs must be supported by relevant evidence in the form of receipts, tickets and bills.

This is a means-tested benefit with limits based on age, childcare needs and whether the person is part of a couple. The disability allowance is directly deposited into the individual's bank account weekly or fortnightly, based on the extra costs submitted.",cambridge-news.co.uk,news,Cambridge News Online,"David Bentley, Cait Findlay",0.3803921568627451,452572209,4,https://i2-prod.cambridge-news.co.uk/news/cost-of-living/article29112159.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_doctor-with-patient.jpg,eng-9540757
