The move enables the offshore wind research lease, located about 28 nautical miles off Maine, to advance. Maine has 30 calendar days to accept, reject or request modifications to the lease.

""Floating wind technology can make offshore wind a reality in the Gulf of Maine,"" said BOEM Director Elizabeth Klein. ""BOEM will continue to work in partnership with the state of Maine as we move forward to facilitate the responsible development of offshore wind in this region, as well as the deployment of floating offshore wind technology nationwide.""

The state requested the research lease in October 2021 to study floating offshore wind energy technology and its deployment. If developed, the site would include up to 12 floating offshore wind turbines capable of generating up to 144 megawatts (MW) of renewable energy, according to BOEM.

The U.S. aims to have 30 gigawatts (GW) of offshore wind capacity by 2030 and 15 GW of floating wind capacity by 2035.

Here's a look at other renewable energy news this week.

Waga Energy and Engie signed a biomethane purchase agreement (BPA) for renewable natural gas produced at the Veolia site in Claye-Souilly near Paris, Waga said on May 29.

The 13-year contract, which is the longest BPA signed to date in France, values the biomethane at a higher price than the subsidized tariff, Waga said in a news release. ""This enables Waga Energy to secure financing for the production unit through a long-term credit facility with the banks CIC and Arkéa Banque Entreprises et Institutionnels,"" the company said.

The contract took effect May 1.

Up to 120 gigawatt hours (GWh) of RNG, equivalent to the consumption of 20,000 households, is produced annually at the Veolia site, according to Waga.

""Veolia is a key player in the production of bioenergy, already producing 1.6 terawatt-hour of biogas from waste anaerobic digestion in France alone,"" Veolia CEO Estelle Brachlianoff said. ""Through this partnership with Waga Energy and Engie, we are contributing to the development of a genuine green gas production industry at the European level, essential for the ecological transformation.""

Energy storage provider Torus will provide 26 megawatt hours (MWh) of energy storage capacity across a portion of real estate developer Gardner Group's portfolio, equivalent to powering nearly 1,000 homes for a full day.

Under a landmark deal, Torus will install its Torus Station energy storage and management system at Gardner's multiple properties, the company announced May 29.

The Torus Stations will integrate ""advanced"" battery and flywheel energy storage systems with Torus' software platform.

Torus said the integration enables energy management and demand response capabilities and connects renewable energy sources and electric vehicle charging infrastructure.

The systems will be manufactured at Torus' South Salt Lake City, Utah, facility and are expected to begin installation in fourth-quarter 2024 with completion by first-quarter 2026.

""Partnering with Torus allows us to optimize our energy management, reduce our carbon footprint and provide enhanced value to our tenants,"" said Christian Gardner, CEO of Gardner Group. ""We look forward to the positive impact this project will have on our properties and the broader community.""

Verbund, an Austria-based electricity company, partnered with TotalEnergies and EREN Groupe joint venture company TE H2 to study implementation of a green hydrogen project in Tunisia.

Called H2 Notos, hydrogen would be produced with electrolyzers powered by onshore wind and solar energy with desalinated sea water, TotalEnergies said May 28. Ambitions are to initially produce 200,000 tons of green hydrogen per year, potentially scaling up to 1 million tons per year.

""H2 Notos has the potential to become a significant supplier of green hydrogen for Europe while fostering significant jobs creation in Tunisia,"" said TE H2 CEO David Corchia. ""We are entering into a phase of greenfield development and major technical work to assess the feasibility of the project and we will need to further deepen the highly constructive and fruitful collaboration we have enjoyed with the national and local authorities through H2 Notos.""

The hydrogen will access the European market via the SoutH2 Corridor hydrogen pipeline, which is expected to be commissioned around 2030. The pipeline connects North Africa to Italy, Austria and Germany.

Verbund will coordinate the transport of hydrogen toward Central Europe, according to the release, while TE H2 and Verbund will jointly develop, finance, construct and operate the project, according to the release.

Italy, Germany and Austria have signed an agreement to cooperate on the development of a network to transport hydrogen from the southern Mediterranean to northern Europe, the energy ministries of the three countries said on May 30.

The official announcement marks a concrete step in the European Union's strategy to secure renewable hydrogen supplies by 2030 to help decarbonize its most polluting industries.

""The Southern Hydrogen Corridor will provide renewable hydrogen imports from North Africa via southern Italy and further connect to the major hydrogen demand hubs in Italy, Austria and Germany,"" the German ministry said in a statement.

The link dubbed SoutH2, which last year won priority status from the European Commission, is considered important to develop a European market for renewable fuel.

A group of companies, including Italian gas grid operator Snam, have teamed up to build the SoutH2 pipeline by the beginning of the next decade, with a financial commitment of more than 4 billion euros ($4.3 billion).

EDP Renewables North America has completed its 175-MW Crooked Lake Solar Park in Arkansas, the company said May 29.

Located near Blytheville in Mississippi County, the solar park is expected to generate enough electricity to power the equivalent of about 30,000 Arkansas homes annually. The solar park is the latest utility-scale addition for EDPR, which now has facilities in 19 U.S. states.

""We're proud to continue our expansion in the South with a focus on serving the clean energy needs of Arkansas,"" stated EDP Renewables North America CEO Sandhya Ganapathy. ""By providing sustainable energy to Mississippi County and the surrounding area, we are generating economic growth and grid stability for generations to come in the region.""

The solar park, located on an approximately 1,800-acre site, utilizes single-axis tracking photovoltaic panels.

Florida-based Apricus Generation has acquired a controlling interest in Nexus Renewables, a solar and energy storage developer, according to a May 29 news release.

Nexus, which has a pipeline of about 500 MW of solar and energy storage projects in North America, is the first strategic acquisition of Apricus. The holding company launched earlier this year.

""As with many independent developers, Nexus has more project opportunities than access to capital,"" said Gautam Chandra, executive chairman and co-founder of Apricus Generation. ""By joining Apricus, they now have access to capital and expertise that will allow them to execute on their pipeline.""

New Jersey officials said the state will receive $125 million from a legal settlement with Denmark's Ørsted over the company's cancellation last year of two offshore wind farm projects.

The New Jersey Board of Public Utilities said in a statement that the funds will be used for investments in wind component manufacturing facilities and wind farms.

The settlement comes nearly seven months after Ørsted said it would stop developing the Ocean Wind 1 and 2 projects off the coast of New Jersey as it struggled with soaring costs and supply chain delays.

The cancellations triggered an angry response from New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy, who is banking on offshore wind to help achieve the state's climate change goals.

His administration said it would speed up the state's plans to procure additional offshore wind capacity by soliciting bids for new projects in the second quarter of 2025, more than a year ahead of schedule.

The utility regulator also said it would pause an offshore wind transmission planning effort with the regional power grid operator, PJM Interconnection, while it considers the impact of a new rule from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that reforms how large power lines are approved and paid for.",hartenergy.com,news,Hart Energy,,0.2549019607843137,454876280,1,https://www.hartenergy.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_650x650/public/image/2024/05/et-roundup_0.jpg?itok=wJmtyrgu,

The growth of the global Electric Vehicle Battery Recycling Market is driven by the growing demand for zero-emission vehicles and recycled products & materials. Market growth is further supplemented by the availability of finite metal resources and the surge in middle-class employment. However, the high-cost to initialize recycling plants and the rise in re-use of EV batteries hamper the market growth. Nonetheless, the increase in subsidies to encourage battery recycling along with high recycling gap would provide lucrative opportunities for emerging market players in the near future.

Request Sample Pages: www.alliedmarketresearch.com/request-sample/5216

Recycling of EV batteries involves processes such as collecting, dismantling, processing, and more. Approximately, 15 jobs are created per thousand tons of lithium-ion battery waste, for collecting, dismantling, and recycling these batteries. Out of these 15 jobs, 20% of jobs are for the recycling of batteries and 80% are for collecting and dismantling lithium-ion batteries. This increases the job opportunities in the industry. This growth might be fueled by the government initiatives such as subsidies on the sales of electric vehicles, which eventually result in increase in sales of the battery of the electric vehicle. Therefore, increase in job opportunities involved in the recycling process of these batteries drives the electric vehicle battery recycling market growth.

Key Market Players:

LI-CYCLE CORP., G & P BATTERIES, FLORIDIENNE (SNAM S.A.S.), RETRIEV TECHNOLOGIES, UMICORE, SITRASA, ACCUREC RECYCLING GMBH, BATTERY SOLUTIONS, RECUPYL, AMERICAN MANGANESE INC.

By application, the electric buses segment is expected to dominate the global market during the forecast period and occupy almost half of the total share. This is attributed to the growing adoption of alternative fuel technologies in commercial vehicles such as buses, which offer zero emission, better acceleration, and quiet operation. However, the energy storage systems segment is projected to register the highest CAGR of 47.8% from 2018 to 2025, on account of remanufacturing of lithium-ion batteries to provide a second-life with 70-80% charging capabilities.

However, electric vehicles require high-performance batteries to operate efficiently. Hence, such batteries, which are removed from the vehicles are able to charge and discharge to a specific point, which is around 70% to 80%. Instead of recycling these batteries which have reached its end of the life stage and are removed from the vehicle, the battery cells can be re manufactured and the cells can be given a second life in storage applications. For instance, Toyota and Chubu Electric Power Co. will be constructing a large-capacity storage battery system that reuses recycled batteries from Toyota electric vehicles to construct storage battery system. This hampers the growth of the electric vehicle battery recycling market.

Regional Analysis:

LAMEA is expected to grow at the fastest CAGR of 46.1% during the forecast period, owing to the high adoption rate of advanced electric vehicle systems in commercial vehicles. Moreover, the rise in vehicle emission standards in this region and growth in demand for fuel-efficient and eco-friendly technologies supplement the growth. Meanwhile, Asia-Pacific is anticipated to remain the dominant region by 2025, generating almost half of the global revenue. This is due to high adoption rates of smart mobility services, increased government regulations, surge in fuel prices, and rise in trend toward adopting non-fossil fuel-based vehicles.

Increase in global concerns regarding the negative effect of climate change along with alarming pollution levels recorded in the major cities have created a significant demand for electric vehicles. The demand for fuel-efficient vehicles has increased recently owing to rise in price of petrol and diesel. Thus, these factors increase the need for advanced fuel-efficient technologies, leading to surge in demand for electrically powered vehicles for travel, which generate demand for the batteries. These batteries are recycled once they reach end of their life. The first batch of batteries from electric and hybrid vehicles have reached their retirement age. The total number of batteries retired from electric bus and car equals to around 55,000 units and is expected to be recycled in 2018. Thus, increase in demand for electric vehicles drives the growth of the EV battery recycling market.

· Acquisition of a 26.1% interest in LNEnergy Limited (""LNEnergy""), built in stages throughout 2023 for a total consideration of £4.3m (£1.9 million of which was in cash and the balance in 1,297,297,298 new Reabold shares). LNEnergy's primary asset is an exclusive option over a 90% interest in the Colle Santo gas field, a highly material gas resource with an estimated 65bcf of 2P reserves, with two production wells already drilled and a development-ready field, subject to approvals and permits. Financing and approvals are progressing well for the liquified natural gas (""LNG"") field development.

· Cash of £5.4 million as at 31 December 2023; net assets of £42.2 million

Reabold Resources plc has a diversified portfolio of exploration, appraisal and development oil & gas projects. Reabold's strategy is to invest in low-risk, near-term projects which it considers to have significant valuation uplift potential, with a clear monetisation plan, where receipt of such proceeds will be returned to shareholders and re-invested into further growth projects. This strategy is illustrated by the recent sale of the undeveloped Victory gas field to Shell, the proceeds of which are being returned to shareholders and re-invested.

In the financial year ended 31 December 2023, Reabold continued with its strategy of identifying, investing in, maturing and monetising undeveloped gas discoveries with significant resources and near-term production potential. Our emphasis is on investing in UK and European gas assets to enhance domestic energy supply and security, which has been exposed in recent years by the Ukraine war. The sale of the Victory strategic gas project to Shell U.K. Limited (""Shell"") in late 2022 reaffirmed our view that there is further opportunity for value creation by applying our strategy to similar assets. Portfolio activity undertaken in 2023 reflects this approach; Reabold reinvested some of the proceeds from the Victory transaction into a significant new opportunity in Italy, the Colle Santo onshore gas field, and continued to commit resources to and develop the attractive prospects of the PEDL183 onshore licence at West Newton in the UK. Other investments in the Reabold portfolio, such as the Romanian licences, continue to hold attractive optional value in the long-term but were not a capital allocation priority in 2023.

At West Newton, we were pleased to receive approval permits from the Environment Agency, a key step forward in enabling further licence activity. We were however disappointed with the delay in drilling of the first development well, which had been targeted for the second half of 2023. Rathlin, the site operator, was unable to resolve funding for its own share in 2023, which we believe is a consequence of the fiscal and political instability in the UK. With a strong balance sheet throughout the year and £8.2 million of cash as at 30 April 2024, Reabold has more than sufficient funding for its direct share of the planned drilling on the licence. And having confirmed a materially lower phased capital expenditure plan for a single well development and early cash flow from production, ahead of the full field development longer-term, we now look forward to an enhanced level of interest and the resolution of Rathlin's funding situation in 2024 through a potential farm-out arrangement or other sources of capital. As a Board, we remain confident in the prospects for West Newton and are fully focused on realising the asset's significant value potential for shareholders.

Outside the UK, we took the decision to build a significant stake (26.1% by the end of 2023) in LNEnergy for a total cost of £4.3 million (£1.9 million in cash and £2.4 million via the issuance of 1,297,297,298 new ordinary shares). We were attracted to LNEnergy because of the exclusive option it has over a 90% interest in the Colle Santo gas field, a highly material onshore gas resource in central Italy, with two production wells already drilled and a field that is development ready, subject to the approvals process. The primary focus for this asset in 2023 was to progress the necessary regional and national approvals required to begin operations. We are encouraged by the favourable momentum in this approvals process throughout 2023 and into the current financial year, helped by the political desire to improve domestic energy security. LNEnergy is working towards securing all necessary permits in the near future. It is also pleasing to report that LNEnergy has secured a well-known, highly experienced technical partner, Italfluid, to act as contract operator and, since the period end, has signed a Heads of Agreement with Gunvor, a leading global LNG trader, for the purchase of LNG from the Colle Santo production facility. 2024 will be an important year in gaining all the formal approvals and operationalising the site to start producing first gas and generating early cash flow, currently targeted for 2025.

From a corporate and governance perspective, 2023 was a year of mixed fortunes and outcomes. The Board and management team had to deal once again with the unwelcome distraction of a second unsuccessful general meeting requisition, driven by Kamran Sattar of Portillion Capital. This consumed valuable time and resource from our efforts to progress our two key assets in the UK and Italy, as described above. With the cash proceeds from the Victory asset sale on our balance sheet, we initiated a share buyback programme - returning £263,000 to shareholders in 2023 and a further £75,000 post period end. Our net assets on the balance sheet were £42.2 million, well above the market capitalisation of the Company at the time of writing. It is now our duty to ensure the full potential and value of Reabold's portfolio is delivered to shareholders. As a Board, we remain confident that this can be achieved, and we look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year.

Reabold is an investing company focussed on developing strategic European gas assets to secure European gas supply and energy security. Reabold has a diversified portfolio of gas assets comprised of development, appraisal and exploration projects. Reabold aims to generate shareholder value by making disciplined and focused investments to grow our business. Reabold's strategy is to invest in existing undeveloped gas discoveries with significant resources and near-term production potential, which have considerable valuation uplift potential and a clear monetisation plan. Proceeds from monetisation events are balanced between shareholder returns and re-investment into new and existing projects.

We are preparing for the future and responding to the increased focus on energy security brought about by the rise in geopolitical conflict and instability in the region, and globally. Concern about energy shortages and vulnerability to geopolitical events has prompted many governments to prioritise access to more domestically produced energy and reduce their dependency on imported gas. Reabold aims to contribute to Europe's energy security by unlocking potential sources of near-term domestic gas supply, at a time when the continent is exposed to potentially significant gas supply disruptions. In this regard, the Company identified, matured and sold the strategic Victory gas project in the UK to Shell for £32.0m (£12.7m net to Reabold).

We are focused on the disciplined allocation of capital to deliver on our strategic objectives. Reabold's current focus is on its two key gas assets that have strong parallels with Victory: West Newton (UK onshore) & Colle Santo (Italy onshore). Similar to Victory, both assets are highly material, undeveloped gas discoveries in Europe. Full details of these operations are included in the Review of Operations.

The Group's main business is to invest in direct and indirect interests in exploration and development gas projects. Reabold's long-term strategy is to re-invest capital generated through monetisation of its investments into new projects in order to grow the Company and create value for its shareholders. The Company tracks its new business development objectives through the building of a risk-balanced portfolio of assets. The Company reviews its KPIs on an ongoing basis as it moves through the lifecycle of its strategy to ensure they continue to serve as a useful measure of our strategic performance.

The Board assesses the performance of the Group across measures and indicators that are consistent with Reabold's strategy and investor proposition.

Co-Chief Executive Officers' Review of Operations

In 2023, it became even clearer that Europe needs a secure, affordable and lower carbon energy system. The Russia-Ukraine war continued in 2023 and renewed conflict in the Middle East has raised political tensions. Reabold's strategy is to improve Europe's energy security by unlocking potential sources of near-term domestic gas supply, at a time when Europe is exposed to potentially significant gas supply disruptions. In this regard, the Company identified, matured and sold the strategic Victory gas project to Shell for £32.0m (£12.7m net to Reabold).

The last few years were about generating options. In 2024, and as we drive to 2025, we will focus on our two key gas assets that have strong parallels with Victory, namely West Newton in the UK and Colle Santo in Italy, where the Company plans to apply the same successful strategy demonstrated with Victory. We will discuss the details of each project below.

West Newton is an onshore hydrocarbon discovery located north of Hull, England. To date, three successful wells have been drilled at West Newton (A-1, A-2 and B-1z) confirming a major discovery - potentially one of the largest hydrocarbon fields discovered onshore UK. Rathlin Energy (UK) Limited (""Rathlin"") is the operator of the licence in which it holds a 66.67% interest. Reabold has a 59.5% shareholding in Rathlin and a direct 16.67% interest in the licence, giving the Company an aggregate c. 56% economic interest in West Newton. The other co-venturer on the licence is Union Jack Oil with a 16.67% direct interest.

A Gas Export Feasibility study completed by CNG Services Limited in the first half of 2024, concludes that, as a precursor to the intended West Newton full field development, an initial single well development and gas export plan can accelerate production and cash flow whilst requiring limited capital expenditure. With the industry currently suffering from a lack of available development capital, the ability to achieve early production with limited capex is strategically extremely valuable. Initial gas production will be from a single horizontal well, processed through a modular plant, tied in from the A site to the National Transmission System at an existing above ground installation via a pipeline. The single well development plan benefits from early cash generation with the ability to drill future wells out of cash flow. Drilling of the next well at West Newton is subject to Rathlin funding and regulatory approval. Following drilling and testing of this horizontal well, first gas is expected 18 months later with an associated development capex estimated to be c.£12 million. Although early production from the single well development demonstrates highly attractive standalone economics and would support future wells being drilled from cashflow, it is envisaged that it will be a precursor to the full field conceptual development plan which had an associated pre-tax NPV(10) of US$222 million, net to Reabold, based on the PEDL183 CPR effective 30 June 2022.

In May 2024, Reabold commissioned GaffneyCline to perform a carbon intensity study for the West Newton field. The GaffneyCline study highlighted the following:

· The West Newton project has an AA rating for Carbon Intensity for its potential upstream gas and condensate production, the lowest possible carbon intensity rating category on GaffneyCline's scale

· The West Newton field has a Carbon Intensity significantly lower than the UK average and onshore and offshore analogues. It is also significantly lower than the average imported LNG, based on the NSTA Natural Carbon Footprint Analysis published in July 2023

· Based on the study, GaffneyCline estimates that West Newton could produce the equivalent of just 2.87 grams of CO2 per megajoule of energy developed (gCO2eq./MJ)

· As the development proceeds and project knowledge increases, there is potential to improve the Carbon Intensity by further reducing fugitive, flaring and venting emissions and by gas-to-grid development, reducing on site gas and condensate processing, and using the shortest possible route to the National Grid

The AA rating demonstrates the low carbon credentials of the West Newton project and is an example of the opportunities available in the UK to power the country through lower carbon, home grown energy, rather than relying on expensive and more carbon intensive imports. For more information, please see the ESG section of this report on pages 15-17.

The joint venture has a commitment to the North Sea Transition Authority (""NSTA"") to drill and test a new Kirkham Abbey deviated or horizontal well by June 2024 and to recomplete or sidetrack and test one of the existing wells in that same timeframe. As mentioned above, drilling of the first development well is subject to Rathlin securing funding. There is an active process underway to assess options to source funding for Rathlin's share of the cost, including through a farmout, or through further investment from Reabold, which, following the receipt of the proceeds from Shell, the Company could potentially provide, in addition to funding its own share. As a result of Rathlin's funding shortfall, drilling of the first development well will not be completed prior to June 2024. Rathlin, as operator, has initiated discussions with the NSTA to defer the deadlines for these commitments.

In May 2023, Reabold acquired a 3.1% interest in LNEnergy for cash consideration of £250,000 and received options to acquire, at its sole discretion, further shares in LNEnergy. In June 2023, Reabold exercised certain of these options to increase the Company's stake in LNEnergy to 16.2% through a cash consideration of £500,000 and the issuance of 810,810,811 new ordinary shares as consideration for the increased investment. In September 2023, Reabold increased its stake in LNEnergy to 17.6% for a further cash consideration of £250,000. In November 2023, Reabold increased its interest in LNENergy by 0.8% to 18.4% through a partial exercise of the remaining option for a cash consideration of £150,000. In December 2023, Reabold exercised the remainder of the final option to increase its stake in LNEnergy to 26.1% through a cash consideration of £750,000 and the issuance of 486,486,487 new ordinary shares as consideration for the increased investment.

LNEnergy's primary asset is an exclusive option over a 90% interest in the onshore Colle Santo gas field in Abruzzo, Italy. With 65bcf of 2P reserves, as estimated by RPS as of 30 September 2022, this is a highly material undeveloped onshore gas resource. Reabold believes this is the largest onshore proven undeveloped gas field in mainland Western Europe. The field is development ready subject to permits and approvals. Two wells have already been drilled and are available for production, with no additional drilling being required. The development will consist of a small-scale LNG facility to produce initially at 10mmcf/d from the existing two wells with over 20 years of ultimate production. LNEnergy believes that the field has the potential to generate an estimated €11-12m of gross post-tax free cash flow per annum. First gas is targeted for 2025.

Demand for LNG is expected to continue to grow. LNG is critical to the energy transition and plays an important role in enabling countries to replace coal-fired power generation with a less carbon-intensive alternative, and provides grid stability alongside wind and solar power in electricity generation. The Italian government has recently approved a decree, which was converted into law in February 2024, to boost the country's renewable energy production and energy security. The decree provides incentives to build plants for energy production from renewable sources, such as the liquefaction of natural gas; the release of new licences for the exploitation of gas fields aimed at providing gas to industries with high gas consumption, at competitive prices; incentives for LNG terminals and incentives for carbon dioxide storage programmes.

In August 2023, Reabold announced that LNEnergy had received a letter from the head of the Italian National Bureau of Hydrocarbons and Georesources (""UNMIG""), the minerals division of Italian Ministry of Environment and Energy Security (""MASE""), giving permission to carry out well integrity and well service testing on the two existing wells and to start work on the installation and commissioning of the monitoring network at the Colle Santo gas field. The letter is a positive indication of support for the development of the Colle Santo gas field and the next stage is to receive a formal decree from MASE to conduct the work.

In December 2023, LNEnergy reported that it had filed the Environmental Impact Study (""EIS"") for the new small-scale LNG development plan at the Colle Santo gas field with MASE. This is a further step towards achieving the granting of a production concession at Colle Santo. The study was performed on behalf of LNEnergy by its technical partner Italfluid, and various subsidiary companies of Italfluid, along with several independent technical specialists.

The Company also notes that LNEnergy's application for concession has been recognised by MASE, as a project that meets the requirements of the Italian government's National Integrated Plan for Energy and Climate and National Plan for Economic Recovery, for which €12 billion in grants and economic incentives have been made available by executive decree.

On 2 May 2024, Reabold announced the execution of a non-binding Heads of Agreement (""HoA"") between Gunvor and LNEnergy for the purchase of LNG by Gunvor from LNEnergy from the Colle Santo gas field. The HoA provides the terms on which Gunvor will purchase LNG from LNEnergy at its planned small-scale LNG production facility at the Colle Santo gas field. Gunvor will purchase approximately 44,000 tonnes of LNG per annum. The point of sale will be the truck loading flange at the small-scale LNG plant, and the LNG will then be delivered by truck in Italy. The price for the LNG will be aligned with the Italian PSV price. The contract term will be for an indefinite period with a minimum term of five years.

The HoA also provides for a potential prepayment by Gunvor for a portion of the first five years of deliveries, with such amounts subject to prepayment being a total of approximately 66,000 tonnes of LNG, or 999,000 MWh. The average forward Italian PSV gas price for the years 2025-2030 is currently approximately €30 / MWh. The prepayment is conditional on agreeing definitive transaction documentation and LNEnergy obtaining the required permits to construct and operate the LNG production facility.

On the basis of the HoA, LNEnergy and Gunvor intend to negotiate a fully-termed LNG sale and purchase agreement over the next six months. During such time, LNEnergy will exclusively discuss the sale and purchase of LNG from Colle Santo with Gunvor, whilst concurrently focusing its efforts on obtaining the required permits to construct and operate the LNG production facility.

Following the receipt of the initial £3.2 million net to Reabold in November 2022, for the sale of Corallian, Reabold received a further £5.2 million in December 2023. In January 2024, Reabold received the final tranche payment, following Shell's receipt of development and production consent for the Victory gas field from the North Sea Transition Authority, taking Reabold's final proceeds for the sale of its 49.99% interest in Corallian to £12.7 million.

Licences retained - P2605, P2504 (both 100%) and P2486 (10%)

In 2023, Reabold relinquished interests in five North Sea licences: (P2464 and P2493 (both 100%), P2332 (30%), P2329 and P2427 (10%)). Reabold relinquished its 36% interest in licence P2478 in March 2024.

Discussions to farm down Reabold's remaining North Sea licences to help fund the de-risking and value creation process continues, however, the energy profits levy and political uncertainty in the UK has created difficulties for the farmout process.

Reabold has a 50.8% equity position in Danube Petroleum Limited (""Danube""), with ASX listed ADX Energy Ltd (""ADX"") holding the remaining 49.2%. Danube has a 100% interest in the Parta exploration and Iecea Mare production licence in Western Romania, which include the IMIC-1 discovery and the IMIC-2 prospect.

During the reporting period, following several positive meetings with the governing authority, ADX has submitted technical and financial documents in relation to the Parta Exploration Licence to the relevant Romanian authorities for the possible extension of the current licence period (note: the validity of the Iecea Mare production licence is 20 years and not affected). The governing authority is the National Agency for Mineral Resources (NAMR) which is supporting the extension which can be granted through a government process. ADX is currently providing several reports to assist NAMR with documenting the extensive past activity with the objective of receiving a de facto waiver on the fulfilment of the obligatory work programme.

With regards to the Iecea Mare Production Licence, ADX has forwarded the 2024 work programme to the government agency and is reviewing options to convert part of the licence into a geothermal prospecting area.

Reabold has a 42% shareholding in Daybreak Oil and Gas Inc (""Daybreak""). Daybreak is an OTC traded oil and gas company engaged in the exploration, development and production of onshore crude oil and natural gas, primarily in California. Further details on Daybreak can be found on its website at www.daybreakoilandgas.com/.

The Group's loss for the year ended 31 December 2023 was £7.2 million (2022: £45,000).

The Group incurred a loss of £2.7 million on financial assets (2022: £1.9 million) The loss primarily arose from a decline in the market value of Daybreak's shares (£3.5 million), partly offset by an increase in the fair value of contingent consideration receivable (£0.8 million) from the sale of Corallian in 2022.

Reabold's share of loss of associates was £0.6 million (2022: £1.6 million). The decrease was largely due to the absence of non-cash impairment charges which Corallian had incurred in 2022. See Note 15 for more information.

Reabold received cash proceeds of £5.2 million in 2023 related to the sale of Corallian to Shell in 2022, however the gain on this sale was recorded in 2022, when the sale completed, and as such no gains were recorded in the income statement in 2023. In 2022, the net gains on sale of businesses of £5.0 million related to the gain on sale of Corallian (£7.3 million) offset by a loss on disposal of Reabold California (£2.3 million).

Exploration expenses of £1.6 million were incurred in 2023 (2022: £74,000). The increase in 2023 was principally related to exploration expenditure written off as a result of the relinquishment of several North Sea licences. See Notes 7 and 13 for further details.

Administrative expenses for the year were £2.2 million (2022: £1.7 million). The increase was mainly driven by an increase in legal fees in relation to the step acquisitions of LNEnergy, as well as inflationary impacts across the majority of suppliers.

In 2023, Reabold incurred £190,000 (2022: £191,000) in legal and professional fees, which Rebold has classified as non-underlying items, in relation to the successful defence from a second attempt, from a group of beneficial shareholders, to remove the entire Board of Directors of Reabold and replace them with four new directors. All resolutions proposed by the requisitioning shareholders were rejected at a general meeting held in January 2024 (2022: rejected at a general meeting held in November 2022).

Exploration and evaluation assets increased by £0.2 million from £6.8 million at 31 December 2022 to £7.0 million at 31 December 2023. Additions at West Newton of £0.3 million and the acquisition of four Southern North Sea licences for £1.2 million as part of the acquisition of Simwell Resources were offset by exploration write-offs of £1.4 million.

Investments in associates increased from £22.3 million at year end 2022 to £26.1 million at year end 2023, primarily as a result of the step acquisitions of LNEnergy during the year. See Note 15 for further information.

Other long-term investments decreased by £3.5 million as a result of the decline in value of Daybreak's shares. Other short-term investments decreased from £8.7 million to £4.4 million following the receipt of £5.2 million of contingent consideration for the sale of Corallian to Shell in 2022. The movement in short-term investments also included favourable movements of £0.8 million due to the fair value accounting of contingent consideration. See Note 16 for further information.

The increase in share capital from £9.0 million to £10.6 million arose from shares issued as consideration for the acquisition of Simwell Resources Limited (£0.2 million) and shares issued as part of the investment into LNEnergy (£1.3 million). The decrease in the share premium account from £29.0 million to £1.1 million relates to a capital reduction of £29.4 million, offset by the premium on shares issued as part of the consideration for Simwell Resources Limited (£0.4 million) and the premium on shares issued as part of the investment in LNEnergy (£1.1 million). The capital reduction ensures the Company has sufficient distributable reserves to make distributions to shareholders.

Overall, net assets decreased from £46.5 million at 31 December 2022 to £42.2 million at 31 December 2023.

Net cash used in operating activities was £2.2 million in 2023, compared with £1.8 million in 2022. The net cash used in operating activities was primarily driven by administration expenses of £2.2 million.

Cash flow from investing activities was an inflow of £2.3 million, compared with an inflow of £2.4 million in 2022. The cash flow from investing activities in 2023 included cash capital expenditure of £2.9 million (compared with cash capital expenditure of £0.7 million in 2022). The increase in cash capital expenditure was primarily driven by the acquisition of Simwell Resources Limited and the step acquisitions of LNEnergy. Divestment proceeds in 2023 were £5.2 million compared with £3.2 million in 2022 - both amounts relate to cash receipts from the sale of Corallian to Shell in 2022.

Cash flow from financing activities in 2023 was an outflow of £0.3 million, compared with nil in 2022, due to the repurchase of shares in 2023.

Cash and cash equivalents were £5.4 million at 31 December 2023 (2022: £5.5 million). The Group has no debt.

The Group does not have any signed contractual capital commitments as at 31 December 2023 (2022: nil), however the group does have obligations to carry out defined work programmes on its licences, under the terms of the award of rights to these licences. The Company is not obliged to meet other joint venture partner shares of these programmes.

PEDL 183

The joint operation between Rathlin, Reabold and Union Jack have a commitment to drill and test a new Kirkham Abbey deviated or horizontal appraisal well by June 2024. The joint venture has also committed to recomplete or sidetrack and test one of the WNA-1, WNA-2 or WNB-1Z wells in that same timeframe. The Company estimates its 16.67% share of costs for these commitments to be c.£2.2 million. Rathlin, the operator of PEDL183, is working with the NSTA to defer these commitments to allow the time necessary for Rathlin to obtain sufficient funding for its share of the commitments.

UK North Sea

Reabold estimates its share of firm exploration and appraisal work commitments on its North Sea portfolio to be c.£50,000 over the course of 2024. The Company has not yet taken a decision on whether to drill on any of its North Sea licences.

Reabold operates in an environment subject to inherent risks and uncertainties. The Board regularly considers the principal risks to which the Group is exposed and monitors any agreed mitigating actions. The overall strategy for the protection of shareholder value against these risks is to carry a broad portfolio of assets with varied risk/reward profiles, and to retain adequate working capital. The risks faced by the Company can, and are likely to, change with progress in the Company's strategy and developments in the external business environment.

The risks discussed below, separately or in combination, could have a material adverse effect on the implementation of our strategy, our business, financial performance, liquidity, prospects, shareholder value and returns and reputation.

Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Statement

Reabold is committed to the highest standards of environmental, social and governance processes and we incorporate these responsibilities into our operational decision-making and investments. We regularly review our approach, policies, and processes across key areas.

At present Reabold does not 'operate' any of the assets in its portfolio. Our operational assets are managed by our associate companies who are responsible for the adequacy of standards, operations and compliance. The Group does not have any assets that are yet in the development or production stage and therefore the business has no scope 1 or scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions.

Reabold is committed to preserving and protecting our natural environment for future generations.

Reabold complies with the standards of the international oil industry, environmental laws and regulations. We recognise and support the basis of the Paris Agreement to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change.

We support a balanced energy transition where the world maintains a secure and affordable supply of energy, while building the clean energy system of the future. Our focus is on minimising carbon emissions and the environmental footprint of the projects we invest in, whilst continuing to contribute positively to the demand for energy and products that require hydrocarbons in the supply chain. The pace of transition to a lower carbon economy and cleaner fuels is uncertain, and will be heavily influenced by government policy, but oil and natural gas demand is expected to remain a key element of the energy mix for many years based on stated government policies, commitments and announced pledges to reduce emissions. The challenge is to meet the world's energy needs sustainably and efficiently, which requires managing and reducing harmful emissions.

Reabold actively encourages and expects its investee companies / operators of its oil and gas interests to respond to this by continuously striving to minimise the potential environmental impact of operations by:

· Implementing controls to identify and prevent potential environmental risks

· Implementing controls during operations to avoid accidental spills, or leaks of polluting materials

· Managing water with due consideration

· Targeting high energy efficiency levels in drilling and other activities

· Limiting unnecessary wastage

· Handling waste products in an environmentally responsible manner

· Regularly assessing the environmental consequences of operations

The operators have developed systems, controls and processes to integrate climate related considerations, in order to meet these objectives. For example one can read the approach and policies of Rathlin Energy, operator of the West Newton PEDL 183 licence, on its website at www.rathlin-energy.co.uk, and of LNEnergy, operator of the Colle Santo project in Italy, on its website at https://www.sviluppocollesanto.it/.

Focus on energy efficient extraction and drilling to reduce carbon intensity

Reabold's assets are primarily small to medium sized, proven oil and gas fields at relatively shallow depth. As such, the intensity of drilling required is considered low relative to industry standards and we do not conduct energy intensive prospecting activities, reducing the impact on the environment. We encourage the operators of our assets to use the most energy efficient drilling methods. As the energy mix evolves towards a higher percentage of renewables in the countries in which we operate, we anticipate a greater share of our energy consumption will be purchased from green sources.

Our investee company sites in the United Kingdom are located close to areas with a high demand for energy. Consequently, we expect that hydrocarbons produced locally and consumed locally will displace imported hydrocarbons thereby resulting in lower carbon emissions overall. This will provide greater security of supply to the UK as well as providing jobs and supporting UK industry, compared to the alternative of importing fuel. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of our critical national infrastructure and, more recently, the war in Ukraine has been a stark reminder that energy security cannot be taken for granted.

We believe that natural gas has an important role to play in the energy transition, bridging the gap on the journey from fossil fuels to a renewable, zero-carbon future and helping to supply stable and affordable energy to UK homes and businesses as part of a lower-carbon energy supply mix. To that end, we continue to explore ways to invest in gas projects such as the Victory project, which was subsequently sold to Shell in November 2022, and the Colle Santo gas project in Italy.

Reabold takes its commitment to responsible hydrocarbon production very seriously. In May 2024, Reabold commissioned GaffneyCline to perform a carbon intensity study for the West Newton field. The GaffneyCline study highlighted the following:

· The West Newton project has an AA rating for Carbon Intensity for its potential upstream gas and condensate production, the lowest possible carbon intensity rating category on GaffneyCline's scale

· The West Newton field has a Carbon Intensity significantly lower than the UK average and onshore and offshore analogues. It is also significantly lower than the average imported LNG, based on the NSTA Natural Carbon Footprint Analysis published in July 2023

· Based on the study, GaffneyCline estimates that West Newton could produce the equivalent of just 2.87 grams of CO2 per megajoule of energy developed (gCO2eq./MJ)

· As the development proceeds and project knowledge increases, there is potential to improve the Carbon Intensity by further reducing fugitive, flaring and venting emissions and by gas-to-grid development, reducing on site gas and condensate processing, and using the shortest possible route to the National Grid

The AA rating demonstrates the low carbon credentials of the West Newton project and is an example of the opportunities available in the UK to power the country through lower carbon, home grown energy, rather than relying on expensive and more carbon intensive imports.

We believe West Newton is an important strategic asset to the UK as the country looks to secure domestic energy supply for secure and affordable energy, at a time when the country is exposed to potentially significant gas supply disruptions. The study proves that the operator, Rathlin, is a responsible hydrocarbon producer complying with best environmental practice to produce much needed UK hydrocarbons in the most efficient and environmentally friendly way possible.

Reabold is committed to the highest standards of environmental processes and we incorporate these responsibilities into our operational decision-making and investments.

The development plan for Colle Santo involves converting gas to LNG directly onsite using a small modular LNG processing unit. The LNG will be trucked a short distance (7 km) to an entry point into the SNAM transmission grid. There will be no new drilling due to two existing wells already drilled and tested. There will be on-site CO capture of 1,400 tonnes CO equivalent per year, and connected hydrogen production facilities.

LNG provides energy security and flexibility because it can be easily transported to places where it is needed most. LNG is a critical fuel in the energy transition and plays an important role as a lower-carbon alternative to coal for industry, and provides grid stability alongside wind and solar power in electricity generation. It is the lowest-carbon fossil fuel, producing around 50% less carbon emissions than coal when used to generate electricity.

Daybreak's production sites are located in California, a state with very high renewable energy generation which feeds into the energy required for hydrocarbon extraction. By industry standards, Daybreak's oil and gas activities require a very low level of energy to extract the hydrocarbons, ensuring it is one of the most energy efficient of its type in California.

Romania has a diverse energy mix, including coal, natural gas, nuclear, hydroelectric, and renewable sources. The largest share of electricity production historically came from coal and natural gas, followed by hydroelectric and nuclear power. In recent years, there has been a shift towards increasing the share of renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar. However, Romania supports natural gas in the long-term in the European Green Deal because it forecasts that this resource will remain an important tool in changing the energy sector and transitioning to a more sustainable and carbon-free economy. By developing and producing gas from the Parta site, Danube Petroleum Limited will be able to contribute to the country's efforts to implement this energy strategy. In addition, options to exploit the geothermal potential of the Romanian part of the Pannonian Basin are under investigation with the authorities in combination with a subsurface review of the likely prospectivity.

Managing our environmental footprint and reducing our emissions are important objectives for Reabold Resources. We regularly review and revise our policies, as necessary.

Reabold wishes to build value through developing sustainable relationships with partners and the community.

We comply with all applicable legislation; and design and manage our activities to prevent pollution, minimize environmental and health impact and provide workplaces free of safety hazards.

The Company is committed to high standards of health, safety and environmental protection; these aspects command equal prominence with other business considerations in the decision-making process.

Health, safety and environmental protection are responsibilities shared by everyone working for the Company and the full support of all staff, partners and contractors is vital to the successful implementation of the policy. We ensure, as far as reasonably practicable, that all personnel are aware of their delegated health, safety and environmental responsibilities and are properly trained to undertake these.

We strive for continuous improvement in our HSE performance and measure this by setting objectives and targets consistent with the aims of this policy.

HSE performance is routinely monitored and reported regularly to the Board of Directors, which will ensure that the necessary resources are provided to support this policy fully.

As an AIM-quoted company, Reabold is required to apply a recognised corporate governance code, demonstrating how the Company complies with such corporate governance code and where it departs from it.

The Directors of the Company have formally applied the 2018 QCA Code. The Board recognises the principles of the 2018 QCA Code, which focus on the creation of medium to long-term value for shareholders without stifling the entrepreneurial spirit in which small to medium sized companies, such as Reabold, have been created. Please see pages 25 to 30 for the Chair's corporate governance statement and how Reabold has applied the 10 principles of the 2018 QCA code.

In accordance with the requirements of Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006, the Directors consider that, during the financial year ended 31 December 2023, they have acted in a way that they consider, in good faith, would most likely promote the success of the Company for the benefit of the members as a whole, having regard to the likely consequences of any decision in the long term and the broader interests of other stakeholders, as required by the Act. The Board delegates day-to-day management of the business of the Company to the Co-CEOs, save for those matters which are reserved for the Board's approval. More information on how the Board has regard to the Section 172 factors are outlined below.

S172(1) (a) ""The likely consequences of any decision in the long term""

The Directors understand the business and both the evolving and challenging environment in which we operate, including the challenges of the global energy transition. The Board made decisions with regard to acquisitions and investments with consideration given to key stakeholders and the likely long-term impact of any decision. During the year, the Board reflected on the challenges to be faced by Reabold given the shifting macroeconomic and geopolitical context. Our strategy is intended to transition Reabold to an energy business focused on developing strategic European gas assets to secure European gas supply and energy security. The Board of Directors is collectively responsible for the decisions made towards the long-term success of the Company and the way in which the strategic, operational and risk management decisions have been implemented throughout the business is detailed in our Strategy and business model on page 4 and throughout the Strategic Report.

S172(1) (b) ""The interests of the Company's employees""

Reabold employees are fundamental and core to our business model and the delivery of our strategic ambitions. The future success of our business depends on attracting, retaining, developing and motivating talented employees.

We ensure that:

* Health, Safety and the Environment are considered paramount throughout the organisation.

* Annual pay and benefit reviews are carried out to determine whether all levels of employees are benefitting fairly and to retain and encourage skills vital for the business.

* There are freely available Company policies and procedures.

* Personal development reviews and work appraisals are conducted.

* Employees are informed of the results and important business decisions and are encouraged to feel engaged

The Remuneration Committee oversees and makes recommendations of executive remuneration and any long-term share awards. In April 2023, we launched the Reabold Resources plc long-term incentive plan for our full-time senior management team. Reabold aims to invest in competitive rewards for our people.

S172(1) (c) ""The need to foster the Company's business relationships with suppliers, customers and others""

Delivering our strategy requires strong mutually beneficial relationships with suppliers, customers, governments, and joint-venture partners. We aim to have a positive and enduring impact on the communities in which we operate, through partnering with national and local suppliers, and through payments to governments in taxes and other fees. The Group values all of its suppliers and aims to build strong positive relationships through open communication and adherence to trade terms. The Group is committed to being a responsible entity and doing the right thing for its customers, suppliers and business partners. The Board upholds ethical business behaviour across all of the Company's activities and encourages management to seek comparable business practices from all suppliers and customers doing business with the Company. We value the feedback we receive from our stakeholders and we take every opportunity to ensure that where possible their wishes are duly considered. The Board engages with stakeholders to understand their priorities and concerns through a range of engagement activities. Meeting commitments made to investors is critical to building trust and confidence with our external stakeholders. Back in 2022, management made a commitment to improve communication with shareholders with stakeholder engagements at least every two months. This has taken the form of corporate presentations, interviews with the Co-CEOs and investor events. In 2023, we published 12 new videos on the media section of our website, including operational updates, investor presentations and Q&As. In Q1 2023 the Company launched a new website so that shareholders and other stakeholders can more easily navigate Company updates and communications. The website includes a Q&A page which answers some of the most common investor questions.

The Co-CEOs provide a comprehensive update to the Board on material business and external developments at each main Board meeting. This includes significant operational updates, e.g. partnerships, investments, divestments, projects, commercial highlights and political or regulatory developments.

S172(1) (d) ""The impact of the Company's operations on the community and the environment""

This aspect is inherent in our strategic ambitions, most notably on our ambitions to thrive through the energy transition and to sustain a strong societal licence to operate. As such, the Board receives information on these topics to provide relevant information for specific Board decisions. Executive Directors conduct site visits of various investee company operations and hold external stakeholder engagements, where feasible.

At present Reabold does not 'operate' any of the assets in its portfolio. Our operational assets are managed by our associate companies who are responsible for the adequacy of standards, operations and compliance. Reabold seeks to influence how risk is managed in arrangements where we are not operator by ensuring we have a member of the executive team on the Board of our associate companies. This gives Reabold assurance that operations are and will be carried out in a sustainable and safe manner.

Further information can be found within our ESG Statement on page 15, and within the principal risks and uncertainties section on page 12.

S172(1) (e) ""The desirability of the Company maintaining a reputation for high standards of business conduct""

The Company is incorporated in the UK and governed by the Companies Act 2006. The Company has adopted the Quoted Companies Alliance (""QCA"") Corporate Governance Code 2018 (the ""2018 QCA Code"") and the Board recognises the importance of maintaining a good level of corporate governance, which together with the requirements to comply with the AIM Rules ensures that the interests of the Company's stakeholders are safeguarded. Please see the Chair's Corporate Governance statement on pages 25 to 30.

Reabold aims to contribute to Europe's energy security by unlocking potential sources of near-term domestic gas supply in economically, environmentally and socially responsible ways. The Board periodically reviews and approves clear frameworks, such as Reabold's Code of Conduct, and specific Ethics & Compliance policies, to ensure that its high standards are maintained both within Reabold and the business relationships we maintain. This, complemented by the various ways the Board is informed and monitors compliance with relevant governance standards help ensure its decisions are taken, and that Reabold investee companies act, in ways that promote high standards of business conduct.

S172(1) (f) ""The need to act fairly as between members of the Company""

The Directors consider which course of action best enables delivery of our strategy in the long-term interest of the Company. The Board is committed to maintaining good communication and having constructive dialogue with its shareholders. The Company has close ongoing relationships with its shareholders - engaging with both retail and institutional holders during 2023. Institutional shareholders and analysts have the opportunity to discuss issues and provide feedback at meetings with the Company. All shareholders are encouraged to attend the Company's Annual General Meeting and any general meetings held by the Company, which present an opportunity for shareholders to speak with the Executive Directors in a formal environment and in more informal one to one meetings.

The primary communication tool with our shareholders is through the Regulatory News Service (""RNS"") on regulatory matters and matters of material substance. The Company's upgraded website, launched in March 2023, provides details of the business, investor presentations and details of the Board, changes to major shareholder information and 2018 QCA Code disclosure updates under AIM Rule 26. Changes are promptly published on the website to enable the shareholders to be kept abreast of Company's affairs. The Company's Annual Report and Notice of Annual General Meetings are available to all shareholders. The Interim Report and investor presentations are also available on our website.

Investor events are held with shareholders throughout the year. By providing a variety of ways to communicate with investors the Company feels that it reaches out to engage with a wide range of its stakeholders.

The Board delegates day-to-day management of the business of the Company to the Co-CEOs. The responsibility for the execution of this delegation of authority, including regularly monitoring it, is retained by the Board. We outline some of the principal decisions made by the Board over the year, and how directors have performed their duty under Section 172.

Cash allocation including shareholder distributions

Following the completion of the sale of Corallian in November 2022 along with the receipt of the first tranche payment from Shell, the board considered cash flow, the macro environment and business performance in 2023. The Directors approved a share buyback programme in April 2023 with the aim of delivering value to shareholders. The Directors considered its ordinary shares to be undervalued and at a meaningful discount to conservatively estimated per-share intrinsic value.

A number of considerations underpinned the decision to commence the buyback programme including feedback from advisors and other stakeholders, the strength of the Company's balance sheet and the need to continue to invest in our assets.",investegate.co.uk,news,investegate.co.uk,,0.4352941176470588,454831780,1,https://www.investegate.co.uk/assets/images/linkedin-investegate-logo.jpg,

Italy, Germany and Austria have signed an agreement to cooperate on the development of a network to transport hydrogen from the southern Mediterranean to northern Europe, the energy ministries of the three countries said on Thursday.

The official announcement, which confirms what sources told Reuters on Tuesday, marks a concrete step in the European Union's strategy to secure renewable hydrogen supplies by 2030 to help decarbonise its most polluting industries.

""The Southern Hydrogen Corridor will provide renewable hydrogen imports from North Africa via southern Italy and further connect to the major hydrogen demand hubs in Italy, Austria and Germany,"" the German ministry said in a statement.

The link dubbed SoutH2, which last year won priority status from the European Commission, is considered important to develop a European market for the renewable fuel.

A group of companies including Italian gas grid operator Snam has teamed up to build the SoutH2 pipeline by the beginning of the next decade, with a financial commitment of more than 4 billion euros (USD 4.3 billion).

""The southern corridor will play an important role, especially in supplying the southern German states with green hydrogen,"" Germany's Minister for Economic Affairs and Climate Protection Robert Habeck said in a statement.

The hydrogen would be transported to Europe through a 3,300 km (2,050 mile) pipeline connecting Tunisia to Italy and continuing onto Austria and Germany, which is being planned by companies including Snam.

Production could begin as early as 2030, with Verbund taking some of the hydrogen and transporting it throughout Central Europe.

Why it is important?

The European Union aims to produce 10 million tons and import 10 million tons of renewable hydrogen by 2030 in a bid to replace hydrocarbons, which emit planet-warming gases when burned.

European industrials are already signing hydrogen supply deals and investing to upgrade equipment to run on the green fuel, which emits water when combusted.

""What is notable about this project is its ability to transport low-cost hydrogen directly to Europe via pipeline,"" TEH2 CEO David Corchia said in a media call.

""Pipeline transport adds about 1 euro (USD 1.09) per kilo to the cost, compared with 3.5 to 4 euros per kilo when you transform hydrogen to ammonia, ship it on a boat, and re-crack it back into hydrogen.""

""The Americans are moving but haven't cracked that problem better than we have. They are still transforming it and putting on boats, it's just that they are heavily subsidized,"" Corchia added.

MILAN/ROME, May 28 (Reuters) - Italy is aiming to sign a letter of intent with Germany and Austria to speed up development of a more than 4-billion euro ($4.35 billion) southern pipeline for supplying hydrogen to central Europe, sources close to the matter told Reuters on Tuesday.

The administration of Giorgia Meloni has laid out plans to turn Italy into an energy gateway and last year it signed with Germany and Austria a joint letter for a hydrogen-ready pipeline between North Africa and Europe.

The European Union aims to produce 10 million metric tons and import 10 million tons of renewable hydrogen by 2030 in a bid to replace fossil fuels, which emit planet-warming gases when burned.

A group of companies including Italy's Snam is looking to build by the beginning of the next decade the SouthH2 Corridor pipeline, which would allow green hydrogen from the southern Mediterranean to reach European customers. It is unclear how much sooner Italy now wants to see the pipeline built under the letter of intent.

Green hydrogen, produced by splitting water through electrolysis using renewable energy, is included in the European Commission's decarbonisation strategy for high-polluting industries and transports.

One of the sources, who declined to be named, said a three-page letter of intent was being drafted with the aim of accelerating the creation of the southern corridor and enhance cooperation on the development of sustainable energy.

The parties will discuss the matter on the sidelines of a meeting of European energy ministers scheduled for Brussels on Thursday, two sources said, declining to provide further details as talks had not yet been finalised.

If signed, the letter of intent is expected to be submitted for review to the next European Commission, which will be appointed after elections to renew the European Union parliament scheduled for June, another source added.

Golar LNG Limited (""Golar"" or ""the Company"") reports Q1 2024 (""Q1"" or ""the quarter"") Net income attributable to Golar of $55 million inclusive of $6 million of non-cash items1, and Adjusted EBITDA1 of $64 million.FLNG Hilli maintained 100% economic uptime and market leading operational track record. FLNG Gimi on standby day rate ready to commence operations for BP.Framework Agreement announced in our Q4 2023 earnings report now progressed to detailed contractual negotiations for FLNG deployment. Additional FLNG deployment opportunities in advanced development.0.7 million shares repurchased during Q1 at an average price of $20.87 per share. Declared dividend of $0.25 per share for the quarter.

FLNG Hilli: Maintained her market leading operational track record, generating $68 million of Q1 Distributable Adjusted EBITDA1, of which Golar's share was $64 million, a $20 million decrease compared to Q4 2023. Most of the decrease is attributable to a reduction in realized TTF commodity swap gains and lower Brent oil prices.

FLNG Gimi: Moored at the GTA Hub offshore Mauritania and Senegal, ready to commence operations. During April, Golar received its first standby day rate cash payment from March 13, 2024 onwards, paid monthly in arrears. Pre-Commercial Operations Date contractual cash flows are expected to be deferred on the balance sheet and released over the contract term from the Commercial Operations Date (""COD""). The operators, BP and Kosmos, and Golar have reached an agreement in principle to resolve the disputed amounts for pre-COD cash flows from January 10, 2024, subject to final documentation and stakeholder approval. If made effective this agreement will provide Golar with progressive stage payments from January 10, 2024 until COD.

The client's FPSO has now arrived at the project site. Hookup and commissioning of the FPSO are on the critical path to first gas and are expected to complete in the third quarter of 2024. Commissioning of FLNG Gimi can commence thereafter. FLNG Gimi's commissioning period is expected to be approximately six months, concluding with COD. Together with the client we are making positive progress in exploring options to bring forward parts of the commissioning process that could shorten this six-month commissioning period. COD triggers the start of the 20-year Lease and Operate Agreement that unlocks the equivalent of around $3 billion of Adjusted EBITDA Backlog1 to Golar and recognition of the contractual day rate comprised of capital and operating elements in both the balance sheet and income statement.

A potential refinancing facility with agreed indicative terms between prospective lenders and Golar is advancing to term sheet and syndication. Golar targets a facility with a higher debt amount, lower margin and improved amortization profile versus the current vessel debt facility.

FLNG business development: Focus on re-deployment of Hilli following the end of her current charter in July 2026, and thereafter ordering and securing commercial terms for a contemplated MKII FLNG.

The framework agreement for potential FLNG deployment (as announced in our Q4 2023 earnings release), has now progressed to detailed contract negotiations for an up to 20-year FLNG deployment. The next steps of the project development include (i) signing of definitive detailed agreements, (ii) obtaining necessary third-party approvals including governmental and environmental, amongst others, and (iii) a mutual Final Investment Decision (""FID""). The FLNG development has a planned start-up during 2027.

We continue to advance additional FLNG developments and see increased prospective client interaction for our FLNG offering. Geographically, most of the activity remains in West Africa and South America, however we are pleased to see other regions with proven stranded and associated gas reserves seek FLNG development. Based on the increased FLNG business development activity we have recruited Federico Petersen as Chief Commercial Officer, and a further two highly experienced maritime and upstream development team members will join later this year. Together they have a combined 70+ years of experience and a successful business development track record.

The MKII FLNG project development continues, with previously ordered long lead items now 58% complete and the LNGC conversion candidate Fuji LNG delivered to Golar on March 4, 2024. Fuji LNG will trade on a multi-month charter ahead of her expected transfer to the yard for FLNG conversion. Work between the topside manufacturer, shipyard and Golar continues to move the project towards a FID. Detailed negotiation for a debt financing facility to be available during the construction period of the contemplated MKII FLNG also continues with prospective lenders and made solid progress during the quarter.

Other/Shipping: Operating revenues and costs under corporate and other items is comprised of two FSRU operate and maintain agreements in respect of the LNG Croatia and Golar Tundra. The non-core shipping segment is comprised of the LNGC Golar Arctic, and Fuji LNG which is now trading on a multi-month charter. Per above, Fuji LNG is a MKII FLNG conversion candidate, whilst Golar Arctic remains a candidate for sale or long-term charter.

Share buyback and dividends: The company continues to see attractive value in its shares and purchased and cancelled 0.7 million shares during the quarter at an average cost of $20.87 per share. As of March 31, 2024, 104.0 million shares are issued and outstanding. Of the $150.0 million approved share buyback scheme, $74.1 million remains available.

Golar's Board of Directors approved a total Q1 2024 dividend of $0.25 per share to be paid on or around June 17, 2024. The record date will be June 10, 2024.

Golar reports today Q1 net income of $55 million, before non-controlling interests, inclusive of $6 million of non-cash items1, comprised of:

TTF and Brent oil unrealized mark-to-market gains of $2 million; andA $4 million mark-to-market gain on interest rate swaps.

The Brent oil linked component of FLNG Hilli's fees generates additional annual cash of approximately $3.1 million (Golar share equivalent to $2.7 million) for every dollar increase in Brent Crude prices between $60 per barrel and the contractual ceiling. Billing of this component is based on a three-month look-back at average Brent Crude prices. During Q1, we recognized a total of $34 million of realized gains on FLNG Hilli's oil and gas derivative instruments comprised of:

A $17 million realized gain on the Brent oil linked derivative instrument of which Golar has an effective 89.1% interest;A $5 million realized gain in respect of fees for the TTF linked production of which Golar has an effective 89.4% interest; and A $12 million realized gain on the hedged component of the quarter's TTF linked fees of which 100% is attributable to Golar.

Further, we recognized a total of $2 million of non-cash gains in relation to FLNG Hilli's oil and gas derivative assets, with corresponding movements in its constituent parts recognized on our unaudited consolidated statement of operations as follows:

A $31 million gain on the Brent oil linked derivative asset; A $17 million loss on the TTF linked natural gas derivative asset; and A $12 million loss on the economically hedged portion of the Q1 TTF linked FLNG Hilli production.

Balance Sheet and Liquidity:

As of March 31, 2024, Total Golar Cash1 was $622 million, comprised of $548 million of cash and cash equivalents and $74 million of restricted cash.

Golar's share of Contractual Debt1 as of March 31, 2024 is $1,209 million. Deducting Total Golar Cash1 of $622 million from Golar's share of Contractual Debt1 of $1,209 million, leaves a debt position of $587 million.

A total of $45 million was invested in FLNG Gimi during the quarter, with the total FLNG Gimi asset under development balance as at March 31, 2024 amounting to $1.6 billion, including capitalized financing cost during the construction period. Of this, $630 million was drawn against the $700 million debt facility secured by FLNG Gimi. Both the investment and debt drawn to date are reported on a 100% basis.

Expenditure on long-lead items, engineering services and conversion candidate Fuji LNG for the MKII FLNG amounted to $270 million as of March 31, 2024. Of this, $192 million is included in other non-current assets and $78 million in respect of Fuji LNG is included in vessels and equipment, net. The final payment on the Fuji LNG of $62 million was made during Q1 2024. All MKII FLNG expenditure incurred to date, including the acquisition of Fuji LNG is currently fully equity financed.

Positive progress on a potential refinancing facility of Gimi as well as a potential debt facility for a MKII FLNG newbuilding can further add significant flexibility to Golar's cash position.

The board and management are pleased with the progress made across business development, new potential financing facilities and moving MKII FLNG closer to FID, whilst continuing to deliver market leading operational performance on Hilli and bringing Gimi closer to COD. We continue to focus on (i) commercial opportunities for FLNG deployment, (ii) optimizing the debt associated with Gimi, (iii) target FLNG growth through a MKII FLNG FID, and (iv) continue to deliver attractive shareholder returns.

Non-GAAP measures

In addition to disclosing financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (US GAAP), this earnings release and the associated investor presentation contains references to the non-GAAP financial measures which are included in the table below. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business and measuring our performance.

This report also contains certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures for which we are unable to provide a reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside of our control, such as oil and gas prices and exchange rates, as such items may be significant. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future events which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied to Golar's unaudited consolidated financial statements.

These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures and financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP measures are not uniformly defined by all companies and may not be comparable with similarly titled measures and disclosures used by other companies. The reconciliations as at March 31, 2024, from these results should be carefully evaluated.

Forward Looking Statements

This press release contains forward-looking statements (as defined in Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) which reflects management's current expectations, estimates and projections about its operations. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, that address activities and events that will, should, could or may occur in the future are forward-looking statements. Words such as ""if,"" ""subject to,"" ""believe,"" ""assuming,"" ""anticipate,"" ""intend,"" ""estimate,"" ""forecast,"" ""project,"" ""plan,"" ""potential,"" ""will,"" ""may,"" ""should,"" ""expect,"" ""could,"" ""would,"" ""predict,"" ""propose,"" ""continue,"" or the negative of these terms and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are based upon various assumptions, many of which are based, in turn, upon further assumptions, including without limitation, management's examination of historical operating trends, data contained in our records and other data available from third parties. Although we believe that these assumptions were reasonable when made, because these assumptions are inherently subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies which are difficult or impossible to predict and are beyond our control, we cannot assure you that we will achieve or accomplish these expectations, beliefs or projections. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward-looking statements. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this press release. Unless legally required, Golar undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Other important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include but are not limited to:

our ability and that of our counterparty to meet our respective obligations under the 20-year lease and operate agreement (the ""LOA"") with BP Mauritania, a subsidiary of BP p.l.c (""BP""), entered into in connection with the Greater Tortue Ahmeyim Project (the ""GTA Project""), including the commissioning and start-up of various project infrastructure such as the floating production, storage and offloading unit (""FPSO"").

Meanwhile, investors await the latest inflation data expected this week for clues on the European Central Bank's monetary policy outlook.

Expectations of falling inflation increase the likelihood of a rate cut in June, supported by recent comments from ECB Governing Council members Olli Rehn and Philip Lane suggesting that a rate cut next week is almost certain.

Thus, the FTSE Mib is in the green 0.2 percent to 34,828.66, the Mid-Cap is up 0.4 percent to 48,472.93, the Small-Cap advances 0.8 percent to 29,354.06 while Italy Growth is up 0.2 percent to 8,279.84.

In Europe, Paris' CAC 40 gives up 0.3 percent, London's FTSE100 is in the fractional red and Frankfurt's DAX 40 rises 0.3 percent.

On the main list in Piazza Affari, BPER Banca does best of all and rises 2.3 percent. The rating agency Moody's revised its major ratings upward on Monday.

The agency, in particular, revised upward in the Investment Grade area the standalone Baseline Credit Assesment rating from ""ba1"" to ""baa3"" and the long-term ratings on senior unsecured debt and the issuer rating both rising from ""Ba1"" to ""Baa3.""

Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena, Intesa Sanpaolo and Banco BPM follow, with gains between 2.3 percent and 1.1 percent.

Snam gives up 0.3 percent after announcing Tuesday that it has signed a new EUR1 billion Sustainability-linked credit facility that complies with the group's new Sustainable Finance Framework published last February.

The revolving credit facility has a maturity of three years and is linked to specific sustainability targets whose achievement by Snam determines the margin applicable to the financing.

Leonardo is also in the red by 0.4 percent after announcing Friday that it has signed a framework agreement with operator PHI Group for 12 AW189 helicopters to support the global energy market starting in 2025. The agreement, which consists of orders and options, also includes a support partnership, with a service contract, an MRO contract - maintenance, repair and overhaul - and training solutions for the AW139 and AW189 models.

On the cadet segment, Juventus FC takes the top spot with a 4.0% rise followed by De' Longhi, in the green by 3.0%.

The contract for the first frigate and option for an additional nine ships, signed in 2020, has a total value of about EUR5.5 billion and includes after-sales support and crew training.

Maire Tecnimont gives up 0.6 percent. The company announced Thursday that a consortium composed of its subsidiary Tecnimont - Integrated E&C Solutions and Baker Hughes has been awarded an engineering, procurement and construction contract by Sonatrach for the construction of three compressor stations, as well as the upgrading of the gas gathering system, at the Hassi R'mel gas field, 550 kilometers south of Algiers.

The transaction will be financed through the company's available cash, shareholder financing and a EUR300 million loan to be provided by a pool of leading international banks. The pool, led by Unicredit and BNL BNP Paribas as Global Coordinator and Bookrunner, includes Rabobank, Commerzbank, Banco BPM and BPER.

Antares Vision gives up 5.1 percent after reporting Monday that it closed 2023 with a loss of EUR99.6 million, worsening from a loss of EUR503,000 in 2022.

The company points out that operating income is negative EUR2.8 million from a positive EUR5.5 million a year earlier. This result is affected by higher depreciation and amortization charges related to the capitalization of development costs and usage rights for the company's various locations, as well as higher provisions of a prudential nature for credit risks and product warranty fund. The financial component is negative by EUR5.2 million and is influenced by EUR5.4 million in interest and financial charges on loans, EUR1.4 million by the negative balance of foreign exchange gains and losses, offset by EUR1.7 million from the recognition of income from the fair value valuation of warrants.

BY THE NUMBERS

The multi-billion-dollar project, H2 Notos, aims to produce 200,000 metric tons of hydrogen a year using desalinated water from the Mediterranean and electricity from wind and solar farms in southern Tunisia. A ramp-up to 1 million tons per year is possible.

The hydrogen would be transported to Europe through a 3,300 km (2,050 mile) pipeline connecting Tunisia to Italy and continuing onto Austria and Germany, which is being planned by companies including Snam.

Production could begin as early as 2030, with Verbund taking some of the hydrogen and transporting it throughout Central Europe.

WHY IT'S IMPORTANT

The European Union aims to produce 10 million tons and import 10 million tons of renewable hydrogen by 2030 in a bid to replace hydrocarbons, which emit planet-warming gases when burned.

European industrials are already signing hydrogen supply deals and investing to upgrade equipment to run on the green fuel, which emits water when combusted.

KEY QUOTES

""What is notable about this project is its ability to transport low-cost hydrogen directly to Europe via pipeline,"" TEH2 CEO David Corchia said in a media call.

""Pipeline transport adds about 1 euro ($1.09) per kilo to the cost, compared with 3.5 to 4 euros per kilo when you transform hydrogen to ammonia, ship it on a boat, and re-crack it back into hydrogen.""

""The Americans are moving but haven't cracked that problem better than we have. They are still transforming it and putting on boats, it's just that they are heavily subsidized,"" Corchia added.

WHAT'S NEXT

A final investment decision is expected in 2027 or 2028.

According to a recent report published by Report Ocean, titled,""Electric Vehicle Battery Recycling Market by Application: Global Opportunity Analysis and Industry Forecast, 2018 - 2025,""the global electric vehicle battery recycling market size was valued at $138.6 million in 2017, and is projected to reach at $2,272.3 million by 2025, growing at a CAGR of 41.8% from 2018 to 2025. At present, Asia-Pacific dominates the electric vehicle battery recycling market, followed by Europe, North America, and LAMEA. China dominated the Asia-Pacific market in 2017 and Norway led the overall market in Europe. However, in North America, the U.S. currently dominates the electric vehicle battery recycling market.

On July 29, 2017, Britain joined France in pledging to ban the sales of gasoline and diesel cars by 2040 to reduce the toxic vehicle emissions. This is expected to result in the excess demand for the electric vehicles and thereby battery components and raw materials such as lithium, nickel, cobalt, aluminum, and others. Battery makers are struggling to control supply of the raw materials used in the production of these battery packs as the resources are finite and expensive. This results in recycling of the batteries, which have reached its end of the life. The process extracts the vital components from such batteries, which can be used further in other applications due to the scarcity of the supply of metal components such as nickel, cobalt, and more. This in turn supplements the growth of the electric vehicle battery recycling market.

Increase in global concerns regarding the negative effect of climate change along with alarming pollution levels recorded in the major cities have created a significant demand for electric vehicles. The demand for fuel-efficient vehicles has increased recently owing to rise in price of petrol and diesel. Thus, these factors increase the need for advanced fuel-efficient technologies, leading to surge in demand for electrically powered vehicles for travel, which generate demand for the batteries. These batteries are recycled once they reach end of their life. The first batch of batteries from electric and hybrid vehicles have reached their retirement age. The total number of batteries retired from electric bus and car equals to around 55,000 units and is expected to be recycled in 2018. Thus, increase in demand for electric vehicles drives the growth of the EV battery recycling market.

Various companies are working on effective technique to recycle the lithium-ion batter in optimized manner after analyzing the potential demand for the recycled raw materials, such as nickel, cobalt, lithium, and others. For instance, Kemetco is working with American Manganese to develop a scalable and commercialized recycling technology for Lithium-ion batteries, which is low cost as well as environment friendly. In addition, the amount of the recycled lithium is expected to satisfy 9% of the global demand for lithium in various applications. More than 66% of the spent EV batteries are expected to be recycled in China which will be used to serve the countrys fast growing battery material industry.

Recycling of EV batteries involves processes such as collecting, dismantling, processing, and more. Approximately, 15 jobs are created per thousand tons of lithium-ion battery waste, for collecting, dismantling, and recycling these batteries. Out of these 15 jobs, 20% of jobs are for the recycling of batteries and 80% are for collecting and dismantling lithium-ion batteries. This increases the job opportunities in the industry. This growth might be fueled by the government initiatives such as subsidies on the sales of electric vehicles, which eventually result in increase in sales of the battery of the electric vehicle. Therefore, increase in job opportunities involved in the recycling process of these batteries drives the electric vehicle battery recycling market growth.

However, electric vehicles require high-performance batteries to operate efficiently. Hence, such batteries, which are removed from the vehicles are able to charge and discharge to a specific point, which is around 70% to 80%. Instead of recycling these batteries which have reached its end of the life stage and are removed from the vehicle, the battery cells can be re manufactured and the cells can be given a second life in storage applications. For instance, Toyota and Chubu Electric Power Co. will be constructing a large-capacity storage battery system that reuses recycled batteries from Toyota electric vehicles to construct storage battery system. This hampers the growth of the electric vehicle battery recycling market.

Key Findings of the Electric Vehicle Battery Recycling Market:

Based on application, the electric buses segment generated the highest revenue in the global electric vehicle battery recycling market in 2017.

LAMEA is anticipated to exhibit the highest CAGR during the forecast period.

In 2017, Asia-Pacific contributed the highest electric vehicle battery recycling market share, followed by Europe, North America, and LAMEA.

The key players profiled in the report include ACCUREC Recycling GmbH, American Manganese Inc., Battery Solutions, LI-CYCLE CORP., G & P Service , Recupyl, Retriev Technologies, SITRASA, SNAM S.A.S., and Umicore.

Interim Financial Results for the six months ended 31 March 2024

This announcement contains regulated information.

* Two quarterly dividends were paid during the period totalling 4.00p per share. With effect from the dividend paid in February 2024, the quarterly dividend was increased by 5.1% to 2.05p per share (8.2p per share per annum)

* The Company continues to buy back shares while the share price is at a significant discount to the NAV; your board considers this to be in

the best interests of shareholders

* Continuing growth in earnings and dividends from companies in the portfolio suggests compelling value and is at odds with currently low

valuation multiples for these essential assets businesses

1. Please refer to Alternative Performance Measures in the Interim Report.

2. Dividends paid (annualised) as a percentage of share price.

3. Gearing is the Company's borrowings (including the net amounts due from/to brokers) less cash divided by net assets attributable to shareholders.

4. The ongoing charges figure is calculated in accordance with guidance issued by the Association of Investment Companies (""AIC"") as the

operating costs (annualised) divided by the average NAV (with income) throughout the period.

5. The Company was incorporated on 27 June 2016 and its investment activities began on 13 September 2016 when the liquid assets of Ecofin Water & Power Opportunities plc (""EWPO"") were transferred to it. The formal inception date for the measurement of the Company's performance is 26 September 2016, the date its shares were listed on the London Stock Exchange.

6. Total return includes dividends paid and reinvested immediately. Please also refer to the Alternative Performance Measures in the Interim Report.

7. The S&P Global Infrastructure Index and MSCI World Utilities Index are the global sector indices deemed the most appropriate for performance comparison purposes. The Company does not have a formal benchmark index. The other indices are provided for general interest.

I am pleased to report that your Company's net asset value (NAV) increased by 9.0% over the six months to 31 March 2024, including the reinvestment of dividends. This exceeded the comparative global sector indices, the S&P Global Infrastructure Index and the MSCI World Utilities Index, which both increased by 8.2% (total return in sterling). The share price total return was more modest at 3.2% because the discount widened, averaging 14.2% during the six months. Investment trusts generally continued to be out of favour, as evidenced by unusually

large share price discounts to NAV.

As our Investment Manager explains in more detail, performance was encouragingly strong in the North American part of the portfolio. Exposure to select US utilities had already been increased, stock selection was beneficial, and utility valuations finally began to recover. Despite falling European natural gas and power prices for much of the half-year, the portfolio's diversified pan-European group of shares, spanning utilities, transportation infrastructure and environmental services, also contributed positively to the NAV. Our modest level of gearing enhanced the NAV as well, helped by the fact that the cost of borrowings was once again lower than the portfolio's dividend yield.

Continuation vote

Shareholders demonstrated their support for the Company by voting overwhelmingly in favour of the continuation vote put to shareholders at the recent Annual General Meeting (AGM). The next continuation vote will be at the AGM in 5 years' time.

Dividends

In light of growth in investment income and earnings per share, we were pleased to announce in December a 5.1% increase in the quarterly dividend to 2.05p per share (8.20p per annum) with effect from the dividend paid in February 2024. Growth in our portfolio's income continued during the half-year to 31 March: compared with the same period last year, investment income and revenue per share increased by 10.8% and 11.4% respectively. At the current share price and increased dividend rate, the Company's shares yield 4.4%.

Share price and buybacks

When our shares were trading at a premium to net asset value, we issued over 12 million new shares to investors. Subsequently, and alongside much of the rest of the investment trust sector, our share price sank to a double digit percentage discount. We think it is right to balance our willingness to issue at a premium with a willingness to buy back shares. Accordingly, during the half-year we used the authority granted by shareholders to repurchase a total of 1.3 million shares (£2.1 million), with an additional 3.3 million shares repurchased since 31 March. This has enhanced NAV to the benefit of shareholders.

At the AGM, Iain McLaren retired from the board and Joanna Santinon succeeded him as chair of the audit committee. Susannah Nicklin was appointed Senior Independent Director.

Outlook

Continuing growth in earnings and dividends is expected from companies in the portfolio. The currently low valuation multiples for many of these essential assets businesses in both absolute terms and relative to broader markets strongly suggest that these companies are significantly undervalued relative to their prospects for growth, earnings and cash generation.

In the current economic environment, we believe that the portfolio has some significant strengths.

First, a high proportion of portfolio companies have revenues which are inflation-linked and based on long term contracts.

Secondly, your Company's utility exposure includes leading power generators and owners of major transmission and distribution grids. These network operators are as fundamental to the delivery of the energy transition as renewable energy sources, and they are stepping up capital investments meaningfully.

Your Investment Manager expects attractive returns will be earned on these investments.

Thirdly, portfolio companies providing transportation infrastructure and environmental services have attractive and growing dividend yields based on long term earnings growth derived from demand and strong pricing power.

After a difficult 18 months, we are confident that we passed a turning point in February and that the prospect for shareholders has become much brighter. Since then, the share price has appreciated by 21% (11% since the end of March) and we have declared a second quarterly dividend of 2.05p.

After sharp declines in August and September last year as interest rates spiked, EGL's NAV and share price recovered in the final calendar quarter of 2023. This proved to be a false dawn with both falling back to their 2023 lows by February 2024 while equity market momentum was centred around technology sectors and expectations for interest rate cuts were scaled back. February has proved to have been a decisive turning point though with a marked improvement in EGL's performance since then.

During the half-year we remained focussed on the underlying performance of portfolio companies which, on both sides of the Atlantic, were mostly delivering good results, eye-catching dividend growth and return-enhancing capital expenditure plans. In the US, power demand dynamics strengthened (due to the economy generally as well as GenAI, datacentres, re-shoring, EVs) and utility valuations stabilised, helped by a renaissance for nuclear power and positive news from bellwether NextEra Energy. These factors, along with a notable improvement in forward power prices since February, resulted in a strong rally in the NAV in the half-year's final month, March. Over the six months to 31 March, the NAV increased by 9.0%.

Performance summary

Returns were strong and ahead of local sector indices in the US and European parts of the portfolio, and overall performance benefitted from last year's exercise to increase the US allocation in view of depressed utility valuations. The lion's share of the NAV advance during the half-year was attributable to large US utilities NextEra Energy, American Electric Power, Constellation Energy, Edison International and Vistra, together over 22% of the portfolio. Non-OECD holdings in Australia and Hong Kong-listed Chinese names, notably Xinyi Energy, continued to be weak.

By sub-sector, the brightest spots were nuclear power producers (net cashflow positive nuclear specialists Constellation and Vistra), transportation infrastructure (ENAV, Ferrovial, Vinci), and network infrastructure owner/operators with a growth acceleration underway (E.ON, National Grid, American Electric Power, Public Service Enterprise Group). Although it didn't perform as well during the half-year, we include SSE in this high growth power transmission group where networks comprise a large proportion of cash flow and capital investment. Some European power generators and integrated utilities lagged, principally RWE. RWE cautioned in January that lower commodity prices could impact 2024 earnings, causing weakness in the European utility sector more widely, even though many integrated utilities - EDP, Enel, Iberdrola - would benefit near term as buyers of power.

Constellation (pure nuclear) and Vistra (nuclear and other baseload power) performed remarkably well - Vistra +99% since its addition to the portfolio in November and Constellation +70% over the six months to 31 March - capturing investors' interest as direct plays on power demand growth from GenAI and datacentres. Nuclear power offers 24/7 year-round decarbonised electricity, the Production Tax Credit in the IRA provides a floor tariff for nuclear electricity, and these two companies' results were starting to beat earnings forecasts.

NextEra Energy delivered two strong earnings reports during the period to which the shares barely reacted. It took until the company's analysts' day in March, devoted to renewables development expertise and competitive advantages, for the shares to gather positive momentum. The shelving of a federal investigation into a complaint alleging the company's Florida utility had violated political campaign fundraising laws also lifted an overhang for the shares.

Purchases & sales

Along with Vistra, Snam, a regulated natural gas transportation and storage infrastructure company in Europe, was added to the portfolio and the positions in E.ON, Edison International, Vinci and Veolia were increased significantly. These purchases further increased the portfolio's exposure to energy transmission and distribution (regulated growth), baseload nuclear power provision (unregulated growth) and transportation and environmental services (inflation-linked growth). Power price exposure was lowered via partial sales of Drax, AES, EDP and Iberdrola. Endesa and APA Group were exited. In the sector allocation table, E.ON was reclassified as regulated (from integrated).

Income and gearing

Income from investments continues to grow. Compared with last year, dividend receipts increased by 10.8% and the revenue return per share increased by 11.4%.

Gearing averaged 11% during the half-year. Borrowings, which had been significantly reduced by December 2023, were built back up by the end of March, not least because the positive spread between dividend yields and the cost of borrowings had been reestablished.

Outlook

The upswing in portfolio performance that began in March has persisted. We expect that valuation multiples in EGL's listed infrastructure sectors, which remain near historic lows relative to broad market averages, will continue to expand. There are plenty of compelling investment opportunities with the earnings momentum we're seeing and dividends yields in the region of 3-8%. Utilities in the portfolio will continue to grow their earnings, almost irrespective of the economic backdrop due to the proportions of revenues which are fully contracted or regulated. The adoption of artificial intelligence and datacentres are supporting our expectation for power demand growth in the US and, moreover, datacentre owners are showing a willingness to pay a premium for reliable and clean electricity, recognising that electricity is not plentiful and that uninterrupted clean energy is not a commodity. The growth the sector should experience globally will also reflect the quantum increase in investments in electricity networks we are seeing. A pronounced acceleration in capex growth by power grid operators is underway, motivated by the ever increasing installed base of renewables capacity for which new transmission and distribution connections are required, the electrification of economies and the associated need for grid upgrades. Investment need and allowed returns for these regulated activities are usually highly correlated.

Beyond power utilities, we continue to like the opportunities amongst companies operating and investing to upgrade environmental services and transportation infrastructure. These parts of the portfolio contribute growth, a degree of cyclicality, inflation protection (airports and toll roads, for example, have long term pricing power in relation to inflation) and provide diversification. Very large sums have been raised by private equity since December 2023 to devote to infrastructure investment globally, adding to already record levels of available cash. In view of the significant gap in valuations between listed and private infrastructure, merger and acquisition activity is returning to this strategy's sectors and should provide support for a re-rating of the growth opportunity.

The total column of the Condensed Statement of Comprehensive Income is the profit and loss account of the Company.

The revenue and capital columns are supplementary to this and are published under guidance from the AIC.

All revenue and capital returns in the above statement derive from continuing operations. No operations were acquired or discontinued during the six months ended 31 March 2024.

The Company has no other comprehensive income and therefore the net return on ordinary activities after taxation is also the total comprehensive income for the period.

1. The special reserve may be used, where the board considers it appropriate, by the Company for the purposes of paying dividends to

shareholders and, in particular, smoothing payments of dividends to shareholders.

The Condensed Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard (""FRS"") 104 Interim Financial Reporting and with the Statement of Recommended Practice 'Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies and Venture Capital Trusts' issued in July 2022. The Condensed Financial Statements are prepared in Sterling which is the functional currency of the Company and rounded to the nearest £'000. They have also been prepared on a going concern basis and approval as an investment trust has been granted by HMRC.

The Condensed Financial Statements have been prepared using the same accounting policies as the preceding Financial Statements which were prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 102.

The financial information contained in this Interim Report does not constitute statutory accounts as defined in Sections 434-436 of the Companies Act 2006. The financial information for the periods ended 31 March 2024 and 31 March 2023 has not been audited.

The information for the year ended 30 September 2023 has been extracted from the latest published audited Financial Statements which have been filed with the Registrar of Companies. The report of the Auditor on those accounts contained no qualification or statement under Section 498 of the Companies Act 2006.

Income from investments, including taxes deducted at source, is included in revenue by reference to the date on which the investment is quoted ex-dividend. Special dividends are credited to capital or revenue, according to the circumstances. The fixed returns on debt securities are recognised on a time apportionment basis so as to reflect the effective yield on the debt securities. Interest receivable from cash and short-term deposits is treated on an accruals basis.

All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis. Expenses are charged to the revenue account except where they directly relate to the acquisition or disposal of an investment, in which case they are charged to the capital account; in addition, expenses are charged to the capital account where a connection with the maintenance or enhancement of the value of the investments can be demonstrated. In this respect, since 1 October 2022 the management fee and overdraft interest have been allocated 60% to the capital account and 40% to the revenue account (previously 50% to the capital account and 50% to the revenue account).

The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year to date and takes into account, if applicable, taxation deferred because of timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes. Deferred taxation is provided using the liability method on all timing differences, calculated at the rate at which it is anticipated the timing differences will reverse. Deferred tax assets are recognised only when, on the basis of available evidence, it is more likely than not that there will be taxable profits in future against which the deferred tax asset can be offset.

Due to the Company's status as an investment trust company and the intention to continue meeting the conditions required to obtain approval in the foreseeable future, the Company has not provided deferred tax on any capital gains and losses arising on the revaluation or disposal of investments.

The tax effect of different items of income/gain and expenditure/loss is allocated between capital and revenue within the Condensed Statement of Comprehensive Income on the same basis as the particular item to which it relates using the Company's effective rate of tax for the year, based on the marginal basis.

For the purposes of preparing the Condensed Financial Statements, the Company has applied Sections 11 and 12 of FRS 102 in respect of financial instruments. All investments are measured initially and subsequently at fair value and transaction costs are expensed immediately. Investment transactions are accounted for on a trade date basis. The fair value of the financial instruments in the Condensed Statement of Financial Position is based on their quoted bid price at the reporting date, without deduction of the estimated future selling costs. Changes in the fair value of investments held at fair value through profit or loss and gains and losses on disposal are recognised in the Condensed Statement of Comprehensive Income as ""Gains on investments held at fair value through profit or loss"". Also included within this caption are transaction costs in relation to the purchase or sale of investments, including the difference between the purchase price of an investment and its bid price at the date of purchase.

Cash comprises cash in hand and demand deposits. Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and that are subject to insignificant risk of change in value.

Short-term borrowings, which comprise of prime brokerage borrowings, are recognised initially at the fair value of the consideration received, net of any issue expenses, and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The finance costs, being the difference between the net proceeds of borrowings and the total amount of payments required to be made in respect of those borrowings, accrue evenly over the life of the borrowings and are allocated 40% to revenue and 60% to capital.

The directors are of the opinion that the Company is engaged in a single segment of business activity, being investment business.

Consequently, no business segmental analysis is provided.

The balance classified as share premium includes the premium above nominal value received by the Company on issuing shares net

The special reserve arose following court approval in November 2016 to transfer £123,609,000 from the share premium account. This reserve is distributable and may be used, where the board considers it appropriate, by the Company for the purposes of paying dividends to shareholders and, in particular, augmenting or smoothing payments of dividends to shareholders. There is no guarantee that the board will in fact make use of this reserve for the purpose of the payment of dividends to shareholders. The special reserve can also be used to fund the cost of share buy-backs.

Gains and losses on disposal of investments and changes in fair values of investments are transferred to the capital account. Foreign exchange differences of a capital nature are also transferred to the capital account. The capital element of the management fee and relevant finance costs are charged to this account. Any associated tax relief is also credited to this account.

This reserve reflects all income and costs which are recognised in the revenue column of the Statement of Comprehensive Income.

The Company's special reserve, capital reserve and revenue reserve may be distributed by way of dividend.

Monetary assets and liabilities and non-monetary assets held at fair value in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the Condensed Statement of Financial Position date. Transactions involving foreign currencies are converted at the rate ruling on the date of the transaction. Gains and losses on the translation of foreign currencies are recognised in the revenue or capital account of the Condensed Statement of Comprehensive Income depending on the nature of the underlying item.

Dividends are recognised in the period in which they are paid.

During the six months ended 31 March 2024, the Company received no special dividends (31 March 2023: £nil and 30 September 2023: £83,000).

During the period the Company suffered withholding tax on overseas dividend income of £602,000 (31 March 2023: £392,000).

At 31 March 2024 there were 114,920,697 ordinary shares of 1p each in issue of which 770,179 were held in treasury (with no voting rights) (31 March 2023: 101,363,423 of which nil were held in treasury; 30 September 2023: 115,495,663 of which nil were held in treasury). During the half-year ended 31 March 2024, 544,966 shares were bought back for cancellation and 770,179 were bought back to treasury at a total cost of £2,083,000 (31 March 2023: 2,411,000 shares were issued for net proceeds of £5,153,000 and 30 September 2023: 4,581,577 shares were issued for net proceeds of £9,793,000 and 1,054,337 shares were bought back for cancellation for a net payment of £1,819,000).

Since 31 March 2024 the Company has bought back 3,298,488 ordinary shares to treasury for a net cost of £5,713,246.

The capital reserve reflected in the Condensed Statement of Financial Position at 31 March 2024 includes gains of £16,226,000 (31 March 2023: gains of £37,832,000 and 30 September 2023: losses of £1,225,000) which relate to the revaluation of investments held at the reporting date.

A second interim dividend for 2024 of 2.05p will be paid on 31 May 2024 to shareholders on the register on 3 May 2024. The ex-dividend date was 2 May 2024.

During the period expenses were incurred in acquiring or disposing of investments classified as fair value through profit or loss. These have been expensed through capital and are included within gains on investments in the Condensed Statement of Comprehensive Income. The total costs were as follows:

The above transaction costs are calculated in line with AIC's Statement of Recommended Practice (SORP). The transaction costs in the Company's Key Information Document are calculated on a different basis and in line with the EU's Packaged Retail Investment and Insurance-based Products (PRIIPs) regulations.

FRS 102 requires an entity to classify fair value measurements using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements. The fair value hierarchy shall have the following levels:

Level 1: unadjusted quoted prices in an active market for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date;

Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable (i.e. developed using market data) for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and

Level 3: inputs are unobservable (i.e. for which market data is unavailable) for the asset or liability.

The financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value in the Condensed Statement of Financial Position are grouped into the fair value hierarchy at the reporting date as follows:

The fair value of the Company's investments in equities and preference shares has been determined by reference to their quoted bid prices at the reporting date. Equities and preference shares included in Fair Value Level 1 are actively traded on recognised stock exchanges. Investments categorised as Level 2 are not considered to trade in active markets.

11. Related party transactions and transactions with the Investment Manager

Fees payable to the directors and their interests in shares of the Company are considered to be related party transactions and are disclosed within the Directors' Remuneration Report on pages 30 to 31 of the 2023 annual report. The balance of fees due to directors at the period end was £nil (31 March 2023: £nil and 30 September 2023: £nil).

The Company has an agreement with Ecofin Advisors Limited for the provision of investment management services.

The investment management fee is calculated at 1.00% per annum of the Company's NAV on the first £200 million and 0.75% per annum of NAV thereafter, payable quarterly in arrears. The management fee was chargeable 50% to revenue and 50% to capital until 30 September 2022. With effect from 1 October 2022 the management fee is chargeable 40% to revenue and 60% to capital.

A statement reconciling the movement in net funds to the net cash flow has not been presented as there are no differences from the above analysis.

The principal and emerging risks and uncertainties that could have a material impact on the Company's performance have not changed from those set out on pages 15 to 18 of the Company's Annual Report for the year ended 30 September 2023.

Italian officials privately met with the executives behind the so-called Medlink project, in a sign that Rome would be willing to throw its political weight behind the plan, people familiar with the matter said.

The project calls for setting up installations including solar panels in Tunisia and Algeria, with the energy produced then exported to the Italian regions of Tuscany and Liguria via subsea lines, according to a confidential project document viewed by Bloomberg News.

The proposal was drawn up by Zhero, a company launched by former executives at gas network operator Snam SpA that recently completed financing of over €100 million ($108 million) for its start-up phase.

Zhero will need to reach about €5 billion to put the plan into action, the people said, asking not to be named discussing confidential deliberations. This poses a financing challenge to the feasibility of the project as, according to the document, development costs will have be covered by customers who book and buy electricity.

Medlink has some support at European level, having been included in the Entso-e long-term plan for the bloc's power transmission operators, and it's been integrated into Meloni's broader program for Africa that Rome says will foster growth and reduce migrant arrivals by sea.

Energy generated for Medlink could eventually account for 8% of Italy's annual electricity consumption, according to the document, which also says that providing significant new volumes of supply to the continent could make the country an ""energy hub for Europe.""

That would fit well with Meloni's plan for the region, which she has personally visited at least three times since taking office in 2022. The initative, dubbed the Mattei plan, is aimed at fostering development in the region and reducing migrant arrivals by sea.

Meloni's government has already authorized another subsea cable project linking Tunisia and southern Italy. That project, known as Elmed, will be led by state-controlled power grid operator Terna SpA and Société Tunisienne de l'Electricité et du Gaz, according to a May 15 statement.

The new link could give the premier a tangible chance to showcase her commitment to the region and to energy security to European allies as she pushes to elevate Italy's standing internationally, people familiar with the matter said.

The Tunisia and Algeria-based windmills, solar panels and battery storage sites under Medlink could account for a total of 10 GW installed capacity to deliver up to 28 TW per year of energy to northern Italy via two high-voltage offshore cables, according to the document.

The project, which is scheduled to start operations in 2030, would also aim to export power to Austria, Germany and Switzerland.

The project calls for setting up installations including solar panels in Tunisia and Algeria, with the energy produced then exported to the Italian regions of Tuscany and Liguria via subsea lines, according to a confidential project document viewed by Bloomberg News.

The proposal was drawn up by Zhero, a company launched by former executives at gas network operator Snam SpA that recently completed financing of over €100 million ($108 million) for its start-up phase.

Zhero will need to reach about €5 billion to put the plan into action, the people said, asking not to be named discussing confidential deliberations. This poses a financing challenge to the feasibility of the project as, according to the document, development costs will have be covered by customers who book and buy electricity.

Medlink has some support at European level, having been included in the Entso-e long-term plan for the bloc's power transmission operators, and it's been integrated into Meloni's broader program for Africa that Rome says will foster growth and reduce migrant arrivals by sea.",financialpost.com,news,Financial Post,,0.192156862745098,454171033,1,https://smartcdn.gprod.postmedia.digital/financialpost/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/top-10-african-energy-and-mineral-exporters-to-italy.jpg,

These plants produce 190 GWh of biomethane annually, eliminating 65,000 tons of greenhouse gas emissions. The acquisition supports Verdalia's European expansion, leveraging Italy's supportive regulatory framework for decarbonization and renewable energy incentives.

Verdalia Bioenergy, a platform launched by Goldman Sachs in February 2023 to invest over a billion euros in Europe in the biomethane sector by 2026, has acquired a portfolio of 7 operating plants in the Brescia area for the production of biomethane from funds controlled by Green Arrow Capital and Lazzari & Lucchini, a company specialized in the production of energy from renewable and sustainable sources.

In the operation, Green Arrow and L&L were assisted by MFZ (financial advisor), Parola & Associati (legal and regulatory aspects) while Verdalia Bioenergy was supported by Intesa Sanpaolo (for the M&A aspects), by Ashurst (for the legal aspects), by EY (for the financial and fiscal part), by Ramboll (in the technical field) and by ERM (for environmental issues).

The portfolio consists of plants with a total production capacity of approximately 190 GWh of biomethane deriving from the treatment of 350 thousand tonnes of raw materials per year, with the possibility of expanding these volumes by over 50%. The plants have come into operation over the last few years and aim to eliminate approximately 65 thousand tons of greenhouse gas emissions per year. The construction of the assets is part of the partnership, started in 2020, which now aims to double the number of plants with a second portfolio of at least six assets , which will come into operation by 2025.

The entire portfolio of these first 7 plants produces biomethane thanks to the sole recovery of livestock effluents and agricultural by-products not intended for human consumption. During 2023, the last four of the seven plants were put into operation and, last December, the project financing of the entire portfolio was finalized.

The seven plants bought by Verdalia Bioenergy, built and financed between 2020 and 2023, are incentivized pursuant to the Ministerial Decree ""Biomethane 2018"", which represented a significant step towards the promotion of renewable energy in the Italian energy sector, establishing incentives and regulations to encourage the production and use of biomethane.

In detail, the last four plants inaugurated in March were: Bio Gottolengo Solaro and CH4 Gottolengo, both located in Gottolengo; Bio Sole, located in Montichiari; and Gambaresca in Verolanuova. The three that have already been operational for some time are Bio Tre Ponti, located in Borgo San Giacomo; Bio Industria, with production of BIOGNL, and Bio Verola, both in Verolanuova.

The acquisition of the latter portfolio therefore strengthens Verdalia Bioenergy's presence in Europe in the biomethane sector on the continent, building on an infrastructure business model . All plants benefit from the incentive program established by the Ministerial Decree of 2 March 2018 and the feedstock is guaranteed through medium-long term supply contracts.

Fernando Bergasa, president and CEO of Verdalia Bioenergy, commented: ""We believe that Italy is at the forefront of the European decarbonization program through biomethane, which is based on a supportive regulatory framework , and we are proud to actively contribute to the plan energy transition of the country through this important investment.""

Matteo Botto Poala, managing director of Goldman Sachs Asset Management's infrastructure investment business, added: ""We are very happy with the progress made by Verdalia which, once again, is testament to Goldman Sachs Asset Management's track record in being a pioneer in investments for the energy transition and in the development of successful platforms. We look forward to continuing to invest in European biomethane and attracting new talent to join Verdalia's world-class management team.""

Matteo Grandi, country manager of Verdalia Italia, concluded: ""Green Arrow and L&L have developed 7 high-level biomethane plants. The acquisition of these plants represents an important starting point to launch our activities in Italy and we look to the future with optimism, continuing to work on our expansion in the country.""

Grandi, previously responsible for agricultural and agri-industrial biomethane at Snam and previously at Ladurner, was appointed last September to lead the development of Verdalia Bioenergy Italia's activities, at the same time as the announcement of the company's entry into the Italian market. Verdalia Bioenergy had conducted its first investment in Spain, coinciding with the launch of the platform in early 2023, relating to a portfolio of biomethane projects in intermediate development, with a total capacity of approximately 150 GWh/year.

Since then the company has made significant progress and now has a team of 50 people and a pipeline of mid-to-late-stage development projects in Spain and Italy with a volume of over 2.5 TWh of biomethane per year. As explained in a note from the company, Verdalia Bioenergy will continue to pursue new expansion opportunities through the acquisition of brownfield and greenfield projects , establishing partnerships with EPCs and long-term agreements with offtakers and feedstock suppliers, also thanks to the strengthening of its team.

Biodiversity is essential to ensure people's health and well-being and preserve life on earth. This policy defines the commitments and actions that Snam adopts to protect biodiversity.

Snam's commitment to safeguarding biodiversity is consistent with what has already been established in its Health, Safety, Environment, Energy and Quality Policy (HSEEQ Policy) and is inspired by the main national and international guidelines and strategic plans on the subject. In particular, Snam's Policy refers to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) adopted in 1992, the United Nations 2030 Agenda, in particular the goal 15 ""Life on Earth"", the EU's 2020 Biodiversity Strategy, the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework adopted in 2022 during COP 15, and the National Biodiversity Strategy adopted in 2023.

Snam is a company that operates in the transport, storage and regasification of natural gas. The company manages a network of gas pipelines that extensively covers the national territory, owns storage facilities that contribute to the country's energy security and operates through regasification plants to ensure the diversification of energy supplies. To consolidate its role as an enabler of the energy transition and with the aim of contributing to the decarbonization of the country, Snam has developed new business lines over the years related to the production of biomethane, energy efficiency, sustainable mobility, the development of hydrogen and Carbon Capture & Storage (CCS) technologies.

In line with the principles it commits to adhere to, Snam has developed over time an approach for the management of its infrastructure, from the design phase to the decommissioning phase, based on key principles that express a rigorous application of the hierarchy of mitigation of its impacts on the environment and biodiversity. In particular, the principles followed by Snam are as follows:

Following this approach, Snam, for its linear gas transport infrastructures, has been operating for some time in a regime of substantial Zero Net Conversion in the construction and maintenance activities of the infrastructures, neutralizing the impacts resulting from the change in land use caused by its operations through the restoration by reforestation of the occupied areas (no net deforestation).",marketscreener.com,news,Market Screener,,0.4901960784313726,454010315,48,,

Today, only about 5,000 miles of carbon dioxide pipeline are operational in the US - the equivalent of 0.2% of the combined natural gas and oil pipelines in the US. Considering other energy transition transport needs, only 1,600 miles of hydrogen pipeline are operational in the US - 0.1% of the natural gas and oil pipelines. Simply put, we have a long way to go until our pipeline system supports CO2 or hydrogen transport.

Or, perhaps we don't.

Studies have shown that it may be safe to blend hydrogen with natural gas in our existing pipeline infrastructure, albeit, with some modifications required to infrastructure and protocol. It may also be possible to adapt existing natural gas pipelines to transport carbon dioxide - again, with modifications. To be truly ""fuel-agnostic"" there are various factors that need to be considered when transporting different fuels in existing pipeline infrastructure. But, there is also technology already in existence today that can help solve these challenges.

CO2 is transported in pipelines at pressures that are more than double the pressure of natural gas pipelines. This allows the CO2 to stay in a dense phase above its critical temperature. Hydrogen pipelines would also be higher pressure than natural gas pipelines but for a different reason. Hydrogen is much lighter than natural gas. By volume, hydrogen provides 1/3 the energy as natural gas. Therefore, to get the same amount of energy to end applications, pipeline operators would either need to increase the pressure of hydrogen or increase the volume of hydrogen transported.

Both equipment for compression and pressure letdown must be adapted to the requirements of different gases for a pipeline to be truly agnostic. However, there are technologies that exist today that have the potential to be flexible for these applications. For example, Baker Hughes' turbo-compressor technology can now support up to 10% hydrogen blend and is being tested by leading European natural gas midstream operator Snam in Italy's gas network.

However, the challenge of compressing hydrogen or CO2, can be costly. Energy recovery systems are particularly promising in terms of offsetting some of the higher costs of hydrogen and CO2 compression by creating green electricity from the byproducts of these very processes. For example, Sapphire Technologies' FreeSpin® In-line Turboexpander (FIT), which is used to recover waste energy during pressure letdown processes in existing natural gas infrastructure, has various adaptations that make it a fuel-flexible decarbonization investment for pipeline operators.

Because the FIT has been successfully adapted for higher pressure fuels, it can be used for hydrogen liquefaction and pressure letdown processes. Liquefaction allows hydrogen to be stored in its densest state and transported with highest efficiency. Hydrogen liquefaction is achieved through a series of compression, cooling and expansion processes.

Using the Sapphire FreeSpin® turboexpander system, the energy lost in expansion processes can be recovered and used to offset energy consumed in other areas of the liquefaction process, such as powering the compressors. In pressure letdown processes, high pressure hydrogen would flow into the FreeSpin® turboexpander, which would expand the gas and generate electricity, once again creating energy that can be recycled into the operation or sold to generate additional revenue.

Hydrogen (H2), having an incredibly small mass, is prone to leak when stored and transported in pressurized equipment. The FIT eliminates potential leaks by providing a hermetically sealed environment with no dynamic seals.

To maintain the integrity of a pipeline carrying high pressure CO2 or hydrogen/hydrogen-blended natural gas, filtration systems to remove impurities must be adapted to meet the specifics on these fuels. For example, a dehydration system can help reduce risk of corrosion to pipelines carrying CO2, since wet CO2 can cause corrosion. Crack arrestors can also be installed to help a pipeline withstand CO2 or Hydrogen-induced cracking.

A new technology invented by researchers at the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) may also provide a solution to meet the pipeline integrity challenges of adapting natural gas pipelines to other fuels. The invention is a self-healing cold spray coating that can be applied to existing pipelines to protect from internal corrosion. On the software side of technological developments, technology like digital twinning can allow pipeline operators to test and predict how a pipeline will operate under different pressure, flow, and stress conditions by creating a virtual model of the pipeline - all without impacting the physical pipeline.

Materials, hardware, and software innovations are all helping to make it more viable for natural gas pipeline operators to adapt their existing infrastructure to expedite emission-reducing endeavors like carbon capture and switching to cleaner fuels like hydrogen. Pipeline operators are already investing in important projects to create fuel-agnostic pipelines. For example, British midstream operator National Gas made news in March by testing various concentrations of hydrogen in a segment of their pipeline, including pure hydrogen - a world's first. Leading US midstream provider Tallgrass Energy is converting its Trailblazer natural gas pipeline for carbon dioxide transport, which will ultimately result in a 400-mile CO2 pipeline that can transport over 10 million tons of CO2 per year.

One important way climate technology providers can help energy companies future-proof their assets is by envisioning and developing solutions that are fuel-flexible. By doing so, climate technology providers can close the gap between investing in decarbonization solutions for existing systems and investing in technology to support the energy transition for energy companies. ""Fuel-flexible"" should become table stakes especially when partnering with midstream operators - because the pipeline of the future is fuel-agnostic.",carbonherald.com,news,Carbon Herald,Vasil Velev,0.3019607843137255,453893607,1,https://carbonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/unnamed.jpg,eng-9573365

Operator

Good morning. This is a chorus call conference operator. Welcome and thank you for joining the Snam First Quarter 2024 Consolidated Results Conference Call. As a reminder, all participants are in listen-only mode. After the presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Francesca Pezzoli, Head of Investor Relations of Snam. Please go ahead, Madam.

Francesca Pezzoli

Good morning ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Snam Q1 2024 consolidated results. Today's presentation will be hosted by our CEO, Stefano Venier and by our CFO, Luca Passa. In the presentation, Stefano will provide you an overview of the key highlights of the period. Luca will walk you through the financial performance. Then back to Stefano for closing remarks and finally, the Q&A session.

And now, I will hand over to Stefano.

Stefano Venier

Good morning. Let me go through key highlights on Page 2. First quarter posted a strong performance with the adjusted EBITDA at EUR703 million, up 18% year-on-year mainly thanks to the weighted average cost of capital uplift, the ROSS effect, the RAB growth and the output based incentives. Adjusted net income at EUR335 million is up 11% year-on-year while investments reached EUR462 million, up 48% versus Q1 2023 and the net debt at EUR15.8 billion with 2.4% average net cost of debt.

Gas demand declined by 2.6%. This, along with well-supplied market and high gas storage level in Europe contributed to keep average gas prices 50% below the same period of last year. In April, gas prices experienced some volatility due to the colder weather conditions and the continuous geopolitical tensions.

As known, the annual weighted average cost of capital update triggered an uplift of 80 bps on transport and 60 basis points on storage and LNG applied from January '24. The base, ROSS, was applied to transport from 2024 with positive effect on [fast-slow-money] (ph) accounting. We have been contributed to the working groups set by the Italian Ministry of Energy and Environment, which has the target to release the H2 strategy by the summer along with the National Energy Plan and to define the CCS framework by the autumn. The European Commission announced recently the results of the pipe of the EU Hydrogen Bank auctions, awarding more than EUR700 million, corresponding to 90% of the total available subsidy pool to several renewable hydrogen production projects across different areas and sectors.

Moving to our associates. We continue with our active portfolio management. As you know, we have exercised the preemption right to increase from 7.3% to 30% our stake in Adriatic LNG regas unit terminal following the signing with -- by VTTI of the agreement to acquire a majority stake in the company. The closing of the transaction is expected by the year-end. The deal will further strengthen our asset platform in the LNG sector up to 20 bcm. Moreover, we are in the exclusive negotiation until June with the Edison for the potential acquisition of Edison Stoccaggio. At the same time, our strategy is to extract value from existing portfolio, and we are actively engaging with the Austrian regulator for 2025, 2027 tariff review. The new reference price methodology is under consultation, and we expect the final determination by the end of May. It will provide volume risk stabilization and increase in the visibility of the next three-year regulatory period.

Turning to Page 3. We are progressing on our strategy to become a pan-European multi-molecule operator, leveraging on synergies between gas infrastructure and energy transition businesses. Starting from gas infrastructure, first, the works for the first phase of the Adriatic corridor, the backbone to strengthen the south to north capacity just started, and we are progressing with the works with the Ravenna FSRU terminal. To the latter, the onshore segment is 70% complete with the offshore part is at 30% and the platform construction started in this space. Storage level reached 60% at the end of the winter, well above the historical levels for this period of the year. It was also supported by 3 bcm of commercial reverse flow service that we delivered to the system, and it will be help keeping under control gas prices volatility and making the infilling season smoother. Finally, 100% of the 12.4 bcm of storage capacity for the 2024, 2025 thermal year was allocated, of which 6.4 bcm during auction in April.

Let's now move into energy transition. The two projects, SouthH2Corridor and the Callisto Mediterranean CCS in Ravenna in which we are involved as a partner, as you know, have both been confirmed by the European Commission in the sixth list of projects of common interest. The market sound, we launched to assess the hard-to-abate industry's appetite was completed with large participation with more than 150 companies responding to the questioner. And the pilot phase of the Ravenna CCS project is on track. The injection phase will start by summer. With respect to Ravenna backlog, it is stable at EUR1.2 billion, while on biomethane, eight plants won tariff auction corresponding to 18 megawatts, of which two are already under upgrade construction to biomethane.

Finally, moving to sustainability and governance. CapEx aligned to EU taxonomy and SDGs represent, respectively, 34% and 55% of the total in Q1 2024. Following an extensive engagement with the shareholder head of the AGM, we have further improved the average approval rate at approximately 99% vis-a-vis the 97% of last year. According to the most recent shareholder analysis carried out, ESG investors represent about 50% of our institutional investors base, well above sector and Italian average. Finally, net zero assessment assigned by Moody's to our emission targets confirm a trajectory in line with the Paris Agreements.

On Page 4, you have a summary on gas demand and flows. In Q1 2024, demand was about 20 bcm, down 2.6% or 0.5 bcm vis-a-vis Q1 2023. In detail, thermoelectric sector was down 4.8% year-on-year, driven by higher hydroelectric and renewable production, increase in net electricity imports due to larger availability of nuclear in France that was partly offset by lower utilization of coal and electricity demand increase. Civil sector contracted by around 0.2 bcm due to milder temperatures, especially in March and the impact of the energy efficiency. Whilst industrial sector was up 1.8%, and we expect further growth to -- due to the gas price projections for the next month. Moving to the gas flows. Energy import made about 20% of the total demand, also thanks to the operations of the Piombino plant from July 2023.

Now I will turn to Luca for the financial results. Thank you.

Luca Passa

Good morning to everyone. Thanks, Stefano. We are now on Slide number 5 to comment on first quarter 2024 EBITDA. EBITDA for the period was EUR703 million, plus 18% versus last year or EUR106 million. The growth is mainly attributable to regulatory items for a total of around EUR58 million related to the WACC increase for EUR42 million and to the ROSS effect on transport for EUR16 million.

Regulated revenues change was driven by transport and storage revenues increased by around EUR50 million, output base rise by EUR50 million related to the contribution of output based on fully depreciated assets that in 2023 were recognized starting from the second quarter, the contribution from storage reverse flows services, partially counterbalanced by the decrease of output base related to the full services. A positive volume effect counterbalanced by the expected phase out of input-based incentives. Piombino FSRU started operations from July 2023 and contributed positive by EUR60 million in the first quarter 2024. The increase in regulated fixed cost is attributable to lower costs in large part due to the extension of the employees' health insurance and labor inflation. With regards to the energy transition businesses, the end of the Super-Ecobonus incentive on energy efficiency, along with the consolidation of 8 megawatts of biomethane plants drove to a natural contribution in the first quarter of 2024.

Moving to Slide 6. Adjusted net income for the period was EUR335 million, plus 11% compared to the first quarter of 2023 due to higher D&A by EUR28 million following writing investment and EUR12 million write-down on gas infrastructure. Net financial expenses are higher by EUR36 million, mainly as a result of higher net cost of debt, which moved from 1.5% in the first quarter of 2023 to approximately 2.4% in the first quarter of 2024 as the effect of the increase in interest rates. A substantially flat contribution from associates, which was the result of higher contribution of Italian associates for EUR3 million and lower international associates contribution for EUR2 million. Slightly higher taxes, with a tax rate of 24.8% versus 24.5% in the first quarter 2023.

Moving to Slide 7. Our international associates positively contributed to group net income by EUR52 million or down 4% vis-a-vis last year. TAP inflation-adjusted tariffs drove higher contribution compared to last year in the first quarter of 2024. TAP covered 17% of Italian imports, recording a plus 3% increase in the short-term bookings on top of the long-term capacity. Works for the 1.2 bcm expansion deriving from the 2021 market tests are underway. EMG performance benefited mostly from the recording of positive nonrecurring items related to previous years.

Moving to Austria. The decline of TAG reflects lower imports to Italy and consequently lower bookings vis-a-vis first quarter 2023, partially offset by more power of product mix towards short-term bookings, mainly March, that contributed EUR6 million above expectation in the quarter. On the other end, GCA performance in the first quarter benefits from lower energy costs due to the price effect. On Terega performance already reflects the new regulatory period starting in 2024, in line with our expectation. The decline versus the first quarter of 2023 is due to higher operating costs, which, however, we expect to partially brush off over the year. ADNOC performance is substantially in line with expectation. Looking at Interconnector UK, the operating performance remained strong with a contribution in line with the yearly regulatory cap. The capacity is booked at almost 50% as till 2026, providing medium-term visibility.

Moving to SeaCorridor. After the drop of Russian imports, it represents the first Italian import route with approximately 5 bcm in entry out of 15 of total Italian imports in the first quarter of 2024. Performance, however, is slightly lower, mainly due to the lower volumes, reflecting the decline in demand.

Desfa's lower contribution is the result of lower auction premium on LNG imports and export towards Bulgaria, now closer to historical trends. Nonetheless, Greek gas demand is increasing amidst the ongoing lean night phase out and the recovery of the industrial production and power generation. Desfa is progressing also on its ambitious $1.3 billion CapEx plan that will support the Southeastern Europe market development.

Turning now to cash flow on Slide number 8. Funds from operation for the period amounting to around EUR538 million were partially absorbed by EUR119 million of working capital. This was driven by a broadly neutral impact from regulatory working capital with about EUR550 million absorption due to the balancing activity of which, EUR250 million related to a reduction in balancing item payables, about EUR200 million related to the cash deposit decrease due to the gas price reduction and about EUR100 million related to the full service net increase. All of this partially counterbalanced by EUR470 million of tariff-related items, mainly driven by additional tariff components. And finally, EUR100 million of energy efficiency net working capital absorption driven by the fiscal credit related to the Super-Ecobonus revenues.

Net investment for the period amount to EUR531 million and breakdown as follows. EUR462 million of CapEx, around EUR90 million of CapEx payables decrease, and about EUR20 million of other items. Other outflows were related to the payment of the interim dividend for EUR376 million, resulting in a change in net debt of about EUR523 million.

Moving to Slide number 9. Net debt amounted to EUR15.8 billion. Net cost of debt, which is calculated as the financial charges net of liquidity income on average net debt for the period went from 1.5% in the first quarter of 2023 to 2.4% in the first quarter of 2024 and the fixed floating mix is above 70%. Funding for the year is almost completed, leaving the remaining part of the year for opportunistic 2025 refunding activities. To date, we executed EUR450 million of bank financing, which is sustainability linked, EUR1.5 billion of bonds in February via green bond, the first ever green bond issued by Snam and a sustainability-linked bond linked to the Scope 1 and 2 and for the first time, also Scope 3.

In addition, leveraging our supporting market environment in April, we issued a two-year EUR750 million floating rate bond for our treasury management optimization. The sustainable finance ratio is at 84%, well on track to reach our long-term target. Also, we're proud to have recently received for the second year, the Transition Bond Award of the Year by Environmental Finance for our EU taxonomy aligned transition bond exchangeable in Italgas share that we issued in September 2023.

Moving to Slide 10 on our guidance. Thanks to our strong first quarter performance, which was ahead of expectation, we can upgrade our full year guidance provided at the strategic plan presentation on 25th of January. And in 2024, we expect CapEx will reach EUR3 billion, slightly ahead of the EUR2.9 million guidance, mainly due to the realization of the breakwater in Ravenna. The year-on-year increase is driven by gas infrastructure investments, which includes, among others, the start of the electric line and moving and connection investment for the second new FSRU in Ravenna. Tariff RAB is up around 6% year-on-year at EUR23.8 billion. We expect EBITDA in excess of EUR2.75 billion versus the previous guidance of EUR2.7 billion, mainly thanks to stronger contribution of output-based incentives. The year-on-year growth is driven by the WACC uplift and the flatter impact, Ross effect on transport and RAB growth.

Adjusted net income guidance moved to approximately EUR1.230 billion from the previous EUR1.180 billion, up 5% year-on-year. The upgrade is due to better EBITDA performance, coupled with lower financial charges and higher contribution from our international associates. Net debt at EUR17.5 billion expected versus the EUR17.6 billion, despite the increase of CapEx, thanks to a better expected cash conversion at 80%. It includes about EUR400 million of working capital absorption expected and the cash-out for the increase of the stake increase in Adriatic LNG. The dividend policy going forward envisage minimum 3% dividend annual growth.

And now let me hand over to Stefano for the closing remarks.

Stefano Venier

Thank you. Thank you, Luca. Let me say, in conclusion, we think we have had another year in which we will deliver strong results. A good Q1 led us to upgrade of our full year guideline on all lines. That implies one year add on 2027 plan delivery. This is supported by high visibility over regulation and investments and macro environment, which is stabilizing and policies evolving in line with our strategy. Therefore, we can offer to shareholders an attractive growth profile coupled with a compelling dividend, while keeping a solid balance sheet and financial flexibility.

So then thank you very much for your attention. And now we are available to take all your questions.

Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Javier Suarez, Mediobanca.

Javier Suarez

Good morning and thank you for the presentation. I have several questions. The first one is on the guidance increase. It has been explained by better-than-expected output-based incentives on the storage business. So can you share with us the -- how are you moving your expectation for the collection of these output-based incentives by the year-end. And we have seen the collection during the first quarter of the year and the underlying reason behind for this better performance during the first quarter. That would be the first question. The second question is on the international associates, there has been certainly better than expected performance I guess versus the company's previous expectation. If you can help us to understand the moving pieces, which is the associate that has surprised the most during the first quarter and what we may expect in terms of contribution from this associate by the year-end. And I'm particularly interested on, you can share with us your expectations for the regulatory review in Austria that you have announced that should be unveiled by the end of May. Any detail on your expectation on that important regulatory review would be welcome. And the final thought is on the first implementation of the new [reg] (ph) framework, you can help us to understand the positive impact during the first quarter, giving a little bit more granularity and your expectation by the end of the year. Many thanks.

Stefano Venier

Okay. I'll start with the first about the output-based -- the output-based services. I mean the major contribution, as you pointed out, that came from the output based on storage services. And that was, of course, driven by the, let's say, good appetite the market showed for the reverse flow services and the flexibility we provide in the first quarter. So to that extent, we were ahead on our expectations, and we will drive this benefit to the end of the year. Of course, with respect to last year, we will have a lower contribution from the default services because, of course, this kind of service has squeezed over the year. Globally speaking, as we said, we expect to have a contribution in the region of EUR80 million, EUR90 million on full year. Now I'll turn to Luca for the international associates.

Luca Passa

Okay. Thanks, Stefano. When it comes to international associates. I mean, the first quarter performance, as I commented, it was a mix of better performance, I would say, across the board. And what we expect for the full year in terms of overall contribution of our associate portfolios in the region of EUR260 million in total, which a flat performance for our national associates, i.e., the domestic associates for about EUR90 million, which is in line with last year, while for our international activities, we expect a contribution in the region of EUR170 million. And here, I would say the positive surprise is mainly driven by the performance of Terega on the full year. We will expect basically a similar contribution from Terega vis-a-vis last year, also taking into account the new regulatory period, which started at the beginning of this year. When it comes to the regulatory review in Austria, as you know, we are currently waiting for the final decree from the regulator. What we can say there is that what has been already released for consultation regarding cost compensation for the two companies TAG and GCA is more or less in line with our expectation. And I would say about to be in line with our assumption in the business plan. You know that this effect will happen starting from 2025 and onwards so from next year for the period up until 2027. But until the final consultation is out, we cannot further comment in this respect, but I would say more or like in line with our expectation in the business plan. And then finally, when comes to ROSS effect, as I commented, the impact for the first quarter was EUR60 million. The expectation of the overall impact for the full year is in the region of EUR70 million in total. And clearly, this is based on our assumption when it comes to the percentages between slow money and fast money.

Operator

The next question is from Stefano Gamberini of Equita SIM.

Stefano Gamberini

Yes. Thanks for taking my question. The first regarding the RAB deflator. The trend is weaker than expected, and it was around less 0.7% for the full year 2023, I'm clearly speaking about the gross fixed capital expenditure deflator versus the 1.6% that was included in the RAB deflator defined for 2024 at 5.9% by the regulator. So we are speaking of a difference that should be in the region of 600 basis points in 2023 on top of the around 350 basis points of difference towards the CPI in 2022. So do you think that the regulator can make some adjustment on the RAB deflator mechanism or how you can recover this difference? The second question regarding the trend of fixed costs during the first quarter. If I'm not wrong, your regulated revenues increased in the region of 22% in the same period, in this period and why such a significant growth. And finally, if you can repeat please, the targets -- sorry, the outcome that you expect in Austria, what could be the results from TAG and GCA from 2026 onwards. Thank you.

Stefano Venier

With respect to the deflator, I mean, we raised the point as -- along with the other, let's say, DSOs and TSOs to the authority. I think there will be a sort of discussion on this theme in the forthcoming months. We also have to take into consideration that there will be a review again by the National Institution for Statistics on the deflator mechanism in the forthcoming September. So by the end of the year, we will have much more clarity on the mechanism for the setting of the deflator going forward and backward. And second, it's going to be the position of the ARERA with respect to, let's say, possible adjustments on the mechanism of the deflator or so to have more alignment with the inflation, the CPI index. So I think there will be a discussion on this theme that is so important. With respect to the implications of the adjustment that happened in Q4 last year on 2024, I mean, with the fact that we increased our guidance means implicitly that we will offset entirely the reduction with respect to the former expectation we had for the year. Now I turn to Luca on the operating costs.

Luca Passa

Yes, Stefano.

Stefano Venier

I'll take that Austria question.

Luca Passa

Okay. On operating costs, I mean I commented the EUR6 million on labor cost, which was driven by the health insurance as well as labor inflation. There is another EUR6 million which had netted with the contribution of the Piombino FSRU. Basically, their revenues were EUR22 million. We posted a EUR16 million EBITDA contribution, which means that we had EUR6 million in cost. So the differential in terms of fee cost in total is 12%, 6% is the part of labor and 6% is the cost of the FSRU. And when it comes to the target also the expected outcome in Austria, I hand it over to Stefano.

Stefano Venier

Yes, as we said, I think the discussion that took place in the last month was primarily focused on we introducing a new mechanism for the tariff regulation. That means implicitly the, let's say, sterilization of the volume cyclicality. So we will be from 2025, fully protected from, let's say, volume change with respect to the allowed revenues. That I think it's a core milestone in the Austrian mechanism. And with respect to what we could expect from the new tariff scheme for the next three years, as Luca said, it's going to be in line with our expectations for 2025, 2026 and 2027. That means we will recover from the outcome of the last two years to have a positive net income in those operations.

Stefano Gamberini

Just a quick follow-up. I have understood correctly that as regarded the tariff were up for 2024 tariffs, you confirm that you apply this 5.9% because you didn't change your RAB reference hub. Am I wrong?

Stefano Venier

We applied -- I mean, as you know, the tariff will be -- have been submitted to the authority roughly a month ago. We replied in this stage to some questions they raised to us and will be finally approved by the end of July of this year. Of course, implicitly, the tariffs that will be approved will embed the new deflator that is going to be about 5.3% for the year.

Stefano Gamberini

Thank you.

The next question is from Marcin Wojtal of Bank of America in London.

Marcin Wojtal

Yes, good morning. Thank you so much for taking my questions. Firstly, what revisions to WACC do you expect in the Italian regulated business in 2025 based on current market rates? And secondly, I wanted to follow up on the guidance for the associates because I think if my calculation is correct, now you're indicating a reduction of EUR55 million versus 2023. But I think the previous indication was actually quite similar, it was around EUR60 million. So is it actually a material change in your expectations when it comes to international associates after this Q1? Or it's still -- it looks to me it's not very different to what it was before. Thank you.

Stefano Venier

Okay. Thanks, Marcin. When it comes to the WACC expectation. As you might recall, in the business plan, we have assumed for transport, which is the largest part, 5.7% in our business plan. Current interest rate point from mark-to-market, which is more close to 5.5%. There are still five months in the observation period that are missing, but that is current mark-to-market. Now that's a 20 basis point difference or lower vis-a-vis our business plan expectation. Clearly, lower interest rates also means for us, lower cost of debt expected. Therefore, we are planning to basically mitigate and absorb this delta when it comes to our contribution to EBITDA and then net income. Then when it comes to our associate. The guidance in terms of the contribution has improved. I mean, you pointed out correctly, we are assuming EUR55 million down currently vis-a-vis the full year 2023 in terms of contribution, but it is -- the reduction is smaller than actually what we reported or expected when we presented our full year results, which was in the region of EUR60 million to EUR70 million. So we actually are doing -- or expecting a EUR15 million to EUR20 million better performance from our international associates while the Italian ones are, as I said before, more or less in line at EUR90 million contribution.

Marcin Wojtal

Very clear. Thank you.

The next question is from Alberto de Antonio of BNP Paribas Exane.

Alberto de Antonio

Hi, good morning and thank you so much for taking my question. Just a follow-up on average cost of debt. Could you give us some guidance for the fiscal year '24 as you are expecting our financial expenses on your guidance. Thank you so much.

Stefano Venier

Thanks, Alberto. Our assumption for this guidance is a net cost of debt at the end of 2024 for the full year of 2.6% from the current, let's say, 2.4%. Clearly, what we will be working on, as you've probably seen also in the first part of this year is in trying to reduce basically this guidance. And let me say that I think we will have positive surprises here, but I can comment on this when we actually close the year. But the expectation is 2.6%.

Alberto de Antonio

Okay. Thank you.

Operator

[Operator Instructions] the next question is a follow-up from Stefano Gamberini of Equita SIM.

Stefano Gamberini

Yes. Two quick questions, if I may. The first regarding the announcement of Italgas that submitted an offer for two years Italgas and the risk of a possible rights issue for closing the deal. Will you subscribe this capital increase in the case, it will be called? And the second, could you give us an update of the negotiation with Edison for Edison Stoccaggio? Thank you.

Stefano Venier

Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. With respect to Italgas, our stake, as you know, has been classified as opportunistic among our associates and is bound by a shareholder pact with CDP as well known. Such a shareholder pact allowed us to issue an exchangeable in September 2023 with the objective of lowering the cost of funding. If there will be a liquidity event like the capital increase, we will behave in line to such to the definition and the strategy I pointed out, and we will be looking at maintaining the same financial exposure to Italgas as we have today. With respect to Edison Stoccaggio, as you know, we had an exclusivity period that will end in June, and we are planning to submit our binding offer by June, and we are in the final phase of the due diligence.

Stefano Gamberini

Thanks.

The next question is from Davide Candela of Intesa Sanpaolo.

Davide Candela

Hi, good morning, gentlemen and thank you for taking my questions. Actually, just one. I was looking at the gas flows at Slide 4 and noticing that the LNG import were a little bit down year-on-year. And I was wondering if it is due to the little bit lower gas demand or in some way related to the issues, of course, that have been seen in the Middle East? And maybe more broadly on this point, if you can update on the situation about the transport of LNG to Italy? And which could be the balance if there would be maybe a drop in import, of course, if the geopolitical situation will negatively developed. Just a view from your side would be helpful. Thank you.

Stefano Venier

I think -- I mean the reason why the LNG in the first quarter was down is simply because we had a major maintenance event on the OLT floating vessel. At the end of February, we had to stop the operations and to bring the vessel to the dry dock for an extraordinary maintenance that will end by October, so to have back the unit in operation for the next winter. That's simply the reason because for the rest Piombino ran at full capacity, according to the slot, we received eight vessels in the first quarter as for planning and the same happened for the Adriatic LNG and Panigaglia. So the reason is simply because of the available capacity of the OLT. And we haven't seen any, let's say, effect from the closure of Suez channel for the LNG transport mainly from Qatar. So they took a longer journey through South Africa, but the deliveries happen regularly. With respect to the future -- possible future implication, I can't see short-term effects, again, with respect to the Suez channel performance. What I might see is a slight delay in the final investment decisions for the offshore development offshore Israel. That is -- and I'm referring to the fields of Aphrodite and Leviathan. Those were planned to be, let's say, was scheduled to take a decision by this year and probably it will be postponed just to see how the situation will evolve in that area. But that is the mid long-term possible effect. In the short term, we haven't seen neither on prices nor on deliveries, significant and tangible effects.

Davide Candela

Many thanks.

MILAN, May 16 (Reuters) - Italian gas grid distributor Snam is looking at green fuel opportunities, its chief executive told Reuters on Thursday after the group raised its guidance for 2024 financial results.

The 15-billion euro group - which has Europe's largest gas transmission network and manages both storage assets and liquefied natural gas terminals in Italy - is leading a European project to build a pipeline for green hydrogen.

It is also working with Eni on a pilot project to offer carbon capture, transport and storage services in Italy and, separately, supports the production of green gases.

In February Snam started sounding out the market for hydrogen demand in Italy and gathering expressions of interest for carbon dioxide (CO2) transport and storage services.

""Some 150 companies have taken part in the market sounding,"" Snam's CEO Stefano Venier said, adding this showed a concrete, albeit preliminary interest for these two decarbonisation tools the group aims to offer.

Venier also said that the group had bought 30 plants producing biogas and would upgrade them into biomethane plants.

Biomethane, which is the result of the treatment and purification of biogas, can be used for heating, cooking and all of the same uses as fossil fuel gas but as a by-product of organic matter is considered renewable and carbon neutral.

The group aims to produce 135 million cubic metres of biomethane a year by 2027 under its business plan.

ROSIER OUTLOOK FOR 2024

Earlier on Thursday Snam said it now expects its full-year adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) to be above 2.75 billion euros ($3 billion), up from a previous estimate of 2.7 billion euros.

Adjusted net profit for 2024 is seen rising to approximately 1.23 billion euros, up from previous guidance of 1.18 billion.

The company cited the impact of investments in regulated assets, a higher rate of return on investments and more benign regulation of gas transportation among the reasons for the revised guidance.

Between January and March, Snam reported a 17.8% rise in adjusted EBITDA to 703 million euros.

Total investments were up nearly 50% to 462 million euros, driven by higher capital expenditure related to the floating liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals in the cities of Ravenna and Piombino.

Net debt increased by 523 million euros compared with end-December 2023 to 15.8 billion euros. ($1 = 0.9191 euros) (Reporting by Francesca Landini, editing by Gavin Jones and Keith Weir)",dailymail.co.uk,news,Daily Mail Online,,0.2313725490196079,453566429,24,,eng-9565655

The project will be implemented using technologies for extensive environmental protection and vegetation restoration and will be connected to the Adriatic Backbone

Rome/San Donato Milanese- Cassa Depositi e Prestiti (CDP) has granted Snam an ESG-linked loan (linked to the achievement of sustainable targets) for an overall amount of 200 million euro to renovate the Ravenna-Chieti natural gas pipeline.

The project will strengthen the infrastructure dedicated to transporting natural gas from southern to northern Italy and will also allow for hydrogen transportation. It will thus ensure the safety and competitiveness of the country's energy system while pursuing the EU decarbonisation targets. The main line will be completed by 2026.

More specifically, the ESG-linked loan is linked to annual sustainability targets, whose achievement determines the relevant credit line spread, and has a maturity of four years. This sustainable financing follows the 300-million-euro loan CDP granted to Snam in April 2023 for the Adriatic Backbone, the new gas pipeline currently under construction which aims to increase the transportation capacity of entry points located in southern Italy and whose phase 1 is among the projects to be financed under the RepowerEU Plan. The Ravenna-Chieti pipeline will be connected to this infrastructure.

Carlo Lamari, Head of Infrastructure at Cassa Depositi e Prestiti, commented, ""CDP's support for sustainable development is also achieved by supporting strategic infrastructure projects for the country, citing the objectives of our Strategic Plan, with a particular focus on the environment, as in this case. An example of crucial infrastructure are major works such as the renovation of Snam's Ravenna-Chieti gas pipeline, which, once completed, will strengthen the national gas network, also with regards to the energy transition. Our intervention approach will continue to complement the banking system and confirms the validity of our support for Snam's Adriatic Backbone, to which CDP has secured the resources needed to start the project with a 300-million-euro loan"".

""Consistently with the growing importance that sustainable finance and related instruments are assuming in the current scenario, we have aligned our financial strategy with the Group's sustainability targets, making a tangible contribution to the pathway towards net zero by 2050 that Snam has undertaken,"" explained Luca Passa, Snam's Chief Financial Officer. ""This commitment took the form of setting a new target to increase the weight of sustainable finance in total funding to 85% by 2027. This ESG-linked loan from CDP, tied to the achievement of sustainable targets, boosts Snam's ambition to invest in infrastructure projects that comply with the principle of the energy trilemma -- that of security, competitiveness and sustainability -- pursuing the Italy's decarbonisation and energy transition targets"".

The Ravenna-Chieti gas pipeline consists of 292 kilometres of main pipeline and 133 kilometres of secondary lines and ensures natural gas transportation to the areas along the Adriatic coastline, from the province of Ravenna to the province of Chieti, affecting Emilia-Romagna, Marche and Abruzzo.

The use of trenchless technologies, without digging trenches, combined with environmental restoration activities at the end of the project, will preserve the surrounding environment and vegetation and enable the complete reconstruction of the area's original natural and landscape conditions. The materials which will make up the renewed infrastructure are suitable to transport hydrogen according to ASME standard B.31.12, currently considered the main international reference on hydrogen transportation via pipeline.

The main pipeline has three independent sections: Ravenna-Jesi, of about 142 kilometres, currently being replaced; Jesi-Recanati of about 30 kilometres, already replaced and entered into operation in December 2019 and therefore not part of the current renovation; Recanati-Chieti of about 150 kilometres, currently being replaced. The main line is scheduled to be renovated by 2026, while the secondary lines are scheduled to be renovated by the end of 2027.

The pipeline directly serves 130 delivery points to the distribution networks, 2 connection points with other transportation networks, 64 industrial users, 3 power generation plants, and 59 natural gas stations for motor vehicles, for a total volume of approximately 1.6 billion cubic metres per year. The pipeline also collects production from 9 natural gas fields, with a total annual volume of approximately 0.9 billion cubic metres.

Market Dynamics:

Drivers-

The market for hydrogen liquefaction systems is expanding quickly on a global scale as more companies and governments try to transition to greener energy sources. Now that hydrogen is a recognized alternative fuel, it needs to be produced, stored, and transported with efficiency. As the globe attempts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and tackles the complicated issues presented by climate change, renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power have become increasingly important in the world energy scene. But because these sources are essentially erratic -- they only produce power when the sun or wind blows -- they require greater capacity to offer a steady supply of energy. This intermittent nature seriously threatens the power grid's stability and dependability.

Moreover, it makes it easier to smoothly incorporate more renewable energy into the system since excess energy may be stored for use when the amount of renewable energy produced is lower.

Challenges:

Hydrogen liquefaction processes are currently inefficient, with a thermodynamic energy efficiency of just 30-35% in the hydrogen liquefaction system market. It is a significant drawback because this inefficiency contributes to high costs when it comes to making hydrogen fuel. This makes it more difficult for hydrogen to be used on a larger and more cost-effective scale. However, with many shortcomings come many opportunities for improvement. For example, using cheap power sources like gas or steam turbines, optimizing thermal management, utilizing ortho-para hydrogen converters, improving inter-cooling and insulation, and automating boil-off control can all help significantly improve its energy efficiency. However, several challenges could hold back growth in the market for hydrogen liquefaction systems, including high initial investment costs for large-scale projects and competition from conventional technologies such as fossil fuels or nuclear energy.

Regional Trends:

The APAC hydrogen liquefaction system market is expected to register a major market share in terms of revenue and is projected to grow at a high CAGR in the near future. The major factors contributing to the growth of this region include government initiatives in the region promoting hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, clean energy infrastructure development in countries such as China, Japan, and South Korea and growing demand for hydrogen in various sectors such as transportation, electronics, chemicals, and refining.

With an increasing emphasis on decarbonization and the integration of renewable energy sources, Europe is another important competitor in the market. Market expansion is being driven by government expenditures in hydrogen projects and supportive legislation. The growing number of hydrogen refuelling stations throughout Europe further strengthens the market potential.

They argue that bloc must not only pay more attention to non-EU operators, but take greater responsibility over its own energy system. What are your views?

The EU's climate agenda is in trouble. The Green Deal, which aims to slash the bloc's carbon emissions by 55% by 2030, had started off promisingly after several major pieces of legislation were adopted, including its ban on the sale of new combustion-powered vehicles from 2035 and new carbon border tax. Increasingly, however, Europeans are rebelling against green restrictions of which they have difficulty seeing the advantages.

Another less reported upon but equally important threat to the bloc's ecological and energy transition comes from the alarming number of Chinese and US companies moving into the EU power sector.

In our book, Energy: How to Recover Our European Ambition (published in French), we shed light on this overlooked issue ahead of European elections that will be critical for the EU's energy strategy, and call on the bloc to carefully weigh up cooperation and competition with sovereignty.

While there currently isn't any quantitative data on China's share in the European energy market, we do know the country detains 80% of the global clean-technology manufacturing capacity in 11 segments, from solar wafers to many lithium-ion battery components.

Taking advantage of the sovereign debt crisis in Europe, Chinese investors first stepped in to acquire substantial stakes in what have long been regarded as ""sovereign"" sectors, such as power transmission and distribution grids, in the early 2010s. Key among those was the world's largest utility company, the State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC), commonly known as the State Grid - the world's fourth-biggest company overall by revenue, behind Walmart, Saudi Aramco and Amazon as of March. Also increasingly present is Three Gorges Corp, responsible for the world's largest hydroelectric power complex.

For instance, in Portugal, Three Gorges Corp. won the bidding for the Portuguese government's 21% stake in EDP-Energias de Portugal SA in 2010. Meanwhile, in Italy, SGCC expanded its presence by collaborating with the Italian government in 2014, acquiring a 35% share in the CDP Reti fund, thereby attaining a blocking minority at the local gas network operator, SNAM, and electricity transmission network operator, Terna. Similarly, in Greece the State Grid made substantial inroads by acquiring a 24% stake in the national electricity transmission network operator from the Greek government in 2016.

While Portugal, Italy, and Greece were primary targets, Chinese investors have also acquired grids in Luxembourg. Last but not least, let's not forget China's green-tech industry has flooded Europe with cheap solar panels and electric vehicles (EVs).

The stakes are all the higher because China is not the only country with ambitions in the EU: The United States is also seeking to benefit from the bloc's poorly thought-out energy strategy.

Russia's war against Ukraine has not weakened the United States' energy dominance in the world, and more specifically in the EU. Indeed, while Russian gas was expected to act as a bridge fuel in the energy transition, particularly for Germany, the EU was quick to adopt sanctions against its long-term trade partner that minimised its dependence. Partly filling the vacant space left by Moscow, the United States has become the leading producer and exporter of LNG to Europe. This development favours US trade while domestic energy costs are kept low, further widening the price gap, with Europe experiencing an energy inflation and undermining its relative competitiveness and attractiveness to energy-intensive industry.

Beyond these energy-supply issues, EU member states are struggling to carve out a common vision, highlighting the challenges of sovereignty and strategic autonomy. European companies, particularly in France, have endeavoured to develop fourth-generation small modular nuclear reactors (SMR), with an attempt to create a European nuclear alliance made in November 2023. But at the same moment, countries such as Italy, Belgium, and Romania have partnered with the American Westinghouse Electric Company to develop lead-cooled fast reactors.

Here again, the coordination gap plays to the advantage of American influence in Europe, as confirmed by John Kerry in September 2023. As part of the international consortium ""Clean Fuel from SMR"", led by American companies, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Poland were selected to participate and will receive support for coal-to-SMR feasibility studies. These EU countries are turning to the Americans to build new nuclear power plants, mainly because of their funding and technical expertise, while the EU continues to block all support for nuclear projects developed on its soil.

The scale of these foreign investments in renewable energies, new nuclear facilities and grid development could come to bear heavily onto the bloc's strategic independence at a time when it's looking to decarbonise.

These investments raise concerns over continental energy security, given the still fragmented nature of Europe's energy landscape:

The main challenge for Europe is ending one dependency without falling into another. To replace imports of fossil fuels (coal, gas, and oil), harmful to the climate, the EU member states must accelerate and coordinate the development of their ""green"" technologies.

These risks demand that the bloc not only pays more attention to non-EU operators, but take greater responsibility over its own energy system. How can it do this, all while pursuing the vision of the ""green, secure and affordable energy supply"" set out in its Green Deal?

For starters, we recommend EU member states work harder on building truly European energy grids. As we move toward decarbonisation, we can expect an array of renewable energies to increasingly power our electricity system. These arrangements will require extensive and interconnected networks on a European scale, which must be consolidated and developed by the EU member states themselves.

A second emergency is green energy financing. In November, the European Climate Neutrality Observatory warned a lack of EU-level public investment in green energy and other advances could lead the bloc to fail to meet its net-zero goals. Rather than take heed of the warning, member states axed the fund earmarked for renewables and clean tech - the Strategic Technologies for Europe Platform (STEP) - to 1.5bn in February. Our book calls for a radical change of strategy, through the creation of a ""European transition savings account"" to attract private savings, on the one hand, and a ""European sovereign fund"" that receives proceeds from carbon-pricing revenues on the other.

Whether these actually come into being will depend on the upcoming European elections. Results leaning toward a higher European ambition could help us see in clean, affordable and secure solutions. At the other end of the spectrum, further veering to the nationalistic right could carry harmful effects for the bloc's economic clout and, paradoxically, sovereignty.",energyindemand.com,news,Energy in Demand - Sustainable Energy - Rod Janssen,Rod Janssen,0.0117647058823529,453032450,1,https://energyindemand.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/icon-04.png?w=240,

Recent headlines on India's renewable energy (RE) sector are not encouraging. Even the solar sector, which was celebrated as the means to achieve India's ambitious goal of increasing the installed capacity for power generation using RE, is showing signs of slowing down. The government's plans to meet the expected summer peak demand for electricity in 2024 focus on coal rather than on RE. Slower growth rates in RE capacity addition could mean that the RE industry is entering a phase of maturity in its lifecycle, or input cost escalations are decelerating growth. It could also mean that regulations and resource constraints, especially land availability, are starting to bite. In the current geopolitical context where all countries are prioritising energy nationalism, the slowdown in the RE industry could also be the result of trade barriers.

In the early 2010s, the nascent RE industry demonstrated double digit growth rates. The overall annualised growth rate of RE installations for power generation in India was close to 20 percent in 2013-18. Solar installations grew by 70-80 percent annually in this period while wind power installations grew by 15-20 percent. In 2018-23, annualised growth rate of RE installations slowed down to 10-15 percent. In this period, solar installations grew by 25-35 percent, while the growth of wind power installations slowed down to around 5 percent. In 2023-24 (up to February 2024), the annualised growth rate of RE installations grew by less than 10 percent. The annualised growth rate of wind power installations remained close to 5 percent while the growth of solar installations fell to around 11 percent.

In terms of annual capacity additions of RE since 2013, the highest values of over 15 GW were recorded in 2021-22 as well as in 2022-23. In the same two periods, annual solar installations also recorded their highest values of over 13 GW. The highest annual installation in the wind sector, of 5.5 GW was in 2016-17 while the annual capacity additions were 1.1 GW and 1.2 GW in 2021-22 and 2022-23.

As of 29 February 2024, solar installations accounted for 55 percent of total RE installed capacity while wind accounted for about 33 percent. Other RE sources, such as small hydropower, biomass and waste to energy accounted for the remaining 11.5 percent of total RE installations. The slowdown in the growth rate of solar and wind power installations which account for over 88 percent of total RE power generation installations is raising concerns over India meeting the target of 500 GW of RE installations by 2030. In 2023-24 (up to 29 February 2024), total RE installations were 11.2 GW and wind installations was 2.5 GW, an increase of 13 percent compared to 2022-23. Solar installations however fell by over 50 percent to 11.2 GW, the lowest annual capacity addition since 2013-14.

To achieve the goal of 500 GW of RE installed capacity by 2030, installations have to grow by an annual average of 20 percent and annual capacity additions have to increase from the current level of 11-12 GW to over 60 GW. If the current rate of capacity additions is the result of a secular trend rather than that of a cyclical flux, slowing growth of RE installations signals a serious challenge.

Project developers have cited inadequate transmission infrastructure and the new regulatory requirements as the prime causes of the slowdown in RE installations. One of the new regulations that influences RE installations is the general network access (GNA) rules. GNA rules, notified in June 2022 have been framed by the CERC (central electricity regulatory commission) to facilitate non-discriminatory open access to distribution licensees or generating companies or consumers for use of inter-state transmission system (ISTS).

According to the international energy agency (IEA) , global annual RE capacity additions increased by almost 50 percent to nearly 510 GW in 2023 (calendar year), the fastest growth rate in the past two decades. The factor behind the impressive number is China which commissioned as much solar photovoltaic (PV) as the entire world did in 2022 (calendar year). RE installations were also at an all-time high in Europe, the United States and Brazil in 2022. This suggests that the situation in India is an exception to the global trend. Solar module prices exported from China are at historic low of around US$0.14/watt indicating that input cost escalations are not driving the deceleration in solar PV installations in India.

Restrictions on import of solar PV modules from China to promote domestic manufacturers could also be among the reasons for the slowdown. In 2023, solar PV module exports from China to Europe and other countries that added the most RE capacity increased substantially. Solar PV module exports to India fell by over 7 percent in the first half of 2023 while exports to the rest of the world increased by 35 percent in the same period. This suggests that trade restrictions could have inhibited growth in RE installations in India. Global solar PV manufacturing capacity is expected to reach almost 1,000 GW in 2024, adequate to meet annual IEA's net zero 2050 demand of almost 650 GW in 2030. In 2022, global solar PV manufacturing capacity increased by over 70 percent to reach almost 450 GW, with China accounting for over 95 percent of new facilities throughout the supply chain. In 2023 and 2024, global solar PV manufacturing capacity is expected to double, with China again claiming over 90 percent of this increase. Chinese industrial policies focusing on solar PV as a strategic sector and on growing domestic demand have enabled economies of scale and supported continuous innovation throughout the supply chain. According to the IEA, these policies have contributed to a cost decline of more than 80 percent, helping solar PV to become the most affordable electricity generation technology in many parts of the world. Seen through the lens of climate risk, China's continued dominance of the solar supply chain that reduces the cost of solar PV installations is a global public good. Industrial policies of the United States and India that prioritise energy nationalism and domestic solar PV manufacturing are on the other hand strategic national security goods. These produce domestic jobs, and add to manufacturing capacity but increase the cost of solar installations. If industrial policies of countries are accepted as necessary, then the underlying suggestion that China rather than climate change is a more significant threat must also be accepted.

According to Union Minister Nitin Gadkari, those coal mines in Maharashtra's Vidarbha region and WCL (Western Coalfields Ltd) areas which are economically not viable, produce low-quality coal, and where mining is almost stopped can be used for coal gasification projects. The Minister pitched for the use of non-viable coal blocks and low-quality ones under WCL areas for coal gasificationand backed public-private partnerships in coal gasification projects, coal extractions and power projects on coal pitheads. As per the minister, nano urea introduced by the Centre should be used instead of extracting the urea from coal. He said coal is available in huge quantities in Yavatmal, Chandrapur, and Nagpur districts in the Vidarbha region besides in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh where WCL is working.

Coal Block Auctions

The coal ministry will organise a roadshow in Ranchi to increase participation of investors in the commercial coal mine auction. The government launched the process for sale of 39 coal mines under eight rounds of commercial auctions and 31 under the ninth. These 70 coal mines are from the coal-bearing states of Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha, Telangana, and West Bengal. Of the said mines, 27 are fully explored ones and 43 are partially explored.

Coking Coal Imports

Association of producers and suppliers of metallurgical coal expressed concerns over the ""influx of met coke at prices below the domestic cost of production"" and sought the government's intervention to resolve the issue. Metallurgical coal is a grade of coal that can be used to produce good-quality coke. The prevailing import rate for metallurgical coke in India is US$395 per tonne, while the production cost for domestic met coke manufacturers is around US$460 per tonne. According to the Indian Metallurgical Coke Manufacturers' Association (IMCOM), this significant pricing gap has led to an influx of over 3.6 million tonnes (MT) of inexpensive met coke imports during 2022-23, posing a substantial challenge to India's merchant met coke sector.

India plans to form a consortium of state-owned companies to facilitate coking coal imports to help domestic steel companies tide over shortages. Stung by lower supplies and higher prices of coking coal, leading Indian steel companies have petitioned the government to help boost supplies of the key steel-making raw material. Indian steel companies consume around 70 MT of coking coal annually, and imports constitute around 85 percent of the country's total requirement. Steel mills in India, the world's second-biggest crude steel producer, have struggled with volatile supplies of coking coal from Australia, which normally accounts for more than half of India's annual imports. Other than Australia, India imports coking coal from the United States, Indonesia and Canada, among others.

Coal Production

According to Union Minister for Coal and Mines Pralhad Joshi, for the first time, the country's coal production is going to cross 1 billion tonnes (1000 MT). The minister is of the view that India is going to stop the import of substitutable coal from next year. On the occasion, Madhya Pradesh was also given the 'Award of Appreciation' for securing first place in the mineral block auction in the country during 2022-23.

According to Singareni Collieries Company Limited (SCCL), optimum utilisation of heavy machinery, increase in production and decrease in production cost are key to spurring productivity and facing market competition. As per the company, about 160 lakh tonnes (16 MT) of coal has to be produced in the remaining period of this fiscal to achieve the annual coal production target of 70 MT. It implies that at least 227,000 tonnes of coal need to be produced daily.

Jindal Power has proposed to top a bid by Adani Power, opens new tab, for a thermal power plant, as India looks to drum up investment in coal-fired power. The tussle for the 1,980 megawatt (MW) plant in central India, ensnared in insolvency proceedings, comes after the power minister called last November for more private investment to meet a dramatic rise in electricity demand. Private investments in coal-based power in India started dwindling after 2018, hit by lower demand and an ambitious national thrust in renewable energy.

Prices

Indicating sufficient coal availability in the market, the National Coal Index (NCI) dropped 17.54 percent to 155.09 points in November 2023. As per the coal ministry, the NCI was at 188.08 points in November 2022. This shows a strong supply of coal in the market, with sufficient availability to meet the growing demand. NCI is a price index that combines coal prices from all sales channels, including notified prices, auction prices and import prices. The peak of NCI was observed in June 2022 when the index reached 238.83 points, but subsequent months have experienced a decline, indicative of abundant coal in the Indian market.

China

China's imports of Mongolian coking coal may rise to a record in 2024, after more than doubling in 2023, on improving transport links and its lower price versus domestic and international supplies, traders and miners said. China is the world's biggest steel producer and coal importer and a shift to abundant Mongolian supplies could come at the expense of Australian imports of the steelmaking ingredient. Australia, the world's second-biggest coking coal miner, was China's largest supplier until a 2020 diplomatic dispute. This year's coking coal imports from landlocked Mongolia may rise more than 10 percent as newly expanded road links enable more truck traffic, a Beijing-based coal trading executive estimated. China imports Mongolian coal mostly by truck through seven ports along a border that stretches more than 4,600 km (2,858 miles). Beijing and Ulaanbaatar have simplified customs clearances to bolster coal imports, which have been hindered by transport bottlenecks, several Chinese coal traders said. Australian coking coal imports plunged when Beijing slapped an unofficial ban on several commodities after Canberra called for an investigation into the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic, although trade resumed last year as relations warmed.

Rest of Asia and Asia Pacific

Asia's imports of seaborne thermal coal rose to a record high in December as top buyer China sucked up cargoes amid peak winter demand. Asia's imports of seaborne thermal coal reached 83.69 MT in December, up from 78.87 MT in November and the highest in records compiled by commodity analysts Kpler going back to January 2017. The strength was led by China, with seaborne thermal coal imports of 32.08 MT, another record high according to Kpler data, and up from 29.57 MT in November. China's appetite for imported thermal coal soared in 2023 as coal-fired power generation rose amid lower hydropower output and rising electricity demand as the economy posted a modest recovery from the weakness caused by Beijing's previous strict zero-COVID policy. It's also worth noting that China's domestic coal production has also been rising, with November output hitting a record high on a daily basis of 13.8 MT, besting the previous peak of 13.5 MT from March last year.

Bangladesh nearly tripled its coal-fired power output in 2023, an analysis of government data showed, helping it tide over the worst power shortages in over a decade and slash rising generation costs. Power generation from coal surged to a record 21 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh) in 2023, up from the 7.9 billion kWh of electricity produced from coal in 2022, an analysis of daily operational reports by the Power Grid Company of Bangladesh (PGCB) showed. Coal's share of the power generation fuel mix rose to 14.2 percent in 2023, from 8.9 percent in 2022, the PGCB data showed, while the share of natural gas rose to 55.2 percent in 2023, the first increase in four years and up from 51 percent in 2022. Overall shortages surged nearly 40 percent year-on-year to 2.7 billion kWh in 2023, or 2.8 percent of demand, PGCB data showed, with shortages easing in the second half of the year because of higher coal-fired output. Along with other major Asian economies India and Vietnam, Bangladesh boosted its use of relatively inexpensive coal to meet it surging power demand growth, which rose over 5 percent in 2023. Higher coal-fired generation also put the south Asian nation on track to cut average generation costs for the first time in four years.

Africa

South Africa's Sasol, opens new tab reported lower output at its coal mining division in the October-December quarter citing safety-related incidents, tough geological conditions and delays in sourcing spares for maintenance. According to Sasol, the world's biggest producer of fuels and chemicals from coal and gas, as a result, output in the quarter was cut by 5 percent or 394,000 metric tonnes (0.39 MT).

South African freight rail operator Transnet resumed partial service on the line connecting to the country's main coal export terminal, four days after two trains collided and blocked the tracks. The first line leading to the Richards Bay coal terminal was declared safe for the passage of trains, Transnet said. Coal miners Thungela Resources, and Exxaro Resources, said they did not expect the derailment to significantly impact their exports of the fossil fuel.

Europe/ Middle East

Turkey is on track to surpass Germany as Europe's largest coal-fired electricity generator in 2024 as high inflation causes power producers to cut purchases of expensive natural gas and boost the use of cheaper coal in electricity generation. Turkey generated a record 117.6 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity from coal which yielded a record 118 MT of carbon dioxide and related gases in 2023, data from environmental think tank Ember shows. That generation tally compared to 117.9 TWh by Europe's largest coal-fired electricity generator, Germany, and handily exceeded the 97 TWh by generated in Europe's most coal-reliant power system, Poland. Both Germany and Poland recorded steep annual decreases in coal generation in 2023, and have pledged further reductions in coal use alongside rapid increases in renewable energy deployment for electricity generation going forward. In contrast, 2023 marked the second straight annual climb in Turkey's coal-fired electricity output, and Turkish power producers look set to continue favouring cheap coal over other forms of electricity generation as the country grapples with one of the highest inflation rates in the world.

German importers of coal for power generation, heating and steelmaking have found new suppliers in the United States (US) and Australia, enabling them to end their reliance on Russia, industry body VDKi said. Between January and October 2023, Russia accounted for 2 percent of all German imported coal volumes - mainly supplies that had reached Germany and other European countries before a European Union ban in August 2022 under sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. In 2021, Russia supplied 53 percent of Germany's coal imports. The US accounted for 28 percent of the 28 MT imported in total in the first ten months of 2023 by Europe's largest economy, followed by 27 percent from Australia and 15 percent from Colombia. Overall, German hard coal imports in the whole of 2023 may have fallen by 26.3 percent year-on-year to around 33 MT, VDKi said.

6 February: Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) expects its gasoline sales to rise 4.5-5 percent in the financial year ending on 31 March 2025, the company's head of marketing Satish Kumar Vaduguri said. The company's diesel sales are expected to climb 3 percent over the same financial year, he said.

6 February: Mining conglomerate Vedanta Ltd will invest US$4 billion over the next three years to double oil production, its chairman Anil Agarwal said as he pushed ahead with an aggressive oil and gas expansion programme. Vedanta, which more than a decade back acquired Scottish explorer Cairn Energy's (now Capricorn Energy) India assets, is targeting 300,000 barrels per day (15 million tonnes a year) oil output in 3 years from aggressive exploration campaign, he said.

31 January: Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) cylinder transporters of Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) went on an indefinite strike for the second time in less than two months, alleging pending dues and low rates in recently floated tenders. The decision to go for the shutdown was taken after a meeting called by the Food, Public Distribution & Consumer Affairs Department of Assam between IOC and the North East Packed LPG Transporter Association (NEPLTA) failed to yield any solution to the prolonged stalemate. The association had also written to the chief secretary on 5 January, raising the same issues and urged him to take necessary steps, NEPLTA chief adviser Kumud Nath said. Hundreds of trucks were seen lining up outside the bottling plants across Assam, but the vehicles did not enter the factories and load the cylinders, meant for distribution among the dealers. On the low rate issue, he asserted that the company is moving ahead as per its tripartite discussions with the state government and the NEPLTA.

6 February: Adani Total Pvt Ltd's Dhamra terminal has received 15 commercial LNG (liquefied natural gas) cargoes since commissioning in May 2023 and is operating at a utilisation rate of 55 percent, CEO (chief executive officer) Satinder Pal Singh said. Singh said the capacity of the terminal on India's east coast could be doubled and the company is in the early stages of planning its expansion. The 5 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) LNG terminal, in which French energy giant TotalEnergies SE, opens new tab has a 50 percent stake, has a 20-year take-or-pay contract to provide regasification services to state-run Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), opens new tab and GAIL (India) Ltd, opens new tab.

5 February: The government is making constant efforts to bring the prices of CNG (compressed natural gas) under control and has delinked Indian gas prices from four international hubs based in US, Canada, UK and Russia, and aligned them to the Indian crude basket, Oil Minister Hardeep Puri said. He said the government is encouraging consumption of compressed natural gas as it is relatively a cleaner fuel. On the matter of encouraging people to switch to CNG vehicles, Puri said there is an autonomous process of transition taking place. He said in April 2023, the government took some far-reaching reforms by deciding to delink the Indian gas prices from four international hubs based in the US (United States), Canada, the UK and Russia, and we aligned them to the Indian crude basket, in other words, 10 percent of the Indian crude basket.

1 February: India has proposed to supply liquefied natural gas (LNG) to Sri Lanka to help the island nation produce power from its Yughadhanavi and Sobhadabavi power plants, Sri Lanka's Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera said. In the efforts to expedite the process to generate power from LNG the Government of India has proposed an interim solution from Petronet LNG, opens new tab, he said.

5 February: The government said 10 companies, including Nalco, Gujarat Mineral Development Corporation, and NLC India, submitted bids for coal mines put up for sale under the eighth round of commercial mines auction. A total of 10 companies have submitted bids in the auction process, the coal ministry said. Other companies from which the bids were received are TANGEDCO, OCL Iron, and Steel Ltd, JMS Mining Pvt Ltd, Shyam SEL & Power Ltd, SMN Tradecomm Pvt Ltd, Maa Durga Coal & Minerals Pvt Ltd, and Nilkanth Infra Mining Ltd. The bids will be evaluated by a multi-disciplinary technical evaluation committee and technically qualified bidders will be shortlisted for participating in the auction, to be conducted on MSTC portal. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had in 2020 launched the auction of 41 coal blocks for commercial mining, a move that opened India's coal sector to private players.

1 February: India will start operating new coal-fired power plants with a combined capacity of 13.9 gigawatt (GW) this year, its power ministry said, the highest annual increase in at least six years. Modi's government has cited energy security concerns amid surging power demand and low per-capita emissions to defend India's high dependence on coal. The 2024 capacity increase will be more than four times the annual average in the last five years. India added 4 GW of coal-fired power capacity in 2023, the most in a year since 2019. Coal-fired output surged 14.7 percent during the year, outpacing renewable energy output growth for the first time since at least 2019. Green energy output rose 12.2 percent in 2023, an analysis of daily load dispatch data from the federal grid regulator showed.

31 January: India's electricity supply is much more comfortable at the start of 2024 than in either 2023 or 2022 as coal production has ramped up and the huge deployment of renewables has relieved pressure on fuel inventories. After a weak monsoon curtailed hydro generation and forced the country to rely heavily on coal-fired generation in the summer and autumn of 2023, fuel inventories fell to critically low levels in October. But they recovered strongly in November, December and January, with record volumes of coal dug and despatched by rail to generators over the last three months. Generators are currently storing 38 million tonnes (MT) of coal on site, up from 33 MT at the same point in 2023 and 25 MT in 2022, according to data from the Central Electricity Authority. The number of unit coal trains despatched to power producers averaged 279 per day in December 2023, a new monthly record and up from 269 per day in December 2022.

4 February: Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi said that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government at the Centre is moving towards making the electricity bill of the households in the country zero. PM's remarks came while addressing a gathering after inaugurating and laying the foundation stone of projects worth INR115.99 billion in Guwahati.

1 February: Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi is scheduled to dedicate two power projects by NTPC and lay the foundation stone of another with a total investment of INR289.78 billion during his daylong visit to Odisha on 3 February. Located in Sundergarh district, the Darlipali STPP is a pit-head power station with supercritical (highly efficient) technology and will supply low-cost power to its beneficiary states such as Odisha, Bihar, West Bengal, Jharkhand, Gujarat and Sikkim. The 250 MW project of NTPC-SAIL Power Company Ltd was established in Rourkela Steel Plant (RSP) to provide reliable power for the steel plant, which is vital for economic growth, he said. NTPC is developing the Talcher Thermal Power Project, Stage-III, within the old TTPS plant premises in Angul district, was taken over by NTPC from Odisha State Electricity Board in 1995.

5 February: The Waaree Renewable Technologies has received a Letter of Award (LoA) for the execution of Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) work for Solar power plant on turnkey basis with an order value of INR5.47 billion. The LoA also includes operations and maintenance for a period of two years from the date of hand over, with an order value of INR67.98 million. The projects are scheduled to be completed in December 2024 as per the term of the order. The company said that the order is awarded by one of the global leading biggest utility in the world in renewable energy.

2 February: The government is set to increase the subsidy for rooftop solar installations to about 60 percent under the new Pradhan Mantri Suryoday Yojana, Union Minister for New and Renewable Energy R K Singh said. Currently, the government provides a 40 percent subsidy for rooftop solar installations. The enhanced subsidy aims to support consumers with electricity consumption below 300 units, typically belonging to economically weaker sections, by making solar installations more affordable without the need for loans. Post the 10 years when the loan is repaid, the rooftop solar infrastructure would be transferred to the household, which can then sell the excess power to the distribution companies (discoms), said Singh, who also holds the power portfolio. Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had said that the 10 million beneficiaries of the new scheme would be able to get 300 units of free power through the rooftop solar installations, resulting in an annual saving of INR15,000-18,0000 per year.

2 February: The Government of India has invited bids for the development of off-shore wind energy of a total capacity of 4 GW (gigawatt). The bids invited are for four blocks of 1 GW each on open access basis, for development of offshore wind power projects off the coast of Tamil Nadu, through international competitive bidding. Under this arrangement, the developers who win the bid for each block will set up 1 GW off-shore wind energy capacity and sell electricity directly to consumers under the open access regime. No Viability Gap Funding (VGF) is given under the open access bids, and the Renewable Energy generated will be sold to entities such as industries which are currently in the high-tariff band. The off-shore wind energy bids have been invited through Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI), a Government of India undertaking under the administrative control of the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy. The bids are being called after obtaining all necessary environmental clearances.

1 February: Finance Minister (FM) Nirmala Sitharaman said that the government will mandate the phased blending of compressed biogas (CBG) in compressed natural gas (CNG) for transport and piped natural gas (PNG) for domestic purposes. 'These steps are taken towards meeting our commitment for 'net-zero' by 2070,' She said. She said that the viability gap funding will be provided for harnessing offshore wind energy potential for initial capacity of 1 gigawatt (GW). She said that the financial assistance will be provided for procurement of biomass aggregation machinery to support collection. She said that to promote green growth, a new scheme of bio-manufacturing and bio-foundry will also be launched.

31 January: Russia has reduced gasoline exports to non-CIS countries to compensate for unplanned repairs at refineries, the energy ministry said, as the country grappled with the impact of fires and drone attacks on its energy infrastructure. It said gasoline and diesel exports have been reduced in January by 37 percent and 23 percent respectively from the same month in 2023. Russia is voluntarily cutting its oil and fuel exports by 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) in the first quarter as part of efforts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and allies (OPEC+) to support the energy markets. Russia will likely cut exports of naphtha by some 127,500-136,000 bpd, or around a third of its total exports, after fires disrupted operations at refineries on the Baltic and Black Seas, according to traders and LSEG ship-tracking data. The ministry said that major Russian oil companies had boosted gasoline production, which resulted in an increase of gasoline supplies to the domestic market in first 25 days of January by 7 percent, or 150,000 metric tonnes, year-on-year, and diesel supplies by almost 17 percent, or 490,000 tonnes. The country's inventories for ensuring stable supply of the domestic market amount to 1.9 million tonnes (MT) for gasoline and 3.9 MT for diesel fuel, up 16 percent and 7 percent from January 2023, it said.

31 January: United States (US) crude production in November rose 0.6 percent to a new monthly record of 13.31 million barrels per day (bpd), as output in Texas and New Mexico notched records as well, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said. Crude production in Texas rose by 1.4 percent to 5.66 million bpd, a monthly record, while crude output in New Mexico gained by 2.4 percent to 1.88 million bpd, also a record, the EIA said. Output in both of those states recorded the steepest growths since May 2023 and December 2022, respectively. US product supplied of crude and petroleum products rose in November to 20.71 million bpd, the highest since August, the EIA said. Product supplied of finished motor gasoline fell in November to 8.85 million bpd, the lowest since September, the EIA said.

31 January: Nigeria wants to resolve outstanding issues around the disputed OPL 245 oil block as it seeks to attract investment to its oil and gas industry and has held talks with Shell and Eni to discuss the matter, Oil Minister Heineken Lokpobiri said. Lokpobiri reiterated the government's position that there was no criminal liability on its part, or by the other parties, in the oil block deal, which has been embroiled in litigation for years. Nigeria in November, withdrew a US$1.1 billion civil claim against Shell, opens new tab and Eni, opens new tab related to allegations of corruption in the deal, ending all litigation around the oil asset.

5 February: The spot price of liquefied natural gas (LNG) is continuing to meander at low levels amid ample supply from major exporters and signs that winter demand is easing in the top-importing regions of Asia and Europe. The spot price for LNG delivered to north Asia ended at US$9.60 per mmBtu (million metric British thermal units) in the week to Feb. 2, up slightly from the seven-month low of US$9.50 the previous week. Spot LNG prices have broken their usual seasonal pattern of rising during the northern winter and again in summer, but declining in the shoulder periods between peak demand.

5 February: Shell Plc has made a final investment decision to build a gas supply facility in Nigeria to feed a fertiliser plant owned by Africa's richest man Aliko Dangote, the company said. The new facility will supply 100 million standard cubic feet of gas per day from the Iseni field to the Dangote Fertiliser and Petrochemical plant for 10 years, according to the deal agreed by Shell, opens new tab and its joint venture partners TotalEnergies, opens new tab, Eni, opens new tab and the state oil firm NNPC Ltd. Nigeria holds Africa's largest gas reserves of more than 200 trillion cubic feet and is seeking to develop the reserves to boost supply to industries, power plants, and for exports. Shell's Nigeria chief, Osagie Okunbor, said the project will increase the delivery of gas to the domestic market and help stimulate economic growth.

3 February: Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation (TPDC) has paid US$23.6 million to double its shareholding in the Mnazi Bay natural gas field under an agreement with French energy company Maurel & Prom, opens new tab. The Mnazi Bay gas field, in the Mtwara region of the country's south, has an estimated 641 billion cubic feet of recoverable natural gas reserves and contributes nearly half of the gas used to generate electricity in the East African country.

31 January: Japan's top power generator JERA expects the temporary suspension of US (United States) liquefied natural gas (LNG) export permits may affect Japan's fuel security, and even the world's, if the issue persists. JERA is one of the world's biggest LNG buyers and Japan is the world's second-biggest buyer of the super-chilled fuel after China. US President Joe Biden paused approvals for pending and future applications to export LNG from new projects, a move cheered by climate activists that could delay decisions on new plants until after the Nov. 5 election. JERA, which has signed 20-year agreement to buy 1 million metric tons per annum of LNG from Venture Global LNG's Calcasieu Pass (CP2) plant in Louisiana, will work together with the public and private sectors to address the issue while keeping a close eye on the situation, JERA's head of global investor relations Tetsuo Yoshida said. Japan's Industry Minister Ken Saito raised concerns over the US suspension of LNG export permits and said the Japanese government will take necessary steps to ensure that Japan's stable energy supply is not compromised.

31 January: Grain LNG said it had signed a 10-year deal with Sonatrach to extend the Algerian company's long-term storage and redelivery capacity at Europe's largest liquefied natural gas (LNG) import terminal beyond January 2029. The agreement is for 125 gigawatt hours per day (GWh/d) of import capacity, equivalent to 3 million metric tonnes per annum (mtpa) of LNG, and is the first to be announced under Grain LNG's competitive auction process which was launched in September for 9 mtpa of existing capacity. Located on the Isle of Grain in Kent, National Grid's Grain terminal is currently being expanded to store and deliver enough gas to meet up to 33 percent of British gas demand.

6 February: United States (US) power consumption will rise to record highs in 2024 and 2025, the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) said. EIA projected power demand will rise to 4,112 billion kilowatt hours (kWh) in 2024 and 4,123 billion kWh in 2025. That compares with 3,994 billion kWh in 2023 and a record 4,070 billion kWh in 2022. As homes and businesses use more electricity instead of fossil fuels for heat and transportation, EIA forecast 2024 power sales would rise to 1,530 billion kWh for residential consumers, 1,396 billion kWh for commercial customers and 1,035 billion kWh for industrial customers. That compares with all-time highs of 1,509 billion kWh for residential consumers in 2022, 1,391 billion kWh in 2022 for commercial customers and 1,064 billion kWh in 2000 for industrial customers.

5 February: Norwegian natural gas exports were curtailed due to an unplanned outage at the Nyhamna processing plant following a power cut at the weekend amid high winds, operator Shell, opens new tab said. The power line which tripped and caused the outage at Nyhamna was repaired late, transmission grid operator Statnett said.

5 February: Ukraine reported a surplus of electricity production and intends to export it to neighbouring Moldova and Poland, Ukrainian energy ministry said. Ukraine had produced more energy than it consumed before the Russian invasion in 2022, but that output has dropped since the Russian attacks on power facilities and the occupation of Europe's largest Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Ukraine's Energy Minister German Galushchenko said that Ukraine could resume substantial energy exports as early as this spring due to lower consumption. Ukraine banned exports during the last heating season amid Russian attacks on Ukraine's energy system and large-scale shutdowns.

5 February: Snam, opens new tab is officially launching a market test for hydrogen demand in Italy and a collection of expressions of interest for carbon dioxide (CO) transport and storage, the gas grid operator said. The two initiatives are part of Snam's broader activities to support Italy's energy transition, the company said. The International Energy Agency (IEA) said it can play a vital role in achieving global climate goals. However, critics said it risks prolonging the use of fossil fuels and question whether it is commercially viable. Snam and Italian energy group Eni announced a project last year to set up a carbon capture and storage hub offshore Ravenna to help decarbonise high-emitting industrial activities.

1 February: Prices of European power purchase agreements (PPAs) for green electricity fell 2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2023, making a case for buyers to strike new deals ahead of an expected rise in demand, price tracking platform LevelTen said. PPAs, bilateral long-term agreements between corporate power users and wind and solar project developers, give consumers supply security and developers a guaranteed income stream, making it easier to arrange financing. Corporate buyers are eager to lock in a carbon-free power supply to comply with a 2023 European renewable energy directive requiring 42.5 percent of EU (European Union) electricity be renewable by 2030.

The EU's climate agenda is in trouble. The Green Deal, which aims to slash the bloc's carbon emissions by 55% by 2030, had started off promisingly after several major pieces of legislation were adopted, including its ban on the sale of new combustion-powered vehicles from 2035 and carbon border tax. Increasingly, however, Europeans are rebelling against green restrictions of which they have difficulty seeing the advantages.

The elephants in the room

Another less reported upon but equally important threat to the bloc's ecological and energy transition comes from the alarming number of Chinese and US companies moving into the EU power sector.

In our book, Energy: How to Recover Our European Ambition (published in French), we shed light on this overlooked issue ahead of European elections that will be critical for the EU's energy strategy and call on the bloc to carefully weigh up cooperation and competition with sovereignty.

China eyes Europe's energy sector

While there currently isn't any quantitative data on China's share in the European energy market, we do know the country detains 80% of the global clean-technology manufacturing capacity in 11 segments, from solar wafers to many lithium-ion battery components.

Taking advantage of the sovereign debt crisis in Europe, Chinese investors first stepped in to acquire substantial stakes in what have long been regarded as ""sovereign"" sectors, such as power transmission and distribution grids, in the early 2010s. Key among those was the world's largest utility company, the State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC), commonly known as the State Grid - the world's fourth-biggest company overall by revenue, behind Walmart, Saudi Aramco and Amazon as of March. Also increasingly present is Three Gorges Corp, responsible for the world's largest hydroelectric power complex.

For instance, in Portugal, Three Gorges Corp. won the bidding for the Portuguese government's 21% stake in EDP-Energias de Portugal SA in 2010. Meanwhile, in Italy, SGCC expanded its presence by collaborating with the Italian government in 2014, acquiring a 35% share in the CDP Reti fund, thereby attaining a blocking minority at the local gas network operator, SNAM, and electricity transmission network operator, Terna. Similarly, in Greece the State Grid made substantial inroads by acquiring a 24% stake in the national electricity transmission network operator from the Greek government in 2016.

While Portugal, Italy, and Greece were primary targets, Chinese investors have also acquired grids in Luxembourg. Last but not least, let's not forget China's green-tech industry has flooded Europe with cheap solar panels and electric vehicles (EVs).

US inroads in the EU energy market

The stakes are all the higher because China is not the only country with ambitions in the EU. The United States is also seeking to benefit from the bloc's poorly thought-out energy strategy.

Russia's war against Ukraine has not weakened the United States' energy dominance in the world, and more specifically in the EU. Indeed, while Russian gas was expected to act as a bridge fuel in the energy transition, particularly for Germany, the EU was quick to adopt sanctions against its long-term trade partner that minimised its dependence. Partly filling the vacant space left by Moscow, the United States has become the leading producer and exporter of LNG to Europe. This development favours US trade while domestic energy costs are kept low, further widening the price gap, with Europe experiencing an energy inflation and undermining its relative competitiveness and attractiveness to energy-intensive industry.

Beyond these energy-supply issues, EU member states are struggling to carve out a common vision, highlighting the challenges of sovereignty and strategic autonomy. European companies, particularly in France, have endeavoured to develop fourth-generation small modular nuclear reactors (SMR), with an attempt to create a European nuclear alliance made in November 2023. But at the same moment, countries such as Italy, Belgium, and Romania have partnered with the American Westinghouse Electric Company to develop lead-cooled fast reactors.

Here again, the coordination gap plays to the advantage of American influence in Europe, as confirmed by John Kerry in September 2023. As part of the international consortium ""Clean Fuel from SMR"", led by American companies, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Poland were selected to participate and will receive support for coal-to-SMR feasibility studies. These EU countries are turning to the Americans to build new nuclear power plants, mainly because of their funding and technical expertise, while the EU continues to block all support for nuclear projects developed on its soil.

Cracks in the EU's net-zero goals

The scale of these foreign investments in renewable energies, new nuclear facilities and grid development could come to bear heavily onto the bloc's strategic independence at a time when it's looking to decarbonise.

These investments raise concerns over continental energy security, given the still fragmented nature of Europe's energy landscape:

in the short run, supply issues due to the energy crisis urgently push the EU to turn to other foreign partners (other than Russia) and only shift our energy dependence problem;

in the longer term, faced with Chinese dumping and US protectionism, Europe will have to protect domestic energy manufacturers or grid operators after having long neglected them.

The main challenge for Europe is ending one dependency without falling into another. To replace imports of fossil fuels (coal, gas, and oil), harmful to the climate, the EU member states must accelerate and coordinate the development of their ""green"" technologies.

Toward green sovereignty

These risks demand that the bloc not only pays more attention to non-EU operators, but take greater responsibility over its own energy system. How can it do this, all while pursuing the vision of the ""green, secure and affordable energy supply"" set out in its Green Deal?

For starters, we recommend EU member states work harder on building truly European energy grids. As we move toward decarbonisation, we can expect an array of renewable energies to increasingly power our electricity system. These arrangements will require extensive and interconnected networks on a European scale, which must be consolidated and developed by the EU member states themselves.

A second emergency is green energy financing. In November, the European Climate Neutrality Observatory warned a lack of EU-level public investment in green energy and other advances could lead the bloc to fail to meet its net-zero goals. Rather than take heed of the warning, member states axed the fund earmarked for renewables and clean tech - the Strategic Technologies for Europe Platform (STEP) - to 1.5bn in February. Our book calls for a radical change of strategy, through the creation of a ""European transition savings account"" to attract private savings, on the one hand, and a ""European sovereign fund"" that receives proceeds from carbon-pricing revenues on the other.

Whether these actually come into being will depend on the upcoming European elections. Results leaning toward a higher European ambition could help us seen in clean, affordable and secure solutions. Further veering to the nationalistic right could further jeopardise the bloc's economic clout and, paradoxically, sovereignty.
