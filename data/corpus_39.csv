The company has a market capitalization close to half a billion dollars, yet remains largely unfollowed with basically no analyst coverage. Its management team has continued to show strong execution, particularly in leveraging its foothold in the retail energy market to develop its renewable energy business from the ground up. While its core business shows stable levels of profitability, its renewables business has demonstrated rapid growth in recent quarters. The company trades at a cheap valuation with an EV to 2024 Adjusted EBITDA multiple of just 6.7. Furthermore, management has recently increased its pace of returning capital to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks. Additionally, I believe that there is potentially further upside from several upcoming catalysts, and therefore rate the stock a Buy.

Genie Energy (NYSE:GNE) is a domestic energy services provider solely operating in certain deregulated markets. The company consists of two segments: its core business Genie Retail Energy (GRE) and its emerging business Genie Renewables (GREW).

The GRE business is involved in the purchase of electricity and natural gas on wholesale markets, which it then resells to its customers. It offers its customers contracts with a range of options, including fixed pricing and energy from renewable sources. Its customers are primarily homeowners, with commercial and government institutions to a lesser extent.

Presently the company operates solely in the US, under multiple brands such as IDT Energy, Residents Energy, Town Square Energy, Southern Federal Power and Mirabito. Previously the company operated internationally in the UK as well as in Sweden and Finland. Due to challenging market conditions, its UK operations were discontinued in Q3 2021, followed by a strategic exit from Sweden and Finland in Q4 2022.

Genie's GREW business consists of a vertically integrated solar energy company. In addition to being a developer and operator of solar projects, the company also has the capability to design and manufacture specialized solar panels. Through government incentivized community solar projects, Genie leverages the customer contracts already in place from its GRE segment to sell its own solar energy. In its recent quarter, the GREW segment represented just 6% of Genie's total revenue, but showed growth of close to 89%, though growth was not entirely organic.

GRE strongly benefitted from the volatile energy price environment during 2022. Their pricing hedges enabled them to achieve record gross margins well above 50% compared to historical margins of 30%. However, the subsequent normalization of the energy market for electricity and natural gas has been a headwind for GRE's margins, as shown above.

In its recent quarter, GRE revenue grew 11% year over year while gross margins fell from 32% to 29%. This led to a decrease of 13% in year over year Adjusted EBITDA to $14.6 million. Despite its declining margins, the underlying business continues to grow with the number of installed meters at customers growing 4.5% year over year to 365 thousand. This is a useful metric to follow to understand the growth in GRE's customer base. However, the growth was somewhat offset by churn rising year over year from 4.4% to 5.5%.

The GREW segment has shown strong growth, both due to internally developed solar projects as well as acquired solar projects. Genie's strategy for this segment was explained by its CEO Michael Stein during the Q1 2024 earnings call when he said:

As a reminder, our solar project development strategy is intended to be a long-term value driver for the company. Developing projects from site-right acquisitions through construction and into operations typically takes years. However, we are pursuing projects with robust ROI projections that we expect will provide growing recurring revenue streams to the company for years to come.

As shown above, GREW has shown strong revenue growth, currently operating at an annual revenue run-rate close to $30 million. Gross margins have been highly volatile due to the different types of services offered within this segment as well as ongoing investments. Going forward I expect margins to remain close to 20% as more solar power comes online and provides a steadier stream of revenue. The company's pipeline for ongoing solar energy projects stood at 100MW, of which just 10MW was currently operational.

Guidance for the overall company provided by management during the Q4 2023 earnings call points to an adjusted EBITDA of $45 million at the midpoint for the FY2024, with its CEO stating:

Building off our strong performance in 2023, we're targeting $40 million to $50 million in company-wide consolidated adjusted EBITDA for 2024. This represents a significant increase from our pre-2022 normalized adjusted EBITDA range of $25 million to $30 million, even after allowing for our planned investment in GREW. Our higher expectations reflect our expanded customer base at GRE, our pivot to operating exclusively in domestic retail markets and our focus on continuously enhancing our analytical and operation capabilities.

Though guidance calls for a decline in adjusted EBITDA of 10% compared to the prior year, the positive aspect remains that management expects adjusted EBITDA to normalize around this level. When accounting for the company's net cash of $100 million, at a share price of $15 the company has an enterprise value of $300 million. This implies that the company trades at an EV to 2024 Adjusted EBITDA multiple of just 6.7. Management considers its net cash to be even higher due to the additional $50 million held as restricted cash at its Captive insurance subsidiary, which it created earlier this year. When accounting for this additional cash, its EV to 2024 Adjusted EBITDA ratio falls to just 5.4.

The company's valuation is definitely cheap considering its Adjusted EBITDA is partly suppressed by the investments that the company is making in its solar business. In 2023, the drag to Adjusted EBITDA from the GREW segment amounted to negative $5 million. Furthermore, Genie Energy's present valuation reflects a substantial discount compared to its peers in the Utility sector, which typically trade at a multiple of around 13, according to Statista. It is worth mentioning that Genie's GRE business owns no fixed assets. Therefore, its capex levels are very low, leading to high free cash flow conversion from Adjusted EBITDA.

The most likely reason for the company's discounted valuation is due to the market's skepticism that the company's adjusted EBITDA will normalize around $45 million rather than reverting to pre-2022 levels of $25 to $30 million. If the company can demonstrate that it is capable of achieving the revenue and margins that have been guided, the market should subsequently re-rate the shares much higher.

The Perry and Lansing solar farms in New York are likely to be completed this year and will start contributing economically. Additionally, the company plans to further develop its project pipeline, including inorganic acquisitions similar to those that have been done recently.

With shares trading at depressed levels, management has accelerated its share buyback with $4.1 million spent last quarter. This is a significant increase compared to $2.9 million spent during the whole of 2023. I believe share repurchases at these prices will be immensely value accretive to its current shareholders.

GRE has seen an uptick in churn in recent quarters. According to its 2023 Annual report, the company states that churn could reach as high as 7%, compared to the 5.5% reported in Q1 2024. A higher churn rate would imply that the business would face declining revenue or higher SG&A costs to acquire new customers, which would then drag margins lower.

The company operates in the retail energy market, which is highly competitive and has low barriers to entry. In some of its markets, GRE either competes with the local utility or with companies affiliated with the local utility.

The success of its GREW segment depends on the gross margins showing consistent improvement. It remains to be seen whether the company can reach and maintain positive adjusted EBITDA from the GREW segment.

The company's 2023 Annual report states that it is facing an ongoing lawsuit in Illinois related to consumer fraud and deceptive marketing practices. The state represented nearly 10% of the company's revenue last year.

Despite some risks associated with it, I believe the company's low valuation considerably mitigates the downside. If the company can show stability in its margins at GRE in upcoming quarters, I believe the market will gradually re-rate the shares much higher. The GREW segment provides added optionality to the investment, and could one day turn out to be a hidden gem. Meanwhile, the company's share repurchases continue to be value accretive to shareholders at these prices. I therefore believe Genie Energy presents a good risk-reward to initiate a Long position.",seekingalpha.com,news,Seeking Alpha,Sandeep Nital David,0.3411764705882352,454869814,9,https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/570132253/image_570132253.jpg?io=getty-c-w1536,

The modernisations, starting in 2026, are part of the lifetime extension-related investments consisting of continuous improvements to ensure reliable electricity production until the end of the plant's lifetime. This will also increase the total capacity of the plant by approximately 38 MWe, increasing the output of the power plant during its lifetime by approximately 7 TWh.

In February 2023, the Finnish Government granted a new operating licence for the power plant until 2050. Over the course of the new licence period, the power plant is expected to generate up to 177 TWh.

""Extending the lifetime of the power plant is a major investment with a positive impact - both economically and in terms of employment,"" said Sasu Valkamo, Loviisa NPP Senior Vice President. ""Modernising the low-pressure turbines is our first significant investment in preparation for the lifetime extension. Our aim is for the power plant to operate during the new operating licence period just as stably, reliably and safely as it has so far.""

It is estimated that the investments related to the lifetime extension will amount to approximately €1bn ($1.08bn) by 2050. Over the past five years, Fortum has invested approximately €200m in refurbishing the Loviisa plant.

Fortum has signed an agreement for the turbine modernisation with Doosan Škoda Power. The modernisation will be carried out in conjunction with the normal annual outages. ""Doosan Škoda Power is a seasoned turbine supplier, and we have good experiences working with them. In our previous modernisation project, Doosan Škoda Power also supplied us with high-pressure turbines,"" Valkamo noted.

In the turbine project, eight low-pressure turbine housings and their internal parts will be renewed. The project will significantly improve the efficiency of the turbine plant's electricity production without increasing the thermal output of the reactor. The modernisation is will not impact the reactor plant or nuclear safety.

Loviisa was the first NPP in Finland. The power plant has two Soviet-supplied VVER-440 units that began operation in 1977 and 1980. The operating licences for the units were renewed in 1998 and 2007. The current licences must be renewed by the end of 2027 and 2030. In 2018, the plant completed the largest modernisation programme in its history, which included the full renewal of the plant automation system.",neimagazine.com,news,Nuclear Engineering International,,0.2392156862745098,454868294,9,https://www.neimagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2024/05/Loviisa_NPP.jpg,eng-9614327

The roundtables will bring operators from the industrial sector together to build a common understanding of the situation and give ideas for future work at the ministries. The aim is to set up an efficient network to support influencing in the EU contexts and find cost-effective national solutions.

Views and proposals are also sought from industrial associations and companies on what the central government should focus on and what are the most essential legislative means to build value creation in carbon management.

The first roundtable met in the Government Banquet Hall on 31 May 2024. The participants came from the associations representing the forest, energy, technology and metal industries, the Confederation of Finnish Industries EK, the Bioenergy Association of Finland, Gasgrid, VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland, Stora Enso, UPM, Metsä Group and the key ministers.

As an introduction to the discussions, public officials from the ministries spoke about the situation in terms of legislative drafting and future work related to influencing and preparation of national actions, as well as on the storage of carbon dioxide and the agreements required for this. The discussion showed that the opportunities created by industrial carbon management have been recognised and there is a lot of discussion and preparatory work concerning their utilisation. The next roundtable will be convened on 5 June, this time for the energy companies.

The European Commission published Communications on the 2040 climate target and industrial carbon management in February. They will open paths towards new clean solutions and further development of carbon sequestration. At that time, Minister Mykkänen pointed out that many of the priorities of Finland's work to influence the EU policy were reflected in the Communications.

""Carbon capture, utilisation and storage offer great opportunities. A significant percentage of Europe's biogenic carbon dioxide is produced in Finland, where it can be sucked from industrial smokestacks. Together with the other special strength we have in Finland, clean electricity production, it will also be possible to create even more advanced value chains for the bio-based carbon dioxide that has been captured to replace fossil coal as raw material,"" Minister Kai Mykkänen says.

Industrial carbon sequestration and utilisation of the carbon dioxide that has been captured offer significant opportunities for climate change mitigation, improving the competitiveness of industry and creating new markets. To achieve these targets, sufficient investments in infrastructure, development of the legislation and international cooperation will be needed.

Besides investments, during this decade the focus should be on creating rules for the market and developing transport infrastructure. This includes developing the regulation on transport and ensuring seamless interoperability of different modes of transport. The key measures also include ensuring the storage capacity and creating a clear framework for the access to storage.

If the Government gives an approval a first phase of the project could be operational by 2030 and deliver over 6 TWh annually to South Sweden. The entire wind farm is expected to be developed by 2035 and can deliver up to 24 TWh on a yearly basis.

Aurora is located about 22 kilometers south of the island of Gotland and more than 30 kilometers east of the island of Öland in the Baltic Sea. When completed the wind farm will produce up to 24 TWh annually. The Baltic Sea is also an important area for the Swedish Armed Forces and with the help of sensors on the wind turbines, the wind farm could assist with surveillance in the area.

In connection with its decision, the County Administrative Board of Gotland announces that energy production is an urgent and important public interest and that the wind farm would provide a significant contribution of electricity production in the part of Sweden where consumption is greatest.

- Aurora can act as an accelerator in the transition to net zero emissions in southern Sweden. The large-scale production of electricity will enable a substantial production of hydrogen and e-fuel, which is the prerequisite for fossil-free industry, shipping and aviation. We are working in parallel to secure the connections to the electricity grid as well as signing supplier agreements to be able to start construction as soon as all permits are in place, says Emelie Zakrisson, Head of Offshore wind development in Sweden, OX2.

- We are really pleased that the County Administrative Board has given the green light to the project. We look forward to realizing Aurora together with OX2. With a fast permit process the wind farm could be producing electricity by 2030, says Frederik de Jong, Head of Renewable investments, Ingka Investments.

In addition to electricity production OX2 is working to improve biodiversity in the area. Among other things OX2 is investigating how the fixed structures of the park can be designed to function as artificial reefs for sessile species and form premises where fish accumulate.

Collaborations are also underway to investigate the possibilities for large-scale mussel farming within the park, which would help reduce eutrophication.

In April this year the County Administrative Board granted Aurora a Natura 2000-permit. OX2 and Ingka Investments also develop the offshore wind farm Galene that received a permit a year ago, Triton and Neptunus off the coast south of Sweden and Pleione-Ran off the coast of Gotland.

The modernisation of the turbines will also increase the total capacity of the Loviisa power plant by about 38 MWe.

The Loviisa plant - comprising two VVER-440 type pressurised water reactors - was the first nuclear power plant in Finland and currently provides more than 10% of the country's electricity. Loviisa unit 1 began commercial operation in 1977, with unit 2 following in 1981. In February 2023, the Finnish government granted Fortum an extension to the operating licence for the two-units, allowing the Loviisa plant to continue generating power until the end of 2050.

According to preliminary data from Statistics Finland, total emissions, excluding the land use sector, were 40.6 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent, 5.1 million tonnes less than the previous year. Greenhouse gas emissions in 2023 decreased by 43 percent as compared to 1990.

Last year's decline was primarily driven by the energy sector, which saw a reduction of 4.6 million tonnes. Nevertheless, the energy sector remains the largest source of emissions, accounting for 70 percent of total emissions in 2023.

Statistics Finland Chief Actuary Paivi Lindh stated, ""Last year, changes in the electricity production structure reduced emissions in the energy sector. Coal and peat use decreased, while nuclear and wind power production increased. Hydropower production also rose compared to the previous year.""

At the same time, reduced logging has reduced carbon emissions from the land use sector. Logging volumes dropped by about 9 percent, turning the sector from a net emission source to a carbon sink, analysts explained.

According to the Finnish Climate Change Act, Finland's net emissions should be zero or negative by 2035. By 2030, emissions must be reduced by 60 percent, compared to 1990.",industriesnews.net,news,industriesnews.net,,0.08235294117647052,454852253,13,,

Between 6-9 June, around 360 million people across the EU will vote for representatives from national parties to sit in the European Parliament.

The grouping or coalition with the most seats will help to shape the leadership of the next European Commission. The overall composition of parliament will also influence the bloc's priorities between 2024-2029.

Climate change and energy once again feature prominently in the manifestos of the major parties, with mounting pressure to secure energy supplies in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine drawing particular focus.

Core to this is a transition to decarbonised domestic energy. Carbon Brief's analysis shows that the relatively small nations of Portugal, Latvia and Finland have led the way since the last EU election, with the largest percentage drop in power-sector emissions between 2019 and 2023.

Malta and the Netherlands have led in increasing their renewables shares, with the Netherlands also seeing the largest absolute increase in renewable generation.

Meanwhile, fossil-fuel generation fell in all but three countries when comparing 2019 and 2023.

Other key findings from the analysis include:

In this analysis, Carbon Brief looks at how the electricity sector has changed since the last election.

Every national power system across the EU has become cleaner since the last European Parliamentary election in 2019, Carbon Brief analysis shows.

Finland led the way in terms of reducing grid intensity - the measure of how clean the electricity within national grids is - halving its intensity between 2019 and 2023 to become the third cleanest in the EU, behind France and Sweden.

In absolute terms, Greece reduced its grid intensity the most since 2019, Carbon Brief shows. The country hit a new record high level of clean energy generation, with power grid operator IPTO announcing that renewables and hydroelectric plants accounted for 57% of the country' energy in 2023.

Germany saw the largest fall in power-sector emissions in absolute terms - namely, the overall volume of CO2 emissions produced. Like Greece, the country had a ""landmark"" 2023 for renewable generation, according to thinktank Ember.

Carbon Brief analysis shows that power-sector emissions in Germany fell by 43.23m tonnes of carbon dioxide (MtCO2), or 18.4%, of 2019 values by 2023.

Despite this significant drop, the country's power sector is still the most polluting of all EU countries, responsible for 29.3% of EU power-sector emissions. This places it far ahead of Poland, the second largest polluter, which is responsible for 17% of emissions.

Germany has one of the largest populations in Europe and its energy demand sits at 514TWh (19% of EU total). When looking at per-capita emissions (as shown below), the country sits fourth in the EU for emissions, seeing a reduction of 0.51tCO2 in 2023 compared with 2019.

Portugal, Latvia and Finland decarbonised their power sectors the most relative to 2019, analysis shows.

Portugal saw renewables supply 61% of its electricity consumption in 2023, according to the country's grid operator Redes Energéticas Nacionais. This totaled 31.2TWh - the most it has ever recorded. This included a period in November where the country ran on just renewables for six days in a row.

Carbon Brief's analysis of Ember data placed the 2023 figure even high, with 73% of electricity from renewable sources.

As shown in the chart below, there were just three EU countries where power-sector emissions have increased since 2019 - Malta, Croatia and Lithuania. These countries are some of the smallest in Europe, collectively accounting for less than 1% of total EU power generation in 2023.

Malta increased its power-sector emissions by 0.11MtCO2, or 10.3%, of 2019 emissions. As an island nation, Malta's energy system is still heavily dominated by imported oil and gas, making up nearly 90% of power generation. (Malta has some of the lowest per-capita emissions in Europe, with 5.3 tonnes CO2 equivalent (tCO2e) per inhabitant in 2019, well below the EU average of 8.4tCO2e.)

Croatia, where emissions increased by 0.4MtCO2 or 13%, is similarly reliant on fossil fuels, with coal still dominating its power sector. While power demand has remained stable in recent years, net imports of electricity have dropped likely due to higher electricity prices in neighbouring countries.

Although renewable generation offset most of this, it did lead to a small jump in fossil fuel use of ~1TWh.

Lithuania saw emissions increase by 0.32MtCO2, from 0.57MtCO2 in 2019 to 0.89MtCO2 in 2023, Carbon Brief analysis shows. The country is currently heavily reliant on electricity imports, after the closure of its only nuclear power plant in 2010 changed it from a net exporter to a net importer.

Chris Rosslowe, senior energy and climate data analyst at Ember, tells Carbon Brief:

""Trends in generation in Lithuania don't tell you as much as in other countries as it imports most of its electricity since shutting down nuclear power in 2010. Import dependence is slowly lowering though - from ~75% in 2019 to ~55% in 2023 - and, like Croatia, renewables are growing faster than fossils.""

It is undergoing a particularly key period of transition. Lithuania's electricity grid currently operates synchronously with the Russia-Belarus power system, but it is planning to de-synch by 2025 and instead run with the continental Europe grid.

Additionally, it is among the countries that are seeing the fastest expansion of wind generation. It is also targeting halving its imports and generating 70% of its electricity from domestic sources by 2030, as it pushes for increased energy sovereignty and security.

Rosselowe notes that Malta, Croatia and Lithuania are all expected to reduce their dependence on fossil fuels in the coming years, offset in large part by growing renewables.

Overall, the Czech Republic remains the biggest per-capita emitter in the EU, as shown in the chart below. Between 2019 and 2023, emissions in the country did drop from 4tCO2 to 3.2tCO2, but it still sits 0.9tCO2 above the second highest per-capita emitter Cyprus (3.1tCO2).

The three countries that saw an increase in per-capita emissions match those where there was an increase in fossil fuel generation - Malta, Croatia and Lithuania.

Between 2019 and 2023, the share of renewable generation in the EU increased in all by one country, according to Carbon Brief analysis.

Italy saw renewable generation fall from 115.83 terawatt hours (TWh) in 2019 to 114.8TWh in 2023. This was broadly due to the impact of droughts in the country affecting hydropower generation, which hit in 2022, but had a continued impact in 2023.

This was a wider dynamic seen globally, which kept the world from hitting peak electricity generation emissions in 2023.

Slovakia, meanwhile, was the only country to see a dip in its share of renewable energy when comparing 2019 and 2023. This was minor, falling just 0.65% from 23.57% to 22.92%. The country has one of the smallest energy demands in Europe and, like Italy, saw a drop in hydro driven by droughts in 2022.

Malta and the Netherlands saw their share of renewables increase by more than 150% in 2023 relative to 2019, Carbon Brief analysis shows.

The Netherlands increased its absolute share of renewable generation by close to 30% since 2019, as shown in the chart below. The country seeing the largest absolute increase in renewable generation, closely followed by Spain.

Nearly half the electricity produced in the Netherlands is now renewable, according to the Dutch Central Bureau for Statistics.

This was predominantly wind generation, with the country adding more wind power than any other country in the EU between 2019 and 2023, both relatively and in absolute terms. Overall, the Netherlands increased its wind generation by 152% and Finland followed closely behind with a 143% rise.

Latvia, similarly, saw significant growth, with the share of renewables jumping from 49.5% in 2019 to 76.6% in 2023. This 27.1% increase is particularly key for the country, as it continues to target reducing its dependence on energy imports from Russia.

Spain added more solar generation in absolute terms over the four-year period than any other country in the EU, tripling its overall renewable generation.

Poland increased its solar generation by more than 1,500%, increasing generation by 12TWh albeit from a low starting point of just 0.71TWh in 2019. Renewables generated a record 26% of electricity in the country in 2023. However, coal still produces most of the country's electricity and continues to have a powerful impact on policy due to powerful lobbies.

Hungary has increased its solar share of generation the most since 2019, with an increase of 14%. It was followed closely by the Netherlands, with a 12.8% increase. Luxembourg increased wind power share of generation by more than the Netherlands - 17%.

Overall, just three EU countries - Malta, Croatia and Lithuania - saw an increase in the share of fossil fuel generation in 2023 relative to 2019, according to Carbon Brief analysis.

Over the same period, Luxembourg and Finland reduced fossil generation by more than 60%.

The Netherlands has reduced its fossil fuel share in the electricity system the most since 2019, falling by close to 30%. As shown in the chart below, this fall was mirrored by a significant increase in renewable energy generation.

In comparison with 2019, Ireland saw an increase in coal generation in 2023 making it the only EU nation to do so. In 2019, coal generation was at a record low in the country (0.51TWh) before jumping to 2.72TWh in 2022 due to a drop in wind generation.

However, since that point coal power generation has been continuing to fall again, in line with the wider trend seen over the past few decades.

Ireland has seen total electricity demand increase by more than 60% since 2019, Carbon Brief analysis shows. The country's energy demand has been particularly driven by the growth of data centres, which accounted for 18% of energy demand in 2022, for example.

Despite the blip in coal generation, the share of fossil fuels fell by 2.5% between 2019 and 2023.

Portugal reduced its use of coal the most, relative to 2019, while Germany reduced the most in absolute terms. As discussed above, this was supported by surging renewable generation in both countries.

Pieter de Pous, programme lead in E3G's fossil fuel transition programme, tells Carbon Brief:

""Europe's phaseout of coal has been one of its biggest, most historical, monumental success stories of the last couple of years when you think about it. We've dropped consumption since 2016 by 50%, right? It's really enormous and it's a story that's rarely told.""

The last European Parliament elections saw a ""green wave"" of climate-focused politicians winning seats across the continent. In the years that followed, the EU approved a European Green Deal, including goals to cut emissions by 55% from 1990 levels by 2030 and reach net-zero by 2050.

European member states now have a ""critical role"" to play in implementing what has been agreed, notes Rosslowe. He adds:",carbonbrief.org,news,Carbon Brief,,0.1764705882352942,454852151,76,https://www.carbonbrief.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2RA0468.jpg,

At least to Scottish ears.

But something specific happened a couple of years ago that gave heat pumps yet another big boost.

It did not rain. Yes, a dry, hot summer prompted Norwegians to invest in more efficient, environmentally cleaner heating.

How come?

Now, as most readers will know, southern Norway's climate is not crazily different to our own. So wet and cool.

This, combined with hilly terrain, has given even big cities like Oslo a natural advantage: plentiful cheap electricity from hydro-power stations.

Except when it does not rain. Remember the hot summer of 2022? When Scotland set a record temperature of just over 34 degrees in the Borders. Well, the same thing happened across the North Sea.

Europe's heatwave brought drought to Norway. Its hydropower stations - the country's main source of electricity - did not quite dry up. But they - including pump storage systems needed to maintain supply from other renewables - had far lower accumulations of water. Bluntly, there was not enough of the wet stuff to keep generators buzzing the way they normally do.

Suddenly a country used to ready supplies of power had shortages. It imposed export controls. But this was 2022, shortly after Vladimir Putin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, when world energy prices, including those for gas, were soaring. There were no cheap imports to be had.

Wholesale prices for electricity - as in the UK - jumped, tripled in fact, from 84 euros per megawatt-hour in February 2022 to 246 euros per megawatt-hour in August. Sure, prices do fluctuate from year to year and season to season - they had been as low as two euros per megawatt-hour in 2020.

But the shooting prices of summer 2022 gave consumers a fright. So they looked for ways not to cut their bills - but at least to mitigate against huge rises.

The carbon footprint of heating, from heat pumps to networks

The most obvious move: to switch to more efficient systems like heat pumps. The technology was already popular - and there was some pent-up demand after Covid.

Installations of heat pumps in Norway really took off in the last two quarter of 2022. In 2023 a total of 151,260 were put in place. That was up from 57,620 in 2014.

And it compares - sorry, bottom of the league Scotland - with 6,388 installed in this country in the same 12 months.

The latest numbers from Novap, Norway's heat pump lobby, suggest sales in the first quarter of this year are off their peak. But still the second highest on record.

Norway's love affair with varmepumper began after a previous spike in energy prices, back in 2003. Something like 60% of households in Norway now have the technology fitted. In Sweden, Finland and Estonia the market share of heat pumps is 44%, 41% and 34% respectively.

In Scotland, according to the latest housing conditions report figures, published earlier this year, the equivalent figure is 1.3%.

This country - the whole of the UK - is a remarkable outlier in our region.

Oslo daily paper Dagsavisen earlier this year reeled off the reasons why Norwegians - even in the colder north of the country - were turning to heat pumps, especially air-to-air ones. Their main answer: money. The technology is not just cheaper to run, it is also more reliable, meaning fewer repair bills and maintenance costs.

But cheaper than what? Norwegians are often weighing up the advantages of heat pumps against less efficient (if environmentally clean) direct electric heating.

How so? The country, despite the discovery of North Sea oil and gas, moved to wean itself off fossil heating fuels yonks ago, or, to be more precise, gradually after the oil shock of 1973.

Scotland, and the rest of the UK, went in the opposite direction, installing a vast network of pipes to pump natural gas to millions of individual household boilers.

Norway is also a lot richer than Britain - GDP per capita is at least half as much again.

Its government and its citizens have more money to make initial outlays on green energy in their homes.

Moreover, the houses getting heat pumps are already, on average, far better insulated.

Can you fit a heat pump in an old Glasgow tenement flat?

All this means Scottish and British householders have to make different calculations when deciding on how to warm up their houses - even if they don't want to do the same to the planet.

There are - as if it needs to be said - lots of variables about the best heating system, in whatever country you live, in whatever kind of home.

Yet another nuance is that Norwegians have been less keen on efficient district heating systems than other northern countries. Which might explain why their take-up of heat pumps is higher than in other advanced Nordic nations.

Norwegian heat pump advocates are very aware that their record rolling out clean and efficient individual systems is helping to scotch some myths.

Rolf Iver Mytting Hagemoen, of Novap, has noticed the foreign media attention Norway's heat pumps get.

Speaking to TU, an engineering magazine, Hagemoen claimed the ""gas lobby"" was mobilising against the technology. ""They run targeted campaigns that heat pumps don't work when it's cold,"" he said. ""This is, of course, nonsense.""

Norway, especially its often frigid north, proves Hagemoen's point. Norwegian heat pump fans happily acknowledge that decades ago their tech used to struggle when it got very, very cold.

Crucially, in deep-freezing temperatures heat pumps outperform oil and gas boilers, according to engineers.

Norwegians have fallen in love with their heat pumps (Image: Getty)

In the summer of last year, just as Norwegians were bingeing on new heat pumps at record levels, a Scottish businessman and peer declared the technology wrong for our climate.

Willie Haughey claimed that heat pumps ""don't work as efficiently in Scotland as they do in other countries"". He had made similar remarks before - including in The Herald.

But by 2023 heat pumps had become an unlikely battleground in the culture wars. And Lord Haughey was presented as an expert in the topic.

The millionaire, after all, had made made so much of his fortune by chilling produce that cheeky reporters had long dubbed him Scotland's ""fridge magnate"".

The Daily Express, for example, reported his claims as a ""humiliation"" for the Scottish Greens, then still in government and pushing decarbonisation.

Actual experts were less impressed. Mitsubishi Electric, which makes heat pumps, published a blog in which one of its trainers, Ben Bartle-Ross, let rip at the peer. ""I am appalled that opinions rather than facts are still given public airtime,"" he said.

But Lord Haughey's take was not in a vacuum.

""There are a lot of false myths out there about heat pumps,"" Caroline Haglund Stignor, a researcher at RISE Research Institutes of Sweden, told Euronews at the end of last year.

""Some oil and gas producing countries such as Russia, some people, some sectors, some businesses don't want to see this transition.

She concluded: ""Yes, heat pumps work in cold climates. Yes, heat pumps work in old buildings.""

Norway's heat pump champions have another point. The shock of 2022, with its dry summer and sky-high energy prices, might not be a one-off. The long-term rise in energy prices means, they reckon, that countries and individuals should be investing in efficient, clean heating.

Heat pumps are designed to counter global warming. They are also supposed to mitigate against its costs. But will Scots learn to love varmepumper as much as Norwegians?",heraldscotland.com,news,The Herald,,0.2941176470588236,454830801,9,https://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/18141518/,eng-9610996

If you're seeking to explore the world while minimising your ecological footprint, look no further.

Taking a proactive stance in response to the evolving environment, Scotland took the remarkable step of hosting COP26 in 2021. Pioneering change, it was the first country globally to endorse the Tourism Declares a Climate Emergency initiative, encouraging the tourism sector to minimise its carbon footprint. With everything from commercial solar panels for warehouses and data centres and more to offshore wind, Scotland is one of the greenest places you can visit.

The spotlight on rewilding has attracted visitors to the breathtaking grandeur of the highlands, with the nation's Green Tourism certification scheme serving as a guide to recommended destinations.

Nestled in the heights of the Himalayas, Bhutan, an isolated Buddhist kingdom, stands out for its unique pursuit of measuring gross national happiness. This small nation's carbon neutrality is unparalleled worldwide, and its cautious approach to controlling visitor numbers stems from a concern that an influx of tourists could mar its pristine landscapes. The Royal Society for the Protection of Nature safeguards the integrity of the stunning glacial valleys, aided by a network of ecotourism farmhouses that contribute to funding conservation efforts.

Although often overlooked in the realm of European travel, Slovenia boasts a wealth of natural beauty, from the Julian Alps to Lake Bohinj and Lake Bled. To fully leverage these assets, the country has invested in creating new trails, enhancing signage, and digitising maps for the convenience of hikers and skiers.

Rwanda's allure as a tourism hotspot primarily revolves around its rich natural landscapes, notably the mountain gorillas. The government's emphasis on conserving their habitat in Volcanoes National Park reflects its commitment to preservation. Additionally, community tourism in the Great Rift Valley is championed by establishments such as the Sabyinyo Silverback Lodge, which aids the local population while transforming former poachers into partners in conservation.

The majority of Finland's northern landscape is blanketed by forests, with the nation's air and water being celebrated for their exceptional clarity. Through the establishment of the Sustainable Finland program, the government has reinforced its appeal to eco-tourists. The program steers travellers toward destinations like Lapland's northern forests, where glimpses of the Northern Lights through the trees are possible.

Much like in the UK where various employee benefits schemes reward cycling and travelling via sustainable means, Finland has good infrastructure and incentives for cyclists and those undertaking more sustainable modes of travel.

Boasting a diverse range of natural attractions, from mountains to rainforests to coastlines, Costa Rica captivates visitors with its abundant offerings and is increasingly popular with digital nomads, who benefit from its fast broadband services and stunning scenery. The nation has strategically embraced ecotourism, encapsulated in the motto ""Pura Vida"" or ""Pure Life."" Over a quarter of its land is dedicated to national parks, and the country claims around 17% of the world's animal species. Noteworthy is Costa Rica's reliance on hydropower for a significant portion of its electricity needs.

Leveraging its remarkable natural beauty to draw tourists, New Zealand has become a global exemplar of sustainability. Geothermal energy, an environmentally friendly power source, accounts for more than a fifth of the nation's energy consumption. The government's two-decade-long commitment to prioritising sustainability has solidified its reputation as a leader in green practices.

Like other island nations, Barbados confronts the front lines of climate change. Prime Minister Mia Mottley, a speaker at COP events, is acutely aware of the nation's vulnerability and is championing a transition toward greener practices. As part of the Caribbean Alliance for Sustainable Tourism, Barbados is actively ensuring that tourism enterprises receive the necessary resources to uphold sustainability.

As an island nation, Madagascar has experienced firsthand the dire consequences of climate change-induced challenges, including a famine in its southern region. Its unique ecosystems and wildlife make the country a compelling attraction. There are also initiatives that contribute to awareness by offering volunteerism-focused trips that support conservation efforts.

Amidst its stunning beaches and reputation as an ecological pioneer, it comes as no surprise that a Californian destination secures a spot on this list. San Diego, situated in the southern part of the state, is leading the way with its Climate Action Plan and burgeoning clean tech job market. The city proudly boasts a zero-waste plan with the ambitious goal of diverting all waste from landfills by 2040. Not only this, but San Diego is on the verge of achieving a remarkable milestone -- becoming entirely powered by renewable energy.

Last year's decline was primarily driven by the energy sector, which saw a reduction of 4.6 million tonnes. Nevertheless, the energy sector remains the largest source of emissions, accounting for 70 percent of total emissions in 2023.

""Last year, changes in the electricity production structure reduced emissions in the energy sector. Coal and peat use decreased, while nuclear and wind power production increased. Hydropower production also rose compared to the previous year,"" Chief Actuary of Statistics Finland Päivi Lindh said.

Until now.

The Verge electric motorcycle is revolutionary - in a couple ways. First, it's electric. Yes, there are other electric motorcycles: Zero, Energica, Ryvid, heck, even Harley-Davidson makes the Livewire and S2 Mulholland. Yet, electricity powering a motorcycle is still new enough and novel enough to warrant attention.

But then consider electric motorcycle maker Verge, from sunny Espoo, Finland. Verge takes the electric motorcycle and turns it, not upside down, but inside out. The heart of its innovation is the electric motor... in the rear wheel. Not really in the rear wheel, it is the rear wheel.

""So all the motorcycles have had, in the last 100 or 120 years, the same architecture, right?"" asked Pekka Parnanen, Verge's chief operating officer. ""You have the motor in the bottom, and then you have the power source, that being gas or batteries, on top.""

The problem with that, Parnanen says, is when it comes to electric motorcycles, if you have the motor in the bottom, you don't have much room for the batteries.

""And you have two heat sources next to each other, and you have less battery, so that affects the range, and all that kind of stuff.""

In such a setup you also need to have liquid cooling and pumps for the liquid and radiators ""and things like that."" Not to mention that the center of gravity would be higher and would affect your low-speed cornering.

""You feel like you might be tipping over.""

So the Verge has its 20.8-kWh of batteries in the lower half of the frame, from about the bottom of what looks like the gas tank, south. That done, they had to figure out the motor. All other electric motorcycles put a motor inside the frame with a traditional chain or shaft drive. But that adds weight, cost, and complexity.

""We needed to figure out, 'Where do we put the motor,' and there's really only one place to put it, it's a back wheel.""

Not in the back wheel like a hub motor, but instead of the back wheel. Look closely, or not even that closely, and you'll notice there are no spokes, no hub, nothing. The back ""wheel"" consists of a flat-cylinder-section-shaped stator wrapped in a slightly larger rotor.

""So the regular electromagnetic motor, if you think about it, the stationary part (the stator) is outside, and then you would have (the rotor) inside that turns. This is reversed. So the stationary part is inside and the rotary part is outside.""

Thus, there's no cooling needed for the motor, no driveshaft, no chain, no room taken up inside the frame. It's all lighter - at a claimed 450 pounds total curb weight - and more efficient.

How efficient? This motor makes 137 hp and 738 lb-ft of torque. That's on the Verge TS Pro I rode and which you see here. A coming model called the Verge TS Ultra makes 201 hp and 885 lb ft of torque.

Sikasiisti! (Finnish for ""Great jumpin' catfish!"")

That power and torque goes directly into the motor to turn the wheel, and the torque can be controlled in milliseconds, Parnanen says.

When you're looking at that much power and torque you cannot really use a hub motor, Parnanen said. Also, a hub motor would be heavier.

""So what we have is a kind of reversed electromagnetic motor.""

You would be the smash hit of The Rock Store, or Newcomb's, or Skyline Blvd., or The Dragon's Den Grill by Tail of the Dragon or wherever bikers gather. Me, I was near the Rock Store in Malibu, so that's where I headed.

My yellow Verge TS Pro started by placing a credit card-sized piece of plastic near the tank-mounted screen and hitting a button. The bike came to life but didn't make any noise. Remember, cooling fans only operate when the bike's battery is plugged in and charging.

Lifting it off its kickstand, it didn't feel too heavy, not like the top-heavy Energica Ego I rode a month or two ago with its batteries up high in the frame and an electric motor down low.

You have a choice of driving modes in the Verge ranging from Zen to Beast. I had it in Zen to start out. The suspension is manually adjustable but requires tools to adjust, and no one had any tools. Mine had been cranked down to what I took to calling the ""harshest ride ever,"" ostensibly because we'd be riding through tight twisites, but it could have been to control the unsprung weight. I'm no suspension engineer. As it was set up, every little tar strip crashed up through the suspension and made the ride semi-brutal. With fully adjustable front and rear suspension this could certainly be addressed.

Also, the handlebars were way too forward, way too wide, and way too high up, possibly to look better in photos. ""Normal"" handlebars would have been better, or even some clip-ons. And the foot pegs were dang-near flimsy - beef those suckers up! But I looked cool. Maybe.

The torque delivery was, indeed, monstrous. Rear tire size on the 240/45ZR17 Pirelli Diablo Rosso II was necessary not only to accommodate the large motor, but to accommodate the huge amount of torque. (Fronts are 120/70ZR17s.)

Zero-to 60 mph comes up in a claimed 3.5 seconds and I believe that stat. To slow down there is regenerative braking and dual discs in front and a single disc clinging to the outside of the wheel/motor in the rear.

Into the tight twisties I turned, ready for Finnish fun.

The bike doesn't feel like a sport bike, though my Finnish riding partner/monitor ""Tomi"" had been leaning the bike far into corners for days, judging by the wear on the outside of the Pirellis. On true sport bikes you instantly feel comfortable leaning into and powering out of corners, they encourage you to push your limits and approach those of the bike. This one, perhaps because of the harsh ride setup and the big, big rear tire, took some getting used to, more than I got used to in the hour or so I had the bike. It felt more like a sport tourer, or even a heavy-ish cruiser in the corners, even though it weighs less than most average motorcycles.

The Energica Ego+ weighs 573 pounds, for instance, but offers ""only"" 171 hp and 164 lb ft. The Harley-Davidson Livewire One is 562 pounds with 100 hp and 86 lb ft (the S2 Mulholland weighs only 432 pounds but has only 84 hp and 194 lb ft of torque). The rear motor never made any noise and never wiggled or wobbled. It stayed firmly in place and made torque, like it's supposed to.

So there were some things I'd change, and certainly could if I could afford the $30,000 starting sticker of the Verge TS Pro. Yet, I still wanted this bike, and not just because it looked cool and was revolutionary. With a range of 217 miles and Level 3 charging capability, it'd be practical. I'd gladly accept a long-termer. Or the 201-hp and 885-lb ft Verge TS Ultra starting at $45,000. Either one's fine. I'm even willing to learn Finnish.",autos.yahoo.com,news,Yahoo Autos,,0.3019607843137255,454792987,1,https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/optgJe_E7RDbYsCtYg9LMQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/autos.autoweek.com/9ccd6979ba25e9adb5e9fa631c7016aa,

These countries -- Armenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Moldova, and Serbia -- find themselves in what we have termed an ""arc of instability"" between Russia and the European Union.

This paper, a collaboration between two scholars from Carnegie Europe and one from Carnegie's Russia Eurasia Center in Berlin, is the first of four looking at the issues facing these in-between states. It examines how Russia seeks to maintain influence and leverage in them, the weaknesses it seeks to exploit, and the changing narratives it uses to win the loyalty of swing voters and deter the West. The three subsequent publications will look in more detail at the situation in Armenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Moldova.

All of these in-between states are outside of the European Union and NATO, but are building stronger ties with the EU: several are prospective members of the union. They also maintain many connections with Russia, and are home to pro-Russian political forces and business interests. Many still buy Russian gas. Armenia is a member of two Russian-led institutions -- the Eurasian Economic Union and (for now, at least) the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) -- but is in the process of reevaluating the utility of membership in these organizations.

Since 2022, the EU and the United States have deployed substantial new political and economic resources to support these in-between states. The EU has relaunched its enlargement process, which had been stalled since 2013, and given candidate status to Moldova, Ukraine, and (more conditionally) Georgia -- something that would have been unthinkable a little more than two years ago. It has set up the European Union Mission in Armenia (EUMA) to monitor the border, the first such mission in a country that is a member of the Russia-led CSTO. Moldova is being weaned off of its dependence on Russian gas.

Still, it would be complacent to assume that the European trajectory of these in-between countries is a given. The enlargement process still has a long way to go before the candidate countries achieve actual membership, leaving skeptical EU governments with many opportunities to exercise vetoes. Public opinion in the in-between countries is growing more pro-European, but societies are still divided. In all these countries, a large section of the population says they want good relations with both Russia and the countries of the European Union. In Serbia, for example, 51 percent of people want to be on good terms with both Russia and the EU (13 percent are pro-Western but want to maintain ties with Moscow, while 38 percent want Russia and the West to be given equal treatment), according to a 2022 poll by the International Republican Institute (IRI).

What path these countries take will be largely determined by developments beyond their control -- in particular, the course of the war in Ukraine and complex intra-EU discussions about the future of the European project. If Russia is even partly successful in its war of aggression in Ukraine, destabilization or military action against its other neighbors cannot be ruled out. Conversely, Ukrainian military success against Russia and an accelerated path toward EU accession for Ukraine increases the European prospects of other states.

Geography matters. The states of the Western Balkans are surrounded by EU countries, which necessarily limits Russia's political ambitions there -- even as disillusionment with the EU over the slow pace of enlargement gives Russia leverage. The same cannot be said for Moldova, less still for Georgia and Armenia. Georgia's border with Russia and three-decade-long conflicts over Abkhazia and South Ossetia, recognized as independent by Moscow in 2008, make it vulnerable to any shifts in Russia's war with Ukraine. It is likely this sense of vulnerability that drives the Georgian Dream government's soft rapprochement with Russia on many issues since 2022.

When it comes to Armenia and Moldova, geography is nothing less than critical. There are many similarities in their political profiles: both countries are small and poor by European standards, and both currently have pro-European governments and large societal constituencies that are still close to Russia. Armenia, however, is far from the EU, sandwiched between Azerbaijan, Georgia, Iran, and Türkiye (and has no diplomatic relations with Azerbaijan and Türkiye). Russia is still by default its main security and energy provider -- a dependence that the Armenian government is signaling it wants to begin to break. Moldova's two neighbors, by contrast, are Romania -- a friendly EU country -- and Ukraine, a fellow candidate for joining the union. The support of both neighbors has allowed Moldova to make the EU rather than Russia its main gas supplier since 2022, and to begin accession negotiations with Brussels without suffering (so far) a major backlash from Russia.

Workers from both Armenia and Moldova go abroad to seek employment and send home remittances. Again, there is a sharp contrast in their choices. Moldovan passport holders (including in the breakaway territory of Transnistria) enjoy visa-free travel to the EU, and many Moldovans now have Romanian passports as well, meaning that they can find employment in Europe, which in turn exacerbates the country's brain drain. By contrast, as many as 300,000 Armenians still work in Russia, although many have returned home since 2022.

In addition to the war in Ukraine, for which 2024 will be a critical year, the medium-term future of Armenia, Georgia, and Moldova will be determined by three other geopolitical factors in which the EU and Russia will play a role: the countries' domestic security concerns,the choices and decisions made by political leaders, and how successfully and rapidly the EU's revamped enlargement policy proceeds.

The most public manifestation of the confrontation between Russia and the West in the in-between countries is in the realm of ideas. Since 2022, Moscow has changed its messaging. Today's weakened Russia puts less emphasis on its role as security patron and energy provider and more on an ideological message: that it provides an alternative pole to the West and in particular to the ""global hegemon"" of the United States, which is portrayed as the puppet master of unwilling European countries.

To that end, Russian President Vladimir Putin has appropriated Western vocabulary about ""values,"" ""choice,"" and especially ""sovereignty"" to boost Russia's alternative vision. In a speech to the World Russian People's Council on November 28, 2023, Putin said:

We are now fighting not just for Russia's freedom, but for the freedom of the whole world. We can frankly say that the dictatorship of one hegemon is becoming decrepit. We see it, and everyone sees it now. It is getting out of control and is simply dangerous for others. This is now clear to the global majority. But again, it is our country that is now at the forefront of building a fairer world order. And I would like to stress this: without a sovereign and strong Russia, no lasting and stable international system is possible.

In the fight for the hearts and minds of people in Eastern Europe, the Russian leadership rarely claims that it is more prosperous than the West. Rather, it concentrates on criticizing two key aspects of the West. The first is Western countries' alleged double standards and inability to live up to their lofty rhetoric; the second is their moral decadence.

A stress on ""traditional values"" and on gender and LGBTQ issues in particular is designed to enlist the support of conservative constituencies in Eastern Europe for Russia. The traditionalist agenda requires zero effort from its supporters, but allows them to consider themselves morally superior simply because they do not belong to the LGBTQ community.

The Russian Orthodox Church (ROC), which has strongly supported Russia's war in Ukraine, is a key ally in propagating this message. Several Orthodox churches in Eastern Europe are either directly affiliated with or have close relations with the ROC, allowing Moscow to bypass governments and local media to spread a pro-Russia message in hundreds of parishes.

In Moldova, for example, despite the government's pro-Western stance, around 90 percent of Orthodox believers belong to the Moldovan Orthodox Church, which is in communion with the ROC. Even though dozens of priests have switched their allegiance since 2022 to the Romanian-language Metropolis of Bessarabia, which is part of the Romanian Orthodox Church, the Moldovan Orthodox Church leadership has been equivocal about the war in Ukraine and many of its leading priests are strongly pro-Russian.

The Georgian Orthodox Church is also closer to Russia than much of the general public and has taken a relatively soft position on the war, trying to maintain relations with both the Moscow Patriarchate and the Ecumenical Patriarch in Istanbul. By contrast, Armenia's national church, the Armenian Apostolic Church, is an Oriental Orthodox Church not affiliated with either the Russian or Ukrainian churches. It shares an agenda of ""traditional values,"" but not Russia's geopolitical agenda regarding Ukraine.

Russia and the EU are courting both core constituencies in the in-between states and those who might be called swing voters: the many people who are not firmly committed to either a Western or an Eastern trajectory for their country. In all these countries, the political situation is highly volatile. Moscow clearly believes that even in countries that have made a formal commitment to EU membership, the game is not lost.

This means that Russia will work hard to support political forces with a pro-Moscow orientation in elections, such as the upcoming presidential and parliamentary votes in Moldova. Despite the official ban on Russian state media broadcasting there, Moscow still manages to reach a wide audience by using the local networks of the pro-Russian Gagauzia autonomous region, as well as social media. In its propaganda, the Kremlin portrays Moldova's integration with the EU as a smokescreen for the country's absorption by Romania and promotes anti-LGBTQ narratives presented as ""traditional values."" The latter resonate with the public especially well because they are supported by the Moldovan Orthodox Church and pander to deep-seated prejudices in Moldovan society: in opinion polls, over 70 percent of Moldovans say they would not accept an LGBTQ person as their neighbor.

In Serbia, a hybrid authoritarian-democratic government professes that EU membership is its strategic goal but declines to align with Western sanctions against Russia. It still courts Russian diplomatic support in fighting Kosovo's independence while routinely voting against Moscow at the UN General Assembly. A similar situation is unfolding in Georgia, where the ruling Georgian Dream party has formally promoted EU accession while expanding various forms of cooperation with Russia. In the weak democracies of Moldova and Armenia, pro-European governing parties contend with opposition parties that want to tilt the country back toward Russia.

In Bosnia and Herzegovina, the geopolitical orientation division runs along ethnic lines. Bosnian Serb leader of the Republika Srpska (RS) province Milorad Dodik's policies vis-à-vis Russia -- such as refusing to join in sanctioning Russia and maintaining close relations with the country -- enjoy support among his constituents. According to an IRI survey from 2022, 89 percent of Serbs in Bosnia have a favorable view of Russia, compared to only 27 percent of Bosniaks (Bosnian Muslims) and 39 percent of Bosnian Croats. According to a National Democratic Institute poll from 2021, 82 percent of Bosnian Serbs (mostly living in Serb-dominated RS) are against NATO membership, while 90 percent of Bosniaks and 92 percent of Bosnian Croats are in favor.

Public opinion in Moldova lags far behind the pace of international developments. According to a 2023 IRI poll, over half of Moldovans (52 percent) still believe Russia to be Moldova's most important economic partner. In a question on this issue, for which respondents could choose more than one answer, the EU got only slightly more: 68 percent. In reality, the EU overtook Russia in Moldova's foreign trade over two decades ago, and now trades over five times more with the country than Russia does.

This reality has prevented a major realignment in the country's domestic politics. Even though pro-EU President Maia Sandu is the most popular and most trusted politician in Moldova by a wide margin, with a positive rating of over 40 percent among decided voters, populist pro-Russian parties still fare quite well, with their combined support hovering around 40 percent.

In Armenia, meanwhile, public opinion has turned away from Russia -- the country's traditional main ally -- following Moscow's failure to act during Azerbaijan's seizure of the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh from Armenia last fall. In an IRI opinion poll conducted in December 2023, when asked for their assessment of international partners, 89 percent of Armenians named the country's relationship with the United States as ""good"" or ""very good,"" and 87 percent said the same of the European Union. In contrast, only 31 percent had the same opinion of relations with Moscow, while 66 percent said the relationship with Russia was ""bad."" This marks a calamitous decline from October 2019, when 93 percent of respondents said the relationship with Russia was ""good"" and just 6 percent said it was ""bad.""

Still, 48 percent of Armenians said that Russia was the country's most important economic partner (it is indeed its biggest trading partner), and 31 percent said it was the country's most important security partner: a higher figure than for the EU, but lower than for the United States. In other words, Russia remains for many a patron of convenience and necessity, if not necessarily of choice.

In this context, it is important for Russia to broadcast the message that the West and Ukraine will not prevail in the war -- and that nonaligned European countries should be careful about investing fully in alliances with the EU and NATO.

Since 2022, the consensus among political elites and experts in the West has been that Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine has strengthened Western solidarity and the two main Western alliances, the EU and NATO. The proof of this is the unanimous adoption and renewal of EU sanctions packages against Russia and the fact that EU enlargement has been relaunched -- something that was a very distant prospect prior to 2022. The Western narrative also holds that NATO has become more powerful after two previously neutral countries, Finland and Sweden, joined the alliance.

The Russian narrative is that this is an illusion. NATO is painted as an American hegemonic project imposed on unwilling Europeans, while the EU, also under American influence, allegedly works against the interests of its own population by opposing Russia. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has described U.S.-EU relations as ""the relationship of a suzerain and his vassals.""

The Kremlin constantly points to any evidence of cracks in the two Western alliances as evidence that the in-between countries should be careful about joining them. Hungary and Slovakia, for example, are portrayed as harbingers of change in the EU. In his December press conference, Putin praised Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán for his stand against other EU leaders over Ukraine, along with the recently elected prime minister of Slovakia, the populist Euroskeptic Robert Fico. These two leaders, Putin said, ""are defending their countries' interests. But there are too few politicians like this; I do not know why they do not exist. Maybe this has to do with Europe's excessive dependence on the Big Brother -- the United States.""

Russian officials frequently forecast disaster for the European Union. In December 2023, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov predicted that ""the EU will collapse"" under the burden of Ukraine's accession. Mikhail Sheremet, a parliamentarian from annexed Crimea, said that EU sanctions against Russia would destroy Europeans' prosperity and eventually the union itself. He said: ""With each package of sanctions, the leaders of European countries not only lose face and respect in front of the international community, but elicit annoyance and growing discontent in their own countries, leading the EU to its death.""

In the Western Balkans, a Euroskeptic message will always find its target. Russia tells these countries that they should be allowed to freely choose their international alignments (in contrast to Ukraine, which, according to Moscow, has no such choice). Russia accuses the EU and NATO of using empty promises of Euro-Atlantic integration to subdue the region's Orthodox nations and settle Balkan conflicts at their expense. The EU, Moscow insists, will make Serbia recognize Kosovo without granting any reciprocal concessions, and will turn North Macedonia into a semi-Albanian state. NATO membership is said to be wrong for Bosnia and Herzegovina as it will jeopardize peace. The EU is portrayed as weak and insincere in its promise to accept the Western Balkans into its ranks. And even if they were to join, Russia says the countries would be treated unfairly.

In May 2022, for example, Russia's ambassador to Sarajevo, Igor Kalabukhov, argued in a piece for Glas Srpske, an RS-published daily, that Bosnia and Herzegovina's membership in the ""institutionally and morally"" decadent EU would bring it no benefits and entail the loss of its sovereignty. His colleague Alexander Botsan-Kharchenko, ambassador to Serbia, accused EU and U.S. mediators between Prishtina and Belgrade of a lack of fairness. He also condemned Western pressure on Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić. Most recently, Russia accused the West of destabilizing Serbia by inciting the protests that followed the country's controversial December 17 parliamentary elections.

The region's security architecture (or lack thereof) is still shaped by the legacy of the 1990s wars in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, and Kosovo. Almost all of the Balkan countries have now joined NATO, with the significant exceptions of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, and Serbia. In Serbia, the memory of NATO's bombardment of Belgrade and other towns in 1999 and its role in facilitating Kosovo's independence also prevent the country from joining NATO, even though Belgrade has engaged in security cooperation with the United States.

The same legacy also fuels continuing pro-Russian sentiment among the Bosnian Serbs. Thanks to the ethno-federal structure sanctioned by the Dayton Accords that ended the Bosnian War, Bosnia and Herzegovina is one of the countries where Russian influence is at its strongest in the region. The leadership in RS -- the Serb-majority entity that, alongside the Bosniak- and Croat-dominated Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBiH), makes up the country -- makes no secret of its close links to the Kremlin. Bosnia and Herzegovina has had a NATO membership action plan since 2018 but will struggle to join the alliance, as it could reignite the conflict with RS. The commitment to speeding up integration into NATO was dropped from the agenda of Bosnia and Herzegovina's state-level cabinet, which includes Dodik's Alliance of Independent Social Democrats, the principal Serbian party.

With RS holding wide-ranging powers within the loose federation (powers that are constantly expanding, thanks to Dodik's brinkmanship), the entity can act as a quasi-state, pursuing its own external policies. In September 2022, Dodik met Putin in Moscow ahead of the Bosnian elections. Because of the RS veto, Bosnia and Herzegovina has not joined Western sanctions against Russia in response to the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. In addition, RS and its representatives can block decisions in central institutions such as the cabinet and the federal parliament.

Internally, Dodik has been playing an increasingly disruptive role. He has upgraded the RS police force with weaponry supplied by Russia, raising fears that an RS force separate from Bosnia and Herzegovina's integrated army could reconstitute itself. Dodik has repeatedly threatened to withdraw RS from state-level institutions, including the judiciary, the tax authority, and the military. Russia typically backs Dodik through the Peace Implementation Council. In addition, Russia has called for the abolition of the Office of the High Representative (OHR), which has historically contained Serbs' secessionist ambitions, notably through the so-called Bonn powers that allow the head of the OHR (who comes from an EU member state) to sack officials and impose legislation. Dodik has furthermore openly defied decisions by OHR head Christian Schmidt, and is now a defendant in a trial that he has dismissed as a political witch hunt. Although Russia is a key ally in these domestic squabbles, the Serb leader has other patrons, too -- notably Hungary, which has vetoed the imposition of EU sanctions.

Despite all this, the European Union maintains a gravitational pull. In December 2023, the European Council reconfirmed its commitment to authorize membership talks with Sarajevo, should certain conditions be met. Russia, however, is exploiting cynicism about the EU and resentment against the West (chiefly the United States) by focusing on the bitter legacy of the 1990s, on alleged Western double standards, and on the extremely slow pace of EU enlargement.

There are plenty of local grievances and conflicts to exploit. In 2018-2019, pro-Russian actors took key part in the demonstrations against the Prespa Agreement that resolved the decades-old name dispute between (North) Macedonia and Greece. In Serbia, the main anti-Western argument upon which Russia relies is the West's sponsorship of Kosovo's independence. The message is that the West works against national sovereignty. The Kosovo leadership, including Prime Minister Albin Kurti and President Vjosa Osmani, has repeatedly accused Russia of fomenting tension in the Serb-populated north, which has seen an uptick of violence over the past year. Following the shoot-out between Serb militants and the Kosovar police at the Banjska Monastery in September 2023, authorities in Prishtina said they were investigating a possible Russian connection.

Moscow's agenda is aimed at obstructing EU and U.S. efforts to integrate the region into the West, not at establishing Russia as a political, diplomatic, and economic hegemon, a feat that even the Soviet Union failed to accomplish in the early Cold War period. Russia therefore acts as a spoiler, seeing the Western Balkans as yet another arena in the competition with the United States and its allies.

Moldova is constitutionally neutral with no commitment to join NATO, unlike its two neighbors, NATO member Romania and aspirant NATO candidate Ukraine. Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, however, Moldova has found itself in a completely new international and security environment. Moscow's indiscriminate use of force just across the border and public statements that it intended to conquer vast territories -- and potentially attack Moldova as well -- changed the mood overnight.

The West's renewed interest in the region and the EU's eagerness to overcome its enlargement fatigue worked to the advantage of Moldova's governing party, the pro-European Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS). In less than two years, Moldova -- together with Ukraine -- managed to acquire EU candidate status and start formal talks on accession. These are achievements that in prewar times would likely have taken decades to complete at best. Moldova has also intensified its security cooperation with NATO, breaking a long-standing taboo based on fear of a Russian backlash.

Opinion polls suggest that the Moldovan public lags behind the government in perspectives on the war next door.Two years after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, as many as 30 percent of Moldovans said that Russia posed no threat to their country. Even many of those who opposed the Kremlin's intervention are in favor of accommodating Russia. In terms of national security, 58 percent of Moldovans believe that neutrality still offers the best protection for the country, while support for NATO accession has increased only marginally to 30 percent up from 20-25 percent in the prewar years. Support for EU membership is much stronger at around 60 percent, though the fear of provoking Russia is also tangible, with only 19 percent favoring the idea of quitting the Commonwealth of Independent States (the organization of former Soviet countries).

Even though the war has come dangerously close to Moldova's borders, so far it has failed to bring security issues to the forefront of public attention. In an August 2023 IRI poll, only 5 percent of Moldovans named war and conflict among their key concerns. The leading concerns were high prices (43 percent), corruption (27 percent), and low incomes (24 percent). Frustrated and disoriented by the socioeconomic difficulties exacerbated by the war, Moldovans are looking for easy explanations and solutions. According to a WatchDog.MD poll done in February 2023, over 40 percent of Moldovans deemed Russia a fascist state, while over 30 percent considered Ukraine to be run by fascists. Only around one third declared their readiness to defend their country in the event of a Russian invasion, and upward of 67 percent believed that President Maia Sandu should go to Moscow to negotiate a new gas contract. These findings suggest that economic problems largely eclipse security concerns for the majority of Moldovan society.

Russia is eager to take advantage of this confusion, and the war has made Moscow even less scrupulous in its methods. Over the past two years, the United States and EU have sanctioned a number of Russia-linked individuals for attempts to undermine Moldova's sovereignty, while Chisinau has expelled dozens of Russian diplomats for hostile actions. There is ample evidence that Moscow and its local proxies, led by the fugitive oligarch Ilan Shor, have been buying votes, staging anti-government protests, running disinformation campaigns, and spawning a plethora of new political parties to promote a pro-Russian agenda and sow confusion in the run-up to the autumn presidential election. Moscow views the upcoming vote as an opportunity to thwart Moldova's EU ambitions and bring pro-Russian forces back to power. The latter, despite being mired in numerous corruption scandals, still enjoy high support in Moldovan society, deftly capitalizing on socioeconomic difficulties.

Outside Ukraine itself, the most dramatic change in posture toward Russia in a post-Soviet country since 2022 has been in Armenia. For the past thirty years, Armenia's security concerns have centered on Azerbaijan and the future of the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh and its Armenian population. A military alliance with Russia first struck in 1996 and then renewed and extended in 2010 was seen as the best guarantee of Armenia's security and also of the status quo around Karabakh, which had been in Armenia's favor since the ceasefire of 1994.

Azerbaijan's victorious military campaign of 2020, followed by the war in Ukraine, put a strain on the Armenian-Russian alliance. Following an Azerbaijani military incursion into Armenian territory in September 2022, Armenia tried to trigger the security provisions of the Russia-led CSTO. Neither Russia, which also has a strong relationship with Azerbaijan, nor any other CSTO members came to Armenia's aid. Since then, Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan has publicly questioned the utility of Armenia's CSTO membership, and his officials have stopped attending CSTO meetings.

Anti-Russian sentiment in Armenia deepened further after Russian peacekeepers in Nagorno-Karabakh stood aside and allowed Azerbaijani forces to take the disputed region by force in its entirety in September 2023. Despite a forced exodus of the local Armenian population, Moscow did not criticize Azerbaijan for the takeover of Karabakh and instead lashed out at Pashinyan's government.

This is the context in which Armenian-Russian relations have soured rapidly and the Pashinyan government is looking to the West. Armenia is now turning to other partners beyond Russia to ensure its security. This means procuring weapons from France and India; accepting the EU civilian border-monitoring mission, EUMA, in southern Armenia against the objections of Azerbaijan; and hosting a (largely symbolic) U.S. military training exercise in September 2023. At the same time, Armenia seeks to strengthen its relationship with Georgia as a way of getting closer to the EU and increasing trade via the Black Sea with EU countries.

The EU can lay claim to being one of the most successful economic projects in history. Almost all countries that have joined it have become more prosperous, and this economic pull continues to attract neighboring states to aspire to join the union. This leaves Russia at a disadvantage and means that its pitch to its neighbors does not focus primarily on money. Russian foreign direct investment in all of these countries is minimal compared to the sums the EU and other countries such as China and Türkiye spend on major industrial and infrastructure projects.

Moscow's strategy is a different one. Having learned from the failure of Soviet propaganda, modern-day Russia rarely challenges the fact that people in the West enjoy higher living standards. It does, however, successfully cast doubt on the West's ability to extend its own prosperity to the societies of Eastern Europe. Russia revels in showcasing discrepancies between generous Western promises and the gloomy realities of Eastern Europe. These exposures are usually followed by offers of a bird in the hand instead of two in the bush.

Putin's own rhetoric about the impact of the Moldova-EU Association Agreement is a case in point. According to the Russian leader, ""Moldovan goods have almost lost their traditional place in Russia and have not gained a foothold in other markets."" Putin's claim that the deal has led to a decrease in bilateral trade between Moldova and the EU was false, but it helps illustrate the way Moscow frames its message to neighboring countries: the benefits of cooperation with Russia may appear more basic, but they are easier to grasp. Be it Moldova's fruit, Armenia's cognac, or Georgia's tourism industry,Russia's neighbors would do better to stick with less affluent but less choosy Russian customers, because they have no chance of succeeding in the EU. Essentially, Moscow tries to persuade the societies of Eastern Europe that they are not good enough to achieve affluence in the Western system.

Discounted gas has long been an instrument Russia has used to wield influence. As of 2021, Moldova was 100 percent reliant on Russian gas. The country suffered an energy crisis in 2022 after Russia drastically cut supplies and Ukraine also reduced its exports of electricity. Today Moldova has fully weaned itself off of Russian gas and is increasing electricity imports from its European neighbors to the west.

In December 2023, Putin openly lobbied Moldovans, claiming that their choice to receive gas from the West was political and would hurt consumers. He said:

Moldova is one of Europe's poorest countries. Only recently, it was the poorest of them all. Today, Ukraine holds this title. But if one of Europe's poorest countries, which has been buying our energy resources at a price that was quite low, wants to follow in Germany's footsteps, go ahead. Today, Germany buys its energy resources from the United States and pays 30 percent more compared to what it imported from the Russian Federation. So, if they have some extra money to spend over in Moldova, let them go down this road.

The same message is being sent to Armenia, which currently pays Russia $165 per thousand cubic meters of gas, well below the market price in Europe.

A paradox of the Ukraine war is that even as Armenia's political and security relationship with Russia has deteriorated sharply, Armenia's economy has benefited from an influx of Russian migrants and Russia's need for trading partners. In 2023, Armenia-Russia trade volumes were worth more than $7.3 billion: a record number.

Russia uses sticks as well as carrots. In late 2023, Russia banned imports of agricultural produce from both Armenia and Moldova, supposedly on sanitary grounds. Farmers in both countries are heavily reliant on the Russian market. This followed a suspension of Armenian dairy exports in March 2023. Restrictions on the border crossing at Upper Lars in Georgia in the Caucasus mountains also hurt Armenian businesses that are reliant on this route to trade with Russia.

Russia has many opportunities to apply economic pressure tactics against Moldova and Armenia, just as it has done against Georgia in the past. However, the Kremlin must balance risky tactics such as cutting off gas exports or banning agricultural goods against the prospect that this will alienate the public in those countries and encourage their leaders to diversify their economies.

In 2006, Georgia and Moldova responded to a protracted Russian ban on wine exports by fundamentally restructuring and modernizing their wine industries. Even though Georgian wine eventually returned to the Russian market in 2013, it also expanded its inroads into other markets around the world, from China to Western Europe. While Russia is now once again the main export destination for Georgian wine, the country's ambitions would have been far narrower if Russia had not forced the issue.

Moldova is also diversifying its export markets. The EU overtook Russia as the country's leading export destination back in 2014, and that margin has gradually increased ever since. The war and the ensuing collapse of traditional transport routes dealt a final blow to Russia's status as a major market for Moldovan goods. In 2021-2023 export volumes halved, decreasing Russia's share in Moldova's exports to a negligible 3.5 percent. If sanctions against Russia are tightened or trade routes via Georgia shut down, Armenia may be forced to do the same and support for Russia among Armenia's traditionally Russian-oriented business community could fall.

Russia's ill-fated invasion of Ukraine has dealt a severe blow to its ability to project military and economic power in its neighborhood. A number of countries that are not members of either the EU or NATO, and that in the prewar years looked set to remain forever in a gray zone between Russia and the West, have suddenly found themselves much better positioned to make progress on the path of Euro-Atlantic integration and strengthen cooperation with both the EU and the United States. Many impediments remain, however, not least the unanimity principle in EU decisionmaking, which can still slow down or halt the accession prospects of candidate countries. In a country such as Armenia, whose government aspires to closer alignment with the West, European states face a more immediate problem: how to assist a government that is heavily reliant on Russian gas and wheat and that -- as a member of the Eurasian Economic Union -- is disqualified from pursuing a free trade agreement with the EU.

Moreover, even though pro-European sentiment has grown, societies in countries such as Armenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Moldova are divided, and opinion polls suggest there are many ""swing voters"" who are receptive to the messages of both Russia and the West.

The Kremlin's appeal has never been limited to solely financial or military issues. Its ever- deepening confrontation with the West has pushed Moscow into creating more sophisticated and comprehensive messaging in its attempt to present its vision as a viable alternative to a Western-led international order. Russia is good at taking advantage of local conflicts, capitalizing on preexisting tensions, and recruiting the support of disgruntled segments of society.

Negative messaging about the West gets an especially sympathetic hearing in those segments, especially among Orthodox Christian believers, who regard themselves as adherents of ""traditional values"" and are skeptical of the liberal values promoted in Western countries. Russia also appeals to the economically disadvantaged, such as rural farmers and migrant workers who do not see immediate obvious economic benefits of European integration and are more used to selling their products to Russia than to EU countries or working there.

In three forthcoming papers, Carnegie scholars will map out the more specific and differing challenges facing Armenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Moldova as they navigate relations with both Russia and the West. Despite their many differences, these three countries share a predicament in that their medium-term futures are highly dependent on the course of the war in Ukraine. In all these countries Moscow continues to send the message that its historic interest there is deep and long-term, and that the West can be an unreliable partner.",carnegieendowment.org,news,Carnegie Endowment for International Peace,,0.04313725490196085,454791071,5,https://carnegie-production-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/media/images/serbia-putin-new.jpg,eng-9612340

A new protein called spleen is generated from tiny single-celled organisms. In contrast to conventional yeast, which uses sugar as a feedstock, Solein uses plentiful but underutilized gases, namely carbon dioxide and hydrogen.

""Solein represents the seamless integration of nature's ancient processes with the pinnacle of modern technology,"" says Susanna Mäkinen, head of biology at Solar Foods. This innovative approach may significantly lessen the demand for livestock farming, a substantial source of greenhouse gas emissions.

Solar Foods opened the first production plant for Solein, Factory 01, in April in Vantaa, Finland.

Hydrogen-oxidizing bacteria (HOB), which feed on components found in the air, are cultivated and dried to make solein. According to researchers, humans have a long history of utilizing bacteria for fermentation, which led to the creation of wine, yogurt, and leavened bread -- early examples of biotechnology.

These microbial uses were vital to early civilizations and their nomadic ancestors, offering longer shelf lives, safer eating, and essential nutrients. According to researchers, as nature's perfect manufacturer, HOB transforms gaseous materials into protein that sustains life.

HOBs employed in Solein use chemosynthesis, deriving growth energy from chemical reactions instead of light, as in photosynthesis. Specifically, these bacteria oxidize hydrogen, utilizing the energy released to fix carbon dioxide and convert it into organic molecules like proteins.

In the growing market for alternative proteins, Solein is distinct. Unlike other microbial proteins derived from plants, animals, or fungi, Solein does not require significant resources such as sugar or other solid feedstocks. Solar Foods' manufacturing process uses electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen, then combines these gases with CO2 to create microbial protein, significantly reducing environmental impact.

Solein's reduced reliance on resources distinguishes it from conventional farming methods. Standard plant-based protein sources need a lot of space, water, fertilizers, and infrastructure for farming. On the other hand, Solein is grown in bioreactors with carefully regulated growth conditions, including temperature, pH, and gas concentrations.

One kilogram of Solein, according to Solar Foods, requires only 1% of the water and 5% of the arable land needed to produce a similar quantity of plant protein, emitting only 5% of carbon dioxide during production.

The degree of modularity may vary between designs, and it may have a better possibility to integrate additional modularity in the early stages of design.

The global small modular reactor market size is estimated to be USD 5.8 billion in 2023 and is projected to reach USD 6.8 billion by 2030, at a CAGR of 2.3% during the forecast period. Factors such as the versatile nature of nuclear power and the relative advantages of SMRs such as modularization and factory construction are enabling the growth of the market.

""Small modular reactors (SMRS) are defined as nuclear reactors generally 300 MWe equivalent or less, designed with modular technology using module factory fabrication, pursuing economies of series production and short construction times,"" according to the World Nuclear Association. The ability of SMRS to meet the requirements of flexible power generation for a wide range of applications, such as power generation, process heating, desalination, hydrogen production, industrial applications, and replacing ageing fossil fuel fired power plants, has increased demand for them.

In 2022, the Asia Pacific dominated the global small modular reactor market, followed by Europe and Americas. The region, by country, has been segmented into the China, Japan, India, South Korea, and the Rest of Asia Pacific. Due to the enormous number of SMR projects in China, Asia Pacific is a big contributor to the small modular reactor industry in the current environment. SMRs have the potential to replace coal- and other fossil-fuel-fired power stations in the region for power production and process heat applications, which will likely promote the expansion of the regional small modular reactor market.

The upto 100 MW segment by power rating is expected to be the third-largest growing segment of the small modular reactor market. The reactor unit can be built in a factory and delivered to the site of installation. Because of the modular construction, many SMR units can be deployed together to satisfy varied energy demands. A 100 MW SMR's major use is electricity generating. It may function as a stand-alone power plant, supplying clean and dependable electricity to cities, industries, and isolated regions. The excess heat generated by a 100 MW SMR can be used for district heating, which involves distributing thermal energy to surrounding residential, commercial, and institutional buildings for space heating and water heating.

The gases segment by coolant is projected to be the fastest growing segment of the small modular reactor market. During operation, the gas-cooled reactor uses helium as a coolant medium, allowing it to be easily pressurized and maintain a stable high temperature, allowing for greater operational efficiency. Using gas as a medium in the reactor can prevent corrosion on the reactor's surfaces, reducing the need for maintenance. These operational advantages are propelling the gases segment forward. Graphite is used as a neutron moderator in gas-cooled reactors, and carbon dioxide gas is used as a coolant.

The light-water reactors segment by type is projected to be the fastest growing segment of the small modular reactor market. In 2022, the light water reactor category accounted for 40.6% of the small modular reactor market. These reactors, which use common water as a coolant, are the most widely used since they pose the fewest technological dangers. SMR designs based on LWR technology are similar to large-scale LWRs in use today. Such SMRS employ well-tested technologies and products with small and integrated components and higher passive safety measures over current big scale LWRS. Light-water SMRS have a better level of technological readiness than other SMB designs. Because traditional LWR technology is well-developed, these reactors provide fewer hurdles to present licencing processes. Most regulators are familiar with the technology, resulting in a relatively short learning curve for both regulatory bodies and designers in light water reactors. In the case of a Pressurised Water Reactor (PWR), this is done after the safety rods have been lowered and unlatched.

The hydrogen generation segment by application is projected to be the forth-largest growing segment of the small modular reactor market. Hydrogen is essential in a variety of industrial applications. It can help with the decarbonization of electricity and transportation by being used for energy storage or as a fuel for hydrogen fuel-cell cars, trains, ships, and aeroplanes. Hydrogen can be produced using the fast neutron reactor, molten salt reactor, and high-temperature reactor technologies. The type of reactor technology influences the choice of hydrogen technologies to be combined with the SMRS. Only electricity is required for a few hydrogen manufacturing systems, such as traditional electrolysis. In contrast, methods such as thermochemical cycles may just require process heat, whereas hybrid technologies, such as high-temperature steam electrolysis (HTSE) and hybrid thermochemical cycles, require both heat and electricity.

Europe is expected to grow at the second-highest CAGR during the forecast period. Russia, the United Kingdom, France, and the rest of Europe are all considered in the European small modular reactor market. Italy, Luxembourg, Denmark, the Czech Republic, Sweden, Ukraine, Finland, Estonia, Poland, and Romania are included in the rest of Europe. Nuclear energy accounts for around 28.4% of the region's electricity generation mix, according to the BP Statistical Review of World Energy 2022. The region was responsible for 30.2% of global nuclear power usage. Investments in SMRS development, as well as a trend towards the usage of clean energy to address climate change, are expanding the potential for SMRS deployment in this region. For instance, the government dedicated USD 298 million to SMRS in 2021 as part of the UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) Low-Cost Nuclear (LCN) programme in November 2020. UKRI offered an initial match financing of USD 23 million to the UK SMR consortium lead by Rolls-Royce in November 2019 for the development of a conceptual SMR design. Rosatom (Russia) announced intentions to invest USD 7 billion in new nuclear technology by 2030 in June 2021.

According to preliminary data from Statistics Finland, total emissions, excluding the land use sector, were 40.6 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent, 5.1 million tonnes less than the previous year. Greenhouse gas emissions in 2023 decreased by 43 percent as compared to 1990.

Last year's decline was primarily driven by the energy sector, which saw a reduction of 4.6 million tonnes. Nevertheless, the energy sector remains the largest source of emissions, accounting for 70 percent of total emissions in 2023.

Statistics Finland Chief Actuary Paivi Lindh stated, ""Last year, changes in the electricity production structure reduced emissions in the energy sector. Coal and peat use decreased, while nuclear and wind power production increased. Hydropower production also rose compared to the previous year.""

At the same time, reduced logging has reduced carbon emissions from the land use sector. Logging volumes dropped by about 9 percent, turning the sector from a net emission source to a carbon sink, analysts explained.

According to the Finnish Climate Change Act, Finland's net emissions should be zero or negative by 2035. By 2030, emissions must be reduced by 60 percent, compared to 1990. ■",english.news.cn,news,english.news.cn,,0.1058823529411765,454782794,13,,eng-9607137

Brookfield is offering €39.85 ($59.07) per share to buy 53.32 per cent of Neoen from current owners that include billionaire Jacques Veyrat's Impala SAS, the Fonds Stratégique de Participations (FSP), and an investment vehicle owned by Noeen chairman and CEO Xavier Barbaro. Funding for the bid will be led by the Toronto-based asset manager's subsidiary, Brookfield Renewable, as well as institutional co-investors such as state-owned Singaporean fund Temasek Holdings Ltd.

The offer price promises a 26.9-per-cent premium over Neoen's last closing price, according to an announcement Brookfield made early on Thursday.

The deal requires consultation with bodies that represent employees and approvals from regulators, which Brookfield expects it could obtain by the fourth quarter this year. Assuming it is successful, Brookfield would then make an all-cash tender offer to buy all the remaining shares and convertible bonds in Neoen to take the company private, likely in the first quarter of 2025.

The bid for Neoen, which would be one of the largest take-private deals in Europe so far this year, signals an ambitious plan that would extend Brookfield's reach in Europe and Australia, where it currently has a comparatively smaller presence, and help it meet rising demand from large corporations for renewable energy. Paris-based Neoen, which was founded in 2008 and went public in 2018, has more than eight gigawatts of renewable power capacity that is operating or under construction, including France's largest solar farm, Finland's largest wind farm and two major energy storage plants in Australia.

""Acquiring Neoen further strengthens Brookfield's global scale, while diversifying into key renewables markets and adding expertise in battery storage technology,"" Connor Teskey, chief executive officer of renewable power and transition at Brookfield Asset Management, said in a statement.

Brookfield plans to pay the largest share of the acquisition price through its latest flagship renewables fund, the Brookfield Global Transition Fund II, which is led by Mr. Teskey and Brookfield chair Mark Carney, the former central banker. By February, the fund had raised an initial US$10-billion and is expected to be meaningfully larger than the first Brookfield transition fund, which raised US$15-billion.

Brookfield Renewable, which is the largest investor in BGTF II, plans to invest as much as €500-million ($741-million) in the acquisition.

""Our Board of Directors fully welcomes the transaction,"" Mr. Barbaro said in a statement.

Neoen's board hired French financial advisory firm Finexsi as an independent expert to assess the deal.

Brookfield has been pouring billions of dollars of investment into renewable energy and is making a major bet on corporate demand to run expanding networks of power-hungry data centres that will form the backbone of artificial intelligence and cloud computing technologies. Early this month, Brookfield announced an agreement with Microsoft Corp. to develop renewable power capacity in the United States and Europe, equivalent to the electricity needed to run about 1.8 million homes, by 2030.

Brookfield manages US$929-billion of assets, including US$102-billion through its renewables arm, which operates about 33 gigawatts of current energy capacity and expects to develop another 157 gigawatts through its investments.",theglobeandmail.com,news,The Globe and Mail,,0.5058823529411764,454780385,1,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/resizer/v2/RTHZUAHBP5HDXFNJOJHCFZ4NWE.JPG?auth=647f7ca11c2980e0358e1344bbff8e14f018e2bc5b991e209d2bdfb970d85e62&width=560&quality=80,eng-9609973

After months of planning, you've just arrived at your luxurious hotel in a scenic European destination. It's all you've hoped for -- a beautiful setting, cozy bed with soft linens, excellent service, fine dining, a high-end spa, outdoor activities, expansive grounds. What you didn't realize is that the hotel you've chosen may be contributing to global warming, hurting the local economy, damaging the ecological balance of the region, exposing guests to a toxic environment, adding to the overflowing landfill, and serving food filled with artificial additives. Booking a hotel that is aesthetically pleasing and comfortable is easy, but there is far more at stake.

According to the World Sustainable Hospitality Alliance, the hospitality industry contributes one percent of global carbon emissions, can use up to eight times more water per person than the local community, and is a primary consumer of single-use plastics. And according to thinkbefore.eu, products that are used as part of hotel operations can pose potential hazards to human health.

You can protect yourself, the planet, and the local residents by staying at a sustainability-focused hotel. There are a number of hotels in Europe that are certified as BIO HOTELS®. These 100 percent organic establishments feature innovative architectural designs, farm-to-table dining, sustainable recreation, eco-conscious amenities, and green electricity. They are are not just places to rest one's head but are pioneers in the hospitality industry - redefining luxury and comfort with a commitment to environmental conservation and community engagement and support.

According to a report by Future Marketing Insights, increased awareness about sustainability among the younger generation is expected to drive the global tourism market, which is estimated to reach a net revenue of nearly $13 million, with green tourism forecast to capture 35.7 percent of the total market revenue in 2024. A recent Virtuoso sustainability survey also reports that ""45 percent of respondents agree that traveling sustainably enhances their experience.""

It's no wonder that BIO HOTELs, such as Land Gut Höhne in Germany, have committed to practices and amenities that include using natural building materials, separating waste, offering electric car charging stations, and implementing sustainable energy practices.

In addition to the 44 certified BIO HOTELS (as well as home rentals), there are also numerous other European resorts that are supporting sustainable tourism while providing guests with a remarkable experience.

The 400-year-old Stanglwirt in Kitzbühel, Austria is a luxury hotel-meets-organic farm type of property that includes a children's farm and pools, a biomass power plant, the largest salt water pool in Europe, antibacterial floors, and five types of sauna. Visitors at this five-star resort can focus on their wellness while enjoying views of the picturesque Kaiser Mountains, drinking pristine water from the Kaiser spring, dining on dairy products produced from the on-property farm, and indulging in a treatment at the family-friendly spa. Owner Balthasar Hauser says, ""Our family knows that this place is a center of natural power. Our values, our traditions, our family history - our whole world is reflected in every corner.""

Another five-star eco-property is the newly opened opulent Hotel Maria in Helsinki, Finland that minimizes their environmental impact through reducing energy and water consumption, monitoring food waste, supporting local suppliers, and featuring seasonal, organic produce. They have been awarded with a Green Key certificate for their sustainability efforts. The hotel is housed in restored historical buildings that are protected by the Finnish Heritage agency. General manager Katriina Moksi told greenlodgingnews that ""In selecting partners and making purchases, we always consider various aspects of sustainability, and we are pleased to be generating an increased demand for high-quality, sustainably produced local goods and services in Finland.""

On Loch Lomond in Scotland, guests of the Cameron House can enjoy the natural beauty surrounding the property, view Eurasian otters and red squirrels, see the Hobbit House in the Enchanted Forest, explore Trossachs National Park, play golf on an 18-hole championship course, visit the spa's rasul mud chamber, or meander through a field of wildflowers in the Untidy Garden. The resort was recently awarded a silver designation at the Greengage Awards for their aggressive land management, rewilding, and carbon reduction efforts.

With a focus on nature, the luxurious Cali Mykonos in Greece implements responsible practices through initiatives such as using sustainably sourced building materials, preserving fresh water by having seawater swimming pools, providing insulation through green roofs, and honoring local history and culture. Enjoy an endless summer on this sun-soaked island at a hotel that is flooded with natural light, features art and furniture from local purveyors, and was built with materials that reflect the surrounding landscape.

There are several resources available to find a hotel that aligns with sustainability values but doesn't sacrifice comfort or luxury. In addition to the 50 listings on the BIO HOTELS website, you can also book certified sustainable hotels through online travel agencies recommended by the Global Sustainable Tourism Council. Beyond Green is another place to search for hotels that are striving to protect the planet while providing meaningful experiences.

A new modern heat pump system was commissioned at the Seinäjoki production plant at the beginning of 2024, with the aim of achieving annual savings of around 12-14 percent in heating at the plant. In about six months of operation, the new system has produced about 5800 MWh of heat. This is enough to heat the water for a five-minute shower for 2.8 million people in Finland.

The new heat pump system replaces the old system that had reached the end of its useful life. The aim of the renewal was to improve the energy efficiency of the production plant and save on energy costs. The system has a maximum thermal output of 2.8 MW and a heat recovery capacity of about 2.2 MW. The amount of the investment is several million euros, and the project has been granted Business Finland's energy support.

""The new heat pump system recovers heat from the cooling system of the milk evaporation process and from the condensing circuit of the factory's refrigeration plant, reducing their electricity and water consumption. Four new heat pumps can reuse otherwise wasted energy flows. The heat pumps produce 80-degree water for the heating network, which is then distributed to more than 20 heating points or heat accumulators in the factory. This is energy recycling at its best,"" says Valio's Energy Specialist Jussi Jääskeläinen.

The new heat pumps use ammonia as a refrigerant, which is also used in the Seinäjoki factory's refrigeration plant. Ammonia has a GWP (Global Warming Potential) value of zero. It is therefore an environmentally friendly and natural refrigerant with good prospects for future use.

""The project is a good example of how electrification can improve energy efficiency,"" Jääskeläinen adds.

The Seinäjoki factory produces, e.g., all Valio butters, Valio Oivariini® and Kevytlevi® spreads, quark, cottage cheese, Valio Profeel® quarks and puddings, and Valio MiFU™ milk-based alternatives to meat. In terms of products, the factory is one of Valio's more diverse, and in terms of milk processing volume, it is one of the largest. The Valio producer laboratory operates in conjunction with the factory.

Brookfield (NYSE: BAM, TSX: BAM), together with its institutional partners including Brookfield Renewable (NYSE: BEP, BEPC; TSX: BEP.UN, BEPC) and Temasek, through a special purpose vehicle exclusively controlled by Brookfield (""Brookfield Renewable Holdings"") v has entered into exclusive negotiations to purchase a 53.32% shareholding in Neoen (ISIN code: FR0011675362, Ticker: NEOEN) vi a leading global renewable energy developer headquartered in France, from Impala, the Fonds Stratégique de Participations (FSP), Cartusia and Xavier Barbaro, and other shareholders vii at a price per share viii of 39.85 euros (the ""block acquisition"").

Following the block acquisition, Brookfield Renewable Holdings would file a mandatory cash tender offer for the remaining shares and OCEANEs in Neoen (the ""tender offer"") at a price of 39.85 euros per share and at a price per OCEANEs issued in 2020 (""OCEANEs 2020"") and 2022 (""OCEANEs 2022"") in line with the offer price for the shares and the terms of each OCEANE .

Connor Teskey, CEO, Renewable Power & Transition at Brookfield Asset Management, said: ""Under Impala's sponsorship, Neoen has built one of the world's greatest renewable energy development platforms. We are excited to build on Brookfield's expertise, track-record and access to capital to further accelerate Neoen's growth while preserving its culture and identity. Acquiring Neoen further strengthens Brookfield's global scale, while diversifying into key renewables markets and adding expertise in battery storage technology. We look forward to partnering with management to scale-up the business to meet the growing demand we are seeing for clean power.""

Jacques Veyrat, founder and president at Impala said : ""Impala is delighted to sell the control of Neoen to Brookfield, a responsible actor and world leader in the renewable energy market. Impala created Neoen 15 years ago and have since then supported every stage of its development in France and then internationally, with outstanding success in Australia. With the financial backing of this new shareholder and the talent of Xavier Barbaro and his teams, Neoen will be able to continue its growth trajectory.""

Xavier Barbaro, Neoen's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said: ""After 15 years of successful and profitable growth with Impala as our key shareholder, we are thrilled to open a new chapter in Neoen's history, with the arrival of Brookfield as our new majority shareholder. We look forward to developing a strong relation with Brookfield that will take Neoen to the next phase of its growth story, further consolidating its leadership position as an independent producer of renewable energy, and one of the most dynamic globally. Our Board of Directors fully welcomes the transaction and sees Brookfield as a partner of choice to preserve the structure and identity of Neoen in the best interests of its employees and its stakeholders.""

Nicolas Dubourg, Managing Director of the FSP and Chairman of ISALT, said: ""We are extremely proud of the way Neoen has developed since the IPO. Driven by a relentless focus on profitable growth, operational discipline and open mindset, and fully focused on renewable energies, Neoen is a best-in-class company in its field. The FSP, whose strategy is to remain committed to financing the energy transition, has been at Neoen's side since the IPO in 2018, and along the capital raises to fund the growth of its installed capacity thereafter. The proposed operation is a demonstration of how long-term investment in innovating French companies run by talented and experienced managers, with the aim to creating international leaders, can generate meaningful impact on a global scale.""

Transaction rationale

Neoen is a leading global renewables developer with an 8,000 megawatt high-quality portfolio of wind, solar and storage assets in operation or under construction alongside a significant 20,000 megawatts advanced pipeline of development projects, located in strategic markets, particularly in Australia, France and the Nordics. Neoen has significant expertise in battery storage technology, which will become an increasingly important part of the energy mix going forward. Neoen's best-in-class capabilities include an experienced management team with in-house development, financing and operational capabilities and a track record of successfully delivering more than 1,000 megawatts of renewable capacity on an annual basis in attractive global markets.

Operating across five continents and managing a diverse portfolio of hydro, wind, solar, distributed energy and sustainable solutions assets, Brookfield is one of the world's largest investors in renewable power and transition assets, with almost 34,000 megawatts of generating capacity and a development pipeline of approximately 157,000 megawatts. Brookfield has been active in France since 2015 with over 23 billion euros (US$25 billion) invested, across 15 different investments.

Brookfield sees the investment in Neoen as an opportunity to scale Neoen's portfolio of diverse high-quality assets in a context of accelerating clean power demand. Brookfield is well positioned to support and accelerate Neoen's high quality development pipeline thanks to its access to capital and in-depth industry knowledge. The growth of AI and cloud computing continues to drive higher demand for renewable sources of power, as typified by Brookfield's recent agreement to supply Microsoft with over 10,500 megawatts of renewable power, the world's largest such power supply deal.

Brookfield is pursuing the transaction through the Brookfield Global Transition Fund II which is Brookfield's flagship vehicle for investing in and facilitating the global transition to a net-zero economy, co-headed by Mark Carney and Connor Teskey. This fund aims to deliver strong risk-adjusted financial returns for investors and meaningful decarbonization impact.

Brookfield Renewable, the largest investor in the Brookfield Global Transition Fund II, expects to invest up to 500 million euros (US$540 million) in the acquisition, which will be funded through available liquidity.

Key Transaction Terms

Definitive agreements for the block acquisition would be entered into after information and consultation with employee representative bodies. The transaction would be subject to customary regulatory approvals including antitrust and foreign investments clearances .

It is expected that the regulatory approvals would be obtained by Q4 2024 and that the tender offer would be launched in Q1 2025.

Offer unanimously welcomed by Neoen's Board of Directors

The Board of Directors of Neoen, in a meeting on May 29, 2024, unanimously welcomed the proposed transaction without prejudice to the reasoned opinion to be issued by the Board following the submission of the report of the independent expert. The Board views Brookfield's proposal as an opportunity to enhance Neoen's development and growth over the long term.

To that end, the Board has established an ad hoc committee comprised of Mr. Bertrand Dumazy (independent board member and Chairman of the ad hoc committee), Mrs. Helen Lee Bouygues (independent board member and Lead Director) and Mr. Christophe Gégout (independent board member) to monitor and facilitate the work of the independent expert, and to prepare a reasoned opinion on the merits of the tender offer and its consequences for Neoen, its shareholders and its employees. Following the recommendation of the ad hoc committee, the Board has appointed Finexsi as an independent expert pursuant to article 261-1 I and II of the Autorité des Marchés Financiers (""AMF"") general regulations to prepare a report as to the fairness of the financial terms of the tender offer.

Tender Offer

Following the completion of the block acquisition, Brookfield Renewable Holdings would become the majority shareholder in Neoen, holding approximately 53.32% of the share capital of Neoen, and would file a mandatory simplified cash tender offer with the AMF for all of the remaining shares in Neoen and the OCEANEs issued by Neoen at the same price per share as the block acquisition of 39.85 euros per share and at a price per OCEANEs 2020 and OCEANEs 2022 in line with the offer price for the shares and the terms of each OCEANE .

Brookfield Renewable Holdings intends to request the squeeze out of Neoen's shares and OCEANEs if the legal and regulatory conditions are met at the end of the tender offer. The tender offer is expected to be completed during Q1 2025. It is reminded that the shareholders of Neoen have the right to opt until June 5, 2024 for the payment of the 2024 dividend in shares (at a unit price of 0.15 euro per share) and that such shares would be targeted by the tender offer.

Transaction rationale

Neoen is a leading global renewables developer with an 8,000 megawatt high-quality portfolio of wind, solar and storage assets in operation or under construction alongside a significant 20,000 megawatts advanced pipeline of development projects, located in strategic markets, particularly in Australia, France and the Nordics. Neoen has significant expertise in battery storage technology, which will become an increasingly important part of the energy mix going forward. Neoen's best-in-class capabilities include an experienced management team with in-house development, financing and operational capabilities and a track record of successfully delivering more than 1,000 megawatts of renewable capacity on an annual basis in attractive global markets.

Operating across five continents and managing a diverse portfolio of hydro, wind, solar, distributed energy and sustainable solutions assets, Brookfield is one of the world's largest investors in renewable power and transition assets, with almost 34,000 megawatts of generating capacity and a development pipeline of approximately 157,000 megawatts.

As well as the synchronous condenser, including the flywheel which will deliver around 4000 MWs of inertia, the Siemens Energy scope includes the battery energy storage system (which employs Chinese-made batteries) as well as power conversion systems, energy management system and medium voltage equipment. The order will generate around 85 million Euros for Siemens Energy and work has already begun on site.

The current market regime in Ireland allows the sale of services such as inertia, short circuit power and reactive power, as provided by synchronous condenser technology, to the transmission system operator, EirGrid. To support this, Siemens Energy will also provide an energy management system allowing the owner/operator of Shannonbridge B to respond to market demands and power needs in real time.

Meanwhile, Valmet is providing a DNA automation system to Fingrid's Jylkkä substation in Kalajoki, as part of Destia's turnkey delivery of Finland's first synchronous condenser. The automation system will be taken over by the end customer, Fingrid, in March 2025, Valmet reports. It will be connected to Fingrid's main control room, from which Finland's electricity transmission system is operated.

Finland's first synchronous condenser, which will employ GE Vernova technology, will help Fingrid improve grid reliability on the West Coast, where a lot of wind power is produced.

""Finland's west coast contains one of the country's main concentrations of wind power production, and it is growing faster than all forecasts,"" says Timo Kiiveri, senior vice president, Fingrid. ""A wind power hub is emerging in Ostrobothnia to rival the combined output of the Olkiluoto and Loviisa nuclear power plants. The large amount of wind power in the area presents a challenge for the power system. One of the solutions to address this is the synchronous condenser.""

In the UK, Ingeteam has been awarded a contract for the supply of four synchronous condensers at two locations to help stabilise the grid.

The contract has been awarded by Quinbrook Infrastructure Partners and its development partner Welsh Power as part of Phase 2 of NGESO's Stability Pathfinder Project.

The machines will be installed at Thurso South and Neilston, with two Indarcom synchronous condensers to be installed at each location and connected to the Scottish transmission grid.

The Indarcom synchronous condensers will be manufactured by Ingeteam at its Beasain plant in Spain.

A consortium led by Ingeteam has been awarded the EPC contract for the new synchronous condenser installations and will be responsible for the design, manufacture and installation of both facilities.

This contract represents ""a new benchmark for Ingeteam in the innovative field of transmission and distribution grid stability,"" the company says, and notes that its synchronous condenser offerings meet ""the detailed specifications for connection to the Spanish transmission grid, where this type of system is not currently installed.""",nsenergybusiness.com,news,NS Business,Swagath Bandhakavi,0.2784313725490195,454763191,13,https://www.nsenergybusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/05/Synchronous-condensers.webp,

TORONTO and PARIS, May 30, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Brookfield (NYSE: BAM, TSX: BAM), together with its institutional partners including Brookfield Renewable (NYSE: BEP, BEPC; TSX: BEP.UN, BEPC) and Temasek, through a special purpose vehicle exclusively controlled by Brookfield (""Brookfield Renewable Holdings""), has entered into exclusive negotiations to purchase a 53.32% shareholding in Neoen (ISIN code: FR0011675362, Ticker: NEOEN), a leading global renewable energy developer headquartered in France, from Impala, the Fonds Stratégique de Participations (FSP), Cartusia and Xavier Barbaro, and other shareholders at a price per share of 39.85 euros (the ""block acquisition"").

Following the block acquisition, Brookfield Renewable Holdings would file a mandatory cash tender offer for the remaining shares and OCEANEs in Neoen (the ""tender offer"") at a price of 39.85 euros per share and at a price per OCEANEs issued in 2020 (""OCEANEs 2020"") and 2022 (""OCEANEs 2022"") in line with the offer price for the shares and the terms of each OCEANE.

Connor Teskey, CEO, Renewable Power & Transition at Brookfield Asset Management, said: ""Under Impala's sponsorship, Neoen has built one of the world's greatest renewable energy development platforms. We are excited to build on Brookfield's expertise, track-record and access to capital to further accelerate Neoen's growth while preserving its culture and identity. Acquiring Neoen further strengthens Brookfield's global scale, while diversifying into key renewables markets and adding expertise in battery storage technology. We look forward to partnering with management to scale-up the business to meet the growing demand we are seeing for clean power.""

Jacques Veyrat, founder and president at Impala said: ""Impala is delighted to sell the control of Neoen to Brookfield, a responsible actor and world leader in the renewable energy market. Impala created Neoen 15 years ago and have since then supported every stage of its development in France and then internationally, with outstanding success in Australia. With the financial backing of this new shareholder and the talent of Xavier Barbaro and his teams, Neoen will be able to continue its growth trajectory.""

Xavier Barbaro, Neoen's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said: ""After 15 years of successful and profitable growth with Impala as our key shareholder, we are thrilled to open a new chapter in Neoen's history, with the arrival of Brookfield as our new majority shareholder. We look forward to developing a strong relation with Brookfield that will take Neoen to the next phase of its growth story, further consolidating its leadership position as an independent producer of renewable energy, and one of the most dynamic globally. Our Board of Directors fully welcomes the transaction and sees Brookfield as a partner of choice to preserve the structure and identity of Neoen in the best interests of its employees and its stakeholders.""

Nicolas Dubourg, Managing Director of the FSP and Chairman of ISALT, said: ""We are extremely proud of the way Neoen has developed since the IPO. Driven by a relentless focus on profitable growth, operational discipline and open mindset, and fully focused on renewable energies, Neoen is a best-in-class company in its field. The FSP, whose strategy is to remain committed to financing the energy transition, has been at Neoen's side since the IPO in 2018, and along the capital raises to fund the growth of its installed capacity thereafter. The proposed operation is a demonstration of how long-term investment in innovating French companies run by talented and experienced managers, with the aim to creating international leaders, can generate meaningful impact on a global scale.""

Transaction rationale

Neoen is a leading global renewables developer with an 8,000 megawatt high-quality portfolio of wind, solar and storage assets in operation or under construction alongside a significant 20,000 megawatts advanced pipeline of development projects, located in strategic markets, particularly in Australia, France and the Nordics. Neoen has significant expertise in battery storage technology, which will become an increasingly important part of the energy mix going forward. Neoen's best-in-class capabilities include an experienced management team with in-house development, financing and operational capabilities and a track record of successfully delivering more than 1,000 megawatts of renewable capacity on an annual basis in attractive global markets.

Operating across five continents and managing a diverse portfolio of hydro, wind, solar, distributed energy and sustainable solutions assets, Brookfield is one of the world's largest investors in renewable power and transition assets, with almost 34,000 megawatts of generating capacity and a development pipeline of approximately 157,000 megawatts. Brookfield has been active in France since 2015 with over 23 billion euros (US$25 billion) invested, across 15 different investments.

Brookfield sees the investment in Neoen as an opportunity to scale Neoen's portfolio of diverse high-quality assets in a context of accelerating clean power demand. Brookfield is well positioned to support and accelerate Neoen's high quality development pipeline thanks to its access to capital and in-depth industry knowledge. The growth of AI and cloud computing continues to drive higher demand for renewable sources of power, as typified by Brookfield's recent agreement to supply Microsoft with over 10,500 megawatts of renewable power, the world's largest such power supply deal.

Brookfield is pursuing the transaction through the Brookfield Global Transition Fund II which is Brookfield's flagship vehicle for investing in and facilitating the global transition to a net-zero economy, co-headed by Mark Carney and Connor Teskey. This fund aims to deliver strong risk-adjusted financial returns for investors and meaningful decarbonization impact.

Brookfield Renewable, the largest investor in the Brookfield Global Transition Fund II, expects to invest up to 500 million euros (US$540 million) in the acquisition, which will be funded through available liquidity.

Key Transaction Terms

Definitive agreements for the block acquisition would be entered into after information and consultation with employee representative bodies. The transaction would be subject to customary regulatory approvals including antitrust and foreign investments clearances.

It is expected that the regulatory approvals would be obtained by Q4 2024 and that the tender offer would be launched in Q1 2025.

Offer unanimously welcomed by Neoen's Board of Directors

The Board of Directors of Neoen, in a meeting on May 29, 2024, unanimously welcomed the proposed transaction without prejudice to the reasoned opinion to be issued by the Board following the submission of the report of the independent expert. The Board views Brookfield's proposal as an opportunity to enhance Neoen's development and growth over the long term.

To that end, the Board has established an ad hoc committee comprised of Mr. Bertrand Dumazy (independent board member and Chairman of the ad hoc committee), Mrs. Helen Lee Bouygues (independent board member and Lead Director) and Mr. Christophe Gégout (independent board member) to monitor and facilitate the work of the independent expert, and to prepare a reasoned opinion on the merits of the tender offer and its consequences for Neoen, its shareholders and its employees. Following the recommendation of the ad hoc committee, the Board has appointed Finexsi as an independent expert pursuant to article 261-1 I and II of the Autorité des Marchés Financiers (""AMF"") general regulations to prepare a report as to the fairness of the financial terms of the tender offer.

Tender Offer

Following the completion of the block acquisition, Brookfield Renewable Holdings would become the majority shareholder in Neoen, holding approximately 53.32% of the share capital of Neoen, and would file a mandatory simplified cash tender offer with the AMF for all of the remaining shares in Neoen and the OCEANEs issued by Neoen at the same price per share as the block acquisition of 39.85 euros per share and at a price per OCEANEs 2020 and OCEANEs 2022 in line with the offer price for the shares and the terms of each OCEANE.

Brookfield Renewable Holdings intends to request the squeeze out of Neoen's shares and OCEANEs if the legal and regulatory conditions are met at the end of the tender offer. The tender offer is expected to be completed during Q1 2025. It is reminded that the shareholders of Neoen have the right to opt until June 5, 2024 for the payment of the 2024 dividend in shares (at a unit price of 0.15 euro per share) and that such shares would be targeted by the tender offer.

8152963757,eng,True,2024-05-30,08:09:38,2024-05-30T08:09:38Z,2024-05-30T08:09:05Z,news,0.0,https://strangesounds.org/2024/05/when-solar-flares-meet-cyberattacks-at-the-confluence-of-global-mayhem.html,When solar flares meet cyberattacks at the confluence of global mayhem - Strange Sounds,"The 'Great Blackout' is arguably the most expedient pathway towards the Great Reset. But how will it pan out?

As I had written recently, the Earth was subjected to a dynamic solar flare from an active sunspot called Region 3664 between May 10 and 13. It peaked on May 11 as a significant X5.8 class flare. The X-class constitutes the most powerful category of solar flares and has the potential to impair human and animal health as well as degrade utilities and telecommunications infrastructures.

We are in the midst of a new helical cycle called Solar Cycle 25, which began in December 2019 and is expected to peak into a ""solar maximum"" between late 2024 and early 2025. An unprecedented X class solar storm, accompanied by massive coronal mass ejections (CMEs), may set back societies by months, years or even decades.

The biggest incident of this kind in recorded history, registering X45 on the solar flare scale, was the Carrington Event which occurred on 1 Sept 1859. It caused widespread disruptions to telegraph systems, particularly in North America and Europe. Telegraph lines experienced voltage surges and fires broke out at several telegraph offices. A few telegraph operators were even electrocuted. These telegraph systems, which were in their infancy, were quickly rebuilt. A repeat event in our hyperconnected world however may simply be catastrophic.

To begin with, I am not sure if Elon Musk's constellation of Starlink satellites -- numbering anywhere between 4,000 and 6,000 -- can withstand anything stronger than an X30 solar flare. A relatively mild solar storm had doomed 40 of them in 2022.

Only remote or rural areas, which are relatively unplugged from our hyper-wired world, stand a chance to revert to some sort of normalcy after a Carrington Event. Humans can learn to live without the Internet, electricity and transportation systems relatively quickly but they cannot survive without immediate access to food and water. Why do you think billionaires, who relentlessly promote destructive globalist agendas, are building survival bunkers in remote areas around the world?

Those living in cities, without skills to source, generate or process food and water, will face mayhem unless utilities and telecoms systems are restored within three days. Humans can survive without water for up to three days but the cumulative psychological impact will be incalculable. As the US writer Alfred Henry Lewis once noted: ""There are only nine meals (i.e. three days) between mankind and anarchy."" This was said back in 1906, when societies were far more cohesive and resilient.

An entire generation today, without real life skills and hopelessly hooked on instant multimedia gratification, would crack much sooner than three days. One can only imagine the hordes of zombies straggling along various streets, trying to come to grips with life without Twitter, WhatsApp and Instagram. The vulnerable will face hordes of looters and assorted anarchists who will be razing down down entire neighbourhood blocks when they are not attacking people at random. It will be reminiscent of scenes from The Purge franchise.

Without access to functioning telecommunications systems, it would be next to impossible for police forces and national guard units to restore law and order across the board. Even if emergency systems are deployed, law and order personnel will likely face makeshift roadblocks and attacks from anarchist elements. We were given a preview of this during the George Floyd ""protests"". Hospitals, to the extent where they are accessible, would be inundated with the sick and dying.

Martial law may only benefit high value individuals who will be exfiltrated -- to the extent possible -- from their urban hellholes to safe havens in improvised military camps or makeshift security zones. These operations may be synchronised with the targeted elimination of identified dissidents. Say goodbye to your favourite Substack authors if and when this happens.

Those who had stockpiled essential items in their city dwellings will face new and unforeseen dilemmas. Cooking food from stored items would only alert the dazed, angry and hungry coexisting nearby. Flushing the toilet even once a day would alert neighbours to the fact that someone has a ready supply of water in their vicinity. In the midst of this pandemonium, highways would be gridlocked by vehicles crawling out of urban zones. Then again, if an X30+ solar flare does strike, most vehicles would have been knocked out of commission. This is the acid test for a genuine solar storm incident. You have been forewarned.

The scenarios I depicted above are nothing new. They have been regularly gamed out in various military exercises as well as in movies and novels. During this period, repeated flares of a magnitude exceeding X30 or greater may destroy all backup systems that had been stored in military Faraday cages. Urban dwellers in Developed Nations can recover from a one-time superflare but most will not survive repeated bombardments from the sun.

But what if a takedown of utilities and telecommunications is conveniently blamed on a superflare, accompanied by spectacular auroras around the world? What if many of the recent auroras witnessed from May 10-13 were not the result of solar flares? What if many of them were the result of High-frequency Active Auroral Research Program (HAARP) experiments?

According to expose-news.com, several AI chatbots had concluded that many of the auroras witnessed recently may have been the result of HAARP experiments conducted from May 8-10. To the perennial sceptic, these visual extravaganzas appear like a trial run for something more sinister.

Socioeconomic dams across the Developed World are about to burst. The system can no longer be fixed. The global coronapsychosis was a fiasco of sorts; trust in governments has hit an all time low; and it is now time to unleash a new global false flag.

UK Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden recently advised his fellow citizens to build ""national resilience"" by stockpiling food and water that can last for at least three days, along with candles, torches and hand crank radios which can provide a degree of ""analogue capabilities"".

According to a Daily Mail report dated 21 May 2024, these contingency measures will help citizens deal with ""potential emergencies such as prolonged power cuts, cyber attacks and floods"". On the surface, some of these threats have been linked to a ""new axis of anti-western states including China, Russia, North Korea and Iran"".

Dowden had announced an ""emergency alert"" system in 2023 which will dispatch warnings to millions of mobile phones in the event of an ongoing or impending national crisis. The UK Cabinet was reportedly inspired by Finland's ""72-hour concept"" plan for coping in situations where ""society's services are disrupted or even discontinued"".

Now, here is where things get a little murky. The Finns have also been encouraged to tape up their windows and doors in the event of a national emergency and to await instructions via radios. (Note: The Finnish plan is generic).

As far as I know, taping up exterior gaps in a dwelling is only resorted to under two extraordinary circumstances: a pandemic outbreak/biological attack or a chemical attack. Are the global parasites planning to unleash Disease X?

Just how does a massive cyberattack, solar superflare or an environmental calamity gel with duct tapes? Sure, some chemical plants may suffer catastrophic meltdowns when their cybersystems are compromised but any spillout would be limited to a few urban areas. It will not be a global event. Furthermore, taping up windows and doors would be of no use when a nuclear plant suffers a meltdown. Think of Chernobyl for starters.

But the real goal here seems more ominous. The groundwork for these series of events has already been laid out. In late 2021, when it was apparent that the coronapsychosis was fizzling out, the World Economic Forum (WEF) declared that the world was ""in the midst of a 'cyber pandemic'.""

Nothing of that sort happened. A surge in cyberattacks is not the same as a ""cyber pandemic"". Were hospitals which were allegedly overburdened by mass hospitalisations during the ""pandemic"" subjected to cyberattacks? I thought these were the rare situations which psychopathic hackers typically drooled over?

According to WEF supremo Klaus Schwab, the ""Covid-19 crisis"" would be seen as ""a small disturbance in comparison to a major cyberattack"". Oh, so there may be a bigger global disruption ahead?

All the supposedly antagonistic stakeholders have been bought over. The opening session of the 2021 WEF cyber polygon pow-wow was kicked off by Russia's Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin and the event featured a heavy Russian representation. Rather coincidentally, Russia is on the forefront of the Digital ID agenda.

Another thing to note about Cyber Polygon is its logo. Have we not seen iterations of it elsewhere?

You would think that the Russian security services would have raised a few red flags over an event logo that smacked of pedophile symbolism. These symbols were featured in a 2007 FBI bulletin and they were compiled by its Cyber Division's Innocent Images National Initiative. Somehow the FBI does not maintain a link to this document.

I believe our global puppet masters are planning to launch a coordinated series of cyberattacks worldwide via digital kill switches.

During this short window period of confusion and mayhem, these attacks will be initially blamed on the ""new axis of anti-western states"". Even Hamas may be blamed for this ""attack on humanity"". Later, the narrative may shift in an attempt to avert WW3. A few HAARP-engineered auroras around the world may rapidly create a new global consensus. The cyberattacks will eventually be blamed on a clique of ""anarchists"" worldwide who took advantage of solar disruptions and the accompanying human misery.

Your bank accounts and pension funds, in the meantime, would have disappeared overnight. Your Bitcoins will be worthless. Many will die in their homes, in the streets and in non-functioning hospitals. Any return to societal normalcy would be contingent on acquiring national Digital IDs which will enable the provision of essential products (i.e. food to medicine) via Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). Without Digital IDs, you will not have access to essential services like the Internet or any other form of mobile communications. There will be promises to restore your bank accounts and pension funds but it will soon transpire that the solar flares, rioters and hackers had ""erased"" them altogether. As I had written last year:

You may have been very careful with your finances; you may be free of debts; free from any outstanding loan for any of the properties (houses, cars, farms etc.) you had purchased but you will no longer own them within six years. You may even have millions in the bank, along with a well-cushioned pension fund, but they will no longer be available at your disposal. Rights to everything that you own will be steadily transferred to a national coordinating authority which in turn will report to a centralised international body. There is nowhere to run in the emerging planetary prison.

Day-to-day functions of the Great Reset Society will be mediated by blockchain and social credits. As for the global oligarchy, special CBDC credits will be dispensed for the management of sprawling enterprises that are deemed vital to society. It will be communism on digital steroids; a dynamic form of communism that will finally ""work"" after many failed attempts.

I would like to call this engineered event the ""Great Blackout"" and it is arguably the most expedient pathway towards the Great Reset.

However, there is one event which will throw a planetary-sized spanner into this hypothetical globalist machination. Ironically, it will be a real solar superflare in the form of either a Carrington Event or the much more destructive Miyake Event. Digital IDs and CBDCs would be useless after this event, for society would have to revert to a pre-digital modus vivendi for a considerable period of time.

A solar superflare may set back societies by decades, along with a much reduced global population. [The Eye Opener]

The European Commission has approved a EUR 1.4 billion ($1.5 billion) joint state aid package put forward by Estonia, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Slovakia and Spain for research and development projects on hydrogen technologies and applications.

The IPCEI Hy2Move package, which is the fourth Important Project of Common European Interest (IPCEI) on the hydrogen value chain, supports 11 companies for 13 innovative projects. The owners' share of the investment is expected to be EUR 3.3 billion ($3.6 billion), the Commission said in a statement.

In the transport sector, IPCEI Hy2Move supports ""applications to integrate hydrogen technologies in transport means (road, maritime and aviation)... for example, fuel cell vehicle platforms for use in buses and trucks"". The companies selected in this sector are Air Products in the Netherlands; Airbus and BMW in Germany; Airbus and Hydrogene de France in France; Airbus and Evolution Synergetique in Spain; Skeleton in Estonia; and Tomark in Slovakia.

The aid also supports projects to develop high-performance fuel cell technologies, which use hydrogen to produce electricity. The recipients under this theme are Airbus and BMW in Germany; Hydrogene de France and Michelin in France; and UFI in Italy.

Another technology supported by IPCEI Hy2Move is hydrogen storage tanks. Funded for this undertaking are Airbus' French, German and Spanish arms, as well as BMW and Tomark.

IPCEI Hy2Move also picked projects on hydrogen production technologies, particularly those that can be used to refuel using pressurized 99.99 percent pure fuel cell-grade hydrogen. The beneficiaries in this topic are Air Products; Gen-Hy Cube and Michelin in France; and Neumann & Esser in Germany.

""The participating companies will cooperate with each other as well as with the associated partner Breuer Technical Development, a Belgian SME [small and medium enterprise], and with over 200 indirect partners, such as universities, research organizations and SMEs across Europe"", the Commission added.

""All 13 projects part of the IPCEI are highly ambitious, as they aim at developing technologies and processes that go beyond current technology and will allow major improvements notably in the areas of mobility and transport applications, fuel cells, on-board hydrogen storage and generation of hydrogen for the use in mobility and transport"", the Commission said.

Margrethe Vestager, executive vice president in charge of competition policy at the Commission, said in a statement, ""Hydrogen can support us to move around and transport goods with zero emissions, but investing into hydrogen powered mobility and transport technologies can be risky for one Member State or one company alone"".

""This is where State aid rules for IPCEI have a role to play"", Vestager added.

The EU aims to reach 10 million metric tons of hydrogen production capacity by 2030, as set out in the 27-member bloc's hydrogen strategy adopted 2020.

Last April the Commission announced the results of the first auction under the European Hydrogen Bank, an EU funding program to scale up hydrogen production. Seven projects across Finland, Norway, Portugal and Spain were to receive a total of EUR 720 million ($771.1 million).

""The winning bidders will produce renewable hydrogen in Europe and will receive a subsidy to bridge the price difference between their production costs and the market price for hydrogen, which is currently driven by non-renewable producers"", the Commission said in a statement April 30.

Three projects in Spain with a combined output of 595 megawatts electric (mWe) were among the seven provisional recipients, which will now have to undergo individual grant agreements with the European Climate, Infrastructure and Environment Executive Agency. Renato Ptx Holdco will build the 500 mWe Catalina project, while the other two smaller projects are under Benbros Energy SL (the 60 mWe El Alamillo H2) and Angus (the 35 mWe Hysencia).

The two Portuguese projects in this cohort have a combined capacity of 700 mWe: Madoquapower 2x's MP2X project (500 mWe) and Petrogal SA's Grey2Green II project (200 mWe).

In Norway, the Skiga project by the namesake company has a 117 mWe capacity.

Rounding up this round is the 90 mWe eNRG Lahti project of Nordic Ren-Gas Oy in Finland.

""Together, the winning bidders plan to produce 1.58 million tonnes of renewable hydrogen over ten years, avoiding more than 10 million tonnes of CO2 [carbon dioxide] emissions"", the Commission said.

""The renewable hydrogen they produce will be used in sectors such as steel, chemicals, maritime transport and fertilizers"", it said.

The seven projects will receive subsidies of EUR 8 million ($8.6 million) to EUR 245 million ($264.4 million).

In the inaugural rollout, the producers get a fixed premium per kilogram of output, capped at EUR 4.5 ($4.9) a kilogram.

Projects throughout the duration of the Hydrogen Bank will receive a subsidy on top of the market revenues that they generate from hydrogen sales, for up to 10 years. They will have to start producing renewable hydrogen within five years upon the signing of grant agreements.

For the awardees in the first auction, the Commission expects the grant agreements to be signed by November.",rigzone.com,news,Rigzone,,0.3411764705882352,454748685,5,https://images.rigzone.com/images/news/articles/Seven-EU-States-Provide-15B-Funding-for-Hydrogen-RD-176915-582x327.webp,eng-9604649

The aim is to adopt the Council conclusions on promoting sustainable electricity network infrastructure. The ministers will also discuss the future of the REPowerEU plan and the status of the Green Deal. Finland will be represented at the meeting by Minister of Climate and the Environment Kai Mykkänen.

The ministers will also receive an update from the Commission on the status of national energy and climate plans (NECPs) and the implementation process of electricity capacity mechanisms. Hungary, which will assume the Council presidency on July 1, 2024, will present the program for its six-month term.

Council conclusions on promoting Sustainable electricity network Infrastructure

The Council is expected to adopt conclusions on promoting electricity network infrastructure. These conclusions emphasize the importance of interconnected electricity network infrastructure for the functioning of the internal market, competitiveness, and achieving climate goals. The EU's electricity network must be planned over the long term at the EU level and coordinated between countries at the transmission network level, but also at the distribution network level. Additionally, the importance of energy security is highlighted, as Europe must be prepared for new threats. The conclusions also stress the importance of funding in implementing investments.

Finland welcomes the attention not only to transmission networks but also to the development of distribution networks as a prerequisite for the clean transition. Well-maintained electricity networks are considered a competitive advantage for Finland.

Finland wants to leave sufficient flexibility for member states to develop and expedite permitting processes. The promotion of new technologies requires rapid and efficient state aid control procedures by the European Commission.

Ministers to discuss the progress of the REPowerEU Plan

In spring 2022, the Commission presented the REPowerEU plan, which aims to end the EU's energy dependency on Russia by 2027. The plan includes guidelines for stopping the import of Russian gas, oil, and coal.

The EU's energy reforms and investments must focus on improving energy infrastructure, thereby promoting the security of gas supply, including liquefied natural gas (LNG). Russia's share of EU imports of natural gas has fallen from 45% to about 15% within a couple of years.

Dependence on Russian fossil fuels is also reduced by saving energy, diversifying energy sources, and accelerating the transition to clean energy.

Topics also include the Green Deal and National Energy and Climate Plans

Ministers will exchange views on the European Green Deal and how it can help transform the EU into a modern, resource-efficient, and competitive economy.

In other matters, the Commission will provide an update on the status of national energy and climate plans (NECPs). Member states must submit their final updated plans to the Commission by the end of June. These plans outline how the member states intend to achieve the EU's energy and climate targets for 2030. Finland's final plan will be submitted to the Commission immediately after Midsummer.

In about six months of operation, the new system has produced about 5800 MWh of heat. This is enough to heat the water for a five-minute shower for 2.8 million people in Finland.

The new heat pump system replaces the old system that had reached the end of its useful life. The aim of the renewal was to improve the energy efficiency of the production plant and save on energy costs. The system has a maximum thermal output of 2.8 MW and a heat recovery capacity of about 2.2 MW. The amount of the investment is several million euros, and the project has been granted Business Finland's energy support.

""The new heat pump system recovers heat from the cooling system of the milk evaporation process and from the condensing circuit of the factory's refrigeration plant, reducing their electricity and water consumption. Four new heat pumps can reuse otherwise wasted energy flows. The heat pumps produce 80-degree water for the heating network, which is then distributed to more than 20 heating points or heat accumulators in the factory. This is energy recycling at its best,"" says Valio's Energy Specialist Jussi Jääskeläinen

The new heat pumps use ammonia as a refrigerant, which is also used in the Seinäjoki factory's refrigeration plant. Ammonia has a GWP (Global Warming Potential) value of zero. It is therefore an environmentally friendly and natural refrigerant with good prospects for future use.

""The project is a good example of how electrification can improve energy efficiency,"" Jääskeläinen adds.

The Seinäjoki factory produces, e.g., all Valio butters, Valio Oivariini® and Kevytlevi® spreads, quark, cottage cheese, Valio Profeel® quarks and puddings, and Valio MiFU™ milk-based alternatives to meat. In terms of products, the factory is one of Valio's more diverse, and in terms of milk processing volume, it is one of the largest. The Valio producer laboratory operates in conjunction with the factory.

Valio is a Finnish food company founded in 1905. Valio is owned by 3,400 Finnish dairy farmers through cooperatives. We pay out our operating profit to the dairy farms. The Valio brand is a promise of first-class quality and responsibility. Valio's sales in 2023 were EUR 2,3 million.

We are Finland's biggest food exporter and a trailblazer for the whole food industry. We export our consumer and industrial products to approximately 50 countries. We are an owner in Oddlygood, a company focusing on plant-based products. Our Valio Aimo® wholesale business serves hotels, restaurants and catering services, bakeries, and customers in the public sector and food industry all around Finland. Suomen Lantakaasu Oy, a joint venture we established with energy company St1, is boosting the circular economy by producing biogas from dairy farm manure. In all, we employ 4,200 people.

Our goal is to cut the carbon footprint of milk to zero by 2035. We are reducing emissions, growing carbon sinks and creating circular economy solutions. We are improving animal welfare, and we are working to increase biodiversity.

The solution starts with insulation',"The businessman and vocal critic of heat pumps reiterated his concern over Scottish Government plans which put the technology at the centre of decarbonising heating and mitigating climate change.

His chief point is that the efficiency levels often given for heat pumps are exaggerated, or don't tend to be seen in real homes.

Lord Haughey, founder of City Facitilites Mangement, has been selling heat pumps for 40 years. ""I was selling them before most of the people who are out evangelising for them knew what a heat pump was. I probably sell more heat pumps than anyone in Scotland.""

The heat pumps he sells are not units for heating, but air conditioners which are essentially the same technology. ""I have not sold one heat pump,"" he said, ""to anyone who wanted to use it for their heat source in their home.""

Last year, comments by Lord Haughey hit the news when, in the Herald on Sunday and on BBC Radio Scotland, he criticised, the technology - offering a preferred solution of an electric boiler. Headlines drew attention to the fact that he said that heat pumps did not work in cold climates.

At the time, Patrick Harvie responded that the technology was ""tried and tested"" and that the highest use of heat pumps is in countries that have the coldest winters such as Norway, Sweden and Finland,

But talking this week, Lord Haughey said that the question of how well they work in the cold was not his chief issue.

""In my spat with Patrick Harvie, he kept saying that they work in Scandinavia, so they'll work at the low temperatures in the UK. But the cold temperatures was not my big complaint. It was that you did not get the efficiencies that people were saying you did.""

Heat pump efficiencies are measured according to what is called their seasonal coefficient of performance (SCOP) which relates to the amount of heat produced per unit of electricity. For instance a SCOP of 3 means that for every 1kW, the heat pump actually, by extracting heat from the outside air, produces 3kW of heat.

Lord Haughey is sceptical about some of the high SCOPs that some people have been claiming. ""People have just got on the bandwagon because the Scottish government was saying we should have heat pumps. They started saying, burn 1kW of energy and get 4kW. I was at a convention where I saw a stand where they talked about 7. It's absolute nonsense. I would tell everyone in the world to buy a heat pump if I thought that was the case.""

Even heat pump manufacturers, he pointed out, are not claiming the very high efficiencies. ""You go to the seven largest manufacturers of heat pumps in the world and get their brochures. None of their brochures will claim what the people who are selling them claim.""

A number of studies have collected data on real home installations. One, by Energy Systems Catapult, found that had a median SCOP of 2.8, indicating that whilst some people were getting greater efficiencies, others were getting less. Some were getting as low as 1.6, whilst a tiny fraction were achieving above 4. Given the current ratio of electricity to gas prices (4 to 1), at a SCOP of 3 and above, energy users will be paying the same or less than gas boilers for their bills.

Among Lord Haughey's concerns is that to get the system to work financially, it's necessary to get more than just a heat pump.

""The main thing for me is that there's better ways of putting people into debt. The people selling the heat pump started to say that it's not just the heat pump you need. It's the solar panels, it's the battery, it's the insulation. Instead of it costing £7,000, now it costs £30,000. People are getting into nearly £30,000 debt and I'm saying there's a much better way.""

The Scottish Government has set up schemes to reduce this homeowner debt. Grants and interest fee loans are available for some of these measures from Home Energy Scotland, including the £7,500 heat pump grant.

Another criticism is that electricity is not yet zero carbon: ""People say that a heat pump is a net zero appliance. What does a heat pump run with? Electricity which is not zero carbon. So I'm saying that the claims made about heat pumps are wrong and exaggerated.""

Scotland's electricity is part of the national grid that also covers England and Wales and which is still powered by some gas-fired power stations. However, the equivalent of 113% of Scotland's gross electricity consumption was generated from renewable sources during 2022.

What Lord Haughey wants, he said, is more debate. ""We don't need Boris Johnson or Patrick Harvie to tell us we had better get a heat pump,"" he added. ""We need science. I'm saying everyone who is jumping on the heat pump bandwagon are people who are trying to sell heat pumps and solar panels and everything else.

""I'm happy to have a debate with anybody that is saying heat pumps are giving three times and four times the output. There may be a situation where that is happening. Someone could prove to me they're much more efficient in bungalows and standalone houses. But they will never be the answer for flats. Never.""

The reason for this, he said, is because of how far the piping would have to stretch. ""The outside unit is either on the roof or on the ground. That means the piping will have to go 30 m in the air or to the ground, and the length of the pipeline reduces the efficiency of the heat pump.

Other complaints he has had about heat pumps are how noisy they are. ""I'm building 356 apartments in the Gorbals. If I was to put a heat pump in every one of those apartments, I would guarantee you that SEPA would come along and close me down because of the combined noise of 356 condensing units.""",heraldscotland.com,news,The Herald,,-0.03529411764705881,454743379,21,https://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/18135322/,eng-9610996

Another remarkable achievement is the use of oil in transformers.

While transformers typically use mineral oil, Chint's continuous development efforts have led to the adoption of vegetable oil, a renewable and degradable alternative. This transition has resulted in a significant reduction of carbon emissions by 98 percent.

The company has achieved a groundbreaking milestone with the development of a 750-kilovolt natural ester insulating oil transformer, the highest voltage level in the world to date, astonishing global industry players. Offering a comprehensive product range from 10 kV to 750 kV, Chint is now the world's leading manufacturer in terms of sales volume for natural ester transformers.

Chint Group began its journey as a switch producer in 1984 and has gradually evolved into a major global smart energy solutions provider. Today, the company integrates the entire industry chain of power generation, storage, transmission, transformation, distribution and use.

From frigid Finland to the deserts of Saudi Arabia and the tropical rainforests of Ecuador, Chint has expanded its footprint to over 100 countries and regions. According to Chen Chengjian, deputy chairman of Chint Group's electric company, the company's international business accounts for about 30 percent of total revenue.

Since 2006, Chint has ventured into the photovoltaic new energy field, quickly establishing international competitiveness in the development, design, investment, construction, operation and maintenance of photovoltaic power plants.

To date, Chint has constructed photovoltaic power plants with a combined capacity of more than 30 gigawatts around the world, which can provide more than 34 billion kilowatt-hours of green electricity and reduce carbon dioxide emissions by more than 30 million metric tons every year.

Notably, Chint's rooftop photovoltaic power station project has benefited over 1.3 million households in China, bringing an extra income of 1,000 yuan ($138) to 3,000 yuan for a family every year, while creating over 200,000 jobs in rural areas.

Innovation has always been a cornerstone in the growth of Chint Group's electric company, according to Chen.

As of the end of 2022, the company had developed over 900 products, obtained 404 patents, led or participated in revising 215 national industry standards, and engaged in over 30 industry-university-research collaboration projects.

In 2023, the electric company generated revenue exceeding 20 billion yuan, a significant increase from 4 billion yuan in 2016.

Another important factor contributing to the rapid development of Chint Group's electric company is its strategic location at the heart of the national expressway G60, which serves as a ""science and innovation corridor"" in the Yangtze River Delta, which connects Shanghai and eight cities in Zhejiang, Jiangsu and Anhui provinces.

Each of the nine cities has its own industrial base and advantages, and they can complement each other, said Guo Shuqing, deputy director of the G60 sci-tech innovation corridor joint conference office.

As Cold War-style rhetoric continues to intensify in the wake of Sweden and Finland's accession to NATO, Hungary's pro-Russian president Viktor Orban is now courting Belarus to expand ties and build Hungary's second nuclear power plant.

On Wednesday, despite European Union sanctions on Russian ally Belarus, Hungarian Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó visited MInsk, where he publicly stated, ""our position is clear: the fewer sanctions, the more cooperation!""

The two countries signed a deal in which Belarus will assist Hungary in the construction of its second new PAK reactor. The first reactor, according to Reuters, being built by Russian state-run nuclear company Rosatom, has been in the construction process since 2014. Rosatom will also build the second reactor, with cooperation from Belarus.

Hungary's first commercial nuclear power reactor began operations in the early 1980s, and it now has four nuclear reactors in operation, generating approximately half of its domestic electricity needs, according to data from the World Nuclear Association. Two new reactors currently being built by Russian Rosatom received broad parliamentary support.

""Of great importance is the agreement signed here today on nuclear energy cooperation, which allows us to use the experiences Belarus gained here while constructing reactors with a similar technology,"" Szijjarto stated, adding that Budapest would be boosting cooperation with Belarus in areas that are not targeted by sanctions, which the Hungarian foreign minister suggested were not working.

Belarus has been under EU sanctions for rigged elections, oppression of the opposition and allowing Russian troops to use the country as a staging ground for attacks on Ukraine.

Orban, who has been pushing back against EU sanctions since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in the Spring of 2022, will now have to face municipal elections at home and June 9 European Parliamentary elections, where his party is now faced with a newly emerging opposition challenge.",oilprice.com,news,OilPrice.com,Josh Owens,0.1058823529411765,454726942,1,https://d32r1sh890xpii.cloudfront.net/news/718x300/2024-05-29_iuanogrde9.jpg,eng-9608662

What does this mean for improving speech?,"Stuttering, a speech disorder characterized by involuntary repetitions and blocks, affects millions globally. While previously thought to be psychological, a new study by an international team identifies a specific brain network potentially underlying stuttering, regardless of its cause. This discovery could lead to novel treatments of this speech disorder.

Stuttering affects about 5-10% of young children, with roughly 1% continuing to stutter into adulthood. Speech therapy is a common approach to treating stuttering, but it doesn't always work -- and that can be damning for some.

Severe stuttering can profoundly impact an individual's quality of life. Nearly 40% of children between 12 and 17 who stutter also have conditions like anxiety or depression. Adults who stutter are twice as likely to develop similar conditions and three times more likely to develop personality disorders. Stuttering can be worse when the person is feeling excited, stressed, or under pressure.

Historically, stuttering was viewed as a psychological issue. Recent research, however, has established it as a brain disorder related to speech production regulation.

Stuttering can also be acquired following neurological conditions such as Parkinson's disease or stroke. Despite this, the precise neurobiological mechanisms have remained elusive. Previous brain imaging studies produced conflicting results, making it difficult to pinpoint the exact origins of stuttering within the brain.

The international team, including researchers from Finland, New Zealand, the United States, and Canada, employed a novel research design to address this challenge. They examined individuals who developed stuttering after strokes. Interestingly, the strokes, though in different brain regions, all impacted the same network.

This network, also observed in individuals with developmental stuttering, included the putamen (involved in motor control), amygdala (linked to emotions), and claustrum (a communication hub). The greater these changes, the more severe the stuttering, suggesting a common brain network underpinning both developmental and acquired stuttering. This was in contrast to strokes that did not result in stuttering.

""These findings explain well-known features of stuttering, such as the motor difficulties in speech production and the significant variability in stuttering severity across emotional states. As major nuclei in the brain, the putamen regulates motor function and the amygdala regulates emotions. The claustrum, in turn, acts as a node for several brain networks and relays information between them,"" explains Juho Joutsa, a Professor of Neurology from the University of Turku.

Understanding the specific brain network involved opens up possibilities for targeted medical treatments. For instance, one potential treatment could involve brain stimulation -- essentially zapping the brain with electricity -- tailored to the identified brain network. This could mark a significant advancement in managing and potentially alleviating stuttering, improving the lives of those affected by this challenging condition.",zmescience.com,news,ZME Science,Tibi Puiu,-0.4745098039215686,454702534,1,https://www.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DALL·E-2024-05-28-20.32.42-A-symbolic-illustration-focusing-on-stuttering-as-a-speech-disorder.-Depict-a-person-speaking-but-their-speech-is-represented-as-fragmented-or-broken.webp,eng-9601579

But how will it pan out?

As I had written recently, the Earth was subjected to a dynamic solar flare from an active sunspot called Region 3664 between May 10 and 13. It peaked on May 11 as a significant X5.8 class flare. The X-class constitutes the most powerful category of solar flares and has the potential to impair human and animal health as well as degrade utilities and telecommunications infrastructures.

We are in the midst of a new helical cycle called Solar Cycle 25, which began in December 2019 and is expected to peak into a ""solar maximum"" between late 2024 and early 2025. An unprecedented X class solar storm, accompanied by massive coronal mass ejections (CMEs), may set back societies by months, years or even decades.

The biggest incident of this kind in recorded history, registering X45 on the solar flare scale, was the Carrington Event which occurred on 1 Sept 1859. It caused widespread disruptions to telegraph systems, particularly in North America and Europe. Telegraph lines experienced voltage surges and fires broke out at several telegraph offices. A few telegraph operators were even electrocuted. These telegraph systems, which were in their infancy, were quickly rebuilt. A repeat event in our hyperconnected world however may simply be catastrophic.

To begin with, I am not sure if Elon Musk's constellation of Starlink satellites -- numbering anywhere between 4,000 and 6,000 -- can withstand anything stronger than an X30 solar flare. A relatively mild solar storm had doomed 40 of them in 2022.

Only remote or rural areas, which are relatively unplugged from our hyper-wired world, stand a chance to revert to some sort of normalcy after a Carrington Event. Humans can learn to live without the Internet, electricity and transportation systems relatively quickly but they cannot survive without immediate access to food and water. Why do you think billionaires, who relentlessly promote destructive globalist agendas, are building survival bunkers in remote areas around the world?

Those living in cities, without skills to source, generate or process food and water, will face mayhem unless utilities and telecoms systems are restored within three days. Humans can survive without water for up to three days but the cumulative psychological impact will be incalculable. As the US writer Alfred Henry Lewis once noted: ""There are only nine meals (i.e. three days) between mankind and anarchy."" This was said back in 1906, when societies were far more cohesive and resilient.

An entire generation today, without real life skills and hopelessly hooked on instant multimedia gratification, would crack much sooner than three days. One can only imagine the hordes of zombies straggling along various streets, trying to come to grips with life without Twitter, WhatsApp and Instagram. The vulnerable will face hordes of looters and assorted anarchists who will be razing down down entire neighbourhood blocks when they are not attacking people at random. It will be reminiscent of scenes from The Purge franchise.

Without access to functioning telecommunications systems, it would be next to impossible for police forces and national guard units to restore law and order across the board. Even if emergency systems are deployed, law and order personnel will likely face makeshift roadblocks and attacks from anarchist elements. We were given a preview of this during the George Floyd ""protests"". Hospitals, to the extent where they are accessible, would be inundated with the sick and dying.

Martial law may only benefit high value individuals who will be exfiltrated -- to the extent possible -- from their urban hellholes to safe havens in improvised military camps or makeshift security zones. These operations may be synchronised with the targeted elimination of identified dissidents. Say goodbye to your favourite Substack authors if and when this happens.

Urban Prepper Traps

Those who had stockpiled essential items in their city dwellings will face new and unforeseen dilemmas. Cooking food from stored items would only alert the dazed, angry and hungry coexisting nearby. Flushing the toilet even once a day would alert neighbours to the fact that someone has a ready supply of water in their vicinity. In the midst of this pandemonium, highways would be gridlocked by vehicles crawling out of urban zones. Then again, if an X30+ solar flare does strike, most vehicles would have been knocked out of commission. This is the acid test for a genuine solar storm incident. You have been forewarned.

The scenarios I depicted above are nothing new. They have been regularly gamed out in various military exercises as well as in movies and novels. During this period, repeated flares of a magnitude exceeding X30 or greater may destroy all backup systems that had been stored in military Faraday cages. Urban dwellers in Developed Nations can recover from a one-time superflare but most will not survive repeated bombardments from the sun.

But what if a takedown of utilities and telecommunications is conveniently blamed on a superflare, accompanied by spectacular auroras around the world? What if many of the recent auroras witnessed from May 10-13 were not the result of solar flares? What if many of them were the result of High-frequency Active Auroral Research Program (HAARP) experiments?

According to expose-news.com, several AI chatbots had concluded that many of the auroras witnessed recently may have been the result of HAARP experiments conducted from May 8-10. To the perennial sceptic, these visual extravaganzas appear like a trial run for something more sinister.

Engineered Cyberattacks

Socioeconomic dams across the Developed World are about to burst. The system can no longer be fixed. The global coronapsychosis was a fiasco of sorts; trust in governments has hit an all time low; and it is now time to unleash a new global false flag.

UK Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden recently advised his fellow citizens to build ""national resilience"" by stockpiling food and water that can last for at least three days, along with candles, torches and hand crank radios which can provide a degree of ""analogue capabilities"".

According to a Daily Mail report dated 21 May 2024, these contingency measures will help citizens deal with ""potential emergencies such as prolonged power cuts, cyber attacks and floods"". On the surface, some of these threats have been linked to a ""new axis of anti-western states including China, Russia, North Korea and Iran"".

Dowden had announced an ""emergency alert"" system in 2023 which will dispatch warnings to millions of mobile phones in the event of an ongoing or impending national crisis. The UK Cabinet was reportedly inspired by Finland's ""72-hour concept"" plan for coping in situations where ""society's services are disrupted or even discontinued"".

Now, here is where things get a little murky. The Finns have also been encouraged to tape up their windows and doors in the event of a national emergency and to await instructions via radios. (Note: The Finnish plan is generic).

As far as I know, taping up exterior gaps in a dwelling is only resorted to under two extraordinary circumstances: a pandemic outbreak/biological attack or a chemical attack. Are the global parasites planning to unleash Disease X?

Just how does a massive cyberattack, solar superflare or an environmental calamity gel with duct tapes? Sure, some chemical plants may suffer catastrophic meltdowns when their cybersystems are compromised but any spillout would be limited to a few urban areas. It will not be a global event. Furthermore, taping up windows and doors would be of no use when a nuclear plant suffers a meltdown. Think of Chernobyl for starters.

But the real goal here seems more ominous. The groundwork for these series of events has already been laid out. In late 2021, when it was apparent that the coronapsychosis was fizzling out, the World Economic Forum (WEF) declared that the world was ""in the midst of a 'cyber pandemic'.""

Nothing of that sort happened. A surge in cyberattacks is not the same as a ""cyber pandemic"". Were hospitals which were allegedly overburdened by mass hospitalisations during the ""pandemic"" subjected to cyberattacks? I thought these were the rare situations which psychopathic hackers typically drooled over?

According to WEF supremo Klaus Schwab, the ""Covid-19 crisis"" would be seen as ""a small disturbance in comparison to a major cyberattack"". Oh, so there may be a bigger global disruption ahead?

All the supposedly antagonistic stakeholders have been bought over. The opening session of the 2021 WEF cyber polygon pow-wow was kicked off by Russia's Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin and the event featured a heavy Russian representation. Rather coincidentally, Russia is on the forefront of the Digital ID agenda.

Another thing to note about Cyber Polygon is its logo. Have we not seen iterations of it elsewhere?

You would think that the Russian security services would have raised a few red flags over an event logo that smacked of pedophile symbolism. These symbols were featured in a 2007 FBI bulletin and they were compiled by its Cyber Division's Innocent Images National Initiative. Somehow the FBI does not maintain a link to this document.

'The Great Blackout'

I believe our global puppet masters are planning to launch a coordinated series of cyberattacks worldwide via digital kill switches.

During this short window period of confusion and mayhem, these attacks will be initially blamed on the ""new axis of anti-western states"". Even Hamas may be blamed for this ""attack on humanity"". Later, the narrative may shift in an attempt to avert WW3. A few HAARP-engineered auroras around the world may rapidly create a new global consensus. The cyberattacks will eventually be blamed on a clique of ""anarchists"" worldwide who took advantage of solar disruptions and the accompanying human misery.

Your bank accounts and pension funds, in the meantime, would have disappeared overnight. Your Bitcoins will be worthless. Many will die in their homes, in the streets and in non-functioning hospitals. Any return to societal normalcy would be contingent on acquiring national Digital IDs which will enable the provision of essential products (i.e. food to medicine) via Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). Without Digital IDs, you will not have access to essential services like the Internet or any other form of mobile communications. There will be promises to restore your bank accounts and pension funds but it will soon transpire that the solar flares, rioters and hackers had ""erased"" them altogether. As I had written last year:

You may have been very careful with your finances; you may be free of debts; free from any outstanding loan for any of the properties (houses, cars, farms etc.) you had purchased but you will no longer own them within six years. You may even have millions in the bank, along with a well-cushioned pension fund, but they will no longer be available at your disposal. Rights to everything that you own will be steadily transferred to a national coordinating authority which in turn will report to a centralised international body. There is nowhere to run in the emerging planetary prison.

Day-to-day functions of the Great Reset Society will be mediated by blockchain and social credits. As for the global oligarchy, special CBDC credits will be dispensed for the management of sprawling enterprises that are deemed vital to society. It will be communism on digital steroids; a dynamic form of communism that will finally ""work"" after many failed attempts.

I would like to call this engineered event the ""Great Blackout"" and it is arguably the most expedient pathway towards the Great Reset.

However, there is one event which will throw a planetary-sized spanner into this hypothetical globalist machination. Ironically, it will be a real solar superflare in the form of either a Carrington Event or the much more destructive Miyake Event. Digital IDs and CBDCs would be useless after this event, for society would have to revert to a pre-digital modus vivendi for a considerable period of time.

A solar superflare may set back societies by decades, along with a much reduced global population.

The project will start in 2026 as part of lifetime extension-related investments at the site.

The Lovissa plant is a dual-unit facility with a total net capacity of about 1,014 MW (Figure 1). Unit 1 was commissioned in 1977 and Unit 2 in 1980. The plant is located about 100 kilometers east of Helsinki and provided about 10% of Finland's electricity production in 2023, with the units operating at capacity factors of 89.79% and 92.32%, respectively. The modernization of the turbines is expected to increase the total capacity of the plant by approximately 38 MW.

In February 2023, the Finnish government granted a new operating license for the power plant until 2050. As a result, Fortum expects to perform continuous improvements to ensure reliable electricity production for at least the next 26 years. Fortum said it has invested approximately €200 million in refurbishing the Loviisa power plant over the past five years, and it estimated that investments related to the lifetime extension will amount to about €1 billion by 2050.

""Extending the lifetime of the power plant is a major investment with a positive impact -- both economically and in terms of employment. Modernizing the low-pressure turbines is our first significant investment in preparation for the lifetime extension. Our aim is for the power plant to operate during the new operating license period just as stably, reliably, and safely as it has so far,"" Sasu Valkamo, senior vice president of the Loviisa power plant, said in a statement.

Doosan Škoda Power was selected as the supplier for the low-pressure turbine job. The modernization will be carried out in conjunction with normal annual outages. In the turbine project, eight low-pressure turbine housings and their internal parts will be renewed. This particular modernization is targeting only the turbines, so it won't impact the reactor plant or nuclear safety. The project is expected to significantly improve the efficiency of the turbine plant's electricity production without increasing the thermal output of the reactor.

""Doosan Škoda Power is a seasoned turbine supplier, and we have good experiences working with them. In our previous modernization project, Doosan Škoda Power also supplied us with high-pressure turbines,"" Valkamo said.

Radek Trněný, head of Sales Nuclear at Doosan Škoda Power, said, ""Fortum is our long-term customer and we are very proud to be part of this new important modernization project at the Loviisa nuclear power plant. Nuclear power is a strategic segment for us, and this contract is further confirmation that we are on the right track.""

Doosan Škoda Power is a leading global manufacturer and supplier of power plant machinery, especially steam turbine-generator sets with outputs between 3 MW and 1,200 MW. The company is part of the Doosan Group, which supplies technologies and services to customers all over the world.

Fortum, meanwhile, has more than 150 power plants in its fleet. In addition to the Lovissa plant, Fortum also owns shares in Olkiluoto Units 1, 2, and 3, Oskarshamn Unit 3, and Forsmark Units 1, 2, and 3. Fortum also has hydro, combined heat and power (CHP), solar, and wind power plants. It touts a 98% CO-free electricity generation portfolio.

The current Remuneration Policy of the governing bodies was approved by the Annual General Meeting on 14 April 2020. The Remuneration Policy must be presented to the General Meeting at least every four years or whenever it is materially amended.

The Shareholders' Nomination Committee proposes to the AGM, that the members of the Board of Directors shall be paid a yearly remuneration consisting of a cash remuneration and a share remuneration as follows:

The remuneration in shares is proposed to be paid in such a way that the members of the Board of Directors are given either shares that are in the Company's possession or new shares issued by the Company without consideration or alternatively shares will be acquired from the regulated market (Nasdaq Helsinki Ltd) at a price determined by public trading in the name and on behalf of the member of the Board of Directors.

The members of the Board of Directors shall not dispose such shares during their membership or before six months has passed from the expiry of the said membership.

It is proposed to not pay a separate attendance fee to the members of the Board of Directors. The proposed attendance fees for the members of the committees of the Board of Directors are:

Reasonable travel expenses caused by Board meetings or committee meetings are proposed to be paid in accordance with the instructions of the tax authority. The per diem allowances are included in the attendance fee.

The Shareholders' Nomination Committee proposes that the Board of Directors shall have four (4) members.

The Shareholders' Nomination Committee proposes, that Hannu Lehto and Jani Nokkanen, at their consent, shall be re-elected as members of the Board of Directors.

Tarja Teppo and Timo Okkonen, at their consent, are proposed to be elected as new members of the Board of Directors.

Okkonen currently works as an entrepreneur and advisor to the management in many nuclear energy projects in Sweden and Finland. Timo Okkonen's strengths lie in business strategy, change management and digital solutions. Okkonen knows well the development prospects of the energy sector and the authority field.

The new candidates for the Board of Directors are independent of the Company and its significant shareholders.

Eero Sihvonen has informed the Shareholders' Nomination Committee that he will no longer be available to serve on the Board of Directors of the Company after the AGM.

The Board of Directors proposes to the AGM that remuneration for the auditor be paid according to an invoice approved by the Company. The same is proposed to apply to the auditor's fees relating to the assurance of the Company's statutory sustainability report for the financial period 2024.

On the recommendation of the Audit Committee, the Board of Directors proposes to the AGM that audit firm KPMG Oy Ab would be re-elected as the auditor. KPMG Oy Ab has notified the Company that in the event it will be elected as auditor, Authorised Public Accountant, KHT, Pekka Alatalo, will act as the responsible auditor. The proposed auditor has given his consent to be elected.

If the Company shall also prepare its first statutory sustainability report for the financial period 2024, and if KPMG Oy Ab is elected as the Company's auditor, it shall also provide the assurance for the statutory sustainability report for the financial period 2024 in accordance with the transitional provisions of the amended Finnish Limited Liability Companies Act (1252/2023).

Background to the proposal

Lehto has announced on 29 May 2024 that Lehto's Board of Directors has decided on a plan according to which Lehto will focus its business on real estate energy solutions and electricity storages (the ""Energy Construction Business""), and will seek to divest the prefabrication of building industry components of its subsidiary Lehto Components Oy.

Energy Construction Business is described in more detail in the stock exchange release published on 29 May 2024.

Proposal of the Board of Directors

For the transition to the Energy Construction Business, the Board of Directors proposes to the AGM that, the section of the Articles of Association concerning the sector be amended to read as follows:

""3 SECTOR

The company is involved in construction contracting, construction work, construction consulting, property development, property management, property investment, manufacturing of construction materials and prefabricated building elements and operations related to these as well as energy services, energy storage and distribution, energy saving services and ownership and sale of energy production equipment. The company may carry out its business through its operative Group companies. As the Group's parent company, Lehto Group Plc may be in charge of Group organisation, financing, purchases and other such administrative tasks.""

The Board of Directors proposes to the AGM that the Board of Directors be authorised to decide on the repurchase of the Company's own shares as one or several instalments using non-restricted shareholders' equity or without consideration, such that the maximum quantity repurchased be 19,556,568 shares. On the date of the notice of meeting, the proposed quantity equals approximately 22 per cent of the total amount of Company's shares. The shares shall be repurchased through public trading organised by Nasdaq Helsinki Ltd in accordance with its rules or using another method. If shares are not repurchased without consideration, the consideration paid for the shares should be based on the market price at the time of repurchase.

The authorisation also entitles the Board of Directors to decide on the repurchase of shares in different proportions than the proportion to the shares owned by the shareholders (directed repurchase) with weighty financial reasons. Shares may be repurchased to implement arrangements associated with the share based incentive systems, remuneration of the Board of Directors or Company's business operations, or to be otherwise transferred or to be cancelled. The repurchased shares can also be held by the Company itself.

The Board of Directors is authorised to make decisions on all other conditions and circumstances pertaining to the repurchase of own shares. The repurchase of own shares against payment reduces the non-restricted shareholders' equity.

The authorisation is proposed to remain valid until the end of the following annual general meeting but in any case, not longer than 30 June 2025. The proposed authorisation shall replace the Company's previous authorisation to repurchase own shares granted by the AGM on 30 March 2023.

The Board of Directors proposes that the AGM authorise the Board of Directors to decide on the issue of a maximum of 39,271,653 shares through a share issue or by granting options or other special rights entitling to shares as one or several instalments. On the date of the notice of meeting, the proposed quantity equals approximately 45 per cent of the total amount of Company's shares. The authorisation includes the right to issue either new shares or own shares held by the Company, either against payment or without consideration. New shares can be issued and own shares held by the Company transferred in deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive subscription right (directed issue) if there is a weighty financial reason for the Company to do so and, in case of an issue without consideration, an especially weighty reason for both the Company and in regard to the interests of all shareholders in the Company. The Board of Directors is authorised to decide on all other conditions and circumstances pertaining to a share issue, to the granting of special rights entitling to shares, and to the transfer of shares.

The authorisation may be used, inter alia, to execute Company's share-based incentive systems, to pay the remuneration of the Board of Directors, to strengthen the capital structure, to implement financing arrangements, to expand the ownership base, to use as consideration in transactions or other arrangements associated with the Company's business operations, or when the Company purchases assets associated with its operations.

The authorisation is proposed to be valid until the end of the following annual general meeting but in any case, no later than 30 June 2025. The authorisation shall replace previous share issue and option authorisations granted by the AGM on 30 March 2023, but not the other authorisations regarding share issue and issue of special rights granted at this AGM.

The Board of Directors proposes that the AGM authorise the Board of Directors to decide on the issuance of a maximum of 75,000,000 shares through a share issue or by granting options or other special rights entitling to shares in one or several instalments. On the date of the notice of meeting, the proposed quantity equals approximately 86 per cent of the total amount of Company's shares.

The authorisation entitles the Board of Directors to decide on the issuance of shares as well as special rights entitling to shares in different proportions than the proportion to the shares owned by the shareholders (directed issue). The authorisation includes the right to issue either new shares or own shares held by the Company, either against payment or without consideration. The Board of Directors is authorised to decide on all other conditions and circumstances pertaining to the share issue and to the granting of special rights entitling to shares.

The authorisation may be used to amend the terms of the Company's EUR 15 million convertible bond so that convertible bond may be converted into shares of the Company with conversion ratio which deviates from the current terms of such convertible bond.

The authorisation is proposed to be valid until the end of the following annual general meeting but in any case, no later than 30 June 2025. This authorisation does not replace any other authorisations regarding share issue and issue of special rights granted at this AGM.

This notice of the AGM, including all the proposals for the decisions on the matters on the agenda of the AGM, is available on Company's website at lehto.fi/en/agm.

France's first nuclear plant for a quarter century is finally going ahead at Flamanville on the coast of Normandy, 12 years late and six times over budget.

EDF has loaded the fuel of the giant European Pressurised Reactor or EPR1. The first nuclear reaction will take place within weeks, reaching full power of 1.65 gigawatts (GW) by year's end.

It will be the most powerful reactor on the planet, to be joined eventually by two sister reactors at Hinkley Point, and another at Sizewell C if anybody can find the money.

To fans, Flamanville is an ultra-safe feat of advanced engineering, with three layers of protective barriers. It can withstand an earthquake, a tsunami, a head-on crash by an Airbus A380, or even (arguably) a meltdown of the core. It is built to last 60 years, perhaps a century.

To critics, it is a ruinous misadventure, the ultimate over-refinement of obsolete fission technology that can never compete on a commercial basis. Delays have left France dependent on old reactors that are literally falling apart. EDF has racked up debts of €54bn (£46bn) and had to be renationalised in 2022.

To those of us in the middle - friendly to nuclear, if cheap enough - it is striking that Korea seems able to roll out workhorse reactors relatively quickly at half the cost. Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power's modified APR1000 reactor was certified in Europe last year.

Flamanville 3 began in 2007 with an expected cost of €3.3bn. France's supreme audit institution, the Cour des Comptes, says the final tally is €19.1bn, calling it an ""operational failure"", undertaken prematurely and with hubris.

""It has been an industrial catastrophe. I never thought they would even forget how to make a concrete slab,"" said Bernard Laponche, a French nuclear veteran and doyen of the dissidents.

All is forgiven, apparently, even though a parallel EPR1 plant at Olkiluoto in Finland - opened last year - had similar delays and cost overruns, and even though the Taishan I variant in China had to shut down for a year due to damaged fuel rods.

Emmanuel Macron began his presidency by closing a working reactor near the German border in order to please Angela Merkel. He had a Damascene conversion after Putin's invasion of Ukraine.

Mr Macron now wants to build 14 modified EPR2 reactors - supposedly cheaper - in a repeat of France's ""dash for nuclear"" under premier Pierre Messmer in 1974.

It is a heroic undertaking for a country with a structural budget deficit of 5pc of GDP and a debt ratio stuck at 112pc, with rating agencies on the prowl. Much the same can be said about Britain's nuclear renaissance, targeting 24 GW by mid-century.

The bet is that the average cost per EPR will fall by 30pc as the series rolls out a scale. That would cut the putative bill for Sizewell C to £85 MWh in today's money, or lower if you treat it as a 60-year venture in accounting terms. Reste à voir, as the French say.

Valerie Faudon, head of the French Association of Nuclear Energy, said Flamanville went wrong because France had lost its industrial skills from long neglect.

""We got hit twice: we no longer had the know-how to build new reactors; and we were working on an entirely new model. Flamanville has been an investment to relearn how to do it,"" she said.

The catalogue of errors began from the start. Stray rocks from dynamite blasting rained on the Flamanville 2 reactor nearby. Regulators discovered that the concrete pillars were ""pockmarked with holes like a Swiss cheese"".

The steel reactor vessel had unsafe levels of carbon content. A Japanese company was brought in to build a new one. The saga went on and on.

No doubt lessons have been learned, but Hinkley Point also faces spiralling costs and long delays a decade later. Third time lucky, perhaps?

Mr Laponche says the Messmer episode of the 1970s was a panic reaction to the first Opec crisis, a time when France had oil-based power plants. It led to fevered calls for energy sovereignty.

Messmer launched six reactors a year with theatrical gusto, egged on by vested interests. ""There was a mafia aspect of cronyism in this, as always,"" he said.

The numbers were justified by a make-believe extrapolation of power demand, assumed to be doubling every 10 years. ""It was ridiculous, but they got everybody to swallow it,"" he said.

The demand did not exist. France ended up selling excess electricity to Germany at give away prices.

""They knew we couldn't sell it anywhere else: they got cheap power and we got the safety risk and the radioactive waste. We never recouped our investment costs,"" he said.

""Macron's speeches today are almost a carbon copy of Messmer's speeches 50 years ago. It is all about energy security again, with climate change on top, and people just go along with it. The parallel is uncanny,"" he said.

Mr Laponche said the early reactors were built to last 30 years. They were extended to 40. The new EPRs were supposed to arrive in time to take the baton, but Flamanville drastically upset this calculation. In the meantime, France had missed the boat on renewables.

In the years since work began on Flamanville, the EU has installed 476 GW of solar and wind, roughly equal to 74 EPR reactors once you adjust for apples and oranges.

France has had to keep its old reactors going ever longer beyond their safe industrial life. The crunch hit in 2022 when half the national fleet of 56 reactors was out of action, some due to drought but mostly due to corrosion or fractures. This collided with Putin's war. EDF had to import power at exorbitant spot prices to cover the shortfall.

The question that French and British governments must answer as they commit to colossal projects that will not come on stream until the late 2030s or 2040s, and will then bind us for 60 years, is what happens if commercial nuclear fusion comes good over the next decade, as most fusion insiders now think probable.

Fusion has minimal radioactive waste. It is so safe that plants can be built anywhere like a hospital. Compare that with fission. German authorities began cleaning up the giant Greifswald nuclear plant in 1995. They are still cleaning it up. The decommissioning cost has reached €6.6bn.

There is much to be said in favour of visionary industrial plans. They create a motivating sense of national purpose. They generate spin-off technology. They are certainly better than hand-wringing defeatism on everything. But cost matters and technology is changing the energy equation very rapidly.

Let us hope that this Anglo-French bet on the biggest reactors of all time is not another Concorde.",telegraph.co.uk,news,The Telegraph,Ambrose Evans-Pritchard,-0.1686274509803921,454678926,1,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/business/2024/05/28/TELEMMGLPICT000376713981_17168983817730_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQf0Rf_Wk3V23H2268P_XkPxc.jpeg?impolicy=logo-overlay,

Intelligence experts have warned that Europe is under a growing threat from Russian sabotage operations, and believe those operations aim to secure concrete military results in Ukraine, political and economic costs to Europe, and nuisance value.

""We are experiencing the early stages of a systematic activation of Russian sleeper cells worldwide,"" Joseph Fitsanakis, professor of Intelligence and National Security Studies at Coastal Carolina University, told Al Jazeera. ""This is an unprecedented phenomenon in Western post-war history.""

The Financial Times this month cited intelligence of imminent Russian hybrid operations in Germany, Sweden and the United Kingdom, and a report from Chatham House, a London-based think tank, detailed incidents across Europe that ""match predictions of what Russia would attempt to do in advance of an open conflict with NATO"".

The author of that report told Al Jazeera that Russia has a scattershot of aims, including causing trouble just to see what will happen.

""Russia has this view of security where anything they do to damage us is relatively speaking good for them because it makes them stronger,"" said Keir Giles, a senior consulting fellow at Chatham House. ""That in itself is an incentive to do things which are disruptive.""

In late April, two Finnair flights were forced to return home after GPS jamming prevented them from landing at Tartu, Estonia's second-largest city. The airline suspended flights for a month to find an alternative landing system.

The Finnish transport agency blamed Moscow.

""It is possible that the interference observed in aviation currently [is] most likely a side effect of Russia's self-protection. In practice, self-protection interference is used to prevent the navigation and control of drones controlled by [global navigation satellite systems] or mobile frequencies,"" it said in a statement. ""The interference has not only remained within Russia's borders, but has also reached Finnish territory.""

Giles explained, that the GPS jamming ""may have started with absolutely nothing in mind with regard to disrupting air traffic across Europe ... But once it became clear that those disruptive effects are substantial and there's no downside to Russia for doing it, then there's no reason why they shouldn't expand.""

This nuisance approach may not sound alarming for European security, but at the very least it suggests that Russia feels no constraints against performing any disruption of which it is capable.

And the disruption goes well beyond nuisance.

Soviet operatives and their proxies would typically target network industries such as electric cables, power stations, pipelines, transport and telecommunications, Daniela Richterova, a senior lecturer in Intelligence Studies at the War Studies Department of King's College London, told Al Jazeera.

That is precisely the kind of infrastructure that has reportedly been attacked.

""We're seeing this happen at a time of escalation. That was a key part of [Soviet] doctrine, that sabotage operations were meant to be used also in a time of peace if necessary, but especially in times of war, and they were meant to undermine the enemy's resolve, power and war effort.""

The use of proxies is also a telltale sign, she said.

Last month, Germany arrested two dual nationals on suspicion of plotting to plant explosives at US military facilities in Bavaria. The UK has arrested several people this year on similar suspicions. The people arrested are not considered to be members of the Russian General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU), which typically plans sabotage operations.

The GRU is also suspected of acting directly.

In early May, NATO said GRU had launched cyberattacks against critical infrastructure in Germany, the Czech Republic, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Sweden. All of them, along with Finland and Estonia, are among the Nordic group of countries that comprise Russia's most vocal critics and Ukraine's most dedicated allies in Europe. The GRU is also believed to field 20 to 40 operations officers, said experts.

Russian government officials generally do not comment on their own covert operations, but on Tuesday Putin reciprocated Western accusations to mark the anniversary of the FSB, Russia's Federal Security Service, whose duties include guarding the borders.

""Largely due to the resolve of the border security troops, numerous attempts to break into the Russian territory by mercenaries, traitors and enemy sabotage groups have been thwarted,"" said Putin, referring to incursions on Russian territory by anti-Putin Russian militias operating from Ukrainian soil.

""Those who planned these terrorist raids on our land have miscalculated and were met with a harsh and brutal rebuff,"" said Putin in a video address.

Russia's ultimate aim is military advantage, said Fitsanakis.

""Currently the Russian sabotage campaign appears to be aimed primarily at disrupting the military supply chain from the West to Ukraine.""

That means stopping the flow of weapons, or destroying the weapons themselves, and Russia's attempts to do so go back a decade. Last month, Czech police said the detonation of 63 tonnes of ordnance intended for Ukraine at a warehouse in Vrbetice in October 2014 was the work of GRU.

Front-line states Poland and Romania, from whose borders all war materiel enters Ukraine, are at obvious risk, said Fitsanakis, but earlier stages in the supply chain are equally critical. That includes Norwegian logistics facilities, ports on the US eastern seaboard, and military instructors in Darwin, Australia.

""A typical example is the port of Alexandroupolis in Greece, which the US Department of Defense credits as providing Washington with 'strategic access' to its Ukrainian ally,"" said Fitsanakis. ""Until recently, the port in this small northern Greek city was far removed from the epicentre of global geopolitics. As a result, security had to be elevated drastically within weeks.""

In addition to military targets, Fitsanakis added, ""Their skills are evolving with an eye to intensification, in case of an all-out war with NATO.""

In that case, sabotage operations would spread to the full gamut of network industries, aiming to shut down travel, power and telecommunications overnight, sending civilian society back to the 19th century and creating political pressure on governments to sue for peace - what Fitsanakis calls, ""mass-scale psychological objectives"".

Early this year, a series of NATO military chiefs publicly warned that the latest intelligence suggested a Russia-NATO war in the next five to eight years was more likely than had previously been thought, and European militaries should prepare accordingly.

EU governments have stepped up long-term contracts to defence industries since January, but it is more difficult to provide security over sprawling infrastructure.

The prime example of this is the North Sea, said Christian Bueger, a professor of Maritime Security at the University of Copenhagen.

""The North Sea today is just a dense industrialised infrastructure environment where there's multiple points of failure,"" he told Al Jazeera.

It's not just the pipelines, data and electricity cables that criss-cross the shallow sea floor, which have already come under suspected attack - most recently when a Russian-operated Chinese merchant vessel dragged its anchors on the sea floor, rupturing the Baltic Connector gas pipeline and telecoms cables between Estonia and Finland last October.

""We are also talking about a lot of emerging infrastructure,"" Bueger said. ""In many ways, the future of the green energy transition hangs on what we can do in the North Sea.""

That includes future offshore wind parks, hydrogen pipelines, and disused oilfields that are intended for carbon storage.

""We haven't even started to consider what the security implication of carbon storage will be,"" Bueger said.

Compared with protection, disruption is frighteningly easy. ""You don't need a submarine,"" said Bueger. ""Most of the time it will be easier to do it from the surface to hide in the official traffic ... you can do it with divers, you can do it with anchors ... you can also potentially do it with submersibles and autonomous vessels.""

NATO has started a subsea infrastructure protection centre.

France and Italy are co-ordinating on a system of marine sensors. The Royal Navy is acquiring an underwater surveillance vessel. But the biggest problem is jurisdictional, said Bueger, who is involved in several transnational projects to build information-sharing protocols across the military, coastguard, law enforcement and shipping industry in EU NATO countries.

""There's been a complete and abject failure by Western leaderships to explain to their electorates just what is at stake,"" said Chatham House's Giles.

""It's telling that the primary instinct from a lot of people seems to be, 'What other defensive measures can we take?' that are going to make life more expensive and inconvenient across Europe,"" he said. ""It's all defensive, it's all reactive. There's nothing apparently being suggested to deal with the root of the problem, which lies in Moscow.""

There are plenty of self-imposed constraints Europe could do away with to push back against Russia. Ukraine has pleaded with Germany to provide long-range Taurus missiles to attack Russian infrastructure - something Germany resists for fear of provoking a nuclear attack.

A growing chorus of legal experts says Europe may confiscate 210 billion euros ($228bn) in EU-held Russian central bank assets. France's President Emmanuel Macron has raised the prospect of sending NATO troops to man Ukraine's rear, and Estonia's Kaja Kallas says some have already done so. Nordic and Baltic countries fearing attack are already putting their economies on a partial war footing, but Germany finds itself unable to overcome legal constraints to spend more on the military.

Giles said all this allows Russia to steal a march on Europe, ""[Russia's] idea of how much you can do without precipitating conflict has been precipitated by Western countries not setting boundaries.""

""The fact that there's no downside is the defining factor of how Russia has seen sub-threshold operations over the last decade.""",aljazeera.com,news,Al Jazeera Online,John T Psaropoulos,0.07450980392156858,454674344,5,https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2018-11-02T160626Z_951838612_RC191D3F4740_RTRMADP_3_BRITAIN-RUSSIA-PUTIN-1716974507.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,eng-9600352

EDF has loaded the fuel of the giant European Pressurised Reactor or EPR1. The first nuclear reaction will take place within weeks, reaching full power of 1.65 gigawatts (GW) by year's end.

It will be the most powerful reactor on the planet, to be joined eventually by two sister reactors at Hinkley Point, and another at Sizewell C if anybody can find the money.

To fans, Flamanville is an ultra-safe feat of advanced engineering, with three layers of protective barriers. It can withstand an earthquake, a tsunami, a head-on crash by an Airbus A380, or even (arguably) a meltdown of the core. It is built to last 60 years, perhaps a century.

To critics, it is a ruinous misadventure, the ultimate over-refinement of obsolete fission technology that can never compete on a commercial basis. Delays have left France dependent on old reactors that are literally falling apart. EDF has racked up debts of €54bn (£46bn) and had to be renationalised in 2022.

To those of us in the middle - friendly to nuclear, if cheap enough - it is striking that Korea seems able to roll out workhorse reactors relatively quickly at half the cost. Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power's modified APR1000 reactor was certified in Europe last year.

Flamanville 3 began in 2007 with an expected cost of €3.3bn. France's supreme audit institution, the Cour des Comptes, says the final tally is €19.1bn, calling it an ""operational failure"", undertaken prematurely and with hubris.

""It has been an industrial catastrophe. I never thought they would even forget how to make a concrete slab,"" said Bernard Laponche, a French nuclear veteran and doyen of the dissidents.

All is forgiven, apparently, even though a parallel EPR1 plant at Olkiluoto in Finland - opened last year - had similar delays and cost overruns, and even though the Taishan I variant in China had to shut down for a year due to damaged fuel rods.

Emmanuel Macron began his presidency by closing a working reactor near the German border in order to please Angela Merkel. He had a Damascene conversion after Putin's invasion of Ukraine.

Mr Macron now wants to build 14 modified EPR2 reactors - supposedly cheaper - in a repeat of France's ""dash for nuclear"" under premier Pierre Messmer in 1974.

It is a heroic undertaking for a country with a structural budget deficit of 5pc of GDP and a debt ratio stuck at 112pc, with rating agencies on the prowl. Much the same can be said about Britain's nuclear renaissance, targeting 24 GW by mid-century.

The bet is that the average cost per EPR will fall by 30pc as the series rolls out a scale. That would cut the putative bill for Sizewell C to £85 MWh in today's money, or lower if you treat it as a 60-year venture in accounting terms. Reste à voir, as the French say.

Valerie Faudon, head of the French Association of Nuclear Energy, said Flamanville went wrong because France had lost its industrial skills from long neglect.

""We got hit twice: we no longer had the know-how to build new reactors; and we were working on an entirely new model. Flamanville has been an investment to relearn how to do it,"" she said.

The catalogue of errors began from the start. Stray rocks from dynamite blasting rained on the Flamanville 2 reactor nearby. Regulators discovered that the concrete pillars were ""pockmarked with holes like a Swiss cheese"".

The steel reactor vessel had unsafe levels of carbon content. A Japanese company was brought in to build a new one. The saga went on and on.

No doubt lessons have been learned, but Hinkley Point also faces spiralling costs and long delays a decade later. Third time lucky, perhaps?

Mr Laponche says the Messmer episode of the 1970s was a panic reaction to the first Opec crisis, a time when France had oil-based power plants. It led to fevered calls for energy sovereignty.

Messmer launched six reactors a year with theatrical gusto, egged on by vested interests. ""There was a mafia aspect of cronyism in this, as always,"" he said.

The numbers were justified by a make-believe extrapolation of power demand, assumed to be doubling every 10 years. ""It was ridiculous, but they got everybody to swallow it,"" he said.

The demand did not exist. France ended up selling excess electricity to Germany at give away prices.

""They knew we couldn't sell it anywhere else: they got cheap power and we got the safety risk and the radioactive waste. We never recouped our investment costs,"" he said.

""Macron's speeches today are almost a carbon copy of Messmer's speeches 50 years ago. It is all about energy security again, with climate change on top, and people just go along with it. The parallel is uncanny,"" he said.

Mr Laponche said the early reactors were built to last 30 years. They were extended to 40. The new EPRs were supposed to arrive in time to take the baton, but Flamanville drastically upset this calculation. In the meantime, France had missed the boat on renewables.

In the years since work began on Flamanville, the EU has installed 476 GW of solar and wind, roughly equal to 74 EPR reactors once you adjust for apples and oranges.

France has had to keep its old reactors going ever longer beyond their safe industrial life. The crunch hit in 2022 when half the national fleet of 56 reactors was out of action, some due to drought but mostly due to corrosion or fractures. This collided with Putin's war. EDF had to import power at exorbitant spot prices to cover the shortfall.

The question that French and British governments must answer as they commit to colossal projects that will not come on stream until the late 2030s or 2040s, and will then bind us for 60 years, is what happens if commercial nuclear fusion comes good over the next decade, as most fusion insiders now think probable.

Fusion has minimal radioactive waste. It is so safe that plants can be built anywhere like a hospital. Compare that with fission. German authorities began cleaning up the giant Greifswald nuclear plant in 1995. They are still cleaning it up. The decommissioning cost has reached €6.6bn.

There is much to be said in favour of visionary industrial plans. They create a motivating sense of national purpose. They generate spin-off technology. They are certainly better than hand-wringing defeatism on everything. But cost matters and technology is changing the energy equation very rapidly.

Let us hope that this Anglo-French bet on the biggest reactors of all time is not another Concorde.",yahoo.com,news,Yahoo,,-0.05098039215686279,454666843,1,https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png,

Executive Summary

We are at the beginning of a new age. The accelerating pace of artificial-intelligence development presents new opportunities. Every industry will be profoundly reshaped by this general-purpose technology, and discovering novel solutions to the world's most intractable challenges, such as climate change, will become possible. Governments have a unique opportunity to take action.

As demand for AI has grown, so too has demand for energy. This has created strains on national energy networks, which need to be managed in the short term. But in the medium to long term, the two systems need not be in tension. Instead, each can offer the chance of success in the other. The revolutions taking place in AI and energy are interconnected.

With the right strategy, these twin transitions can create a positive loop in which AI speeds up the energy transition while subsequent clean-energy production fuels further technological innovation, unleashing investments into compute infrastructure and clean technologies.

Many actors in the private sector are already aware of this interplay between clean-energy developments and innovation advancements. Developers are intensely focused on cutting energy demand, while companies such as Nvidia, Microsoft and Google are investing heavily in reducing consumption and increasing clean energy. Political leaders need to continue to create the incentives for companies to move in the direction of the twin transitions with a policy agenda that aims to minimise AI's energy and carbon costs while maximising its benefits.[_]

Unlocking the positive loop at scale requires a bargain between the public and private sectors: governments need to make it easy for companies to innovate and adopt greener AI techniques and the private sector needs to rachet up investments in clean-energy development and energy-efficiency R&D. This focus has to be emphasised across the whole AI value chain - from the electricity grid and power sources to hardware, software and end use - to bend the energy demand curve and unlock the positive loop.

While circumstances and priorities will vary from country to country, it is clear that governments pursuing success in AI and in climate policy face similar challenges. Practical action is needed in five core areas:

Build foundational government capacity: This should include mechanisms at the centre of government that drive national AI efforts and integrate green AI. Investing in collaboration between government, academia and the private sector will also help governments build the right technical expertise and governance frameworks to unlock the positive loop. To meet AI's growing energy requirements, governments also need to build energy infrastructure and power generation that incorporates AI energy-demand forecasts.

Identify the scale of the problem: Governments need to establish and adopt best-practice metrics for reporting on carbon emissions and energy consumption across the AI value chain. Doing so can fill existing measurement and accountability gaps that currently hinder governments' abilities to create the right kinds of policies and R&D investments needed to unlock the positive loop.

Use agile policies and targets to incentivise greener practices: Because the AI revolution is progressing rapidly, governments need to develop innovative, flexible planning and permitting criteria that support private-sector investment in and adoption of clean-energy technologies, while also creating a green-AI certification scheme that incentivises environmentally friendly practices through evidence-based targets. Elements of this could be made mandatory over time if incentives and supportive regulatory environments prove insufficient.

Create better alternatives: Governments need to facilitate private-sector innovation in advanced energy solutions like nuclear and geothermal to ensure AI and energy-system investments go hand in hand. Governments also need to increase R&D investments in green-AI hardware and software to identify new energy-efficient solutions; promote open-source AI models to reduce resource-intensive training phases; and dedicate a portion of the national compute pool for green-AI research.

Collaborate and coordinate internationally: By engaging across borders, governments can accelerate and deliver global progress on green AI. Leaders should look to the COP Breakthrough Agenda to convene and coordinate high-level international collaboration, agenda-setting and delivery for green AI.

Chapter 2

A New Policy Agenda

Even as AI sheds light on the possibility of a carbon-neutral future, it is taxing existing resources and adding to emissions in the short term. Despite commitments by many tech companies and utility providers to reduce carbon emissions and add new clean-power sources, companies[_] and governments[_] alike are turning to less climate-friendly solutions, including the construction of new gas plants, to deal with spikes in compute demand.

Slowing down the development of compute infrastructure while clean energy supply catches up is not a sensible option. As laid out in TBI's State of Compute Access: How to Bridge the New Digital Divide report, this delays digital connectivity and the provision of digitally enabled public services, creating a new digital divide.

This challenge is already surfacing in countries such as Ireland, Singapore and the Netherlands, which have instituted moratoriums on the construction of new data centres in certain regions to limit strains on the grid. In the United States, construction timelines for data centres have been extended by between two and six years[_] because of power-supply delays and grid-capacity constraints.

The Direct Climate and Energy Impacts of AI

Training an AI model like GPT-3 is estimated to emit 552 tonnes of carbon-dioxide equivalent (GtCO2e).[_]

Data centres (excluding those for cryptocurrency) currently account for 1 to 1.5 per cent of global electricity use.[_]

AI is estimated to account for less than one-fifth[_] of overall data-centre energy demand today, but this share is likely to grow quickly over the next few years with the International Energy Agency (IEA) projecting that global electricity demand from data centres could double between 2022 and 2026.[_]

One industry analyst projects that data-centre energy use could triple between 2023 and 2030, with AI accounting for 90 per cent of the growth.[_] In some countries with heavy concentration of tech activity such as Ireland, this could account for up to a quarter of a country's electricity use if power generation capacity does not increase.[_]

Despite heavy energy consumption, AI is enabling breakthroughs across the climate and energy sectors and accelerating climate-science research at scale. Google DeepMind researchers have recently discovered[_] 2.2 million crystal structures, including 380,000 stable materials that could power future technologies such as batteries, computer chips and solar panels. This discovery is equivalent to about 800 years' worth of knowledge and demonstrates an unprecedented scale and level of accuracy in predictions.

Governments that enable the rapid development of zero- and low-carbon power will attract investment into compute infrastructure and clean-power technologies from hyperscalers, the world's largest data centres with extensive cloud-computing services. Run by companies with household names such as Google, Amazon, Meta and Microsoft - all of which are working to achieve net zero in the next ten to 20 years - this investment can translate the positive loop into a competitive advantage.

Figure 1

Leveraging the twin transitions to unlock the positive loop

For countries early in their AI journeys, there is a clear opportunity to establish the foundational capabilities for green AI from the outset, generating investment from hyperscalers seeking new growth markets. For those more advanced in their AI journeys, and those with significant compute resource, the development of green AI presents a significant opportunity to reduce the costs of AI advancements through cleaner, cheaper renewable energy - a critical factor for highly cost-sensitive data-centre operators and developers downstream. In essence, more energy-efficient AI unlocks additional carbon headroom for countries to pursue further information and communication technology (ICT) growth and maximise their compute regardless of their starting point, and while keeping on track with decarbonisation and climate targets.

Green AI

The development and operation of AI that is energy-efficient and uses zero- and low-carbon energy.

Governments need to accelerate clean-grid infrastructure and power generation and drive the development of low- and zero-carbon compute infrastructure. But they also need to create the environment for the private sector to enhance AI's energy efficiency at the technical level. How countries approach this will vary depending on local contexts and capacities.

Zero- and low-carbon approaches to AI do not have to entail compromises on the quality of AI models. Researchers from Google and the University of California, Berkeley, have shown that the carbon footprint of large language models (LLMs) can be reduced by 100 to 1,000 times[_] with the appropriate algorithms, customised hardware and energy-efficient cloud-data centres. Support for existing efforts and accelerating new approaches in this space will deliver benefits for stakeholders across the AI value chain.

Energy Infrastructure & Generation

Hardware

Operations

Grid infrastructure serves as the backbone for powering data centres and compute infrastructure, ensuring reliable energy supply for AI training and operations. The source of power generation determines the grid's carbon intensity and AI's emission levels.

Hardware refers to the physical components needed for AI computations, from facilities such as data centres to equipment such as processors and storage devices. The energy consumption of the hardware, along with the required cooling systems, represents a significant portion of AI's carbon emissions.

Factors critical to minimising this impact include the physical layout of data centres, the modularity of equipment and effective inventory-lifecycle management.

Sustainable AI development involves designing robust algorithms and keeping source code ""neat and clean"". The choice of programming language and the algorithm complexity are crucial drivers of AI energy consumption.

Efforts in software optimisation involve refining code and algorithms to decrease computational loads and, consequently, the environmental impact of running AI applications.

Operations relate to the practical aspects of training and using AI models including advanced analytics, machine learning, deep learning and large language models.

Strategic decisions regarding the location of compute (edge versus core) or practices such as batch optimisation and caching can minimise redundant data transfer and computations, further conserving energy.

While some governments, including those in Singapore, Finland and the EU, are responding to the need to invest in green AI to varying degrees, most governments face significant hurdles in developing effective policies that tackle the pace and scale of AI's energy demand.

Importantly, leaders do not need to reinvent the wheel in this space but can build upon existing efforts.

Singapore in particular has been a pioneer in advancing research and policy that supports sustainable digital economic growth. A comprehensive case study at the end of this paper offers strong examples of best practice that other governments can learn from as well as valuable insights that can be leveraged to advance green-AI innovation.

A new policy agenda for green AI

Chapter 3

Laying the Foundations

Governments need to develop the capacity to address the dynamic and interdisciplinary nature of the climate and AI nexus. Building this ""green-AI muscle"" is critical to accelerating private-sector innovation and adoption across the AI value chain - from measuring AI-related carbon emissions and incentivising green-AI practices to strategically identifying and allocating funding for better alternatives. This capacity has to be complemented by strategic government investment in the foundational energy infrastructure needed to meet AI's energy demands.

Establishing Institutional Mechanisms

Driving technological transformation requires strong political leadership and clarity of priorities. At present, most governments treat AI and decarbonisation as two separate agendas and have few - if any - people working at their intersection. This leads to disjointed policy and failure to harness the opportunities presented by green AI.

Recommendation: Establish a mechanism at the centre of government to coordinate priorities between the AI and climate transitions. As governments integrate AI at the heart of government to improve public services, as recommended in Governing in the Age of AI: A New Model to Transform the State these teams should appoint a specialist with skills at the intersection of climate and AI, or at a minimum, appoint a climate expert. Recruiting this expertise at the heart of government will help break down silos, ensure accountability and build the government's multidisciplinary capacity to drive the twin transitions. There is more guidance on how governments can cultivate this specific skillset below.

Creating ""Triple-Helix Partnerships""

Triple-helix partnerships that interconnect and enhance collaboration between government, academia and the private sector are crucial to greening AI. When tightly interconnected, the three entities act as complementary gears in the machinery of innovation. Governments play a central role by setting strategic direction, providing funding and acting as a connecting node; academia contributes by conducting cutting-edge research and developing foundational knowledge; the private sector brings practical expertise, market insights and the ability to translate research into viable solutions. When these gears move seamlessly, they accelerate the deployment of marketable green-AI solutions.

Figure 4

The triple-helix approach to partnerships

Recommendation: Expedite the commercialisation and translation of foundational AI research into deployed solutions. Governments should use targeted public-funding programmes to bring green-AI research out of the lab and into the market. Programmes should foster greater collaboration between academia and the private sector to enable co-development of zero- and low-carbon digital solutions. Governments should consider specialised pots of funding, with a focus on green-AI market gaps to drive forward these efforts.

Recommendation: Scale skills at the intersection of AI and climate and establish a long-term talent pipeline. To build out the skillset needed to get the twin transition right, governments should leverage the triple-helix model to map future demand and then establish cross-disciplinary training programmes. Regular assessments with industry and academia of such programmes and curricula will ensure their continued relevance and avoid an over- or under-supply of such skills. To develop green-AI talent, governments should consider:

Expanding formalised programmes at the undergraduate and graduate level by increasing degree modules that bridge the gaps between AI, climate change and sustainability. This will provide students with a strong foundation in green AI and enhance their ability to integrate green perspectives when developing AI systems.

Increasing the availability of professional-development programmes with industry partners to provide aspiring green-AI professionals with relevant progression pathways. These programmes should also include joint workshops or training sessions that offer practical exposure to green-AI technologies and their specific application to climate challenges. Strong baseline programmes are already in place and can be continually assessed and updated with further industry and academic views. These include the Green Software Foundation's Green Software Practitioner[_] training and the Linux Foundation's Green Software for Practitioners[_] training course.

Establishing polymath fellowships that enable existing climate or AI professionals to pivot into the complementary field. This approach would cultivate a steady pipeline of interdisciplinary professionals equipped to meet future green-AI demand and a greater culture of sustainability at leading AI labs.

Building Grid Infrastructure

Many companies working in AI, particularly hyperscalers and telecommunications operators, have made commitments to dramatically reduce their carbon emissions. For example, Google aims to achieve 24/7 clean energy for their operations by 2030, and together with Microsoft have signed the 24/7 Carbon-Free Energy Compact,[_] which aims to secure renewable energy matched to demand at all times. Similarly, Amazon and Meta are members of the Emissions First Partnership,[_] which strives to make the most significant emissions reductions possible, irrespective of geographical and market boundaries. These initiatives are not mutually exclusive and show the motivation across industry to support decarbonisation and increase the availability of renewable energy.

Interviews and roundtable conversations with hyperscalers confirmed that renewable-energy capacity is a major factor in where data centres are placed. To attract more compute and clean-tech investment, governments will need a clear path to providing sufficient clean energy, including a grid that can manage the new supply and demand and has the capability to balance, store and manage intermittent renewables.

These plans will need to take into account AI's energy-demand forecasts. Implementing these plans will require governments to think through near- and long-term approaches akin to Norway's second data-centre strategy[_] and Singapore's National AI Strategy 2.0[_]. Governments need to ensure carbon-budget and power allocation to process AI workloads in the near term, while mapping out the growth of net-zero, green data centres powered by renewable energy in the medium to long-term. Few are currently doing this.

Recommendation: Conduct AI-related energy-demand forecasts. To address the AI energy demand and consequent impact on national and global emissions, it is crucial to have strong calculations of current use and future projections. Forecasts need to not solely extrapolate past AI energy use into the future, but include social, economic and technological factors that influence future demand.[_] For example, extrapolations based on recent data-centre energy use overlook countervailing energy-efficiency trends.[_] Research on the energy usage of inference (the process of running data through a trained AI model to draw conclusions) is even more nascent than on the training side of AI energy demand and requires additional attention. Countries and international institutions at the frontier of carbon accounting and reporting should drive this agenda, sharing methodologies that can be adopted across contexts.

Recommendation: Integrate AI-related energy-demand forecasts into national-grid decarbonisation planning and investments. Governments should use strategic spatial energy plans to identify clean-energy investments needed for future zero- and low-carbon AI growth, including assessing the baseload power for data centres. This would allow governments to anticipate grid-capacity needs and invest in clean grid infrastructure. Government-sponsored digital-twin technology could simulate energy supply and demand scenarios to optimise data-centre siting for renewable-energy access and opportunities for heat-waste harnessing as well as help with strategic decisions around grid development and future energy-infrastructure investments. Although not all countries will have the data needed for digital twins, it is imperative that future energy infrastructure investments and plans go hand in hand with AI demand forecasts.

Recommendation: Invest in modern grid infrastructure. Foundational investments in modern grid infrastructure[_] is essential for flexibility and optimisation. A smarter, digitised grid can better integrate different sources of energy, including renewables and storage. This allows for a more flexible and responsive system that can handle the fluctuations of renewable-energy production and leverage additionality from advanced electricity technologies. It also makes it easier for data-centre operators and AI companies to optimise load-shifting strategies. Moreover, government investment in smart-grid technologies can ensure a stable and efficient clean-energy system that can more effectively meet AI's growing energy demands.

Chapter 4

Identifying the Scale of the Problem

Governments cannot manage what they do not measure. Leaders need an accurate picture of the scale and scope of AI's emissions and energy usage to formulate the right policy interventions. This is critical for driving AI-related innovation by helping developers and users understand the link between AI and emissions, encouraging greener practices, and identifying opportunities for energy-saving innovations. Enhanced transparency is also key in tackling greenwashing and fostering accountability in AI development. Importantly, standardising metrics would streamline the reporting process for companies working across international jurisdictions, easing both financial- and non-financial-resource burdens for companies and normalising information-sharing practices.

Moreover, in other sectors the simple act of mandating emissions reporting has been found to lead to reduced emissions, even when reductions are not mandated.[_]

But despite increasingly stringent energy-reporting requirements for grid infrastructure and data centres, there is a lack of understanding and consensus around which aspects of AI's energy-related impacts, especially regarding compute operations, should be monitored. Many of these data are also not publicly accessible. For example, Microsoft's sustainability calculator provides a macro-level overview of Azure's energy impact, but does not release granular data on computing workloads, AI-model energy use or data-centre operations. Moreover, existing methodologies for assessing the environmental impact of ICT are too inconsistent to form a cohesive framework. A more comprehensive measurement framework that spans AI's value chain is needed.

Assessing Grid Capacity and Carbon Intensity

Information and transparency regarding the grid's capacity and carbon intensity are essential for calculating the carbon emissions of activities further downstream. Reporting at the grid level can also help attract investment in AI compute infrastructure, particularly from companies with ambitious renewable-energy ambitions, and is important for accelerating the development of greener techniques across hardware, software and operations. It can also allow investors and developers to ensure that both energy needs and climate commitments will be met.

Recommendation: Require reporting of the capacity and carbon intensity of the grid. Governments should require electricity grids to report their total capacity and carbon intensity, with granular data specified to the unit of an hour. This is already done in many countries across the world, but a large number of developing countries are yet to provide this information.[_]

Assessing Data-Centre Energy Consumption and Carbon Emissions

Greenhouse-gas-emission and energy-consumption reporting is becoming increasingly common.[_] The most commonly used data-centre efficiency and sustainability measurement is Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) - the ratio of total data-centre energy use to IT-equipment energy use - but this provides an inaccurate picture of AI's sustainability and climate impact and limits governments' ability to drive greener behaviour. Additionally, there are limited data that isolate how much energy is being used and emissions are being generated specifically by AI.

Recommendation: Establish and adopt best-practice metrics for data-centre energy consumption and carbon emissions, isolating information related to AI. Governments should look towards best practice in measuring data-centre efficiencies and emissions like the European Energy Efficiency Directive (EED) (see below) and regulatory-reporting requirements like the EU's CSRD and EED, the UK's SECR and California's SB253 as well as legislation recently proposed in the US on the investigation and tracking of the environmental impacts of AI. Reporting requirements should be mandatory for data centres above a certain threshold size (for example 300 kilowatts (kW)) and voluntary for smaller-scale data centres. Governments should consider integrating more specific metrics that provide a holistic overview of data-centre energy efficiency and climate impact, such as the carbon intensity of the energy used (including hourly data); scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions; and inventory age and status. Emissions specific to AI development and deployment should also be identified and reported separate from other ICT uses and services. This would enable data centres to more effectively implement load shifting and could help developers create more energy-efficient and cost-effective alternatives.

The European Energy Efficiency Directive (EED)

The EED was adopted by the European Commission in March 2024 with an aim to reduce both energy consumption and carbon emissions. Applying to data centres above 500 kW, from September 2024 operators are required to report on: floor area, installed power, data volumes, energy consumption, PUE, temperature set points, waste-heat utilisation, and water and renewable-energy usage. Germany was the first European country to incorporate the EED into law,[_] adding the requirement that data centres with 300 kW capacity or more cover 50 per cent of their electricity consumption using renewable sources from January 2024 and 100 per cent from January 2027.

Assessing the Energy Consumption and Carbon Emissions of AI Software

Governments need to measure the energy consumption and carbon emissions of AI software to develop the right set of green-AI policies. This is particularly pertinent for countries leading in AI development and deployment. Singapore has made a strong head start in tackling this measurement challenge through the Infocomm Media Development Authority's (IMDA's) green software trials, which will bring together industry partners to test carbon-reduction techniques in real-world settings and report on those that are successful in lowering AI compute resources.

When the trials conclude later this year, the insights and data will be critical in formulating guidelines for industry - particularly on the ability of these carbon-reduction techniques to deliver cost and energy efficiency without affecting performance.

Recommendation: Adopt best-practice metrics on energy consumption and carbon emissions for AI software. Until findings from the green software trials are released, the Software Carbon Intensity (SCI) specification[_] developed by the ISO in collaboration with the Green Software Foundation presents a strong starting point for calculating a software system's carbon-emission rate - termed the ""SCI score"" - with the purpose of raising awareness and transparency of a particular application's level of energy use and carbon intensity. To support the implementation of the SCI standard and ensure comprehensive emissions assessment, governments can use various open-source and commercial software benchmarks. These can help measure the energy consumption and carbon emissions of AI models and applications throughout the entire AI lifecycle. Such standards need to be constantly examined to identify gaps or shortcomings, given their relatively nascent nature and the rapid pace of AI development.

Incentivising Decarbonisation and Energy Efficiency

Governments need to ensure energy investment and AI development are moving together. To do this, leaders need to make it easy for companies to align clean energy and AI goals. They also need to drive the adoption of best practice across the AI value chain through a range of voluntary and mandated policies. Governments can initially use incentives and voluntary actions to nudge behaviour change. If, over the long term, these measures are shown to be insufficient in curbing energy demand and emissions, governments can consider progressing to increasingly stringent penalties to ensure the adoption of greener practices. This ladder-like approach provides governments with a range of tools and approaches - increasing in scale and severity - to achieve AI decarbonisation and energy efficiency.

Accelerating Private-Sector-Led Energy-Infrastructure Investment

Licencing and permit processes for renewable energy projects in most countries are lengthy and difficult, hindering efforts to align the rapid build out of AI compute and clean-energy infrastructure. This can also inhibit data centres from leveraging existing renewable-energy sources and impede investments in clean on-site generation. For example, while nuclear small modular reactors (SMRs)[_] are touted as one solution for future on-site energy sources, nuclear power is subject to notoriously slow permit processes.

Recommendation: Create flexible planning and permit processes that are faster, more streamlined and in line with strategic AI and clean-energy goals. Governments need to make it easier for data-centre sites to connect directly with renewable-energy sites and ease the planning-application process for data-centre development in areas with plenty of renewable energy or waste-heat-recovery opportunities. For smaller data-centre operators with smaller budgets, governments can also use tax incentives to encourage the use of renewable-energy sources and waste-heat recovery. Permit criteria should be updated to ensure new developments are pursued in tandem with investments in wider energy infrastructure and that they're using state-of-the-art technology and the best sustainability practices.

Recommendation: Leverage time-of-use tariffs to support and encourage flexibility. Governments should use flexible tariff schemes to support load shifting and to encourage software design and applications to be flexible, reducing demands on the grid and enabling data centres to make better use of renewable-energy sources, which may only be able to provide power intermittently. Ireland's state-owned power operator, EirGrid, has flexible demand arrangements that serve as a good example of this. While flexibility is not feasible for all data centres due to sensitive data, there is significant opportunity to optimise renewable-energy availability and shift data-centre energy demand across the grid. Further research and development support is still required on this, as outlined below in the Creating Better Alternatives chapter.

Recommendation: Companies need to match government-driven flexibility by integrating data-centre flexibility requirements into service-level agreements between data-centre operators and customers. This is important in creating demand and awareness among customers for greater flexibility.

Initiating a Green-AI Certification Scheme

While many data centres are already very energy-efficient, not all operators follow the same standard. Specifically, non-hyperscale data centres such as co-location facilities face economic pressures to maximise rack-space utilisation. As a result, they may prioritise selling space over achieving optimal energy efficiency. Additionally, these operators are often hesitant to pay a green-energy premium due to their cost sensitivity.

To incentivise practices that better align with the green transition, it is critical that governments set targets based on the metrics and reporting outlined above, raise awareness of best practice across the AI value chain, and put pressure on low performers to improve. Doing so can have important co-benefits across the ICT sector, as targets do not apply only to AI but to all services within the data centre.

Certification can also help developers and users make informed choices about the services they use, whether that is data-centre space or a particular AI application. Research shows that consumer behaviour is influenced by green labels and certificates,[_] with consumer pressure and brand reputation consequently driving corporate action. In part because of these pressures, management-consulting company Gartner predicts 75 per cent of organisations will have implemented a data-centre infrastructure-sustainability programme by 2027,[_] a significant improvement from less than 5 per cent in 2022.

Recommendation: Establish a publicly accessible repository of best green-AI practices and case studies. Based on existing data and novel trials, this repository should serve as a common reference point to demonstrate successful implementations of green AI. For data centres, the European Code of Conduct for Energy Efficiency in Data Centres and Singapore's tropical data-centres standard provide existing examples for data centres, while similar efforts should be established for software and operations.

Recommendation: Create targets for energy consumption, energy efficiency and carbon emissions for data centres and software through a green-certification scheme. Governments should base targets on best-practice examples and ""green by design"" criteria (see below) that balance energy-efficiency improvements with emissions reductions and do not compromise on the good service of the data centre or software. Requirements within the schemes should become more stringent over time to keep pushing innovation and efficiency improvements.

Data Centres

While many countries have their own sustainability accreditation systems for data centres or buildings more generally, existing certification schemes should be expanded to not only focus on internal optimisation but also on renewable-energy use, additionality and integration with the grid for energy export. Further criteria governments can consider include local land availability for on-site renewable-energy generation, site location and investments in innovative energy sources.

Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) and Excellence in Design for Greater Efficiencies (EDGE) are the leading examples of international green-building certifications that can be easily utilised, implemented and added to by governments and organisations, particularly for those early in their AI trajectory, rather than spending additional resources on establishing their own version.

Software

It is more difficult to judge best practice and provide targets for software because of its context-specific nature and because there has historically been little attention on the intersection between AI software and energy. Yet governments must start building efficiency and carbon footprints into AI-software assessment criteria.

Governments should work to include these targets in frameworks that govern responsible and transparent AI, such as the AI Verify framework, to underscore that responsible use and deployment of AI includes environmental considerations. AI Verify is the first AI governance-testing framework and software toolkit supporting responsible AI. It validates AI systems against the principles of transparency, reproducibility, safety, fairness and accountability. Frameworks like this should be expanded to include measures that will be identified through green software trials along with ""green by design"" AI-model criteria.

Recommendation: Introduce public awards to recognise outstanding performance in green AI. If a certification scheme alone results in limited adoption of greener practices, governments should introduce public awards or recognition schemes based on certification and incentive programmes that recognise, validate and reward organisations adhering to established green-AI practices and further incentivises these actions. Awards enhance transparency and public awareness of this issue, further enabling and incentivising organisations and individuals to make informed decisions of the services they select.

Recommendation: Explore the gradual introduction of more mandatory standards and requirements across the AI value chain. If the data show that incentives and supportive regulatory environments are insufficient, governments should begin making previously voluntary standards and best practice mandatory, including introducing initially small fines to incentivise compliance, with the possibility of increasing severity. If mandatory measures are needed, governments could consider mandating a certain threshold for energy efficiency and carbon emissions for different sizes of data-centre providers; requiring a certain standard of efficiency and renewable-energy use for new data-centre builds; using the green by design criteria and accreditation system to establish a minimum level of accreditation; and increasing efficiency and emissions thresholds and financial penalties over time. These interventions should be considered as options of last resort if incentives and enablers prove insufficient. They are also dependent on the evolution of a country's AI capability and should only be considered in countries where this is advanced.

Potential Green-by-Design CriteriaHardware: Green-by-Design Data Centres

Core elements[_] of ""green by design"" for data centres could include:

Prioritising green approaches in determining data-centre siting

Increasing demand flexibility and load shifting

Shifting from diesel to renewable back-up generators

Utilising energy storage and energy management to integrate with the grid for energy export

Software: Green-by-Design AI Models

Core elements of ""green by design"" for AI models could include:

Limiting the need for duplicated processes by using caching to avoiding redundant recomputes

Reducing ""code bloat""

Certifying AI models for energy efficiency, carbon emissions and water impact

Using agreed standards and specs for the green AI across industries

Using lower-level programming languages that have fewer memory-management requirements and thus are less energy-intensive

Chapter 6

Creating Better Alternatives

Innovation lies at the heart of the positive loop between the AI and energy transitions. It enables reductions in emissions and energy consumption across the AI value chain and accelerates AI advancements. For instance, it is through continued innovation and improvement in data-centre operations and hardware efficiencies (such as using AI to optimise processes[_] and make advancements in chips) that total global data-centre electricity use increased by only 6 per cent from 2010 to 2018,[_] even as the number of data-centre compute instances (that is to say, virtual machines running on physical hardware) rose to 6.5 times over the same period.[_]

The private sector is largely driving these energy-efficiency and decarbonisation efforts, investing in innovations that are critical to both accelerating AI advancements and the energy transition. AI companies are some of today's biggest clean-energy investors. For example, Microsoft has created the $1 billion Climate Innovation Fund to accelerate climate technology development and deployment and corporate clean-energy power-purchase agreements (PPAs)[_] accounted for more than 10 per cent of all new renewable capacity added in 2021.

Facilitating Private-Sector Innovation in Advanced Energy-Source Solutions

Data centres require a power supply that provides consistent, reliable energy to prevent shutdown and overload. This means the infrastructure behind AI has a relatively unique baseload-power requirement compared to most other industries, and companies are investing heavily in advanced clean-electricity technologies needed to complement intermittent solar and wind power.

For instance, by 2022 Google had invested $3.5 billion in renewable energy globally,[_] and it has recently partnered with a clean-energy startup Fervo to develop a geothermal power project in the US that is now contributing carbon-free energy to the electricity grid.[_] Microsoft is investing in new approaches that shift back-up generators from diesel to zero- and low-carbon alternatives, such as green hydrogen[_] and modular nuclear reactors,[_] and is using lithium-ion batteries and a grid-interactive uninterruptible power supply to share energy with the local grid when needed.[_]

In addition to advanced electricity technology, companies are also testing ways to integrate more intermittent renewable energy and increased flexibility into AI operations. For example, by using intelligent design, instrumentation, control and automation, companies are increasingly experimenting with demand flexibility and load shifting to schedule non-time-sensitive tasks for off-peak periods, or even shift workloads to different data centres and geographies.

Recommendation: Build a suite of financial vehicles to accelerate the commercialisation of clean-energy advancements. Governments should focus on paving the way for the production of nuclear (specifically SMRs) and geothermal energy due to their ability to provide baseload power. Mechanisms governments could pursue include:

A loans-programme office to de-risk investments until they become bankable for private investment. The US Department of Energy's Loan Program Office provides a good example other countries could replicate. It is investing in micronuclear reactor advancements while investor confidence builds.[_]

Contracts-for-difference (CfD) schemes to attract private investment in clean-energy projects. In the UK, CfDs are used for a range of renewable-energy sources including wind, solar, tidal and geothermal and can serve as a model for other countries to drive the commercialisation of geothermal and nuclear.[_]

Sophisticated PPAs to help advance 24/7 renewable-energy matching, drive innovation and make a significant emissions impact.[_] Companies like Google and Microsoft are piloting 24/7 clean PPAs[_] that incorporate a portfolio of clean-energy sources, integrate energy-storage solutions and match clean-energy generation with consumption on an hourly basis.[_] To facilitate these more complex PPAs, governments should develop standardised contractual templates that streamline negotiation processes and reduce transaction costs for both clean-energy developers and potential buyers; offer credit enhancements or loan guarantees to clean-energy developers entering into PPAs; or facilitate programmes that aggregate the demand from multiple small clean-energy projects.[_]

Offtake agreements whereby the government serves as a backstop offtaker for renewable-energy generators at a pre-determined price. State-guaranteed revenue improves investor and lender confidence, facilitates greater access to project financing and boosts competition in PPA markets with private-sector participants by enabling more generators and offtakers to participate confidently.[_] This is particularly critical for emerging economies to de-risk hyperscaler investments and support the adoption of clean-energy infrastructure.

Allocating R&D Investment to Improve Energy Efficiencies

Countries at the technological frontier are in an advantageous position to explore and research cutting-edge green-AI technologies. By drawing on insights from prior research and trials, they can accelerate the development of these technologies. Through targeted and strategic investments, governments play a pivotal role in advancing these efforts. Collectively, these advancements contribute to a growing pool of climate-friendly, open-source AI resources accessible globally.

Recommendation: Accelerate R&D into hardware energy efficiencies through sandbox trials. Governments can drive innovation and test new data-centre efficiency and sustainability approaches through data-centre specific sandbox trials that could mirror Singapore's Sustainable Tropical Data Centre Testbed (see case study for details).[_] Efforts could focus on determining and deploying optimal data-centre equipment change-out rates, balancing financial viability with sustainability and ensuring that computing infrastructure remains both efficient and performance-optimised. Research on frontier energy-efficient technologies could also include the developmentof new materials, testing of reversible computing approaches, and the creation of Data Processing Units (DPUs) that are specifically designed for AI applications.

Recommendation: Establish outcome-oriented national grants or prizes to incentivise innovation. These could take the form of a national challenge prize, which offers rewards to whoever can solve a discrete, well-defined problem first or most effectively.

Recommendation: Accelerate software energy efficiencies through trials. Governments should learn from IMDA's green-software trials once findings are published. Through triple-helix partnerships, further software trials should focus on uncovering additional energy-efficient techniques and could include experimenting with synthetic data generation, which would reduce the need for redundant data pre-processing tasks and allow for AI models to be trained in more energy-efficient ways.

Promoting Open-Source Resources

Open-source resources are critical to facilitating the adoption of energy-efficient AI-development practices. Access cuts down the need for resource-intensive training phases, while still providing developers with a base that can be further fine-tuned for their application development.

Examples of such AI models include the SEA-LION (Southeast Asian Languages In One Network) LLM and the VGG16 and VGG19 (16- and 19-layer Convolutional Neural Networks developed by the Visual Geometry Group at the University of Oxford) computer-vision models. These resources can be accompanied by others including optimised software libraries like TensorFlow Lite that support the creation of more energy-conscious AI applications. These libraries are engineered to minimise the computational load, facilitating the deployment of AI in environments where energy utilisation may be a concern.

Recommendation: The mechanism at the centre of government responsible for coordinating AI and climate priorities should establish a curated list of publicly available, open-source AI resources that it updates on a regular basis. Given the pace of AI-model development, various open-source AI models run the risk of becoming outdated if not updated accordingly, which would reduce their effectiveness and hinder their public uptake. A curated and updated list would serve as a comprehensive repository of tools and models that are vetted for their efficiency and sustainability, offering developers easy access to the best available resources for green-AI development and serve as a benchmark for sustainable development practices within the AI community. For instance, the US recently introduced the 2024 Artificial Intelligence Environmental Impacts Act, which includes provisions for the development or cataloguing of open-source software and hardware tools with the aim of facilitating the measurement of environmental impact of AI models, systems and hardware.[_]

Figure 6

Open-source models and the rationale for updating them

Model

Update Rationale

Open-source natural language processing (NLP) models

Earlier versions of large NLP models such as the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) require longer training times and, by extension, larger amounts of computational resources. Such models could benefit from updates using techniques like distillation or pruning to create smaller, more efficient versions.

Open-source computer-vision models

Models such as VGG19, while foundational in the field of computer vision, are known for their large size and computational intensity. Updating these models to more efficient architectures such as MobileNet or EfficientNet can reduce computational load and energy consumption without significantly compromising accuracy.

Generative adversarial network (GAN) models for image recognition and generation

The earlier variations of DCGAN (Deep Convolutional GAN) are based on architectures that are, by today's standards, not optimised for computational efficiency or energy consumption during training and inference. Newer GAN models have incorporated architectural improvements that allow for less training time, reduced energy consumption and more efficient image generation.

Recommendation: Promote or incentivise gradual climate-friendly shifts within the developer community. This includes transitioning mindsets and practices away from high-level languages like Java to more efficient, lower-level languages such as C++. This shift enables developers to write code that is more directly aligned with hardware operations, enhancing the overall energy efficiency of AI systems by optimising resource usage.

Making Sovereign Compute More Accessible for Green-AI Research

TBI's report on the State of Compute Access recommends that governments build out their national compute infrastructure as a means of providing high-performance computing (HPC) resources to academics and AI start-ups. Establishing this public AI infrastructure is crucial not just to spur AI development across various sectors but to ensure that research in key areas, particularly those aligned with governmental priorities such as energy efficiency and climate change, is adequately supported.

Recommendation: Governments at the technological frontier should dedicate a portion of their national compute pool specifically for green-AI research. This dedicated compute pool would serve as a national ""green-AI resource"", ensuring that researchers focused on green-AI challenges have adequate access to the computational power necessary for their work. For example, JASMIN is a supercomputer facility in the UK that is specifically designed to provide substantial compute resources to the environmental science research community. It supports large-scale data analysis, simulation and modelling efforts that are crucial for advancing understanding and actions regarding climate change and environmental sustainability.

Chapter 7

Going International

Both AI and climate change are borderless. The most efficient way to harness the positive loop between the green and AI transitions is to collaborate internationally - to shortcut learning by doing, efficiently allocate scarce R&D funding, ensure consistency and interoperability of green-AI regulations standards, and encourage best practice.

To do this, it is essential to get international buy-in through forums in both the ICT and climate sectors, and to build a network across these sectors. As highlighted in the 2023 Breakthrough Agenda Report,[_] co-authored by the International Energy Agency (IEA), the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) and the United Nations (UN) Climate Change High-Level Champions, international collaboration is not yet strong enough to deliver climate goals; AI coordination at the global level is also nascent. Specifically, international-level efforts are needed to:

Create an international peer-learning network for governments, co-developing policy frameworks and sharing best practice.

Adopt common metrics and reporting frameworks, ensuring cohesion and comparability across efforts. Without this, it is difficult to understand the global scale and scope of AI's energy use and carbon footprint, forecast trends and enable comparability - all of which can hamper innovation and action.

Coordinate horizon scanning, monitoring and forecasting to track progress and identify persisting or emerging challenges, enabling robust policy evaluation.

Collaborate on R&D to support technology transfer and capacity-building mechanisms for green-AI compute infrastructure and skills development, particularly in emerging economies.

Coordinate on standards and regulations for green-AI practices to limit carbon leakage by preventing AI compute infrastructure from shifting to countries with more relaxed policies. Transparency and coordination of standards and regulations also supports the development and adoption of best practice, creating greater international cohesion and putting public pressure on organisations and countries to adhere to green practices.

Recommendation: Leverage the Conference of the Parties (COP) and its Breakthrough Agenda to coordinate high-level collaboration and agenda-setting for green AI. The Breakthrough Agenda brings together stakeholders to decarbonise specific sectors. Data centres are included within Buildings Breakthrough, established at COP28 in 2023.[_] A distinct AI Breakthrough should be established to conduct specific monitoring, forecasting and strategising on emissions across the AI value chain. Reporting from the AI Breakthrough to COP will reveal if the sector is on track to meet global climate goals, and more stringent measures can be introduced by governments if it is not.

Recommendation: Work through international institutions to support technical-level delivery. Many existing international institutions and networks are well-suited to support and deliver the technical aspects of high-level international collaboration and coordination across the five areas outlined above. Some of these organisations are already performing this function but require broader buy-in and support from across the international community.

International-organisation green-AI capabilities

Recommendation: Governments should collaborate and coordinate on green-AI research to reduce R&D costs, share information and drive further green AI research, innovation and deployment. Specifically:

Replicate the Breakthrough Energy Ventures Europe approach,[_] pooling resources to establish a ""Breakthrough Green AI Ventures"". Such a fund would leverage the significant investments hyperscale data-centre operators and large AI companies are already investing in this space.

Provide dedicated funding for Focused Research Organisations (FROs) working on specific green computational research and commercialisation issues. There is more information on FROs below. Different countries could prioritise different kinds of FROs, but they could exist as part of an international umbrella network run by a philanthropic organisation, with joint funding from governments.

Contribute to a joint compute fund to finance challenges in strategically important aspects of climate tech where compute power has the potential to unlock big breakthroughs. Leading AI and quantum companies would be paid to allocate part of their compute capacity towards supporting funded research. This differs from the sovereign compute pool in that it is targeted at more specific problems and resources and data are coordinated and shared across countries. This mitigates the risk of duplicative efforts by researchers. For many countries this will be more accessible than substantial sovereign compute pools.

Establish an international data-centre experimentation hub modelled on the Interuniversity Microelectronics Centre (IMEC), the global centre for semiconductor innovation, which provides space to test, experiment and commercialise new innovations. The hub should utilise triple-helix partnerships to ensure commercial viability and adoption of any innovative solutions that are generated.

Focused Research Organisations: A Deeper DiveWhat Are FROs?

FROs undertake projects that are too big for a single academic lab, too complex for a loose multi-lab collaboration and not directly profitable enough for a venture-backed startup or industrial R&D project. They are run by full-time technicians who oversee ten to 30 employees and who pursue specific, quantifiable technical milestones rather than doing blue-sky research. They are also finite in duration, usually lasting five to seven years. As they near completion, they translate what they have built into venture-backed startup spinouts and/or longer-lived nonprofits.

Suggested Research Areas for FROs

Although breakthroughs in the AI ecosystem can be profitable, there are particular challenges that FROs could address, including:

Developing ultra-efficient AI architectures, for instance research into novel neural-network architectures that prioritise computational efficiency without compromising on performance.

Developing and open sourcing advanced optimisation algorithms, for instance model pruning, quantisation and knowledge distillation, that make models lighter and faster.

Establishing comprehensive benchmarks and standards for measuring and reporting the energy efficiency of AI models.

Compiling and releasing large, high-quality datasets designed to train AI models more efficiently.

Prioritising different kinds of FROs in different countries and contexts, all of which are part of an international umbrella network run by a philanthropic organisation with joint funding from governments.

Greening AI in Practice: Lessons From Singapore

From its work optimising energy efficiency for data centres in tropical climate countries[_] to its more recent efforts focused on greening AI software,[_] Singapore provides strong examples of green-AI best practices across the value chain. Governments across country-income level can learn from its experience and leverage valuable insights to advance green-AI innovation.

Laying the Foundations

Central to Singapore's success in advancing green AI is its application of triple-helix partnerships. Singapore led the application of the triple-helix model of innovation in its first national AI strategy in 2019,[_] recognising the critical importance of interconnecting government, the private sector and academia to enable the development and deployment of AI solutions.

Singapore's IMDA has put this into practice, leveraging its role as connector to help bring researchers and industry together to collaborate on pilot projects and validate their technologies in a real-world setting, with the aim of supporting the translation of research into market-ready solutions.[_] Such partnerships also serve as platforms for ongoing dialogue among government agencies, academic institutions and industry firms to help the government formulate guidelines and regulations that support innovation while balancing the risks.

IMDA's Green Computing Funding Initiative (GCFI) exemplifies the effectiveness and impact of such partnerships in support of green AI.[_] An SGD 30 million funding pool for research to optimise the design and function of energy-efficient software, it enables researchers from institutes of higher learning to collaborate with industry to solve problems related to green computing. The GCFI is targeting its funding on use cases not served by existing commercial solutions and will be accompanied by further efforts to bring together researchers and industry to co-develop low-carbon digital solutions for the technology industry. Governments can use the GCFI as a model to develop similar funds.

Identifying the Scale of the Problem

Singapore leads the way in setting sustainability standards for AI, with the world's first sustainability standard for green data centres in tropical settings. Additionally, as a member of the Green Software Foundation, Singapore contributes to initiatives like the SCI specification, promoting transparency of and accountability for the carbon emissions of AI software.

Incentivising AI Decarbonisation and Energy Efficiency Through Targets and Policy

In 2022, following its four-year temporary pause on new data centres, Singapore's Economic Development Board and IMDA announced a pilot for companies to set up data centres with more sustainable energy use and more efficient cooling methods.[_] The criteria for new data centres prioritised ones that utilised ""state of the art technologies and best practices for sustainability, particularly in the areas of energy efficiency and decarbonisation"", as well as investment in wider national benefits, such as energy infrastructure.

Singapore is taking this a step further with the upcoming release of a ""Green Data Centre Roadmap"", which is set to unlock additional green data-centre capacity in the coming years. The roadmap calls on industry players to play a catalytic role in fostering partnerships across the ecosystem in order to accelerate data centres' use of green and efficient energy in both hardware and software to realise the broader goal of sustainable development.

Creating Better Alternatives

Singapore is particularly advanced in its R&D capacity and contributions to innovation in both hardware and software through initiatives such as the Sustainable Tropical Data Centre Testbed and green software trials.

The Sustainable Tropical Data Centre Testbed was set up at the end of 2023.[_] It is funded by the National Research Foundation with Meta as an anchor industry partner and research led by the National University of Singapore and Nanyang Technological University with support from IMDA. The Centre focuses on surfacing sustainable and efficient data-centre solutions specific to the context of the region's high-temperature and humid operating environment. Countries with similar conditions can build on progress made by Singapore's testbed and assess the feasibility of applying these solutions to their own local contexts.

On the software side, Singapore's green software trials are a first-of-its-kind effort led by IMDA to invest in exploratory research into the tangible energy efficiency and cost savings of greening AI software. Industry players are participating in trials to better understand how to develop green software and reduce energy use and IT costs. The trials will see industry players apply carbon-reduction techniques to digital applications and measure their impact and effectiveness in operational contexts and their ability to increase energy and cost efficiencies without compromising performance. Data from the trials will inform guidelines and best practice for green software development within the industry, which companies will be able to use at scale. They will also provide a basis for incentivising the adoption of green-AI software by providing evidence for the cost savings associated with operations-optimisation strategies.

Finally, to further support research and innovation that would provide societal benefits such as green AI, in its National AI Strategy 2.0 Singapore has also committed to allocating a proportion of high-performance compute to support meritorious use cases, including for the public good.

Going International

Singapore actively engages in the growing international community around AI through participation in the Global Partnership on AI, the World Economic Forum AI Governance Alliance and the UN High-Level Advisory Body on AI. IMDA also produced the world's first AI governance-testing framework and software toolkit, AI Verify, in 2022 to help companies and other builders of AI systems to validate their performance against a set of internationally endorsed principles. The AI Verify Foundation was then established as an open-source community to forge partnerships that drive momentum around the development of trustworthy AI.

Singapore is also engaged in green AI. It became the first country to join the Green Software Foundation through IMDA to work jointly with key technology partners on promoting greener software practices and contributing to building consensus around measuring the environmental impact of AI software. By sharing its expertise, Singapore contributes to a sustainable digital future on a global scale.

Chapter 9

Conclusion

AI will have a transformational impact across the climate and energy sectors. Governments have a critical role to play in unlocking the positive loop between the AI and energy revolutions. AI can fuel the scientific and R&D breakthroughs needed to accelerate the energy transition; the energy transition in turn can drive clean-energy production, energy-efficiency gains and cost savings critical to accelerating technological innovation. In this way, the AI and energy revolutions can become force multipliers. Governments that can harness this dynamic will find advantage.

EDF has loaded the fuel of the giant European Pressurised Reactor or EPR1. The first nuclear reaction will take place within weeks, reaching full power of 1.65 gigawatts (GW) by year's end.

It will be the most powerful reactor on the planet, to be joined eventually by two sister reactors at Hinkley Point, and another at Sizewell C if anybody can find the money.

To fans, Flamanville is an ultra-safe feat of advanced engineering, with three layers of protective barriers. It can withstand an earthquake, a tsunami, a head-on crash by an Airbus A380, or even (arguably) a meltdown of the core. It is built to last 60 years, perhaps a century.

To critics, it is a ruinous misadventure, the ultimate over-refinement of obsolete fission technology that can never compete on a commercial basis. Delays have left France dependent on old reactors that are literally falling apart. EDF has racked up debts of €54bn (£46bn) and had to be renationalised in 2022.

To those of us in the middle - friendly to nuclear, if cheap enough - it is striking that Korea seems able to roll out workhorse reactors relatively quickly at half the cost. Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power's modified APR1000 reactor was certified in Europe last year.

Flamanville 3 began in 2007 with an expected cost of €3.3bn. France's supreme audit institution, the Cour des Comptes, says the final tally is €19.1bn, calling it an ""operational failure"", undertaken prematurely and with hubris.

""It has been an industrial catastrophe. I never thought they would even forget how to make a concrete slab,"" said Bernard Laponche, a French nuclear veteran and doyen of the dissidents.

All is forgiven, apparently, even though a parallel EPR1 plant at Olkiluoto in Finland - opened last year - had similar delays and cost overruns, and even though the Taishan I variant in China had to shut down for a year due to damaged fuel rods.

Emmanuel Macron began his presidency by closing a working reactor near the German border in order to please Angela Merkel. He had a Damascene conversion after Putin's invasion of Ukraine.

Mr Macron now wants to build 14 modified EPR2 reactors - supposedly cheaper - in a repeat of France's ""dash for nuclear"" under premier Pierre Messmer in 1974.

It is a heroic undertaking for a country with a structural budget deficit of 5pc of GDP and a debt ratio stuck at 112pc, with rating agencies on the prowl. Much the same can be said about Britain's nuclear renaissance, targeting 24 GW by mid-century.

The bet is that the average cost per EPR will fall by 30pc as the series rolls out a scale. That would cut the putative bill for Sizewell C to £85 MWh in today's money, or lower if you treat it as a 60-year venture in accounting terms. Reste à voir, as the French say.

Valerie Faudon, head of the French Association of Nuclear Energy, said Flamanville went wrong because France had lost its industrial skills from long neglect.

""We got hit twice: we no longer had the know-how to build new reactors; and we were working on an entirely new model. Flamanville has been an investment to relearn how to do it,"" she said.

The catalogue of errors began from the start. Stray rocks from dynamite blasting rained on the Flamanville 2 reactor nearby. Regulators discovered that the concrete pillars were ""pockmarked with holes like a Swiss cheese"".

The steel reactor vessel had unsafe levels of carbon content. A Japanese company was brought in to build a new one. The saga went on and on.

No doubt lessons have been learned, but Hinkley Point also faces spiralling costs and long delays a decade later. Third time lucky, perhaps?

Mr Laponche says the Messmer episode of the 1970s was a panic reaction to the first Opec crisis, a time when France had oil-based power plants. It led to fevered calls for energy sovereignty.

Messmer launched six reactors a year with theatrical gusto, egged on by vested interests. ""There was a mafia aspect of cronyism in this, as always,"" he said.

The numbers were justified by a make-believe extrapolation of power demand, assumed to be doubling every 10 years. ""It was ridiculous, but they got everybody to swallow it,"" he said.

The demand did not exist. France ended up selling excess electricity to Germany at give away prices.

""They knew we couldn't sell it anywhere else: they got cheap power and we got the safety risk and the radioactive waste. We never recouped our investment costs,"" he said.

""Macron's speeches today are almost a carbon copy of Messmer's speeches 50 years ago. It is all about energy security again, with climate change on top, and people just go along with it. The parallel is uncanny,"" he said.

Mr Laponche said the early reactors were built to last 30 years. They were extended to 40. The new EPRs were supposed to arrive in time to take the baton, but Flamanville drastically upset this calculation. In the meantime, France had missed the boat on renewables.

In the years since work began on Flamanville, the EU has installed 476 GW of solar and wind, roughly equal to 74 EPR reactors once you adjust for apples and oranges.

France has had to keep its old reactors going ever longer beyond their safe industrial life. The crunch hit in 2022 when half the national fleet of 56 reactors was out of action, some due to drought but mostly due to corrosion or fractures. This collided with Putin's war. EDF had to import power at exorbitant spot prices to cover the shortfall.

The question that French and British governments must answer as they commit to colossal projects that will not come on stream until the late 2030s or 2040s, and will then bind us for 60 years, is what happens if commercial nuclear fusion comes good over the next decade, as most fusion insiders now think probable.

Fusion has minimal radioactive waste. It is so safe that plants can be built anywhere like a hospital. Compare that with fission. German authorities began cleaning up the giant Greifswald nuclear plant in 1995. They are still cleaning it up. The decommissioning cost has reached €6.6bn.

There is much to be said in favour of visionary industrial plans. They create a motivating sense of national purpose. They generate spin-off technology. They are certainly better than hand-wringing defeatism on everything. But cost matters and technology is changing the energy equation very rapidly.

Let us hope that this Anglo-French bet on the biggest reactors of all time is not another Concorde.",uk.news.yahoo.com,news,Yahoo News UK,,-0.08235294117647063,454666472,1,https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png,eng-9605869

Approximately one and a half kilometres from Shyamoli Square towards Shia Jame Masjid, along the Ring Road in Mohammadpur, you will first encounter the 10-storey Tokyo Square shopping mall on the right. This is followed by a cluster of high-rise buildings.

Enter through the Roman-styled entrance gate, sandwiched between the said shopping mall and the group of buildings, and you will have officially set foot inside Japan Garden City, the country's first satellite town.

You might expect, given the word ""garden"" in its name, that this satellite town would have some greenery in contrast to the concrete jungle sprawling throughout the rest of the city. However, it would be wise to shed those expectations. Because, as things stand, the interior is almost like the concrete ensemble you saw from the outside.

Dust, noise and everything congested

Japan Garden City now has an overall population of around 10,000 in an area of 9.78 acres. It has 26 buildings in total, each 15-16 storeys high, with the number of flats at over 1,600.

There is a lake in the middle of the complex but it resembles a dirty swamp. And the trees around are few and far between. There is not a single patch of grass-covered field, only concrete runways for vehicular movement.

Nahiyan Abrar, a third-year student at North South University has been living in Garden City since second grade at school. He had a ""safer"" childhood when compared to other areas in Mohammadpur, but that childhood wasn't always the most playful.

They didn't have a designated playground. Resorting to play on the often dust-covered concrete within the complex, and being wary of cricket balls or footballs damaging the parked vehicles, does not sound like much fun. It was the ongoing construction of the market and buildings all around, which made the complex especially dusty.

""Cycling was fun but then again, the driveway was the only spot,"" Abrar recalled.

Shamim Islam (not his real name) faced another problem. He relocated here with his family in 2010 after his SSC exam. However, due to constant noise pollution from vehicle horns and ongoing construction, he struggled to concentrate on his studies for the HSC exam.

So, he had no choice but to pass the evenings idly and only sit with books after 11 pm ""when the outside noise would come down to a tolerable level.""

Over the years, noise pollution has only increased, with at least three public bus companies establishing their starting point just outside Japan Garden City (JGC).

A lack of traffic control results in frequent traffic jams, prompting vehicles to honk incessantly in hopes of resolving the congestion. Also, constant promotional announcements in high volume from some brand showrooms across the road exacerbate the noise problem.

Nazma Sultana, a housewife living in one of the buildings in the middle part of the complex, expressed her frustration with the lack of sunlight and proper air circulation, which leaves her feeling depressed throughout the day.

""It always feels so dark here, as if it is going to rain soon. However, the overwhelming heat reminds you that the reality is much different,"" she said, noting that the distressing environment frequently impacts her mental well-being, occasionally causing her to lose her temper and behave rudely with her children.

But on other occasions, she feels rather sorry for her children that ""they have to grow up in a place like this."" According to her, even though there is a small park for kids now, it hardly makes any difference.

Not your regular garden or satellite city

The lived experience of the inhabitants are a stark contrast to the concept of a ""garden city"", upon which the development of Japan Garden City was based, by Japan Garden City Ltd, a Japan-Bangladesh Joint Venture Company, in 1999.

The concept of the ""garden city"" was first proposed by Ebenezer Howard, a British urban planner, in his book ""To-morrow: A Peaceful Path to Real Reform,"" published in 1898. The concept emerged as a response to the overcrowding, pollution and social issues prevalent in rapidly industrialising cities.

Howard outlined his vision for planned communities that would combine the benefits of urban and rural living with an emphasis on green spaces, community cohesion and social equity. This laid the foundation for the garden city movement, which, in effect, influenced urban planning and development across the world in the 20th century.

Letchworth, founded by Howard and located in Hertfordshire, England, is often cited as the first garden city.

Some of the other examples of successful garden cities include Radburn, in New Jersey, United States; Tapiola in Finland; and Freiburg in Breisgau in Germany. Even India has several garden cities such as Rajarhat-New Town in Kolkata and Navi Mumbai in Mumbai.

Also, satellite cities in general have some common characteristics. According to Dr Farhadur Reza, Associate Professor of Environmental Planning and Management at Jahangirnagar University, a satellite city is a smaller urban centre near a large metropolitan city, featuring its local government and economy independent of the neighbouring large city.

While interconnected, there is a clear geographical distinction between the satellite city and the large parent city, often separated by a rural area. Despite being smaller in size, satellite cities are planned with essential amenities like schools and hospitals, and are connected to the parent city via efficient transport services. Additionally, they are often targeted for marketing by businesses alongside the larger cities nearby, and they often prioritise eco-friendly development.

Japan Garden City Ltd initially had similar plans, or at least that's what they claimed to attract customers. At the time, the developing company asserted that Japan Garden City would be a unique project -- a modern satellite township boasting natural beauty.

The company proposed that only 43% of the total 30 bighas of land would be occupied by structures, while the remaining 57% would be adorned with greenery including gardens, a lake, parks, walkways, children's playgrounds and roads.

""That's such a farce. Where is the greenery? It's nothing more than an urban slum, perhaps slightly better than what they have in Korail,"" said a university teacher, who preferred to remain anonymous, fearing potential backlash from the flat owners' committee.

Another resident acknowledged that they can safely walk inside the complex every morning and evening, which is a significant advantage for her as a woman.

However, she doesn't think having a shopping mall nearby or other facilities just outside the housing complex means anything special in particular. ""Nowadays, these are there in almost every neighbourhood of the city,"" she explained.

Meanwhile, the developing company also initially mentioned while selling the flats that the housing complex would include additional facilities like international standard English medium schools, well-equipped diagnostic centres, specialised doctor's chambers and clinics, gents and ladies gyms etc.

The promises made in the brochures allured many families, including Shamim's, to consider buying a flat here. ""But even after all these years, those promises are yet to be fulfilled,"" Shamim said.

'A constant source of urban mismanagement'

According to some urban planning experts, Japan Garden City exemplifies the pitfalls of our urbanisation process. Dhaka, facing a genuine need for horizontal and compact settlements, viewed this satellite project as a potential solution. However, it has fallen short of addressing this need from the very onset.

""Instead, it has become a constant source of urban mismanagement for residents and the surrounding neighbourhood,"" said Dr Nazmul Huq, a sustainability researcher at the University of Applied Science, Cologne, Germany.

Adil Mohammed Khan, Executive Director of the Institute for Planning and Development (IPD), also shared similar sentiments.

According to him, the housing complex has not been designed and planned according to standard planning and guidelines. This project has also not been approved by Rajuk according to Detailed Area Plan (DAP) guidelines.

In addition, it has altered and deviated from its initial planning and design from its inception. Henceforth, open and green space has been drastically reduced from what had been planned initially.

A 2010 The Daily Star report reveals that Rajuk, as the planning authority, permitted the project as per the building construction rules of 1996 and approved revision three times.

Former Rajuk Chairman Md Nurul Huda at that time said Rajuk was responsible for any dubious approval process of the project in a densely populated area, and surely there had been hectic lobbying for it.

According to the Private Residential Land Development Rules 2004, the maximum allowable density is 350 persons per acre. Whereas the density of Japan Garden City is more than a thousand persons per acre, ""which is unacceptable according to planning standards,"" said Dr Khan, also a Professor of Urban and Regional Planning at Jahangirnagar University.

This is also why traffic, environment and other planning impacts are damaging the livability of the surrounding locality and community.

Furthermore, according to DAP, the population of around 10,000 requires community facilities and amenities like primary schools, playgrounds, parks, kitchen markets, libraries, community centres, etc. However, JGC does not have appropriate community facilities to cater to the demands of its residents.

""Ideally, block-based development ensures proper sunlight, air ventilation and a habitable, built environment. But these attributes are lacking in JGC as well,"" said Dr Khan.

Nevertheless, there is also one set of experts who are of the opinion that on the whole, Japan Garden City development is quite good compared to other private residential developments in Dhaka catering to the middle-income group.

One of them is Emeritus Professor Nazrul Islam of Dhaka University, also the Chairman of Centre for Urban Studies (CUS). He believes that JGC could have done better in terms of more facilities for children, improved amenities for housewives and better safety, security measures, alongside providing additional open space, greenery and trees.

But ""overall, Japan Garden City is reasonably commendable, especially considering Dhaka City's uncontrolled development,"" he commented.

Irregularities galore

In 2010, a fire on Building 6 in Japan Garden City killed seven people, including two children. At the time, occupants of some flats claimed that even though there had been fire alarm systems, there had been no equipment to douse flames.

There have been many other reports of irregularities against Japan Garden City as well.

For example, in 2012, the Department of Environment (DoE) fined Japan Garden City Ltd Tk26 lakh for constructing buildings without environment clearance certificates.

DoE at the time stated in a press release that back in 2001, the DoE gave the company placement clearance against only one apartment. But, the company constructed 26 buildings in the area, without taking environment clearance certificates for any.

Another study conducted in 2012 revealed that according to civil engineers, several safety issues had been overlooked since the inception of the construction of Japan Garden City.

According to the study, the land on which the housing complex is situated was originally a water-based area, and it was reclaimed by filling the wetland with outside soil. In such areas, the outside soil typically requires some time to consolidate properly to support buildings.

However, in the case of Japan Garden City, the soil was not adequately tested. The stability and load-bearing capacity of the soil were not thoroughly examined either.

Meanwhile, the project, initially a joint venture between Japan and Bangladesh with the aim of completion by 2004, faced disruption when local residents coerced the Japanese partners to sell off their shares due to intimidation and extortion, shared Selim Zaman, who previously served as the Vice President of the central committee of the founding flat owners' society. At the time, construction of 23 buildings was nearing completion.

Despite already owning flats elsewhere in Dhaka, many affluent families were drawn to book flats in Japan Garden City throughout the 2000s, enticed by the ambitious promises and the prospect of obtaining improved civic amenities.

Shahadat Hossain (not his real name) is a member of one such family. His father had booked the flat in 2002, and he has been living here since 2007 with his family because of the ""generally uninterrupted connection of electricity, gas and water.""

However, they have to pay a high price for that. According to Hossain, electricity in this housing complex is much more expensive than most other residential areas in Dhaka.

He and his wife provided an example, stating that in both October and November of last year, their electricity bill exceeded Tk5,000. Even though they were not in their flat in December, the bill amounted to Tk1,500 just for some electric appliances, such as two refrigerators.

Shahadat also noted that ""during the peak summer times, the electricity bill can go up to Tk9,000 approximately.""

Overall, some flat owners claimed that in spite of living in their own flats, they have to spend around Tk15,000 on various utility bills and fees, including water, gas and internet. With this budget, one could easily rent a two-bedroom flat in some other areas of Mohammadpur.

Upon visiting the housing complex's maintenance office, operated by Japan Garden City Ltd, the manager, Syed Jamal, explained that the high electricity prices are due to the neighbourhood's electricity being connected to a special 33/11 kv electrical substation. This connection now costs every unit over Tk10.

""It's because of this special electricity connection that the residents in Japan Garden City don't have to endure load shedding,"" Jamal explained. He also mentioned that although the company considered shifting to a regular electricity connection a few years ago, the flat owners' committee ultimately opted to retain the special connection.

Jamal further asserted, as also stated on the official website of Japan Garden City Ltd, that although there is a maintenance team from the developing company, the primary control is vested in the flat owners' committee. They are now responsible for making key decisions regarding the housing complex.

However, conversations with several residents of the housing complex revealed that they have numerous complaints against the flat owners' committee. They claim that the society only works in its own interest, leaving many of the problems faced by general flat owners and residents unaddressed.

Selim Zaman elaborated that each building has an elected building committee. This committee nominates two members to represent them on the central committee, with the consent of the meeting.

Subsequently, these central members are elected to roles such as president and vice president of the central committee through another election process.

The term of the most recent flat owners' committee expired in March, and the next election is scheduled for June. In the meantime, there is a five-member caretaker committee in place to oversee the proceedings of the committee.

However, when approached to discuss the overall situation of the housing society, both the convener of the caretaker committee, Md Akhteruzzaman Talukder, and member secretary Mofizul Haque Mintu, declined to provide any comment.

We also contacted Md Wahiduzzaman, Managing Director of Japan Garden City Ltd, as well as the President of Real Estate and Housing Association Bangladesh (Rehab), via email, seeking their comments regarding the complaints.

Md Maksudur Rahman, Marketing Manager of Japan Garden City Ltd, provided us with a written response, claiming all the accusations were ""wholly and absolutely untrue,"" and that ""the city has been designed and built keeping 57% open spaces, including gardens, park etc.""",tbsnews.net,news,The Business Standard,,0.02745098039215677,454649761,29,https://www.tbsnews.net/sites/default/files/styles/social_share/public/images/2024/05/29/concrete_jungle.png,

Decreases in demand follow the EU Council Regulation's coordinated reduction measures passed in 2022 following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

As of 2022, natural gas and electricity made up two-third of the EU's energy portfolio, with renewable energy representing a growing tenth.

The EU imports 90% of its natural gas, but decreased the fuel's imports by 18.4 million terajoules last year, about 20% of 2022 rates.

A measurement of energy consumption, one terajoule equals one trillion joules.

The EU's highest producers of natural gas, the Netherlands and Romania, each produced more than 350,000 terajoules in 2023, just about enough energy to satisfy demands from Hungary or Austria. Germany produced 143,532 terajoules of natural gas last year, about 3% of its nearly 3 million terajoule demand.

The five nations that use the most natural gas all reduced consumption last year, with Germany reducing the fuel's use by 2.96 million terajoules, nearly 4% of overall demand compared with 2022. At the same tine, Italy cut its own natural gas budget by 10%, and France by nearly 12%, each adding up to more than a million terajoule reduction.

Only six member states reported increased natural gas use last year, with Finland's use jumping more than 25% and Sweden's by 11%.

In all, demand for natural gas dropped nearly 20% over the last two years, 13% in 2022 and a further 7% in 2023. The EU required 12.72 million terajoules fewer last year, compared to the year prior.

Livestock farming is one of the main culprits in greenhouse gas emissions, the primary cause of global warming.

Cellular agriculture, where food or nutrients are grown from cell cultures, is increasingly seen as a green alternative to animal agriculture.

Lab-grown meat, eggs and milk have made headlines in recent years, with scientists using animal cell cultures -- a process some have criticized as unnatural, highly processed, energy-consuming and costly.

But at Solar Foods' recently opened factory outside Helsinki, scientists are using new technology to grow protein out of cells using air and electricity.

By feeding a microbe with carbon dioxide, hydrogen and some minerals, and powering the process with electricity from renewable sources, the company has managed to create a protein-rich powder that can be used as a milk and egg substitute.

""We can source our main feedstock for the microbe from the air,"" Solar Foods chief executive Pasi Vainikka told AFP, as he gave a tour of the company's new facilities near Helsinki.

""We have started the production of the world's most sustainable protein.""

Founded by Vainikka and Juha-Pekka Pitkanen in 2017, Solar Foods launched the ""world's first factory growing food out of thin air"" in April.

""Much of the animal-like protein of today can actually be produced through cellular agriculture and we can let agricultural land re-wild and thereby build carbon stock,"" Vainikka said, referring to the process whereby forests and soil absorb and store carbon.

One kilo of the new protein, dubbed ""solein"", emits 130 times less greenhouse gases than the same amount of protein produced by beef production in the European Union, a 2021 scientific study claimed.

Vainikka navigates his way through the factory's laboratory and into the control room, where a dozen people at computer screens monitor the production process.

""These are our future farmers,"" Vainikka said.

Transforming food production and consumption is at the heart of combating the climate crisis and preventing biodiversity loss, according to Emilia Nordlund, head of industrial biotechnology and food research at the VTT Technical Research Centre.

Yet current projections show the consumption of meat is expected to increase in coming years.

""Industrial food production, especially livestock production, is one of the biggest causes of greenhouse gas emissions (and) the biggest cause of biodiversity loss, eutrophication and freshwater usage,"" she said.

New food production technologies can help cut emissions and ""decentralise and diversify food production"", Nordlund said.

""However, at the same time, we must improve the existing food production methods to make them more sustainable and resilient,"" she added.

Fermentation technology used to produce different nutrients, such as proteins, has been around for decades.

But the field has expanded significantly in recent years with new technological solutions and research projects emerging worldwide.

Some of the most active start-up hubs focusing on cellular agriculture are in the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands and Israel, Nordlund said.

""We are in a crucial phase as we will see which start-ups will survive,"" she said, adding that stalling bureaucracy was slowing cellular agriculture's take-off in the EU.

Dressed in protective gear to prevent bacteria contamination in the factory, Vainikka showed off a giant steel tank in a shiny production hall.

""This is a fermenter holding 20,000 litres,"" he said, explaining that the microbe multiplies inside the tank as it gets fed the greenhouse gas.

Liquid containing the microbes is continuously extracted from the tank to be processed into the yellowish protein-rich powder with a flavour described as ""nutty"" and ""creamy"".

""The fermenter produces the same amount of protein per day as 300 milking cows or 50,000 laying hens,"" Vainikka said.

That equals ""five million meals' worth of protein per year"".

For now, the main purpose of the small Finnish plant employing around 40 people is to ""prove that the technology scales"", so it can attract the necessary investments pending European regulatory approval.

While the protein has been cleared for sale in Singapore where some restaurants have used it to make ice cream, it is still awaiting classification as a food product in the EU and the United States.

To have any real impact, the aim is to ""build an industrial plant 100 times the size of this one"", Vainikka said.

By Sofia Sanchez Manzanaro

In April 2024, the trial of nine people accused of plotting the violent overthrow of the German government began in Stuttgart. The case suggests what can happen when, in extreme circumstances, people feel politically alienated.

The suspects were, in the words of German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser, 'driven by hatred towards our democracy.'

Local voices

Participation by residents in local decision-making across Europe can bolster public trust in their systems of democratic rule and limit the risk that dissatisfaction with governance veers towards violence, according to James Scott, a professor of regional and border studies at the Karelian Institute of the University of Eastern Finland.

'The important thing in the process is that people are involved - that they have a sense that we are co-making a decision,' said Scott, who is also an expert on populist movements. 'Not only are we deciding on it, but we also see that these decisions lead to concrete results.'

He leads a research project that received EU funding to examine and help spur more inclusive forms of local governance in Europe. Called EUARENAS, the project began in January 2021 and is due to run through October 2024.

The project is entering its final five months as Europe gears up for EU legislative elections that take place twice a decade. On 6-9 June, voters in the 27 EU Member States will choose 720 members of the European Parliament.

Along with the Council of Ministers representing national governments, the Parliament decides on European laws covering everything from food safety and airline passenger rights to car emissions and electricity supplies.

The assembly also acts as the EU's budget authority and plays a key role in the formation of each European Commission leadership team following the legislative ballot.

Elections to the EU Parliament are in part a barometer of voter sentiment towards national governments and can trigger political changes within Member States.

In the last EU legislative ballot in 2019, voter turnout rose for the first time since the initial European Parliament elections in 1979. Europe's two main political families - the European People's Party and the Party of European Socialists - saw their seat totals drop by more than 30 each.

Mind the gap

Many people in Europe view their governance system as too distant to be influenced, leading to a polarisation of public debate and a rise in anti-democratic political forces, according to Scott.

To counter this trend, EUARENAS has studied examples of social movements and local government actions to expand political participation. It also encouraged grassroots initiatives such as neighbourhood assemblies, participatory budget communities and ""citizen panels"".

The project has brought together academics, local authorities, policy experts and social activists in seven European countries: Austria, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Italy, Poland and the UK.

'Many organisations are out there trying to promote a closer sense of citizen engagement, belonging and ownership of governance processes,' said Scott.

The EUARENAS team has analysed and enacted pilot programmes in Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Poland and the UK.

Opening up

One initiative by the project is a housing and urban development plan involving residents of the Polish coastal city of Gdansk.

'We didn't want to create the master plan from the top down but instead to involve the communities affected by it in the decision-making process,' said Scott.

In the Italian city of Reggio Emilia, residents represented in neighbourhood panels designed an agenda to address the main challenges people face. High among their concerns was the climate crisis.

In the Estonian town of Võru, which is grappling with an exodus of young people, EUARENAS identified ways to enhance their quality of life and employment prospects.

Residents of Võru addressed education on mental health and the well-being of youngsters, with one initiative placing stickers with QR codes in two schools. The codes linked to mental health websites.

A prominent role played by young people in the area was reflected in first-hand testimonies collected by EUARENAS.

Lasse Rihard Sissas, a ninth grader from Võru, cited his strong connection to the region and its natural beauty. He recommended more learning opportunities for people his age and called for the creation of a local university.

'It would be nice if there was a university here,' Sissas said in a project video. 'Young people would stay.'

Regardless of the particular local challenges, more inclusive decision-making at that level can limit the risks of social divisions and political exploitation of them by reactionary political forces, according to Scott.

'Decision-making has to be more democratic, more open,' said Scott.

Bridge-building

In the German trial in Stuttgart, prosecutors have charged the nine suspects with plotting a coup aimed at installing an aristocrat in power. German police reportedly foiled the alleged plot during raids in 2022.

The court proceedings are among three German trials this year involving a total of 26 defendants, all of whom are accused of plotting the violent overthrow of the federal government.

One challenge in nurturing grassroots involvement in public debates is that people who harbour extreme views are more reluctant to voice them, according to Pierangelo Isernia, a professor of political science at the University of Siena in Italy.

'They think they will be exposed and attacked because of their ideas,' he said.

Isernia led another EU-funded project into how liberal democracies can tackle political polarisation through more inclusive decision-making. Called EUCOMMEET, the project wrapped up in February 2024 after three years.

Language lessons

It featured an experiment involving a total of more than 400 people in five EU countries: France, Germany, Ireland, Italy and Poland.

The participants exchanged views on the climate crisis - a topic that Isernia said has had an increasingly polarising effect in Europe and beyond.

Initially, the exchanges took place locally by involving people from the same city. Then the conversations became national and, finally, European with a concluding plenary session in which people from at least three countries exchanged views.

The sessions each involved eight to 10 people. In a reflection of the experiment's cross-border nature, an open-source online platform allowed the participants to communicate in their native languages.

'People could discuss in their language and understand what others were saying,' said Isernia. 'We showed that this is possible.'

A main finding of EUCOMMEET is that exchanges of these kinds among people help reduce divisions over any given topic.

Isernia said he hopes that platforms like the one developed by the project will be integrated into future EU efforts to involve the general public in policy considerations.

For instance, he recommends that the next European Commission organise 'short-term consultations' to capture evolving public opinions.

'Surveys are not enough to understand what people really think,' said Isernia. 'You need to see how a person evolves in their thinking through a conversation and deliberative processes are the best way of understanding this.'",moderndiplomacy.eu,news,Modern Diplomacy,,-0.2862745098039216,454629905,9,https://moderndiplomacy.eu/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/european-union.jpg,

However, the fate of humanity is a challenge that extends beyond our social reality. Experiences of belonging and inclusion, understood in a broader sense than before, may be crucial for a sustainable future.

In an article published in the International Journal of Social Pedagogy, a team of researchers propose a new planetary inclusion scale that structures our planetary relationship three-dimensionally based on temporal, spatial and ethical orientation.

The temporal element relates to the link between generations: those who lived before us have created the foundation upon which we are building our well-being today. Similarly, the choices we make today will affect the lives of generations to come -- whether we like it or not.

The spatial element, in turn, is about how the foundation of our well-being is largely built on resources from outside our own area. Nowadays, our everyday life is typically connected to the lives and environments of people in faraway places.

""We often oversimplify reality by thinking in a point-like manner, for example that electricity comes from the socket, water from the tap, and jeans from the store,"" Professor Arto O. Salonen of the University of Eastern Finland, the first author of the article introducing the planetary inclusion scale, notes.

The planetary inclusion scale also involves the idea of broader ethical thinking. Transcending the human-biosphere boundary in life-preserving ways is increasingly important.

Evaluating personal beliefs and experiences helps to become aware of one's planetary relationship. The nature of this relationship is increasingly central when seeking solutions to climate change, biodiversity loss and the depletion of natural resources.

The planetary inclusion scale works in such a way that the respondent evaluates their life as a whole by considering the following statements, for example, on a scale of 1-7.

The strength of the planetary inclusion scale lies in its ability to make visible the diverse ways in which humans are connected to their surrounding world. Each of the connections identified can give meaning to life, increase experiences of belonging and inclusion, expand the sphere of care, and raise awareness of one's own possibilities for influence.",phys.org,news,Phys.org,,0.2156862745098038,454622717,1,https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/global-community.jpg,

With global demand for fossil-free electricity forecast to double in the coming decades, we take a closer look at four projects that could become viable options for the energy sector soon.

For thousands of years, mankind has tried to harness the energy of the four elements: earth, wind, sun, and water. Wind to drive boats and mills, water to turn wheels, the Sun to generate heat and light fire and from the Earth itself pressure and hot springs.

This quest has never stopped; rather, it has intensified as global demand for fossil-free energy increases. The challenge lies in managing all that raw energy.

In one second, the Sun emits the same amount of energy as humanity consumes in 20,000 years. The fraction of energy that reaches Earth every hour is sufficient to meet our global electricity needs for an entire year.

An innovation that could efficiently capture and utilise more of this energy would represent a huge leap in fossil freedom.

On 4 February 1993, a five-kilometre-wide bright spot raced from France to Russia at a speed of 8 km/s. Some 350 kilometres above Earth's surface, the cause was in orbit: a 20-metre-wide reflector screen that the Russian Federal Space Agency had deployed next to their space station, Mir.

While the Russians had other objectives, and the project was abandoned a few years later, now space engineers from the University of Glasgow have published new research about a method that they believe could be a viable option to increase the output of photovoltaics on Earth.

With modern technology, the reflector screens would be cheaper, more efficient, easier to deploy and could be automatically aimed at large solar farms, adding an extra 20 minutes or so of production every day. When they are no longer able to direct energy towards solar farms, they could be steered in a neutral direction to avoid disturbance.

Dr Onur Çelik, the corresponding author of the paper, says: ""Solar power has the potential to be one of the key accelerators in our race to reach net-zero, helping us to mitigate the global impacts of climate change by reducing our reliance on fossil fuels.

Algae biofuels first caught the attention of major oil corporations about 20 years ago, and hundreds of millions of dollars have since gone into research. By cultivating microalgae in controlled environments, these microorganisms photosynthesize sunlight and carbon dioxide into oil-rich biomass. Once mature, the algae are harvested, the oil is extracted and processed into biofuels.

Algae can be grown on marginal land and promises high output, while it's relatively easy to refine. However, early efforts to scale up algae biofuel production has encountered hurdles, particularly in achieving scalability and better efficiency under environmental constraints. Work is now being focused on modifying algae strains to improve productivity and resilience. The goal is to develop a product that has nine times the output compared to palm biodiesel, for example.

The algea biofuel company Virido claims for example that they already achieved seven times the oil productivity compared to wild algae and participates in the decarbonization challenge of the heavy transportation sector as aviation, shipping, and long-distance trucking.

Karl Bergman, long-time Head of R&D at Vattenfall, has seen technologies develop over decades. And there's a clear distinction between an interesting idea and a great invention, he says. The two main drivers that push innovators to make products cheaper, cleaner, and more efficient are climate and competition. Only solutions that meet both these demands can last long-term.

""When there is already a solution on the market, new alternatives need to be significantly better for us to want to change,"" he says.

""It's not only about the technology but probably even more about the people, their habits, knowledge, and the infrastructure surrounding the technology.""

In the town of Kankaanpää in western Finland, 100 tonnes of sand is tightly packed into a solid steel tank in two layers separated by heat insulation. On sunny or windy days, excess energy from adjacent solar and wind farms heats the sand to about 600 degrees Celsius. As opposed to water, which has a significantly lower boiling point, sand and other solid materials store much larger amounts of energy per unit.

This innovation has already proven to be significantly better than the alternative -- burning fossil fuels for heating -- and is cutting emissions from some district heating networks by nearly 70 per cent.

""This is a significant step in scaling up the sand battery technology"", says Liisa Naskali, COO at Polar Night Energy, the company behind the innovation, in an interview with euronews.green.

At about 300 metres altitude, wind currents are significantly higher compared to the 100 or so metres that many conventional windmills reach. Harnessing this power could generate double the electricity - and eight times more than smaller windmills at 35 metres. But the solution isn't to build 300-metre monopiles. Instead, different technologies such as kites, drones, or helium-lifted turbines are being tested to reach this untapped power source. Turbines are tethered to the ground with wires that also transmit electricity to the power grid.

This solution would also have other benefits, such as being mobile and requiring little ground infrastructure, making them especially attractive for remote and hard-to-reach areas.

""Airborne wind energy is an innovative renewable energy technology which, on small scale, is perfectly suited for remote off-grid electricity generation and, on a larger scale, will have the potential to disrupt the global energy economy"", as the company Kitepower´s co-founder Roland Schmehl describes it on the company´s website.

It's too early to tell if our cars will run on algae biofuels, or kites fluttering 300 metres above the ground will power our homes. What is certain is that we will need a mix of energy sources, says Bergman.

""There is no silver bullet -- we need multiple energy sources to meet the demand for renewable energy. During my 20 years as Head of R&D, I have seen wind and solar power become the cheapest technologies for producing electrical power. I've also seen how the discussion has moved from being mainly about hardware to being about information and data. Now, with the evolution of AI, there are so many fantastic opportunities that we've only just begun to see.""",evwind.es,news,AEEolica,,0.2,454618333,17,,

Yes, you read that right - a company is now making protein from literally thin air (via South China Morning Post).

This interesting approach promises to transform the food industry by offering a sustainable alternative to traditional animal and plant-based proteins.

Solein is a protein-rich powder made through a unique process involving single-celled organisms. Solein's production uses abundant gases hydrogen and carbon dioxide to feed these organisms. Much like how sugar speeds up the fermentation process in yeast.

The process begins with the electrolysis of water, which separates it into hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen and carbon dioxide are then fed to hydrogen-oxidizing bacteria in a carefully controlled environment.

These bacteria use chemosynthesis, a process in which chemical reactions produce energy for growth by converting gases into proteins.

""We can source our main feedstock for the microbe from the air,"" Solar Foods CEO Pasi Vainikka tells SCMP, putting the process into simple words.

Solein's production method stands out in the rapidly developing market of alternative proteins. Traditional protein sources, whether animal-based or plant-based, require significant amounts of land, water, and other resources.

According to available data, food production contributes to around 26% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, packaging, retail, food processing, and transportation account for 18% of total food emissions.

Livestock farming, in particular, is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, which are a primary driver of global warming.The biggest contributors to food emissions are livestock and fish farms at 31%, and grain production and land use at a staggering 51%.

By contrast, Solein's production process is remarkably efficient and environmentally friendly. CEO Vainikka adds that that a significant portion of today's animal-like protein can be produced via cellular agriculture.

This approach has the potential to lessen reliance on traditional farming, enabling agricultural land to revert to natural states, which in turn can enhance carbon sequestration, the CEO noted.

According to Solar Foods, producing one kilogram of the 'world's most sustainable protein' Solein emits 130 times less greenhouse gases than the same amount of protein from beef production in the European Union.

Solar Foods, founded by Pasi Vainikka and Juha-Pekka Pitkanen in 2017, launched its first production facility, Factory 01, in Vantaa, Finland, in April.

This facility, for now, only serves as a proof of concept, demonstrating that the technology can be scaled up for larger production.

Currently, Solar Foods is focused on proving the scalability of its technology to attract further investment. The company's goal is to build an industrial plant 100 times the size of its current facility, SCMP reports.

While Solein has already been approved for sale in Singapore, where it has been used in products like ice cream, it is still awaiting regulatory approval in the EU and the US. Solar Foods receives funding from the European Union.

""Flamanville 3 becomes the 57th reactor in the French nuclear fleet This is the culmination of many years of work,"" Morvan said on his Linked-In page. Some 150,000 pieces of equipment and all the EPR's circuits have been rigorously checked and conditioned (visual and endoscopic inspections, cleaning of circuits and premises, etc.). More than 58,000 operating criteria were tested, he noted.

The 241 fuel assemblies, each about 5 metres high and weighing nearly 800 kg, were transferred one by one under water, through the transfer tube that links the fuel storage pool to the reactor pool where the vessel is located. ""The handling of the fuel assemblies was carried out with the greatest rigour by the EDF teams. The loading of the reactor concludes the first stage of start-up.

Morvan said the tank will be closed soon and the tank cover equipment will be connected to the regulation and control system. The primary circuit will then gradually increase in temperature and pressure until it reaches hot shutdown conditions at 303°C and 155 bar. The first nuclear reaction, called divergence, will be carried out in the coming weeks. The reactor will then be able to ramp up gradually until it is connected to the electricity grid in the summer of 2024, at 25% nuclear power. The EPR will continue its ramp-up in stages to 100% capacity by the end of the year. During these several months, numerous checks will be carried out in order to test about 1,500 safety criteria.

""As project director since the beginning of 2020, I am proud to have lived the EPR adventure and followed so many activities to bring the reactor to maturity, thanks to the unfailing involvement of the women and men who have worked for this project for many years.""

Construction of the Flamanville 3 reactor began in December 2007, with an initial target of commercial operation in 2013. However, the project has faced significant delays and cost overruns, with the latest estimate by EDF putting the total cost at €13.2bn ($14.2bn). The Flamanville EPR is the first of its kind in France, following the commissioning of EPR reactors in China (Taishan 1&2) and Finland (Olkiluoto 3), all of which were also significantly delayed.",neimagazine.com,news,Nuclear Engineering International,,0.05098039215686279,454601761,1,https://www.neimagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2024/05/Alain_Morvan_EDF.jpg,

The limitation could see greater power price fluctuations than normal, especially at times of simultaneously low or high wind power production, disturbances in power plants or outages on other transmission lines, Finland's Fingrid said.

Between May 29 and June 23, capacity from Finland to Sweden will be 300 megawatts (MW) instead of the usual 1,100 MW, a market message posted by Swedish grid operator Svenska kraftnaet on the Nord Pool exchange transparency website showed.

From Sweden to Finland, only 200 MW instead of 1,200 MW will be available during the same period.

Similar restrictions will be repeated in July and August to allow for work on the new Aurora Line cross-border connection, which is scheduled to start operations in 2025, Fingrid said in its statement.

Nord Pool transparency data showed the cuts will last from July 15 until Aug. 11.

In addition, Fingrid said work to strengthen the main grid in Ostrobothnia in western Finland during the summer could see wind power output cut regionally by as much as 2,000 MW to maintain system security.

This is the kind of daily fluctuation that electricity consumers will have to keep in mind this summer, and according to Eesti Energia's Armen Kasparov, behind it are solar, natural gas and Estlink 2, the undersea power link between Estonia and Finland.

""Peak morning and evening hours are covered by the production of gas-fired power plants which reaches us from Latvia and Lithuania, and their cost price never drops below €100,"" explained Kasparov, head of energy trading at the Estonian state-owned energy group.

""We know that the Estlink 2 cable is out of service until September, and with that, affordable electricity from the Nordic countries, which today comes primarily from nuclear energy, isn't reaching us,"" he continued. ""Midday is peak solar production, and that drives down prices significantly because there's not that much demand to meet. All three of these factors are closely linked.""

Kasparov acknowledged that very cheap solar energy should please consumers, but most people are at work during the day. In the short term, household consumers are protected from fluctuations in market prices by fixed-price plans. In the future, large and high-capacity energy storage facilities would help as well.

""Solar energy isn't bad, it just needs cheaper production capacities on the market, or storage options that could distribute this cheap electricity at later hours too,"" he said. ""But if these capabilities do emerge, it will mean that daytime prices will go up a bit as well, because then that cheap electricity won't be put into the grid; it will be stored for the evening hours.""

Eesti Energia's thermal power plants, meanwhile, cannot even enter the market with such price fluctuations. The group's energy trading chief pointed out that firing up the thermal power plant at Auvere is a very lengthy process.

""Just to produce [electricity] only in the morning and evening, that means that all those daytime deficits, where the price is near zero, need to be factored in,"" he explained. ""This makes oil shale-fired power plants very uncompetitive against gas-fired plants, which are very fast. Consumers aren't willing to pay a daily average price of €150 per MWh right now. That is what Auvere would actually need.""

Wind powers ships and factories, water turns wheels, the sun creates heat to light fires, and the earth itself creates pressure and hot springs.

This quest never stops. Rather, it is intensifying as global demand for fossil-free energy grows. The challenge lies in managing all that raw energy.

Space Solar Reflector

In one second, the sun releases as much energy as humanity consumes in 20,000 years, and the portion of the energy that reaches Earth each hour is enough to meet the world's electricity needs for a year.

Innovations that can capture and use this energy more efficiently would represent a giant leap towards moving away from fossil fuels.

On February 4, 1993, a bright spot five kilometers wide flew from France to Russia at eight kilometers per second. It was in orbit about 350 kilometers above the Earth's surface and was caused by a 20-meter-wide reflective screen installed by the Russian Federal Space Agency next to the Mir space station.

Russia had other objectives and the project was abandoned after a few years, but now space engineers at the University of Glasgow have published new research into what they believe could be a viable option for increasing solar power output on Earth.

Modern technology has made reflective screens cheaper, more efficient and easier to install, and they can be automatically aimed at larger solar farms, adding around 20 minutes of power each day. If they can no longer direct energy towards the solar farms, they can also be pointed in a neutral direction to avoid interference.

Dr Onur Çelik, corresponding author of the paper, said: ""Solar power can be one of the key accelerators in the race to reach net zero, helping to mitigate the global effects of climate change by reducing reliance on fossil fuels.""

Algae biofuel

Algal biofuels first caught the attention of major oil companies about 20 years ago, and hundreds of millions of dollars have been poured into research since then. By cultivating microalgae in controlled environments, these microorganisms photosynthesize with sunlight and carbon dioxide to produce oil-rich biomass. Mature algae are harvested and the oil extracted and processed into biofuel.

Algae can be grown on marginal land, has high yield potential, and is relatively easy to refine. However, early efforts to scale up algal biofuel production have faced challenges, especially in terms of scalability and efficiency under environmental constraints. Current efforts are focused on improving algae strains to improve productivity and resilience. The goal is to develop a product that is nine times more productive than, for example, palm biodiesel.

For example, algae biofuel company Virido claims to have already achieved seven times higher oil productivity compared to wild algae, and is joining the challenge of decarbonizing heavy transportation sectors such as aviation, shipping, and long-haul trucking.

The innovation challenge

Carl Bergmann, Vattenfall's longtime head of research and development, has watched technological developments for decades, and he says there's a clear difference between an interesting idea and a great invention. Climate and competition are the main drivers for innovators to make products cheaper, cleaner and more efficient. Only solutions that meet both demands can be sustainable in the long term.

""When there's already a solution on the market, the new alternative has to be significantly better for us to want to change,"" he says.

""It's not just about technology, but maybe it's also about people, their habits, their knowledge and the infrastructure that surrounds the technology.""

Sand Battery

In the town of Kankaanpää in western Finland, 100 tons of sand are packed into two sturdy steel tanks separated by insulation. On sunny or windy days, excess energy from nearby solar and wind farms heats the sand to about 600 degrees. In contrast to water, which has a much lower boiling point, sand and other solid materials can store much more energy per unit.

This innovation has already proven significantly better than the alternative of burning fossil fuels for heating, reducing emissions from some district heating networks by around 70 percent.

""This is an important step towards the scaling up of sand battery technology,"" Liisa Nascali, chief operating officer at Polar Knight Energy, the company driving the innovation, said in an interview with euronews.green.

High altitude wind power

At an altitude of about 300 meters, the wind currents are much stronger than at an altitude of around 100 meters that conventional wind turbines reach. This force can be harnessed to generate twice the power, and eight times more power compared to a small 35-meter turbine. But the solution is not to build a 300-meter monopile, and different technologies such as kites, drones and helium lift turbines are being tested to reach this untapped source of power. The turbines are fixed to the ground with wires that send electricity to the power grid.

The solution has other advantages, such as being mobile and requiring little on-ground infrastructure, making it particularly attractive for remote or hard-to-reach areas.

""Airborne wind energy is a revolutionary renewable energy technology that is ideally suited for off-grid power generation in remote locations on a small scale, and has the potential to disrupt the global energy economy on a large scale,"" Kitepower co-founder Roland Schmehl explains on the company's website.

What's next?

It's too early to tell whether cars will run on algae biofuel or homes will be powered by kites flying 1,000 feet above the ground, but what's certain is that we'll need multiple energy sources, Bergman said.

""There is no silver bullet. Meeting renewable energy demand requires multiple energy sources. In my 20 years as an R&D manager, I've seen wind and solar power become the cheapest electricity production technologies. I've also seen the discussion shift from being primarily about hardware to being about information and data. Now, with advances in AI, there are a lot of incredible opportunities that we're only just beginning to see.""

The product could help reduce the need for livestock farming, among the biggest culprits for greenhouse gas emissions. Approval for it as a food is pending

At a factory in Finland, the “farmers of the future” are making a new food protein using air and electricity, proving that protein can be produced without traditional agriculture.

Livestock farming is one of the main contributors to greenhouse gas emissions, the primary cause of global warming.

Cellular agriculture, where food or nutrients are grown from cell cultures, is increasingly seen as a green alternative to animal agriculture.

Lab-grown meat, eggs and milk have made headlines in recent years, with scientists using animal cell cultures – a process some have criticised as unnatural, highly processed, energy-consuming and costly.

But at Solar Foods’ recently opened factory outside Helsinki, scientists are using new technology to grow protein.

By feeding a microbe with carbon dioxide, hydrogen and some minerals, and powering the process with electricity from renewable sources, the company has managed to create a protein-rich powder that can be used as a milk and egg substitute.

“We can source our main feedstock for the microbe from the air,” Solar Foods chief executive Pasi Vainikka says, as he gives a tour of the company’s facilities.

“We have started the production of the world’s most sustainable protein.”

Founded by Vainikka and Juha-Pekka Pitkanen in 2017, Solar Foods launched the “world’s first factory growing food out of thin air” in April.

“Much of the animal-like protein of today can actually be produced through cellular agriculture and we can let agricultural land re-wild and thereby build carbon stock,” Vainikka says, referring to the process whereby forests and soil absorb and store carbon.

Producing one kilogram of the new protein, dubbed “solein”, emits 130 times less greenhouse gases than the same amount of protein from beef production in the European Union, a 2021 scientific study claimed.

Vainikka navigates his way through the factory’s laboratory and into the control room, where a dozen people at computer screens monitor the production process.

“These are our future farmers,” he says.

Transforming food production and consumption is at the heart of combating the climate crisis and preventing biodiversity loss, according to Emilia Nordlund, head of industrial biotechnology and food research at Finland’s VTT Technical Research Centre.

Current projections show the consumption of meat is expected to increase in coming years.

“Industrial food production, especially livestock production, is one of the biggest causes of greenhouse gas emissions (and) the biggest cause of biodiversity loss, eutrophication and freshwater usage,” Nordlund says, eutrophication being the process by which water becomes nutrient-rich, leading to excessive growth of algae and other plants.

New food production technologies can help cut emissions and “decentralise and diversify food production”, she says.

“However, at the same time, we must improve the existing food production methods to make them more sustainable and resilient,” she adds.

Fermentation technology used to produce different nutrients, such as proteins, has been around for decades. But the field has expanded significantly in recent years with new technological solutions and research projects emerging worldwide.

Some of the most active start-up hubs focusing on cellular agriculture are in the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands and Israel, Nordlund says.

“We are in a crucial phase as we will see which start-ups will survive,” she says, adding that stalling bureaucracy was slowing cellular agriculture’s take-off in the EU.

Dressed in protective gear to prevent bacterial contamination in the factory, Vainikka shows off a giant steel tank in a shiny production hall.

“This is a fermenter holding 20,000 litres [5,300 gallons],” he says, explaining that the microbe multiplies inside the tank as it gets fed the greenhouse gas.

Liquid containing the microbes is continuously extracted from the tank to be processed into the yellowish, protein-rich powder with a flavour described as “nutty” and “creamy”.

“The fermenter produces the same amount of protein per day as 300 milking cows or 50,000 laying hens,” Vainikka says.

That equals “five million meals’ worth of protein per year”.

For now, the main purpose of the small Finnish plant, which employs around 40 people, is to “prove that the technology scales”, so it can attract the necessary investments pending European regulatory approval.

While the protein has been cleared for sale in Singapore, where some restaurants have used it to make ice cream, it is still awaiting classification as a food product in the EU and the US.

To have any real impact, the aim is to “build an industrial plant 100 times the size of this one”, Vainikka says.",scmp.com,news,South China Morning Post,,0.1215686274509804,454562164,13,https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/d8/images/canvas/2024/05/27/b9de011a-7d01-4c0b-a1b2-57413c6c8a76_70545158.jpg?itok=Hwzwsn-9,

--

A breakthrough technology that has the potential to dramatically reduce the amount of radioactive waste from nuclear power plants has received backing from Switzerland.

Developed by Geneva-based start-up Transmutex, the long-sought technology could solve a dilemma that has long been cited by the anti-nuclear movement as one of the main disadvantages of atomic energy. While this form of electricity is emission-free and thus a better alternative to highly polluting fossil fuels - making it the second-largest source of low emissions power after hydropower - the dangers posed by highly radioactive spent fuels raise concerns about its feasibility. This hazardous waste contains highly poisonous chemicals like plutonium and uranium pellets, which remain highly radioactive for hundreds of thousands of years, posing a threat to agricultural land, fishing waters, freshwater sources, and humans.

More on the topic: The Nuclear Waste Disposal Dilemma

After reviewing Transmutex' proposal for several months, Swiss national body managing the disposal of radioactive waste Nagra concluded that the technology - known as nuclear transmutation - could cut waste by 80%. The process converts long-lived radioactive isotopes into shorter-lived or stable isotopes, reducing the overall radioactivity and longevity of the waste, thereby minimizing its environmental impact and long-term management requirements.

According to the start-up's website, the technology could be used on 99% of the world's nuclear waste and would cut the duration of its radioactivity from half a million years to ""less than 500 years.""

Between 1954, when early commercial nuclear power stations started, and 2016, some 390,000 tonnes of spent fuel were accumulated. Of these, about two-thirds are currently being stored - mostly in inactive nuclear power plants - while the rest were reprocessed. The largest quantity of untreated nuclear waste on the planet is currently stored in the Sellafield plant in the UK.

In the case of Chernobyl, some of the plant's reactors still contain an enormous amount of waste that will remain dangerous for tens of thousands of years. In 2019, one reactor was finally encased below an enormous steel and concrete structure. However, the US$1.6-billion construction will safely store the radioactive material for only about a century and is thus just a temporary solution.

""The successful management of radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel underpins the peaceful use of nuclear technology in all its facets, from low-carbon energy production to medicine and industry,"" said Mikhail Chudakov, IAEA Deputy Director General and Head of the Department of Nuclear Energy.

Nuclear power accounts for about 10% of electricity generation globally, rising to almost 20% in advanced economies, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).

The energy crisis sparked by the war in Ukraine and the race to net zero have pushed many countries, including Belgium, Canada, China, Finland, France, and Japan to take steps to extend operations at existing nuclear power plants and build new ones. As a result, new nuclear power capacity increased by about 40% between 2021 and 2022.",earth.org,news,Earth.Org - Past | Present | Future,Martina Igini,-0.388235294117647,454562022,5,https://u4d2z7k9.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Untitled-1024-×-683px-87.jpg,eng-9603199

A 3 per cent fall in March gives reason to hope,"SINGAPORE - If there is one question energy analysts and climate scientists want answered, it is this: Has China's carbon emissions finally peaked?

China is the world's top carbon polluter, emitting nearly a third of all carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions linked to human activity, and those emissions are a major driver of climate change.

It is also by far the largest investor and producer of wind and solar energy. How the country manages the transition to a clean energy economy has lessons for all nations - and the pace of global climate change.

While it is too early to say for sure if emissions have peaked, China's carbon emissions fell 3 per cent year on year in March 2024, ending a 14-month surge following the lifting of Covid-zero controls, an analysis published on May 28 showed.

The main causes for the drop are expanding solar and wind generation, as well as declining construction activity caused by the ailing property sector.

Electricity demand has continued to increase rapidly in China, growing 7.4 per cent year on year in March, but record additions of wind and solar in 2023 helped meet 90 per cent of this additional demand.

The pace of growth of new green energy capacity has continued into 2024, noted the analysis published by Carbon Brief, a British climate news site. The analysis is based on official figures and commercial data.

Mr Lauri Myllyvirta, the author of the analysis and a senior fellow at Asia Society Policy Institute, said that emissions from steel and cement production - large carbon polluting sectors - fell sharply in March, reflecting the contraction of the construction sector.

He said the slowdown strengthens the view that China's CO2 emissions might have peaked in 2023, but that this trend would become clearer only after more months of data.

""The key message from my analysis up to March is that emissions are currently in a structural decline and if the key drivers of that decline - clean energy additions, the fading importance of the construction sector - continue, emissions should keep falling,"" said Helsinki-based Mr Myllyvirta, who is also lead analyst for the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, a research organisation registered in Finland.

- Wind and solar growth pushed fossil fuels' share of electricity generation in China down to 63.6 per cent in March 2024, from 67.4 per cent a year earlier.

- Steel production fell by 8 per cent and cement output by 22 per cent in March 2024.

- Electric vehicles now make up around one in 10 vehicles on China's roads, knocking around 3.5 percentage points off the growth in petrol demand.

- Oil demand for transport was unchanged from a year earlier - following months of strong increases - suggesting that the post-Covid-19 rebound could be petering out. Coal use also fell 1 per cent in March.

Burning coal, oil and gas are the main sources of CO2 - the main greenhouse gas - and pressure is growing to hasten the switch to greener energy to try to limit the pace of climate change.

JIM CHALMERS: The CSIRO has completely torpedoed this uncosted nuclear fantasy of Peter Dutton's.

- Nine News (Sydney), 21 May, 2024

The CSIRO is Australia's premier science body.

And it has bad news for those who argue that nuclear energy is the key to reaching net zero:

Nuclear option unviable ...

- Sydney Morning Herald, 22 May, 2024

Nuclear could cost up to $17b and take until 2040 to build ...

- Australian Financial Review, 22 May, 2024

CSIRO report paints grim picture of cost, timeline of Coalition's nuclear idea

- news.com.au, 22 May, 2024

The CSIRO has said before that nuclear energy in Australia can't compete with renewables and would come too late to save us from global warming.

But it's now teamed up with the Australian Energy Market Operator to put numbers on its assessment, saying we wouldn't see the first reactor until 2040.

With Seven's Mark Riley reporting:

MARK RILEY: ... as a comprehensive CSIRO study finds powering Australia through the Coalition's nuclear energy plan would cost twice as much as renewables and take 15 years to build, extending coal and gas-fired generation.

- Seven News (Sydney), 22 May, 2024

So how was this reported at The Australian, which has long campaigned for nuclear energy and lower power prices?

Well, it certainly wasn't front-page news, where the paper was warning about the risk of green energy and blackouts.

But tucked away on page five was this enticing headline:

CSIRO runs ruler over value of large-scale nuclear power

- The Australian, 22 May, 2024

Wow. Talk about clickbait.

And online, the story was even harder to locate although we did find the CEO of Woodside slamming Labor's energy policy as wishful thinking.

But this subtle downplaying by the Oz was nothing compared to the approach at Sky After Dark where commentators lined up to sink the slipper into the scientists at CSIRO and claim that its negation of nuclear should just be ignored.

With Chris Kenny landing the first blow:

CHRIS KENNY: Is this science or is this advocacy? Is this science or is this ideology?

- The Kenny Report, Sky News Australia, 22 May, 2024

Kenny accusing the nation's science and energy experts of fiddling the figures to suit the renewable message:

CHRIS KENNY: So the CSIRO, they just juggle around with some of their numbers and they chuck in a bit of transmission here and a bit of firming there and some batteries there and they pretend they've invented a new form of energy, reliable renewables.

- The Kenny Report, Sky News Australia, 22 May, 2024

Yes, these government scientists can't be trusted.

And on Sharri Markson's show, former Victorian Liberal Party president Michael Kroger was telling us why:

MICHAEL KROGER: The CSIRO haven't got the credibility they had 20-30 years ago ...

... because they've been very much part of the, sort of, you know, the screaming cultural left on these environmental issues over more than a decade now.

- Sharri, Sky News Australia, 22 May, 2024

And that message was echoed by Peta Credlin, also on Sky, who declared:

PETA CREDLIN: I know where I want to go, I want to go nuclear.

- Credlin, Sky News Australia, 22 May, 2024

And beaming into Credlin's program from Stockholm, her fellow traveller, Nick Cater, agreed:

NICK CATER: We know the technology is there, we know it works. Sweden right, 40 per cent nuclear ...

... I just think it's a no brainer.

- Credlin, Sky News Australia, 22 May, 2024

Nick Cater is a massive fan of nuclear power and an even bigger fan of Sweden and Finland's nuclear reactors, and having travelled there at his own expense, he's been enthusing about it all to The Australian, and to Sky News in several other crosses to Credlin from the country.

As well appearing on the libertarian digital channel, ADH TV:

NICK CATER: We're in a clean energy paradise here in Finland. The electricity grid is running at 90-95 per cent carbon free. They've got the second cheapest electricity in Europe all thanks to nuclear.

- Reality Bites, ADH TV, 16 May, 2024

But it's not 'all thanks to nuclear' which actually generates only a third of Finland's electricity.

And it's not recent decisions that have made Finland's power cheap.

Finland opted for nuclear energy 60 years ago and building it today is an entirely different proposition.

This brand new nuclear reactor at Olkiluoto Island, for example, where Cater says:

NICK CATER: I would quite happily settle for a holiday cottage right here. I tell you what, right here. And the good thing is, the lights wouldn't go out.

- Reality Bites, ADH TV, 16 May, 2024

That was due to open way back in 2009 and cost three billion Euros. But it ended up costing nearly four times as much and it arrived 14 years late.

With even The Australian in 2015 calling it a 'cautionary tale'.

Technical problems have also kept it shut down for 73 days since it opened.

And that's in a country which has experience in nuclear power, existing sites and wide popular support. Unlike Australia.

But let's go back to Sky, where Andrew Bolt was also spruiking the nuclear cause, inviting on 17-year-old Will Shackel, and asking:

ANDREW BOLT: Look, the CSIRO saying nuclear power is much more expensive than wind and solar, it will take 50 years to save us, too late. Do you believe it? What do you know at 17 that the CSIRO does not know at all?

- The Bolt Report, Sky News Australia, 22 May, 2024

Good question.

Which in fact was met with some good answers from the teenage founder of Nuclear for Australia, including a call to lift the ban on nuclear energy in this country and have a proper debate.

But even Shackel couldn't answer the problem that nuclear power would not deliver low emissions electricity in Australia until 2040 or later, while climate change action is needed now.

However, let's not pretend that the Coalition's energy policy is the only one to get a free pass from sections of the media.

Labor's reliance on carbon capture and storage to hit net zero by 2050 is even more pie in the sky.

Because, as Crikey's Bernard Keane observed last week:

Unlike Dutton's nuclear power technology, carbon capture doesn't work.

- Crikey, 23 May, 2024

With Keane citing a number of recent failures and a long list of abandoned projects.

The CSIRO and AEMO report finds that carbon capture would cost almost as much as large-scale nuclear, whether it's trying to clean up coal or gas.

And trying is still the operative word.

The EU aims to reduce its dependency on Russian fossil fuels and accelerate the transition to clean energy. To take concrete actions, the EU has launched the REPowerEU plan, which is part of the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF). VTT has just launched three strategic research openings and a postdoc programme as part of the implementation of the REPowerEU chapter of Finland's Recovery and Resilience Plan.

One of the objectives of Finland is to support research and development activities focusing on clean energy solutions. VTT's first research opening focuses on electricity storage and accelerating clean energy production, the second on improving industrial energy efficiency and the third on renewable hydrogen economy solutions. VTT has been granted EUR 22.8 million to develop clean energy solutions.

""The research projects of EUR 17.8 million just launched will not only aim at significant reductions of emissions and improvements in energy efficiency, but also create opportunities for new types of business and business models. The aim is to develop solutions for both domestic use and export,"" says Jussi Manninen, Executive Vice President of VTT's Carbon Neutral Solutions business area.

Increasing in production of clean energy goes hand in hand with a fundamental change in heavy industry. Improvements are required in both energy and material efficiency and decarbonisation of processes as such. This is why the research themes are cross-cutting and cover value chains.

""For example, carbon capture and industrial reuse are linked to the hydrogen economy, which in turn is linked to energy storages. The production of raw materials for renewable plastics or fuels requires hydrogen with carbon. Hydrogen, on the other hand, can be produced by electricity when there's an excess of renewable energy production,"" says Tua Huomo, Executive Vice President of VTT's Sustainable Products and Services business area.

Postdoc programme recruits top experts in energy sector

VTT has already carried out pioneering research and development to promote renewable energy solutions. The aim is now to increase expertise and develop solutions to address bottlenecks related to the green transition, such as the adequacy of electricity storage capacity, availability of critical materials and safety challenges in the use of hydrogen. This requires new expertise, which is why the research openings include an extensive postdoc programme. The programme is used to hire top experts from both Finland and abroad, and EUR 3.4 million has been reserved for this purpose.

""With REPowerEU funding, we deepen our cutting-edge energy research and develop solutions that accelerate the commercial adoption of key clean energy technologies in Finland. The postdoc programme also helps us to attract top foreign researchers to Finland,"" Jussi Manninen says.

VTT invests in clean energy pilot infrastructure and builds process development facilities in Bioruukki as well as research and product development services. The EUR 5 million granted from the REPowerEU envelope to extend the pilot infrastructure is part of VTT's total investment (EUR 21.3 million) in Bioruukki. The REPowerEU funding covers part of the hydrogen and emission-free transport infrastructure and research equipment. The clean energy testing and piloting infrastructure will be used for research and development projects important to industry, such as hydrogen technologies, reducing industrial carbon footprint, transport and energy storage.

The three strategic research openings launched: Electricity storage and accelerating clean energy, industrial energy efficiency and low-carbonisation, as well as renewable hydrogen economy, the postdoc programme and the development of the Bioruukki piloting infrastructure are part of the additional chapter of the REPowerEU investment and reform programme for sustainable growth in Finland prepared by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of the Environment and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, for which Finland has reserved EUR 127 million in total. From the RePowerEU funding allocated to research institutes, a total of EUR 22.8 million has been allocated to VTT's research openings. The Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment acts as the ministry responsible for the project towards the European Commission.

The company ""Latvijas Vēja parks"" (Latvian Wind Park, LVP) was set up at the time. The first parks could be operational in 2028, Latvian Television reported on May 26.

One of the company's first wind farms to be operational will be located in Limbaži. All the necessary consultations and studies are currently underway and, in theory, construction work should start in about two years' time, so that the first wind turbines will be generating electricity in 2028.

The planned park and others will be located in forests. The generators will be high up in the air to ensure that the wind reaches the turbines. They will be about 300 meters high.

""We are building wind farms inside Latvia. And we have to take into account that a certain wind speed and strength has to be achieved for the turbine to be operational and economically viable,"" explains Jānis Urtāns, Chairman of the Board of Latvian Wind Park.

The total number of turbines could reach around 120. The planned turbines will not only be incomparably taller than those currently installed in Latvia, but also much more powerful. The company originally planned to build a total of eight different wind farms. One, in the eastern part of the country, is unlikely to go ahead because the Ministry of Defence has banned the construction of wind farms in certain areas of the country due to security concerns. Public consultations with local authorities are ongoing.

""There are questions about how it is, how it will be in the future, whether it is really necessary to be so close or further away. These are questions from the residents whose buildings it will be near,"" said Dagnis Straubergs (LRA), chairman of the Limbaži municipal council.

The municipality recognizes that the planned compensation of local residents for wind farms could help with this issue. However, not everyone will be enthusiastic about the projects - those who object now will most likely continue to do so even after the announcement of such compensation, predicts the chairman of the Ventspils municipal council. The ministry responsible for energy notes that the plan to build wind farms in the forest is positive. If there is land, why not use it?

""In fact, in all countries where the proportion of forests is large enough to allow wind power plants, options are also being considered for locating wind power plants in forests. This includes Finland and Sweden, for example, where the proportion of forests is already over 60%. One of the better-known examples is in Germany, where statistics show that more than 9% of all wind farms are now located in forest areas,"" explained Līga Rozentāle, Deputy State Secretary for Energy Policy at the Ministry of Climate and Energy.

LVP notes that large forest areas will not need to be cleared for the construction of the parks. In some cases, roads will have to be widened to bring the giant turbines into the forest, but in this case the existing infrastructure of Latvian State Forests will help. Also, each turbine will need about one hectare of land, where trees will most likely have to be cut down.",balticword.com,news,The Baltic Word,,0.1372549019607843,454502906,1,https://balticword.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/wind-park.jpg,

""Everything is going according to the schedule and there are no signs of any problems or delays,"" said the minister.

However, when asked if Latvia expects any possible provocations from Russia, including the possibility of Baltic States being disconnected from BRELL sooner than 2025, Melnis said this possibility is considered as well. ""This is reality. We fully expect such a thing to happen,"" said the minister. He also mentioned that Baltic States are prepared for this scenario.

""We are prepared, but we hope it won't come to it,"" said the minister, adding that if Russia does go through with this, there would be some inconveniences. Nevertheless, there would still be electricity.

Chairman of Augstsprieguma tīkls JSC (AST) Rolands Irklis previously told LETA that the Baltic power grid is basically prepared to exit from Russia's controlled BRELL network at any moment.

He said he considers Russia's possible provocations in regard to the disconnection from BRELL network before February 2025 as realistic. ""We are aware there could be something unexpected from our neighbouring countries. There could be emergency de-synchronisations from BRELL, which could force us to speed up our synchronisation with the EU grid. We are aware such a possibility exists, and we are prepared for it,"" said Irklis.

AST board chairman said that in the event of an emergency de-synchronisation, it will be necessary to put infrastructure available in the EU to use and balance out the grid.

As for availability of electricity in the event Russia disconnects Latvia from BRELL unexpectedly, Irklis said power generation output is sufficient, especially in Latvia, which has both hydroelectric dams and thermal power plants. On top of that, Baltic States have connection with Finland, Sweden and Poland. ""So from the perspective of power output, we are covered. What we need to do is use all available infrastructure to balance out the grid and ensure network stability,"" said Irklis.

At the same time, he said the situation could impact electricity costs, not security of supplies.

The EU aims to reduce its dependency on Russian fossil fuels and accelerate the transition to clean energy. To take concrete actions, the EU has launched the REPowerEU plan, which is part of the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF). VTT has just launched three strategic research openings and a postdoc programme as part of the implementation of the REPowerEU chapter of Finland's Recovery and Resilience Plan.

One of the objectives of Finland is to support research and development activities focusing on clean energy solutions. VTT's first research opening focuses on electricity storage and accelerating clean energy production, the second on improving industrial energy efficiency and the third on renewable hydrogen economy solutions. VTT has been granted EUR 22.8 million to develop clean energy solutions.

""The research projects of EUR 17.8 million just launched will not only aim at significant reductions of emissions and improvements in energy efficiency, but also create opportunities for new types of business and business models. The aim is to develop solutions for both domestic use and export,"" says Jussi Manninen, Executive Vice President of VTT's Carbon Neutral Solutions business area.

Increasing in production of clean energy goes hand in hand with a fundamental change in heavy industry. Improvements are required in both energy and material efficiency and decarbonisation of processes as such. This is why the research themes are cross-cutting and cover value chains.

""For example, carbon capture and industrial reuse are linked to the hydrogen economy, which in turn is linked to energy storages. The production of raw materials for renewable plastics or fuels requires hydrogen with carbon. Hydrogen, on the other hand, can be produced by electricity when there's an excess of renewable energy production,"" says Tua Huomo, Executive Vice President of VTT's Sustainable Products and Services business area.

Postdoc programme recruits top experts in energy sector

VTT has already carried out pioneering research and development to promote renewable energy solutions. The aim is now to increase expertise and develop solutions to address bottlenecks related to the green transition, such as the adequacy of electricity storage capacity, availability of critical materials and safety challenges in the use of hydrogen. This requires new expertise, which is why the research openings include an extensive postdoc programme. The programme is used to hire top experts from both Finland and abroad, and EUR 3.4 million has been reserved for this purpose.

""With REPowerEU funding, we deepen our cutting-edge energy research and develop solutions that accelerate the commercial adoption of key clean energy technologies in Finland. The postdoc programme also helps us to attract top foreign researchers to Finland,"" Jussi Manninen says.

VTT invests in clean energy pilot infrastructure and builds process development facilities in Bioruukki as well as research and product development services. The EUR 5 million granted from the REPowerEU envelope to extend the pilot infrastructure is part of VTT's total investment (EUR 21.3 million) in Bioruukki. The REPowerEU funding covers part of the hydrogen and emission-free transport infrastructure and research equipment. The clean energy testing and piloting infrastructure will be used for research and development projects important to industry, such as hydrogen technologies, reducing industrial carbon footprint, transport and energy storage.

The three strategic research openings launched: Electricity storage and accelerating clean energy, industrial energy efficiency and low-carbonisation, as well as renewable hydrogen economy, the postdoc programme and the development of the Bioruukki piloting infrastructure are part of the additional chapter of the REPowerEU investment and reform programme for sustainable growth in Finland prepared by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of the Environment and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, for which Finland has reserved EUR 127 million in total. From the RePowerEU funding allocated to research institutes, a total of EUR 22.8 million has been allocated to VTT's research openings. The Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment acts as the ministry responsible for the project towards the European Commission.

(The Conversation) - As wars grind on in Ukraine and Gaza, another location ravaged by conflict is taking steps to implement a historic peace agreement. From the mid-1960s through 2016, Colombia was torn by conflict between the government, leftist guerrilla movements and right-wing paramilitary groups. Now the government and rebels are working to carry out a sweeping accord that addresses many critical sectors, including environmental damages and restoration.

University of Notre Dame researchers Richard Marcantonio and Josefina Echavarria Alvarez study peace and conflict issues, including their effects on the environment. They currently are advising negotiations between the Colombian government and several rebel factions over wartime damage to soil, water and other natural resources. They explain that while Colombia's transition from war to peace has been difficult, the accord offers a model for addressing the ravages of war in places such as Gaza and Ukraine.

Few agreements include environmental provisions, and even fewer see them carried out, even though research shows that many drivers of conflict can be directly or indirectly related to the environment.

We work with a research program at the University of Notre Dame called the Peace Accords Matrix, which monitors the implementation of comprehensive peace accords in 34 countries worldwide. Only 10 of the accords have natural resource management provisions agreements, and these typically have not triggered major steps to protect the environment.

Colombia's is seen as the most comprehensive peace accord that has been signed to date. It considers issues ranging from security to social justice and political participation, in great detail.

The accord acknowledges that a peaceful postwar society requires not only respect for human rights but also ""protection of the environment, respect for nature and its renewable and nonrenewable resources and biodiversity."" More than 20% of the commitments in the agreement have an environmental connection.

- Protecting environmental health through measures such as access to clean water

- Process issues, such as ensuring that communities can participate in decisions about rural programs and resource management

There also are gaps. For example, many protected areas have been deforested for ranching and coca production in the postaccord period. And there are no provisions addressing toxic pollution, an issue other agreements also neglect.

Often there are power vacuums during transitions between war and peace, when government agencies are working to reestablish their operations. Natural resources and environmental health need protection during these phases.

In Sierra Leone, for example, resource extraction by foreign companies drastically ramped up immediately after the Lome Peace Agreement eventually ended that nation's civil war in 2002. Companies exploited a lack of governance and support in the rural areas and often mined metals illegally or hazardously without any regulatory oversight. Today these areas still struggle with mining impacts, including contaminated drinking water and fish, the primary protein source in the area.

European Commission: ""Ukraine green recovery Conference""

The damage is vast: There's air, water and soil contamination, deforestation and enormous quantities of waste, including ruined buildings, burned-out cars and thousands of tons of destroyed military equipment. Russia's destruction of the Kakhovka Dam flooded villages, destroyed crops and wrecked irrigation systems.

The cost estimates are staggering. A joint commission of the World Bank, the government of Ukraine and other institutions currently estimate direct damages at roughly US$152 billion.

In addition, cleaning up sites, rebuilding infrastructure and other repairs could cost more than $486 billion over the next decade, as of late 2023. That figure rises every day that the war continues.

There's broad interest in a green and sustainable reconstruction that would include steps like using sustainable building materials and powering the electricity grid with renewable energy. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been adamant that Russia must pay for the damage it has caused. It's still unclear how this would work, although some U.S. and European lawmakers support seizing frozen Russian assets held in Western banks to help cover the cost.

There is a legal basis for holding Russia accountable. In 2022, the U.N. General Assembly adopted a set of principles for protecting the environment during armed conflicts. Among other existing statutes, they draw on a protocol to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 that prohibits using ""methods or means of warfare which are intended, or may be expected, to cause widespread, long-term and severe damage to the natural environment.""

There has been only modest discussion so far of how to integrate these principles into a formal peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia. But a working group that included Ukrainian and European Union officials and former leaders from Sweden, Finland, Ireland and Brazil has recommended a framework for addressing environmental damage and holding perpetrators accountable.

Environmental damage in Gaza also is devastating. The U.N. estimated in early 2024 that over 100,000 cubic meters (26 million gallons) of untreated sewage and wastewater were flowing daily onto land or into the Mediterranean Sea.

Gaza's drinking water system was insufficient before the war and has been further weakened by military strikes. On average, Gazans now have access to about 3 liters of water per person per day - less than 1 gallon.

Thousands of buildings have been destroyed, spreading hazardous materials such as asbestos. Every bomb that's dropped disperses toxic materials that will persist in the soil unless it's remediated. Simultaneous environmental and infrastructure impacts, such as water and power shortages, are contributing to larger crises, such as the collapse of Gaza's health care system, that will have long-lasting human costs.

Integrating the environment into peace accords isn't easy. Resources such as energy, clean soil and water are vital for life, which is precisely why military forces may seek to control or destroy them. This is happening in both Ukraine and Gaza.

Peace negotiators tend to focus on social, political and economic issues, rather than environmental reparations. But leaving environmental damage unresolved until after a peace accord is signed keeps people who have been displaced and marginalized by conflict in precarious positions.

It may even cause fighting to resume. According to the U.N. Environment Program, at least 40% of all wars within states in the past 60 years have had a link to natural resources. In those cases, fighting was twice as likely to resume within five years after conflict ended.

We see some lessons for future negotiations.

First, it's important for accords to recognize environmental harm as one of war's main consequences and to acknowledge that a healthy environment is essential for sustainable livelihoods and peace.

Second, connecting environmental provisions with other issues, such as rural reform and political participation, can create better, more sustainable and equal conditions for reestablishing democracy. The Colombia accords are an example.

Third, it is important to clearly define goals, such as what infrastructure and institutions need to be rebuilt, who is in charge of getting those tasks done, and the timetable for doing it. This can help ensure that environmental restoration doesn't become a secondary goal.

Fourth, the international community has an important role to play in monitoring and verifying environmental restoration and providing financial and technical support. Foreign donors have already pledged $66 billion for rebuilding Ukraine and have said that they will require grantees to follow strict environmental standards in order to receive financing.

Reconstructing nations and simultaneously regenerating communities and ecosystems after wars is a daunting mission, but it's also an opportunity to build something better. We see Ukraine and Gaza as potential test cases for addressing war's toll on the environment and creating a more sustainable future.",juancole.com,news,Informed Comment,,-0.1137254901960785,454478747,1,https://media.juancole.com/images/2024/05/gaza-and-ukraine-wars-causing-ma-750x422.jpg,

The head of the American Hellenic Educational Progressive Association, Leo J. Lamberson, is in the center, with Senator Bob Wilson at the left. [MARIA HECKINGER ARCHIVE]

Dear Greece,

You are the land of my birth. Of my mother's birth, and of all the mothers that came before her.

She was unmarried when she became pregnant with me. She was from a small village in the Peloponnese and was therefore unable to keep me. She left, never to return.

I was born in December 1962 in Athens, and adopted from Mitera sometime in 1963/64. My adoptive mother was Greek but had lost her citizenship with her marriage to my adoptive father, a British citizen.

They adopted my brother Alex at the same time.

Both of us have applied to have our citizenship reinstated through our birth mothers who were Greek nationals when they gave birth to us.

My journey away from you was quick. My journey home has taken four years already and I've yet to clear the first hurdle. I submitted my application to the Greek Consulate in London in 2020. I am still waiting for an acknowledgment, for a case number.

Greece. These are my earliest memories of you.

Our house in London, full of exiles. Theodorakis, his musicians, Mercouri and countless others made stateless during the turbulent years of the junta.

I remember also all the long hot summers spent at our beach house near Halkida, where my mother, her sister and two brothers built small houses to accommodate our large extended family. All us children running between them, playing, watching wide-eyed when my uncle brought large blocks of ice wrapped in hessian sacks from the village, then chopped it into chunks and placed in the four iceboxes.

I remember too our small hands carefully carrying the empty ""stamnes"" to be filled from the well - pumped only after 5 p.m., when our sleepy community resurfaced after a seemingly never-ending ""mesimeri.""

We had no electricity back then.

At night we would sing and dance or play cards by the orange light of the oil lamps. Then to sleep in our own beds or top-to-toe if the houses were full of visiting relatives (more often than not); to be woken the following morning by a donkey braying in a far-off field, to sit drinking our milk in the cool shade of the trees, watching as Yiayia started cooking dinner, scooping out the flesh of vegetables into a large bowl, then grating onion, adding herbs, rice and mixing together with the oil harvested from the trees under which we sat.

It is there I learned what family means. What you, Greece means.

It was the summers spent diving for shells and competing to see who could go deepest, burned nut-brown by the sun that sustained, scorched and bonded us forever.

My adopted mother died when I was 14. My adopted father signed over the house to me and my brother and chose a different path, a new wife, a new life. But for us, there was only this life, this family, OUR family and it remains so to this day.

Growing up with two cultures has its challenges. Nowadays they call children like us ""third culture kids."" But then there was no word for it.

In England, we never completely fitted in. We were branded ""Greek"" at the pleasure of whoever, whenever they wanted.

""Don't let her write about Turkey."" I overheard the editor say to no one in particular in my first newsroom job at the beginning of my journalism career. ""She's Greek!""

Meant to defame I suppose, but in truth it made me love you more.

For it was as a journalist that I really got to know you outside of Athens and the community of my summer home.

Over my career I've sat with Greek officials in Phuket City Hall in Thailand, as they tirelessly waited for the handful of Greeks then unaccounted for in the days following the Boxing Day Tsunami.

I have spent weeks outside your parliament, talking to those who'd made their home in Syntagma Square, as successive governments held emergency talks late into the night on the economic crisis and what should be done.

More recently I watched as my fellow countrymen offered water, food, blankets, with an extended hand of friendship on the beach at Skala Sikamias in Lesvos, where 800,000 fleeing war arrived in rubber dinghies.

I have walked with refugees as they made their way through Idomeni, the Balkans, Hungary, Austria and Germany all the way up to northern Finland. I always asked about their journey to reach safety, how it had been, the welcome they received, or lack thereof.

""Yunan, Greece good,"" each would say with a smile and give me a thumbs-up. It filled me with pride.

Greece. Each year as spring turns towards summer my heart is pulled towards you, my homeland. Flights are booked. Friendships dusted off. ""When will you get there?"" we ask each other from across the globe, for we are part of the diaspora that each year comes home to recharge, to take stock and by doing so, live our best lives.

Dear Greece. I have always been told I'm Greek. So do you know what it's like not to be accepted by you?

It's like standing outside of a room, the door locked. I can hear voices inside. They're the voices of my country, talking in my mother tongue. I bang on the door to be let in. Inside they can hear me, but they don't open. I get angry, frustrated and bang louder.

Still nothing, just silence, as if I'm being punished for an unintended sin. So I stop banging and slump to the ground overwhelmed with grief, weeping, deflated, rejected yet again.

For yes, for those of us who are adopted, it's another rejection.

Rejected by our birth mothers, now rejected by the country which gave birth to us.

Dear Greece, agapimeni mou Ellada, I ask that you please, please recognize me as one of your own.

Livestock farming is one of the main culprits in greenhouse gas emissions, the primary cause of global warming.

Cellular agriculture, where food or nutrients are grown from cell cultures, is increasingly seen as a green alternative to animal agriculture.

Lab-grown meat, eggs and milk have made headlines in recent years, with scientists using animal cell cultures -- a process some have criticised as unnatural, highly processed, energy-consuming and costly.

But at Solar Foods' recently opened factory outside Helsinki, scientists are using new technology to grow protein out of cells using air and electricity.

By feeding a microbe with carbon dioxide, hydrogen and some minerals, and powering the process with electricity from renewable sources, the company has managed to create a protein-rich powder that can be used as a milk and egg substitute.

""We can source our main feedstock for the microbe from the air,"" Solar Foods chief executive Pasi Vainikka told AFP, as he gave a tour of the company's new facilities near Helsinki.

""We have started the production of the world's most sustainable protein.""

Founded by Vainikka and Juha-Pekka Pitkanen in 2017, Solar Foods launched the ""world's first factory growing food out of thin air"" in April.

""Much of the animal-like protein of today can actually be produced through cellular agriculture and we can let agricultural land re-wild and thereby build carbon stock,"" Vainikka said, referring to the process whereby forests and soil absorb and store carbon.

One kilo of the new protein, dubbed ""solein"", emits 130 times less greenhouse gases than the same amount of protein produced by beef production in the European Union, a 2021 scientific study claimed.

Vainikka navigates his way through the factory's laboratory and into the control room, where a dozen people at computer screens monitor the production process.

Transforming food production and consumption is at the heart of combating the climate crisis and preventing biodiversity loss, according to Emilia Nordlund, head of industrial biotechnology and food research at the VTT Technical Research Centre.

Yet current projections show the consumption of meat is expected to increase in coming years.

""Industrial food production, especially livestock production, is one of the biggest causes of greenhouse gas emissions (and) the biggest cause of biodiversity loss, eutrophication and freshwater usage,"" she said.

New food production technologies can help cut emissions and ""decentralise and diversify food production"", Nordlund said.

""However, at the same time, we must improve the existing food production methods to make them more sustainable and resilient,"" she added.

Fermentation technology used to produce different nutrients, such as proteins, has been around for decades.

But the field has expanded significantly in recent years with new technological solutions and research projects emerging worldwide.

- Slow progress -

Some of the most active start-up hubs focusing on cellular agriculture are in the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands and Israel, Nordlund said.

""We are in a crucial phase as we will see which start-ups will survive,"" she said, adding that stalling bureaucracy was slowing cellular agriculture's take-off in the EU.

Dressed in protective gear to prevent bacteria contamination in the factory, Vainikka showed off a giant steel tank in a shiny production hall.

""This is a fermenter holding 20,000 litres,"" he said, explaining that the microbe multiplies inside the tank as it gets fed the greenhouse gas.

Liquid containing the microbes is continuously extracted from the tank to be processed into the yellowish protein-rich powder with a flavour described as ""nutty"" and ""creamy"".

""The fermenter produces the same amount of protein per day as 300 milking cows or 50,000 laying hens,"" Vainikka said.

That equals ""five million meals' worth of protein per year"".

For now, the main purpose of the small Finnish plant employing around 40 people is to ""prove that the technology scales"", so it can attract the necessary investments pending European regulatory approval.

While the protein has been cleared for sale in Singapore where some restaurants have used it to make ice cream, it is still awaiting classification as a food product in the EU and the United States.

To have any real impact, the aim is to ""build an industrial plant 100 times the size of this one"", Vainikka said. -- AFP",omanobserver.om,news,Oman Observer,,0.01960784313725483,454436045,9,https://www.omanobserver.om/omanobserver/uploads/images/2024/05/26/thumbs/600x600/2673210.jpg,

Another remarkable achievement is the use of oil in transformers. While transformers typically use mineral oil, CHINT's continuous development efforts have led to the adoption of vegetable oil, a renewable and degradable alternative.

Since 2006, CHINT has ventured into the photovoltaic new energy field, quickly establishing international competitiveness in the development, design, investment, construction, operation and maintenance of photovoltaic power plants.

To date, CHINT has constructed photovoltaic power plants with a combined capacity of more than 30 GW around the world, which can provide more than 34 billion kWh of green electricity and reduce carbon dioxide emissions by more than 30 million tonnes every year.

Notably, CHINT's rooftop photovoltaic power station project has benefited over 1.3 million households in China, bringing an extra income of 1,000 to 3,000 yuan (about 422 U.S. dollars) for a family every year, while creating over 200,000 jobs in rural areas.

Innovation has always been a cornerstone in the growth of CHINT Group's electric company, according to Chen.

The company ""Latvijas Vēja parks"" (Latvian Wind Park, LVP) was set up at the time. The first parks could be operational in 2028, Latvian Television reported on May 26.

One of the company's first wind farms to be operational will be located in Limbaži. All the necessary consultations and studies are currently underway and, in theory, construction work should start in about two years' time, so that the first wind turbines will be generating electricity in 2028.

The planned park and others will be located in forests. The generators will be high up in the air to ensure that the wind reaches the turbines. They will be about 300 meters high.

""We are building wind farms inside Latvia. And we have to take into account that a certain wind speed and strength has to be achieved for the turbine to be operational and economically viable,"" explains Jānis Urtāns, Chairman of the Board of Latvian Wind Park.

The total number of turbines could reach around 120. The planned turbines will not only be incomparably taller than those currently installed in Latvia, but also much more powerful. The company originally planned to build a total of eight different wind farms. One, in the eastern part of the country, is unlikely to go ahead because the Ministry of Defence has banned the construction of wind farms in certain areas of the country due to security concerns. Public consultations with local authorities are ongoing.

""There are questions about how it is, how it will be in the future, whether it is really necessary to be so close or further away. These are questions from the residents whose buildings it will be near,"" said Dagnis Straubergs (LRA), chairman of the Limbaži municipal council.

The municipality recognizes that the planned compensation of local residents for wind farms could help with this issue. However, not everyone will be enthusiastic about the projects - those who object now will most likely continue to do so even after the announcement of such compensation, predicts the chairman of the Ventspils municipal council. The ministry responsible for energy notes that the plan to build wind farms in the forest is positive. If there is land, why not use it?

""In fact, in all countries where the proportion of forests is large enough to allow wind power plants, options are also being considered for locating wind power plants in forests. This includes Finland and Sweden, for example, where the proportion of forests is already over 60%. One of the better-known examples is in Germany, where statistics show that more than 9% of all wind farms are now located in forest areas,"" explained Līga Rozentāle, Deputy State Secretary for Energy Policy at the Ministry of Climate and Energy.

LVP notes that large forest areas will not need to be cleared for the construction of the parks. In some cases, roads will have to be widened to bring the giant turbines into the forest, but in this case the existing infrastructure of Latvian State Forests will help. Also, each turbine will need about one hectare of land, where trees will most likely have to be cut down.",eng.lsm.lv,news,eng.lsm.lv,,0.1372549019607843,454395750,1,https://static.lsm.lv/media/2021/07/large/1/ftcq.jpg,eng-9591248

Notably, the exports of wooden products is expected to bring home over 4 billion USD, up 7.5% compared to the same period last year.

To Xuan Phuc, Managing Director of Forest Trends' Forest Policy, Trade, and Finance Initiative, said that Vietnam's timber industry will gradually recover in 2024 as demand for the products is increasing.

According to Do Xuan Lap, Chairman of the Vietnam Timber and Forest Products Association, said that Vietnam is among the top timber exporters in the world. Vietnamese timber reaches 170 countries and territories worldwide, making deeper inroads in key markets like the US, Europe, the Republic of Korea and Japan, and marking greater presence in emerging markets like Middle-East and India.

Lap said that Vietnam has affirmed its position in the global timber market thanks to its advantages in forestry development, support policies, and accession to free trade agreements.

Moreover, Vietnamese companies are investing in new technology and digital transformation to develop new products and services and increase competitiveness, efficiency and productivity.

However, Vietnam's timber industry is also facing many difficulties , especially when major importers have been imposing stricter requirements on origin, green production, reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, and the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) - a carbon tariff on carbon-intensive products imported to the European Union (EU).

Last year, the EU adopted a regulation to curb the market's impact on global deforestation and forest degradation around the world, as well as protecting the rights of indigenous people. The EU Deforestation Regulation (""EUDR"") mandates extensive due diligence on the value chain for all operators and traders dealing with certain products derived from cattle, cocoa, coffee, oil palm, rubber, soya and wood.

According to this regulation, businesses exporting rubber wood furniture to Europe have 18 months for large companies or 24 months for small and medium companies to prepare to meet the requirements of the EUDR.

Lap added that the internal capacity of Vietnamese businesses is also a limitation as most of them mainly produce following orders and designs of foreign distributors.

Production and export have grown continuously for years but still rely on cheap labour and raw materials, and the added value of products is not high.

He noted that most businesses are small in scale and do not have enough capacity to build brands. Small businesses can be weak in responding to sudden and continuous fluctuations in the market. Vietnamese products are rarely distributed directly to customers but via foreign distribution channels and foreign businesses, Lap added.

Nguyen Liem, Chairman of the Binh Duong Furniture Association, said that exports of Vietnamese timber and wooden products to the US increased in the first months of this year, pushing the industry's growth.

US importers highly value and consider Vietnam an important timber and wood product supplier in the world, Liem said, adding that if businesses can make use of this advantage, they can create breakthroughs.

However, focusing too much on a key market is also a weakness, Lien said, emphasising that Vietnamese timber producers need to diversify markets and increase exports to other potential markets./.\

Businesses seek sci-tech rule changes

Businesses and scientific researchers are seeking amendments to tech transfer and financial mechanisms through Vietnam's sci-tech law.

The Ministry of Science and Technology (MoST) is working on amendments to the 2013 Law on Science and Technology (LoST) towards creating further refinements for businesses and intellectuals.

""The ministry will drastically amend the law with many new points, transforming it into an effective tool and important legal corridor to strongly promote science, technology, and innovation, with technology transfer and financial mechanisms being among the amendments,"" said Nguyen Hoang Giang, Deputy Minister of Science and Technology.

The MoST's plan is reinforced by the government's determination to create a more enabling environment for the sci-tech sector. At a meeting to celebrate Vietnam Science and Technology Day on May 16, Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh proclaimed that sci-tech and innovation are a fundamental element of both digital and green transformation.

""Science, technology, and innovation are the shortest path to achieving our goals. Therefore, we need to prioritise resources in institutions, mechanisms, policies, infrastructure, and people,"" he noted. ""Lessons from successful cases around the world, especially in South Korea, Japan, China, the United States, Germany, and Finland prove the great role of sci-tech in the development and advancement of nations.""

He requested relevant authorities to further promote the role of science and technology and innovation in all fields, considering this an important political task of all levels. They must focus on key tasks and solutions, such as building policies for inclusive development, investing in infrastructure, improving the quality of human resources, and increasing attraction and diversification.

Also of note to carry out includes strengthening the model of public-private partnerships, and having appropriate policies to lure reputable Vietnamese and international scientists to contribute to domestic sci-tech development.

At the meeting, Pham Van Tai, general director of business corporation THACO, said, ""The business community looks forward to support from the MoST to create new advantages for businesses to participate in research, development, and application of sci-tech and innovation.""

It is regarded that the sci-tech industry is still facing many issues in terms of legal problems, human resources, limited state funding, and a big sci-tech gap with developed countries. The business community is waiting for improvements not only in the LoST, but also the Law on Capital City for Hanoi.

As shown in MoST statistics, investment in sci-tech has been decreasing compared to the level stated in the LoST. While investment must be no less than 2 per cent of the total annual state budget expenditure, in 2023 the state funding for sci-tech was only 0.82 per cent.

Nguyen Quan, chairman of the Vietnam Automation Association, which represents the voice of more than 1,000 member businesses, said that a major problem involves technology transfer, especially transferring research results to businesses.

""As shown in existing rules, when a research project is funded by the state budget, the result is owned by the state. Moreover, if research results are transferred, it is necessary to evaluate the product as intellectual property - a type of intangible asset,"" Quan said.

""But currently, there is no competent agency assigned to evaluate assets and almost no-one dares to value them for transfer to businesses,"" Quan continued.

He added that research projects also encounter difficulties in disbursement, payments, invoices, contracts, and bidding for equipment and materials procurement. Although financial management under the fund mechanism has been regulated in the sci-tech law, it has not yet been accepted for application to the relevant task management system.

""Along with amending the LoST, it is necessary to pay attention to amending laws on the state budget, corporate income tax, and on public employees to have a consistent legal system,"" Quan added. ""In addition, other laws such as on public procurement, public investment, use of public assets, and tech transfer must also be amended to remove obstacles in research activities, application, and commercialisation.""

SBV announces plan to inspect gold trading entities

The State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) has announced a plan to conduct inspections of gold trading operations at two commercial banks and four businesses.

The entities subject to inspection include TPBank, Eximbank, Saigon Jewelry Company (SJC), Doji Precious Metals, Phu Nhuan Jewelry JSC (PNJ), and Bao Tin Minh Chau, according to an SBV official at the Compliance Announcement Conference on Business Gold Practices held in Hanoi on May 22.

The inspection, which will feature representatives from the Government Inspectorate, Ministry of Public Security, Ministry of Finance, and Ministry of Industry and Trade, is set to last 45 days.

The inspection team will focus on compliance with legal regulations regarding gold business operations, anti-money laundering practices, accounting policies, preparation and use of invoices and receipts, and tax reporting and performance of tax obligations, based on the regulations of the Inspection Law and related statutes.

The audit period covers activities from January 1, 2020, to May 15, 2024, and could be extended if necessary.

Deputy Governor of the SBV Pham Quang Dung said that during the inspection, additional subjects and contents could be added if deemed necessary. The SBV plans to enhance state oversight of gold business activities and impose strict sanctions on legal violations in gold trading.

The SBV will also continue to take measures to increase the supply of SJC gold bars and narrow the price gap between domestic and international gold prices, Dung added.

Dragon Capital becomes major shareholder of Nam Long Group

Fund management firm Dragon Capital has raised its stake in Nam Long Group, whose NLG shares are traded on the Hochiminh Stock Exchange, to 5.18% and become one of the real estate developer's major shareholders.

Amersham Industries Limited, a member of Dragon Capital, purchased 1.8 million NLG shares on May 16 while Samsung Vietnam Securities Master Investment Trust, another member of the fund management firm, acquired 0.17 million NLG shares.

The deals raised Dragon Capital's ownership in Nam Long Group from 4.67% to 5.18%.

In related news, Nguyen Xuan Quang, chairman of Nam Long Group, registered to sell two million NLG shares, reducing his ownership from 11.03% to 10.51% of Nam Long's charter capital. The transaction is expected to be conducted from May 22 to June 20.

Regarding business activities, Nam Long recorded revenue of VND204.6 billion in the first quarter of 2024, down by 13% year-on-year. The real estate developer incurred a loss of VND65 billion.

Closing the trading session today, NLG rose by 1.77% day-on-day to VND45,900 per share, with more than 3.2 million shares transacted.

With 278 winners and 152 losers, the VN-Index of the Hochiminh Stock Exchange shot up by 14.12 points, or 1.11%, against yesterday's session, at 1,281.03 points.

More than 968.1 million shares worth VND23.3 trillion were traded on the southern bourse, falling by 14% in volume and 19% in value compared to the previous session. Block deal transactions contributed VND2.4 trillion to the overall value, with 134.4 million shares changing hands.

Domestic coffee prices rising again

After short-run price stability, the price of coffee in localities of Vietnam increased again to nearly VND5,000 per kg on May 22.

Specifically, traders in the Central Highlands province of Dak Nong are paying VND110,400 per kg (US$4.32). In the meantime, the product is being sold at VND109,000 a kg in Lam Dong Province. In Dak Lak and Gia Lai provinces, the purchasing price has increased to VND109,800 a kg and VND110,000 a kg respectively.

Local traders disclosed that coffee prices normally decrease from May to August because Brazil and some other countries are in the harvest season and the supply is abundant.

However, the sudden increase in coffee prices in the local market and the huge demand of trading volume shows that concerns about supply shortages along with geopolitical and economic uncertainties are still weighing heavily on buyers.

The coffee market is forecast to continue to increase in the near future and Robusta coffee prices will soon return to US$4,000 a ton. Experts predict that by 2024, Vietnam's coffee exports could reach $5 billion because many factors are attributable to the achievement including a high increase in prices.

The world's rising demand of some green coffee products for making instant coffee is also pushing up domestic demand.

Green Business Title 2024 program launched in HCMC

The Green Business Title is an annual program organized by the People's Committee of Ho Chi Minh City in collaboration with Sai Gon Giai Phong (SGGP) Newspaper and the Ho Chi Minh City Union of Business Association.

Launched in 2023, the Ho Chi Minh City Green Business Title recognized 90 businesses for their achievements. Building on this success, the organizers have officially launched the Green Business Title program for 2024.

The program aims to achieve three core objectives. The first is to honor, reward, and encourage businesses that comply with waste management regulations during production and operations and engage in research and production of environmentally friendly products.

The second is to enhance corporate responsibility in environmental protection, aiming for sustainable growth. The third is to support businesses in promoting themselves, increasing competitiveness, and integrating into the global economy.

Agricultural products enjoying good export season

At the Northern bordering gates of Vietnam each day, hundreds of agricultural product trucks have customs clearance, showing a promising time for farmers this year.

The lychee season has just begun, and by May 23, 2024, more than 4,200 tonnes of fresh lychee had been bought by Chinese businesses to transport via Kim Thanh II Border Gate in Lao Cai City. Every day, about 200 vehicles carrying fresh lychee from the provinces of Bac Giang and Hung Yen pass this border gate.

Because both lychee and longan in the North suffer from serious crop failures, the harvested ones are enjoying very lucrative prices and consumption is quite high.

At the two border gates of Tan Thanh and Huu Nghi in Lang Son Province, about 250 - 300 trucks have customs clearance for exported goods, mostly farm produce.

According to Deputy Head Phung Van Ba of the Customs Unit of Huu Nghi Border Gate (under the Customs Department of Lang Son Province), since this April, the quantity of trucks passing the border gates of this province to sell merchandise in China has been quite large, at around 400 vehicles per day on average. They mostly use the border gates of Huu Nghi and Tan Thanh. Around half of them transport agricultural products, and 50 electronic items.

On the opposite side, each day, approximately 600-800 trucks come for importing procedures. Deputy Head Ba said that due to this heavy workload, even at weekends, the staff at the province's border gates are still on duty. Agricultural products passing these gates are mostly durians, dragon fruits, jackfruits, grapefruits, and lychees.

Deputy Head Nong Quang Hung of the Customs Unit of Tan Thanh Border Gate informed that besides common imported produce, since the beginning of 2024, there have been new items like wooden boards, coke, and construction machines.

Particularly, for the first time, tractor-trailers have been imported into Vietnam via Tan Thanh Border Gate. This leads to the estimated import-export turnover for the first 5 months of 2024 reaching $460 million, a rise of 60 percent compared to 2023.

Renewables company's tax dues prevent chairman from travelling abroad

The chairman of major hydroelectricity and renewable energy producer Trung Nam Group has been prohibited from leaving the country until the company pays its tax debts of VNĐ21 billion (US$840,000).

Nguyễn Tâm Thịnh's ban is related to taxes owed by the company's Thuận Nam solar power plant.

The company said the plant is struggling due to slow payments for electricity by state-owned Electricity Vietnam (EVN).

The company recently paid overdue customs duties of over VNĐ27.5 billion in HCM City.

The company has outstanding bonds worth VNĐ24.3 trillion, and subsidiaries too have issued bonds.

But it nevertheless remains a significant player in the energy industry.

Vietnam Airlines resumes Hanoi to Chengdu flights

Starting June 25, the national flag carrier, Vietnam Airlines, will reopen a route for flights from Hà Nội to Chengdu, China.

Four flights per week will depart Hà Nội on Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday and Sunday.

Flights will operate to Chengdu Tianfu International Airport, one of the largest and most modern airports in China.

This route is an important part of Vietnam Airlines' strategy to grow its international flight network, making it easier for tourists to travel between Việt Nam and China. Vietnam Airlines has launched various promotional offers for this route.

Euro investment takes on green hue

European companies increasingly beef up their manufacturing facilities in Vietnam with a focus on green production capacity.

This month, Swedish packaging giant Tetra Pak announced an additional €97 million ($105.3 million) investment to expand its packaging material production in the southern province of Binh Duong, bringing total investment in the site to over $23 million.

Tetra Pak's expansion plans for the Binh Duong facility will include an additional production line, which will be fully operational by the third quarter of 2025. With this expansion, the facility will have the capability to produce new and innovative packaging formats.

Elsewhere, staBOO Thanh Hoa, a joint venture with Swiss company staBOO Holdings AG, in April gained approval from Thanh Hoa People's Committee to build a bamboo processing factory with a total investment of around $125.7 million.

The factory has a designed annual capacity of 225,000 cubic metres of chipboard panels and plywood made from bamboo. It is expected to consume 1,000-2,000 metric tonnes of bamboo per day and create more than 3,000 jobs.

European investments such as these are geared towards sustainable development and green production. In particular, Tetra Pak will implement the upcoming changes for the Binh Duong facility in accordance with its dedication to environmental responsibility and corporate stewardship, ensuring sustainability standards are upheld throughout the process.

Another Danish company, Lego Group, is investing more than $1 billion in building its first carbon-neutral plant in Binh Duong province. The toymaker company plans to operate its carbon-neutral factory in the second half of this year.

Likewise, staBOO's bamboo processing factory will produce green patented products used in construction and furniture, providing efficient carbon emissions reduction solutions to the global market.

Dominik Meichle, chairman of European Chamber of Commerce in Vietnam (EuroCham), told VIR that the trend of green manufacturing led by European companies is poised to have a ripple effect across Vietnam's industrial landscape.

""As European firms collaborate with local suppliers, valuable knowledge about eco-friendly production processes is shared, encouraging Vietnamese businesses to adopt higher sustainability benchmarks. This not only enhances their competitiveness but also makes them more attractive to foreign investors,"" he said.

According to Meichle, when sustainable practices prove to be successful both environmentally and economically, they create positive momentum for the development of regulatory policies. Demonstrating that green manufacturing is advantageous for both environmental health and economic growth encourages policymakers to support and promote these practices among domestic businesses.

""This includes providing incentives, creating supportive frameworks, and fostering collaborations between industry leaders and local enterprises. The alignment of proven sustainable methods with policy support can lead to widespread adoption of greener industrial operations, enhancing the overall competitiveness and attractiveness of Vietnam's industrial sector to foreign investors,"" he added.

Beyond cost considerations, Vietnam's appeal as an investment destination lies in the government's concerted efforts to improve infrastructure and promote a business-friendly environment. While progress is still needed, Vietnam is undoubtedly moving in the right direction, making it an increasingly attractive destination for European manufacturing investments, Meichle added.

The trend of European companies expanding their manufacturing capacity is closely aligned with the findings from EuroCham's Q1 2024 Business Confidence Index report. Accordingly, 71 per cent of European businesses in Vietnam are expressing confidence in the country's long-term future.

Gloomy car market requires u-turn

Vehicle manufacturing and consumption is struggling due to a dreary market, decreasing output, and poor motivation for development.

According to the Vietnam Automobile Manufacturers Association (VAMA), sales for the entire market in April were at just 24,350 for vehicles of all types, down 11 per cent on-month, and up 9 per cent on-year.

In the first four months of 2024, sales of the entire market reached 82,515 units of all types, down 11 per cent on-year, of which, completely knocked down (CKD) cars decreased by 17 per cent, and completely built unit (CBU) cars went down by 3 per cent.

TC Motor revealed that Hyundai car sales in April 2024 hit 4,276 units, almost 300 units lower than in March and April of last year. In the first four months of this year, Hyundai car sales reached 14,420 units, a sharp decrease compared to 19,328 units in the same period last year.

Other car manufacturers also reported decreasing on-year sales in the first four months of 2024. Toyota reduced by 32 per cent, Hyundai by 25 per cent, Kia by 22 per cent, Lexus by 14 per cent, and Mazda by 13 per cent.

""There are many burdens in the economy and business activities, consumers are still cutting down on spending, so the car business is not thriving,"" said Tran Trung Hieu, a showroom owner in Nam Tu Liem district in Hanoi. ""Demand for new cars is poor, while that of used cars is better.""

According to the General Statistics Office, sales of CKD and CBU cars in the first four months of 2024 are estimated at 88,300 and units, respectively.

Thus, the total supply of new cars in the market was estimated at more than 133,000 units, in combination with about 65,000 vehicles in inventory from 2023, so the total supply this year is nearly 200,000 units. Meanwhile, businesses estimate total market consumption in the first four months at nearly 130,000 units of all types. Supply is nearly 70,000 units higher than demand.

Due to excess supply and a lot of inventory, businesses and agents are announcing promotions and reduced prices to clear sales. Numerous car models from luxury to affordable cars have been discounted by thousands or tens of thousands of US dollars. However, sales are still not improving much, and the vehicle market is still in the recession.

Moreover, sales of CKD cars in the first four months were 21,000 units lower than in the same period last year, and 62,700 units less than in the first four months of 2022.

""This also means that domestic car manufacture and assembly is still falling sharply. The auto industry is losing development motivation,"" said Ninh Huu Chan, VAMA general secretary.

Economic difficulties, along with strong competition from imported CBU cars, have caused the backward growth for CKD cars. It is unlikely that the output of CKD cars will surpass the figure of 350,000 units in 2023.

""For the auto industry, maintaining capacity and growing steadily can be impetus for development. As manufacture growth regresses, the driving force for development is no longer there,"" Chan said.

Amid this gloomy market, the prime minister recently assigned the Ministry of Finance to consider and propose extending the tax payment deadline and reducing registration fees for CKD cars.

If approved, these cars will be able to continue receiving a 50 per cent registration fee support in the second half of this year. On three occasions during 2020-2023, CKD cars enjoyed 50 per cent registration fee policy that lasted six months each.

The auto market is expected to become more open. Currently, the import tax on CBU cars from the ASEAN region to Vietnam has been reduced to zero. The import tax on CBU cars from the European Union, the United Kingdom, and Japan will also do so by 2030, and thus domestic manufacture and assembly is gradually losing its advantage.

""Domestically manufactured and assembled vehicles have too few chances to grow in the coming years,"" Chan said. ""If output is maintained at low levels, the country's auto industry cannot overcome its disadvantages or utilise its advantages.""

While people's income is not high, cars with fewer than 10 seats take on many taxes and fees, including import tax, special consumption tax, VAT, and more, so market scale is struggling to grow quickly, Chan added.

""To develop the industry, the most important factor is large output. So stable and long-term support solutions are needed to create competitiveness for domestically manufactured cars,"" Chan said.

Vendors seek global supply chain access

Vietnamese businesses have opportunities to become vendors of global manufacturers as companies increasingly seek to diversify their global supply chains. However, they need to overcome strict requirements to enter the market.

Hanoi Plastics JSC, a member of An Phat Holdings, and its South Korean partner PowerNet Technologies last week signed an MoU marking their strategic comprehensive partnership on electronic equipment assembly.

This event is deemed an important milestone, opening up prospects for cooperation and development for both sides and laying a stepping stone for Hanoi Plastics (HPC) to participate more deeply in the supply chain for leading South Korean businesses in the future.

PowerNet Technologies is currently a tier-1 supplier of Coway, a major brand in South Korea, with decades of experience in manufacturing and developing household appliances, notably air and water purifiers. Thus, this would be an important step for HPC to participate more deeply in the supply chain for Coway, while also ushering in opportunities for the company to become a leading supplier for businesses in South Korea and global electronics groups in the future.

Speaking at the signing ceremony, Pham Do Huy Cuong, CEO of An Phat Holdings and chairman of the Board of Directors of HPC, said, ""The MoU marks a new success for HPC in its efforts to diversify the supply chain, realising the goal for production and business expansion, and product diversification to catch up with increasing market demands. This is also a solid stepping stone for us to engage more deeply in the global value chain, contributing to bringing high quality Vietnamese-made products to global customers.""

According to the Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI), many enterprises from the likes of the US and South Korea have recently arrived in Vietnam to survey its semiconductor ecosystem.

""The potential is available. However, there is still a limited number of local companies capable of supplying products/technologies that meet the immediate demands of South Korean companies,"" said Hong Sun, chairman of Korean Chamber of Commerce in Vietnam, at the Vietnam Business Forum (VBF) in Hanoi in March. ""Additionally, there is insufficient information available about promising local companies. Especially in advanced industries such as semiconductors, electrical/electronics, and IT, the disparity is more pronounced.""

According to a Japan External Trade Organization (JETRO) report delivered at VBF 2024, the local content ratio of Japanese companies in Vietnam has only increased by 10 per cent over the past 10 years, which needs to be further accelerated. As of 2022, only 0.2 per cent of nearly one million domestic businesses joined the supply chain of supporting industries.

The localisation ratio for automobiles is between 5-20 per cent, the electronics sector at 5-10 per cent, and mechanical processing at 15-20 per cent. Meanwhile, the localisation ratio of the high-tech sector is 1-2 per cent only.

According to JETRO, businesses operating in Vietnam depend on imports for more than 60 per cent of production inputs, while supply chains have been disrupted for some time and transportation costs are still high.

Bui Van Thanh, director of New Sun Law Group, told VIR, ""In general, the foreign partners often have extremely strict requirements about product delivery. At the contract, they often require domestic vendors to ensure that goods delivery is not interrupted in any situation, which means that Vietnamese vendors have to prepare a reserve of goods of within six months to a year.""

This requirement in particular is extremely hard for Vietnamese suppliers to get a slot in the partners' supply chain because they have to suffer pressure to produce products with competitive prices and at the same time prepare financial sources to ensure a large number of reserved goods, added Thanh, who is a legal consultant for Taiwanese corporations in Vietnam such as Foxconn, Luxshare, and Pegatron.

The financial potential plays a crucial role when domestic vendors negotiate with foreign partners. However, said Luu Van Dai, director of metallurgy treatment group Metal Heat Vietnam, the problem is that the modest financial resources are one of the biggest disadvantages for domestic suppliers. Metal Heat Vietnam provides heat and surface treatment of metal products for domestic and foreign-invested partners nationwide.

""When foreign investors decide to invest in Vietnam, they will look at five factors: capital, technology, manufacturing progress, products, and the market. Thus, if domestic manufacturers can become vendors of these corporations, it is a precious opportunity to improve their competition capacity,"" Dai said.

In August 2023, the Ministry of Industry and Trade proposed to the government policies to support enterprises operating in supplying parts and materials for garments and textiles, footwear, electronics, automobile production and assembly, and mechanical engineering. Approval of the proposals, which included an interest rate subsidy of 3 per cent, is not yet forthcoming.

Bilateral trade boon felt with United States

A comprehensive strategic partnership has helped expand bilateral trade between the United States and Vietnam, with the former gradually removing technical barriers for the latter's exports.

The General Statistics Office (GSO) reported that in the first four months of 2023, Vietnam's export and import turnover with the US declined 22.1 and 11.9 per cent on-year, respectively - both due to economic difficulties and the US' technical barriers. Total trade hit $32.5 billion.

However, the grey situation has changed to brighter colours in the first four months of this year, when total bilateral trade reached $38.6 billion, including $34.1 billion worth of Vietnam's exports - up 19.1 per cent on-year, and $4.5 billion of US' exports - up 4.6 per cent on-year.

Key Vietnamese exports included high-tech products like consumer electronics and smartphones, along with garments and footwear.

According to the GSO, such a major rebound in trade reflects a rosier landscape, fuelled by the comprehensive strategic partnership forged last September in Hanoi during US President Joe Biden's historic state visit to Vietnam.

""To further sharpen the partnership, both nations need to increase exchanges in visits at all levels, boost political trust - especially respect for the two nations' political regime; and continue to consider expand investment and trade as a big focus, while intensifying bilateral ties in science and technology, and innovation including a semiconductor ecosystem,"" stated Vietnamese Minister of Foreign Affairs Bui Thanh Son.

Adam Sitkoff, executive director of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hanoi (AmCham), told VIR that the US and Vietnam becoming comprehensive strategic partners have and will provide both nations with new trade and investment opportunities.

""Vietnam has become one of America's fastest growing trading partners and we expect this positive trend to continue,"" he said. ""The US is Vietnam's second-largest trading partner, its largest export market, and one of the top drivers of investment here. Vietnam has risen to become a top-10 trading partner of the US and the economic relationship between the two countries is expected to continue its rapid growth.""

Two-way trade between Vietnam and the US soared from $450 million in 1995 to $110.6 billion last year.

One of the reasons behind a rise in bilateral trade, especially Vietnamese exports to the US, is that the US has provided more favourable conditions for Vietnamese products.

For example, after a thorough investigation, the US Department of Commerce (DoC) last November concluded that steel pipe products imported from Vietnam did not evade the anti-dumping and countervailing duties that the US applies to similar goods from Taiwan.

One month earlier, stemming from the US' imposition of anti-dumping duties on South Korean stainless steel round wire products, the DoC also concluded that Vietnam's stainless steel wire did not evade anti-dumping duty in the US.

More than a week ago, it also issued a notice terminating the investigation into the product scope of steel wheels imported from Vietnam. The probe was initiated in August 2023 into the product scope of steel traction wheels imported from the Vietnamese market.

The petitioner, Dexstar Company of the US, had submitted a request to the DoC to launch a scope review investigation on steel wheels completed in Vietnam from components originating in China.

Based on the information and documents collected during the investigation process, the DoC unveiled its intention to end the investigation of the case on March 15 as Vietnamese enterprises did not import any wheel components from China to produce wheels as alleged by the plaintiff.

In 2023, Vietnam exported 1.08 million tonnes of assorted steel products to the US, up 58.8 per cent, earning $852 million, up 1.2 per cent on-year.

Last November, the US Department of the Treasury continued not to list Vietnam as a currency manipulator in its latest semi-annual report on the macroeconomic and foreign exchange policies of major trading partners of the US.

In the joint statement on the elevation of bilateral relations last September, the US appreciated Vietnam's efforts to further modernise and enhance the transparency of its monetary policy and exchange rate management framework, to promote macroeconomic stability and to ensure the safety and soundness of the banking system.

At present, the US is considering the recognition of Vietnam as a market economy. This would align with President Biden's goal to make the Southeast Asian manufacturing hub a 'friend-shoring' destination for the US.

Last September, Vietnam filed an official request that the DoC consider it a market economy, citing the country's economic reforms made in recent years. If the status upgrade is accepted, it will mean an end to high tax (anti-dumping and countervailing duty) on Vietnamese imports in the US. The DoC will complete their review in late July.

""In any case, if Washington DC decides to change Vietnam's non-market economy (NME) status to a market economy label, there will be significant implications for trade relations and broader geopolitical dynamics in the Asia-Pacific region,"" said Asia Briefing, a subsidiary of consultancy firm Dezan Shira & Associates.

The US has considered Vietnam an NME since 2002. Per US law, an NME is defined as any foreign country that the DoC determines does not adhere to market principles regarding cost or prices, leading to the sale of goods within that country failing to reflect their fair value.

At present, according to Asia Briefing, the US assesses the value of a product intended for import from an NME like Vietnam by referencing a third country - a market economy such as Bangladesh. It uses the perceived product value in Bangladesh as a benchmark. Consequently, this benchmark is presumed to represent the production cost for a Vietnamese company, without consideration for the company's actual cost data.

This calculation causes the dumping margin to be pushed up substantially and does not actually reflect the situation of Vietnamese companies.

Luan Nguyen, Cargill Vietnam country president, told VIR, ""Cargill has long advocated for the recognition of Vietnam as a market economy, especially given its implications for key industries like aquaculture. Vietnam's classification as an NME has resulted in significant anti-dumping taxes on species such as pangasius and shrimp, adversely affecting their competitiveness in vital markets like the US,"" Nguyen said.

According to Nguyen, recognition as a market economy would alleviate these burdens, facilitating access to the US market.

""This regulatory shift would not only reduce trade barriers but also strengthen bilateral relations between the US and Vietnam,"" Nguyen said. ""Market economy recognition would stimulate production and services in industries where Vietnam holds export strength, including agricultural products. This, in turn, fosters greater economic collaboration between the nations.""

Nguyen Hoai Nam, deputy general secretary of the Vietnam Association of Seafood Exporters and Producers, also commented that if the US recognises Vietnam as having a market economy, future anti-dumping lawsuits initiated by the US will be subject to market economy rules, meaning that the US will no longer use a third country as a replacement value.

""It is hoped there will be more advantages for Vietnamese exports to the US,"" Nam said.

In 2023, Vietnam's shrimp exports to the US are estimated to hit $682.5 million, down 15.4 per cent on-year, while exports of tuna and tra fish hit $326.6 million and $271 million, down 32.9 and 49.6 per cent on-year, respectively.

In Q1 2024, the US imported nearly 182,800 tonnes of Vietnam's shrimp products worth $1.4 billion.

According to Vietnam's Ministry of Planning and Investment, cumulatively as of April 20, the US was Vietnam's 11th largest foreign investor with total registered capital of over $11.9 billion for over 1,350 valid projects.

""Vietnam is increasing its attractiveness as a destination for American investment as many companies seek to diversify their global supply chains,"" said Sitkoff from AmCham.",vietnamnet.vn,news,VietNamNet News,,0.3176470588235294,454359858,5,https://static-images.vnncdn.net/vps_images_publish/000001/00000Q/2024/5/26/vietnam-business-news-may-252024-1654e4cbd131425a86040041ddead485-186.webp?width=0&s=WhGynYgaHd5L042BDdlMdg,

Key energy and communication infrastructure, undersea electricity and internet cables are located in the area.But what has NATO stymied is the fact that ""Russia is tasked with enforcing an accord that has banned any military presence on its shores for over a century,"" the news site pointed out.Now the Nordic country is a NATO member, warmongering hawks see the archipelago as a huge blind spot, ""giving Moscow an open field should it ever decide to invade.""The Agreement between the-then Soviet Union and Finland on the Åland Islands was signed in 1940 following the end of the Winter War. The Finnish side pledged ""to demilitarise the Åland Islands, not to fortify them, and not to put them at the disposal of the armed forces of foreign states."" A Soviet Consulate was established in Åland's capital, Mariehamn.According to Toveri, the Russian consulate on the Åland Islands needs to be shut down, and Finnish forces must begin training there.The member of parliament for the center-right National Coalition Party added that archipelago is more important to Finland than Gotland Island is to Sweden. As with Gotland, control of Åland is perceived as key to military dominance in Baltic waters.After a recdnt review of the Åland islands' status, the Finnish government saw no need to make any changes. That stance is backed by recent polls among Åland's residents.Bloomberg acknowledged that shredding any international demilitarization agreements would be a time-consuming feat, and is unlikely to happen, ""for now.""Developments around both Gotland and the Åland Islands fit the ongoing ""Russia threat"" narrative NATO has been pushing -- while continuing its eastward expansion.At the Antalya Diplomacy Forum held in Turkey earlier this year, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov took Finland and Sweden to task for abandoning their longstanding neutrality to join NATO.He said that their decision marked the end of ""decades of good neighborliness.""

Livestock farming is one of the main culprits in greenhouse gas emissions, the primary cause of global warming.

Cellular agriculture, where food or nutrients are grown from cell cultures, is increasingly seen as a green alternative to animal agriculture.

Lab-grown meat, eggs and milk have made headlines in recent years, with scientists using animal cell cultures -- a process some have criticised as unnatural, highly processed, energy-consuming and costly.

But at Solar Foods' recently opened factory outside Helsinki, scientists are using new technology to grow protein out of cells using air and electricity.

By feeding a microbe with carbon dioxide, hydrogen and some minerals, and powering the process with electricity from renewable sources, the company has managed to create a protein-rich powder that can be used as a milk and egg substitute.

""We can source our main feedstock for the microbe from the air,"" Solar Foods chief executive Pasi Vainikka told AFP, as he gave a tour of the company's new facilities near Helsinki.

""We have started the production of the world's most sustainable protein.""

Founded by Vainikka and Juha-Pekka Pitkanen in 2017, Solar Foods launched the ""world's first factory growing food out of thin air"" in April.

""Much of the animal-like protein of today can actually be produced through cellular agriculture and we can let agricultural land re-wild and thereby build carbon stock,"" Vainikka said, referring to the process whereby forests and soil absorb and store carbon.

One kilo of the new protein, dubbed ""solein"", emits 130 times less greenhouse gases than the same amount of protein produced by beef production in the European Union, a 2021 scientific study claimed.

Vainikka navigates his way through the factory's laboratory and into the control room, where a dozen people at computer screens monitor the production process.

Transforming food production and consumption is at the heart of combating the climate crisis and preventing biodiversity loss, according to Emilia Nordlund, head of industrial biotechnology and food research at the VTT Technical Research Centre.

Yet current projections show the consumption of meat is expected to increase in coming years.

""Industrial food production, especially livestock production, is one of the biggest causes of greenhouse gas emissions (and) the biggest cause of biodiversity loss, eutrophication and freshwater usage,"" she said.

New food production technologies can help cut emissions and ""decentralise and diversify food production"", Nordlund said.

""However, at the same time, we must improve the existing food production methods to make them more sustainable and resilient,"" she added.

Fermentation technology used to produce different nutrients, such as proteins, has been around for decades.

But the field has expanded significantly in recent years with new technological solutions and research projects emerging worldwide.

Some of the most active start-up hubs focusing on cellular agriculture are in the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands and Israel, Nordlund said.

""We are in a crucial phase as we will see which start-ups will survive,"" she said, adding that stalling bureaucracy was slowing cellular agriculture's take-off in the EU.

Dressed in protective gear to prevent bacteria contamination in the factory, Vainikka showed off a giant steel tank in a shiny production hall.

""This is a fermenter holding 20,000 litres,"" he said, explaining that the microbe multiplies inside the tank as it gets fed the greenhouse gas.

Liquid containing the microbes is continuously extracted from the tank to be processed into the yellowish protein-rich powder with a flavour described as ""nutty"" and ""creamy"".

""The fermenter produces the same amount of protein per day as 300 milking cows or 50,000 laying hens,"" Vainikka said.

That equals ""five million meals' worth of protein per year"".

For now, the main purpose of the small Finnish plant employing around 40 people is to ""prove that the technology scales"", so it can attract the necessary investments pending European regulatory approval.

The Finnish company's Solnet Manager platform will allow commercial and industrial solar utilities and energy storages to join a collective pool of VPPs, enabling them to participate in balancing markets, contribute to greater grid stability and earn additional revenue.

The company claims the platform will be the first of its kind globally as the model will allow participatory companies in the network to receive compensation for being on standby and providing production flexibility.

Specifically, the platform will control a diverse pool of solar utilities and energy storage units as a virtual power plant, optimising their flexible renewable capacity to provide auxiliary services.

The platform handles all necessary services, including participation, reporting, aggregation of combined virtual power plant capacity and targeting of balancing markets for profitability.

Under a service model, Solnet Group takes care of the logistics, from device integration and onboarding to management and report generation. Business Finland has provided funding for the project in its research phase.

Solnet Manager - Virtual Powerplant Services for Solar will be available during 2024 as the first in Finland.

""With the launch of Solnet Manager, we are addressing a crucial gap in virtual power plant participation for small and mid-scale installations. This will bring a new era to solar PV and energy storage markets, as it makes onboarding variable-size utilities for balance market participation easy, cost-effective, and profitable,"" said Arttur Kulvik, SVP and co-founder of Solnet Group, who has been responsible for the development of Solnet Manager.

""In doing so, they can become part of the solution for overcoming the volatile nature of renewable energy production and grid congestion issues, earning additional revenue while ensuring the optimal functioning of energy grids.""

Now's the time for virtual power plants to shine

In a release, Solnet cites fluctuating production of renewable energy sources and geopolitical uncertainties, which have led to increased volatility in energy prices and instability in electricity markets.

Solar utilities and energy storage units, they add, can play a crucial role in grid balancing services, helping counteract the variability of renewable energy generation and generating extra income for participants.

Previously, such market opportunities were available only to large-scale energy consumers and producers, but now smaller commercial solar utilities and variable-capacity energy storage can also partake.

According to Solnet, the platform's launch is timeous, referencing provisions for solar power in the European Performance of Buildings Directive, confirmed by the EU in March 2024, which will further increase the number of industrial and commercial onsite solar installations.

The directive requires the installation of onsite solar power systems across Europe on all new commercial and public buildings by 2026, on all commercial and public buildings undergoing major renovations by 2027, on all new residential buildings by 2029, and on all existing public buildings by 2030.

Rescued Javan pangolin in Quang Nam gives birth after six months

After birth, the baby Javan pangolin receives meticulous care, including specialized nutrition and close monitoring to ensure its healthy development.

On May 24, the leader of Quang Nam Province's Department of Natural Resources and Environment reported that a Javan pangolin individual rescued and nurtured at the Vinpearl River Safari Nam Hoi An Animal Rescue Center had successfully given birth.

Accordingly, the Javan pangolin was discovered in a severely injured state on December 13, 2023, by the Forest Protection Unit of Tien Phuoc District, Quang Nam Province. It was subsequently transferred to the center to ensure proper care and rehabilitation.

According to Mr. Le Viet Cuong, Head of the Animal Care Department at the Center, caring for the severely injured Javan pangolin caught in a trap posed significant challenges. During the rescue operation, the center conducted a scan of the pangolin to aid in treatment and discovered that it was possibly pregnant, although there were no clear signs.

The pangolin individual resides in a simulated natural habitat, featuring soil, vegetation, and hiding spots to ensure the animal feels secure and at ease. On May 13, during a routine health check, the caretakers found that the pangolin had given birth to a newborn.

""After birth, the baby Javan pangolin receives meticulous care, including specialized nutrition and close monitoring to ensure its healthy development. The baby Javan pangolin is regularly weighed and undergone medical assessments. As of now, the newborn pangolin has gained 34 grams, weighing a total of 211 grams.""

Before that, on January 22, 2023, the center celebrated the birth of a Javan pangolin offspring from an individual rescued on August 25, 2022, by the Nam Giang District Police (Quang Nam Province).

UNDP says political commitments needed for green economy

Strong political commitment from governments and active private sector engagement are critical for achieving a green and resilient economy, according to UNDP Deputy Resident Representative in Việt Nam Patrick Haverman.

""Green recovery and green economy efforts must be vigorously pursued at national, regional and global levels, guided by the SDGs and the Paris Agreement,"" he said while speaking at the South-South Lessons Learned Workshop on Aligning Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) with Green Recovery in the central province of Thừa Thiên-Huế.

In response to the dual challenges of recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic and addressing climate change, the alignment of NDCs with green recovery strategies has become a vital pathway for sustainable development.

To support this goal, the UNDP initiated a targeted support project for five pilot countries -- Benin, Albania, Ecuador, Việt Nam and Jordan.

The workshop, which takes place from Wednesday to Friday, brings together government officials and UNDP international experts from the five countries as well as other Vietnamese representatives.

It aims to share insights and lessons learned from the pilot countries on integrating NDCs with green recovery initiatives.

Other objectives include identifying best practices and challenges in aligning NDCs with sustainable economic recovery efforts, exploring opportunities for applying the lessons learned in future programming and policy-making, and developing networks for South-South cooperation on NDCs and sustainable development.

The initiative focuses on leveraging the NDC enhancement and implementation process to foster a recovery that is robust, equitable and sustainable, highlighting the importance of the Paris Agreement and its instruments, such as NDCs, National Adaptation Plans (NAPs) and Long-Term Strategies (LTS).

The pilot countries have undertaken various initiatives, including policy alignment, financial strategies, capacity building and knowledge sharing to integrate NDCs into their green recovery efforts.

In addition to deep-dive sessions on aligning NDC policy measures with post COVID-19 recovery plans and NDC finance with recovery finance, the workshop also includes sessions on enhancing gender responsiveness and inclusivity in green recovery efforts.

Hoàng Hải Minh, deputy chairman of Thừa Thiên-Huế Province People's Committee, said: ""With the cooperation and support of UNDP, Thừa Thiên-Huế has achieved positive results in green energy conversion, reducing carbon and methane emissions in the transportation sector.

""Some projects include the pilot 'Support for providing preferential loans for individuals to purchase electric vehicles' for people in Thừa Thiên-Huế Province; deploying six electric trucks at a pilot waste collection site in Huế City funded by UNDP; researching and testing green transportation policy for shippers delivering goods by motorbike in Huế City; and installing solar panel systems for electric vehicle charging stations.""

Workshop participants are scheduled to visit various sites in Huế City, including Vietnam Motorcycle Ltd., where they will see the electric vehicle fleet supported by UNDP. They will also visit Huế Environment and Urban Works JSC to learn about solar battery stations and electric garbage trucks funded by the Japanese government and UNDP.

Additional stops include the Institute of Development Studies of Thừa Thiên-Huế Province and a shared bicycle station promoting environmentally friendly transport options.

Vietnamese women's volleyball team defeats Singapore

The Vietnamese women's volleyball team continued their winning streak in Group B of 2024 Asian Women's Volleyball Challenge Cup, with their victory over Singapore's women's team being unsurprising.

On the afternoon of May 23 in the Philippines, the Vietnamese women's volleyball team played their second group stage match in Group B, facing off against Singapore.

In theory, Singapore's women's volleyball team is not a particularly strong opponent for the Vietnamese team. Nevertheless, coach Nguyen Tuan Kiet and the coaching staff remained cautious and respectful, ensuring a solid lineup. Once again, outside hitter Tran Thi Thanh Thuy did not take the court. However, hitters Hoang Thi Kieu Trinh, Nguyen Thi Tra My, and Nguyen Thi Bich Tuyen were assigned the responsibility of scoring points by coach Nguyen Tuan Kiet.

Besides them, at certain points, outside hitters Vi Thi Nhu Quynh and Tran Tu Linh were brought in to bolster the strength of the Vietnamese women's team. Throughout the match, setter Vo Thi Kim Thoa safely distributed the ball to the outside and middle hitters, allowing Vietnamese players to make precise attacks.

In the first set, coach Nguyen Tuan Kiet's players secured a quick victory with a score of 25-8. In the second set, the Singaporean team showed more enthusiasm and determination, making it challenging for the Vietnamese blockers. At the crucial moment of the set, Bich Tuyen made a precise spike to secure a 29-27 win. The third set concluded with a decisive 25-10 victory for the Vietnamese women's volleyball team, resulting in a 3-0 overall win.

Facing a relatively weak opponent, coach Nguyen Tuan Kiet rotated players to allow more team members to play. This strategy helps each player gain a better feel for the game. In an earlier match, Hong Kong's women's volleyball team (China) defeated Indonesia 3-0. With two consecutive wins, Vietnam temporarily leads Group B. On May 24, the Vietnamese women's volleyball team will face Kazakhstan.

Vietnam's bamboo diplomacy gains Russian scholars' interest

Vietnam's bamboo diplomacy drew attention of Russian researchers on Vietnamese studies at a conference held by the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) on May 22.

Participants in the event, themed ""Vietnam in a Multipolar World: Approaches, Challenges and Prospects"", discussed the concept of ""bamboo diplomacy"" in Vietnam, new directions of the Vietnamese foreign policy, the country's relations with strategic partners, its political and socio-economic development, as well as current aspects of Russian-Vietnamese cooperation.

Speaking at the conference, President of the Vietnam Union of Friendship Organisations (VUFO) Phan Anh Son briefed participants on the foreign policy that Vietnam is pursuing, which is independence, self-reliance, peace, friendship, cooperation and development, multilateralisation and diversification of foreign relations; to be a friend, a trustworthy partner and an active and responsible member of the international community; to stay steadfast in principles and goals while being flexible and smart in strategies; and to harmoniously combine the Party, state and people's external affairs.

Responding to scholars' questions about how Vietnam chooses to join international organisations, Son affirmed that following the above-mentioned principle, Vietnam will never join any organisation that hinders the development of other countries, but it has always helped others, including close neighbours, integrate into international organisations.

Talking to Vietnam News Agency, Deputy Director of the MGIMO's ASEAN Centre Valeria Vershinina said that in just the last few years, Vietnam has upgraded its relations with several powers, especially the US, to the highest level of comprehensive strategic partnership. Meanwhile, Vietnam and Russia are still maintaining their highest-level relationship successfully.

This shows that Vietnam's bamboo diplomacy is multi-dimensional and aims to maintain the country's influence and pro-activeness despite ongoing conflicts in the Asia-Pacific region as well as others in the world, she added.

For his part, Vladimir Mazyrin, Director of the Vietnam - ASEAN Research Centre at the Russian Academy of Science, held that Vietnam's philosophy of bamboo diplomacy is new and more reasonable than other countries' in the same region.

Bamboo diplomacy is not only a work methodology for Vietnam's diplomatic sector but also a right political choice in the current context, and this policy reflects Vietnamese leaders' research efforts and creativity, he added.

The concept of ""bamboo diplomany"", first mentioned by Party General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong at the 29th Diplomatic Conference on August 22, 2016, has become known in Russia inthe past few years and attracted growing attention.

Counsellor of the Vietnamese Embassy in Russia Doan Khac Hoang expressed his belief that better understanding of Vietnam's foreign policy will help future diplomats take the first steps properly and in a right direction to build up and develop relations between the two countries./.

Vietnam, Finland discuss ways to boost labour cooperation

Deputy Minister of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs Le Tan Dung held a working session with Finnish Ambassador to Vietnam Keijo Norvanto in Hanoi on May 23, during which they discussed measures to promote cooperation in vocational education and sending Vietnamese workers to Finland.

Dung proposed Norvanto continue to act as a bridge to coordinate and step up cooperation activities in vocational education such as building and developing training institutions of Finland, establishing a quality assessment system that meets international standards, connecting Vietnamese vocational education institutions with Finnish businesses in Vietnam, enhancing the capacity of management officials and teachers, and selecting support for technology transfer and training courses aligned with Finland's key strengths.

While acknowledging the absence of a formal labour cooperation agreement between the two countries, Dung highlighted the recent trend of receiving Vietnamese guest workers to Finland, saying that since late 2023, about 20 Vietnamese workers have secured jobs in various sectors, including nursing, welding and forestry.

Amid the labour shortage caused by an aging population and a low birth rate, Norvanto said the Finnish Government launched the pilot Talent Boost Programme to attract workers, experts and entrepreneurs during 2020-2022 to draw 50,000 immigrants for employment to Finland by 2030 and 250,000 by 2050.

Vietnam, alongside Brazil, India, and Turkey, has been identified as a key source country for this initiative, he said.

He urged the Vietnamese Ministry of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs (MoLISA) to prioritise strengthening bilateral labour cooperation, specifically by expeditiously studying and signing a Memorandum of Understanding outlining a framework for Vietnamese labourers working in Finland.

With the upcoming visit of the Finnish Minister of Employment to Vietnam in January 2025, he expressed his desire for close collaboration between MoLISA and the Finnish Embassy to solidify cooperation plans./.

HCM City partners German firms in vocational training, labour export

Mine action for Korea-Vietnam peace village project launched

The mine action for the Republic of Korea (RoK) - Vietnam peace village project, which covers the central provinces of Thua Thien-Hue, Quang Ngai and Binh Dinh, was launched in Binh Dinh on May 23.

Jointly implemented by the Vietnam National Mine Action Centre (VNMAC), the Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA) and the UN Development Programme, the project will run until December 2026 at a total cost of over 14 million USD from non-refundable aid provided by the RoK Government.

It aims to cope with consequences of bombs and mines left by the war, protect civilians, promote socioeconomic development of the localities and serve the building of rural communities of harmony, safety, prosperity and climate change resilience.

The project will focus on conducting technical surveys on 15,000 hectares of land and clear about 6,000 hectares of UXO and explosive-contaminated areas in the three provinces.

It will support UXO victims and persons with disabilities in the covered localities, while enhancing the capacity of officials at all levels in the field, and helping complete mechanisms, policies and social solutions to assist UXO victims and the disabled.

Addressing the launching ceremony, Vice Chairman of the People's Committee of Binh Dinh Nguyen Tu Cong Hoang said that 250,000 hectares, or 40% of the province's natural area are polluted by post-war bombs, mines and unexploded ordnance (UXO).

Thanks to a cooperation project between Vietnam and the RoK that was implemented in 2018-2021, more than 4,200 hectares of UXO-contaminated land of Binh Dinh were cleared, and 69,000 UXOs of all kinds were collected and deactivated. Currently, more than 26,800 people affected by UXO in the province are in need of support, Hoang said.

Sen. Lieut. Gen. Hoang Xuan Chien, Deputy Minister of National Defence, said that once completed, the project will help people in areas contaminated with bombs, mines and explosives in the three provinces to be safe during their production and daily life.

Along with the completion of three component projects implemented by the People's Committees of the three provinces, many communities and bomb and mine victims living in Hoa Binh (peace) villages will receive support in human and livelihood development, thus making an important contribution to the socio-economic development of the localities.

He asked VNMAC to continue coordinating closely with KOICA and UNDP with the highest sense of responsibility, ensuring the effective implementation of all project activities as scheduled with the utmost safety.

Earlier, VNMAC, KOICA and UNDP jointly implemented the Korea-Vietnam Mine Action Project (KVMAP) which successfully cleared nearly 17,000 hectares of UXO-polluted land in Quang Binh and Binh Dinh provinces, enhance the capacity of more than 450,000 locals in preventing UXO accidents, and support 1,000 UXO victims./.

Deputy minister requires strict handling of violations of vessel monitoring system regulations

Deputy Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development Phung Duc Tien on May 23 emphasised the management of the fishing fleet, traceability, and strict administrative punishment for violations of regulations on the vessel monitoring system (VMS) as the key issues in ending illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing while addressing an online conference on May 23.

The conference was held by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) to implement Dispatch No. 49/CD-TTg on detecting and handling violations of the VMS regulations.

Tien said in a recent working session between a MARD delegation and the European Commission (EC), the EC pointed to limitations during the implementation of the VMS regulations in localities, despite adequate legal documents and strong political determination in Vietnam.

It is a must to strictly handle violations of VMS regulations, especially those committed by above-15m-long boats, the official said, noting that merely commitments or warnings are not accepted by the EC.

Ha Le, Director of the Fisheries Information Centre under the MARD's Directorate of Fisheries, said as of May 21, 2024, up to 98.25% of boats measuring at least 15m long had been equipped with VMS devices.

However, only about 60% of them maintain daily connection, he said, adding that many vessels have disconnected since 2019, which has hampered monitoring efforts by competent forces.

He also pointed to shortcomings in the handling of such violations, the loose coordination between forces in localities, along with wrongdoings by VMS suppliers.

Director of the Fisheries Resources Surveillance Department Nguyen Quang Hung asked localities to review and dispose vessels no longer operational, and take more drastic actions in investigating and handling violations./.

Vietnam calls for cooperation in protection, use of transboundary water resources

Vietnam, Slovenia, Switzerland, several other United Nations (UN) member states and international organisations on May 23 jointly organised an event on preventing attacks on water resources in armed conflicts and enhancing civilian protection.

Held within the UN Protection of Civilians Week, the event saw many representatives lauding the importance of Resolution 2573, which is on protecting objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population, to the protection of water systems and infrastructure.

In his remarks, Ambassador Dang Hoang Giang, Permanent Representative of Vietnam to the UN, outlined several proposals by the Southeast Asian nation for better protecting water resources in armed conflicts.

He said addressing the root causes of conflicts is the best way to protect civilians and water resources, with the Security Council playing a crucial role. Resolution 2573 is one of the significant initiatives in this regard and its implementation needs to be strengthened.

All parties involved in armed conflicts must adhere to international law and international humanitarian law and be held accountable for attacks on water resources and water infrastructure, he noted.

The diplomat went on to stress a need to prioritise stronger cooperation in protecting and sustainably using transboundary water resources to ensure effective and equitable management of the shared resources, maintaining a peaceful and stable environment for sustainable development, and preventing conflicts. The UN and regional mechanisms have a vital role to play in promoting dialogue and joint work among countries for common development and prosperity./.

In his remarks, Ambassador Dang Hoang Giang, Permanent Representative of Vietnam to the UN, outlined several proposals by the Southeast Asian nation for better protecting water resources in armed conflicts.

He said addressing the root causes of conflicts is the best way to protect civilians and water resources, with the Security Council playing a crucial role. Resolution 2573 is one of the significant initiatives in this regard and its implementation needs to be strengthened.

All parties involved in armed conflicts must adhere to international law and international humanitarian law and be held accountable for attacks on water resources and water infrastructure, he noted.

The diplomat went on to stress a need to prioritise stronger cooperation in protecting and sustainably using transboundary water resources to ensure effective and equitable management of the shared resources, maintaining a peaceful and stable environment for sustainable development, and preventing conflicts. The UN and regional mechanisms have a vital role to play in promoting dialogue and joint work among countries for common development and prosperity./.

Cu Lao Cham - Hoi An marks 15th anniversary of world biosphere reserve status

A ceremony was held by the People's Committee of Hoi An city, the central province of Quang Nam, on May 23 to mark 15 years since Cu Lao Cham - Hoi An was recognised as a world biosphere reserve by UNESCO.

Cu Lao Cham - Hoi An was granted the status by the International Coordinating Council of the Man and the Biosphere Programme of UNESCO on May 26, 2009 thanks to its unique and typical values that cannot be found anywhere else among the 11 world biosphere reserves in Vietnam at present.

Among those prominent values, the site, established in 2006, is part of the system of national-level protected areas. It features Hoi An Ancient Town - a cultural heritage site recognised by UNESCO in 1999, a nipa palm forest ecosystem in the mouth of the Thu Bon River, a special-use forest on Cu Lao Cham Island, a coastal protection forest system, and traditional craft villages with outstanding tangible and intangible cultural values associated with the land and people of Hoi An throughout history.

According to UNESCO, this biosphere reserve is a typical and the clearest demonstration of the connection and harmony between the nature and humans. Located in the downstream Thu Bon River and linked with Cu Lao Cham archipelago, it is home to all representatives of natural ecosystems along river branches, in coastal areas, and on islands around Hoi An Ancient Town.

The world biosphere reserve title is the international community's recognition of Hoi An city's remarkable efforts in preserving and bringing into play values of natural and human resources on the path to sustainable development.

On this occasion, visitors to Cu Lao Cham between May 22 - June 3 have a chance to experience diverse and special activities such as a photo exhibition on the reserve's biodiversity and nature protection efforts, a music show, and local traditional crafts./.

Vietnamese, Czech communist parties eye to strengthen relations

Chairwoman of the Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia (KSCM) of the Czech Republic Katerina Konecna has asserted her support for further strengthening the bilateral relations with Vietnam, as the two countries are looking forward to the 75th founding anniversary of the bilateral diplomatic relations (February 2, 1950 - 2025).

In a recent interview granted to the Vietnam News Agency, the official highlighted the long-lasting and good relationship between the two countries, saying that the Czech Republic was one of the first countries in the world to establish diplomatic relations with Vietnam, and even before that, it supported Vietnam's struggle for national liberation.

Throughout the history, the relationship between the two countries has always developed dynamically and comprehensively, she said.

According to Konecna, one of the foundations for strengthening bilateral relations is the mutual respect of sovereignty and choice of social models, including differences in history and culture, thus paving the way for enhancing the win-win cooperation based on the demands and capabilities of the two nations.

She stated that as a member of the European Parliament (EP), she personally always supports strengthening the relationship between the European Union (EU) and Vietnam.

In the overall bilateral relationship, she valued the long-standing tradition of the relationship between the KSCM and the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV), saying that the two parties share a common belief in building a socialist society with the unique identities of each nation.

She affirmed the CPV's role in the struggle for national liberation and reunification, and as well as the ongoing national construction and defence efforts.

Konecna spoke highly of the Vietnamese community's integration into Czech society, and the fact that hundreds of thousands of people in Vietnam still maintain ties with the Czech Republic. She emphasised that the KSCM supports the recognition of the Vietnamese community as an ethnic minority group in the country more than 10 years ago.

In mid-April, during a meeting with Vietnamese Ambassador to the Czech Republic Duong Hoai Nam, Konecna evaluated the political and diplomatic relations between the two countries, stressing that the traditional friendship and multifaceted cooperation have been maintained and developed by leaders of both nations over nearly 75 years.

She affirmed KSCM's consistent policy of promoting traditional relations with communist parties around the world, of which the CPV is one of the priority partners in the foreign policy of the KSCM.

Vietnam puts forward initiatives to promote Asia's role and sustainable development

Vietnamese Deputy Prime Minister Le Minh Khai delivered a speech at the 29th Future of Asia Forum in Tokyo, Japan, on May 23, putting forward a number of initiatives to promote Asia's role and sustainable development amidst global complications.

He said Asia remains a dynamic and steady growth region, citing the fact that after each crisis in the past three decades, Asia has overcome difficulties, resolved challenges, developed more strongly and truly become a role model of development with pioneers and leaders in many new fields.

To promote its role and development in the future, he said it's necessary for Asia to maintain a peaceful and stable environment as a premise for cooperation and development, while respecting the United Nations Charter and international law, especially the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.

In his viewpoint, benefits from trade and investment liberalization are distributed widely and equally among countries, and countries uphold multilateralism and take a global, all-people, comprehensive approach in solving common challenges.

The Deputy Prime Minister called on regional partners to promote and strengthen the adaptive capacity and resilience of Asian economies and businesses. According to him, through multilateral frameworks, regional economies need to increase information sharing, coordinate macro policies, and promptly promote regional and inter-regional economic cooperation initiatives.

Cooperation on food security, energy security, cyber security and trade connections to diversify supply sources is necessary to contribute to strengthening the economic security of the Asian region, he stressed.

He also suggested bringing into full play resources to promote new growth drivers in the green economy and digital economy, saying regional economies need to prepare to welcome new development trends, such as artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and new energy; pilot and replicate green, circular, and sharing economy models; and enhance the implementation of regional initiatives such as Japan's Asia Zero Emission Community (AZEC) initiative; the ASEAN Digital Economy Framework Agreement, the ASEAN Blue Economy Framework, and the ASEAN Strategy for Carbon Neutrality.

To do this, the Deputy Prime Minister requested that developed countries continue paying attention to and providing support to developing countries in terms of finance, technology transfer, and improving capacity building to implement commitments on green growth, emission reduction, climate change adaptation, and human resources training.

Amidst common challenges in the region, the Vietnamese leader called on businesses to accompany the governments in implementing its commitment to sustainable development, towards long-term economic, environmental and social goals. He underscored the need to increase investment in science - technology, and human capital, and in building inclusive, self-reliant communities, considering this an opportunity for Asian businesses to establish positions in global supply chains.

The Deputy Prime Minister expressed his hope that leaders would support youth exchange programmes to strengthen mutual understanding and build up trust for the next generations.

He also highly appreciated Japan's role in shaping Asia's future development, saying as one of the most developed economies in the region, Japan has made important contributions to regional cooperation and development over the past decades. He expected that Japan, with its advantages in capital, technology and governance, would continue to play a leading role in promoting regional economic cooperation and development, as well as supporting and accompanying partners in Asia and ASEAN on this journey.

At the meeting, Deputy PM Khai affirmed that Vietnam is part of the great Asian family, and it wishes to further promote its role as a good friend, a reliable partner, and a responsible member of the region and the international community.

He briefed delegates on Vietnam's recent development achievements and its policy line, saying the country is entering a new stage of development with the vision of becoming a developed economy by 2045.

To realise the goal, he said Vietnam focuses on implementing three strategic breakthroughs, namely economic institutions, infrastructure and human resources; steadfastly building an independent, self-reliant economy closely linked to deep, active and effective international integration; and persistently implementing the foreign policy line of independence, self-reliance, peace, friendship, cooperation and development, along with multilateralization and diversification of foreign relations.

He also assured that the Government of Vietnam accompanies foreign investors to iron out snags for win-win results.

Deputy PM meets Cambodian, Singaporean counterparts in Tokyo

Deputy Prime Minister Le Minh Khai met bilaterally with his Cambodian and Singaporean counterparts on May 23 during his working trip to Tokyo for the 29th International Conference on the Future of Asia.

Meeting Cambodian Deputy PM Sun Chanthol, Khai expressed his delight at the stable development of bilateral cooperation, especially in the economic aspect with a remarkable growth in two-way trade in the first quarter of this year.

He affirmed Vietnam's respect for Cambodia's legitimate interests in national construction and development, including the Funan Techo canal project, in line with the friendly relations and relevant regulations of the Mekong River Commission (MRC).

In this spirit, Khai urged Cambodia to continue collaborating closely with Vietnam and the MRC to share information and assess the project's impact on water resources and the eco-environment in the Mekong River basin. This, he stressed, is crucial for harmonising interests of riparian countries for the sustainable development of the basin and the well-being of its inhabitants.

Sun Chanthol, for his part, highlighted the need to further strengthen economic, trade and investment ties to achieve the goal of US$20 billion in two-way trade, adding that the Cambodian Government encourages Vietnamese investment in Cambodia.

Both leaders agreed to promote high-level visits and exchanges, including via the Party channel, and effectively implement existing agreements and cooperation mechanisms. They affirmed their high regard and priority for the fine neighbourliness, traditional friendship, comprehensive, sustainable and long-term cooperation between Vietnam and Cambodia.

Meeting with his Singaporean counterpart Gan Kim Yong, Khai congratulated Gan on his recent appointment. He believed that following the recent successful power transfer, the Singaporean Government and people will reap greater successes in national construction and development.

To elevate Vietnam-Singapore relations to a new level, Khai proposed further strengthening the implementation of the Vietnam-Singapore Economic Connectivity Agreement framework and the Digital Economy and Green Economy Partnership (GDEP) framework. He also called for attracting high-quality foreign investment in emerging technology sectors, transforming Vietnam-Singapore Industrial Parks (VSIPs) into smart, green and sustainable models, and fostering collaboration in education, training, tourism and people-to-people exchanges.

The Vietnamese leader hoped that both countries would continue working closely together at international and regional forums such as ASEAN, the United Nations, and APEC. He also emphasised the need for a strong, united and resilient ASEAN Community to uphold its role and address regional issues.

Both sides acknowledged the positive outcomes of their cooperation, particularly in the economic sphere. They expressed a commitment to elevating their relationship to a new height, potentially setting a model for future ASEAN partnerships.

Gan underscored the potential for further economic cooperation, expressing a desire to expand collaboration not just in quantity but also in quality. Building upon the GDEP framework, he suggested the two sides explore and launch projects in emerging areas like electricity transmission, hydrogen energy, carbon credits and green finance.

On the occasion, Deputy PM Khai conveyed an invitation from Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh for a visit by Singaporean PM Lawrence Wong.

Chí Thạnh Railway Tunnel expected to reopen in the next three days following landslide incident

The Ministry of Transport says that provided the remains favourable, the landslide repairs at Chí Thạnh Railway Tunnel in the south-central province of Phú Yên can be completed quickly and the tunnel reopened within the next three days.

Repairs are underway at the Chí Thạnh tunnel, with nearly 100 workers actively pumping concrete to reinforce the landslide points, while no new soil and rock displacements have been observed inside the tunnel.

Speaking at the on-site inspection on Thursday, Deputy Minister of Transport Nguyễn Danh Huy stated that Chí Thạnh Tunnel and other tunnels in the central region were built over a hundred years ago and have deteriorated.

However, due to the lack of investment funds, repairs and renovation of the tunnel faces many difficulties.

The cause of the landslide at Chí Thạnh Railway Tunnel has been identified as complicated geology and loose structures, while a road on top of the tunnel has caused structural damage.

Heavy rainfalls have reduced the physical and mechanical properties of the soil, triggering the landslide along a 325m railway tunnel section in Tuy An District and disrupting the North-South rail services.

The Ministry of Transport has instructed the Project Management Board No85, the project owner and the construction unit to closely coordinate with the Việt Nam Railway Corporation to carry out the repairs.

Construction forces must remain on-site around the clock to quickly address the landslide, ensuring worker safety throughout the process.

Despite the challenging conditions, repair work at Chí Thạnh Railway Tunnel is making significant progress.

At 10.30 am on Tuesday, a landslide occurred inside the tunnel, causing 30 cu.m of soil and rock to fall onto the track, covering part of the tunnel.

No trains were damaged, as the tunnel was already closed for reinforcement when the landslide occurred. Passengers were taken by bus to bypass the affected area.

Previously, the Bãi Gió railway tunnel in the Đèo Cả area of south-central province Khánh Hoà experienced a serious landslide, causing disruptions on the North-South railway route for nearly ten days.",vietnamnet.vn,news,VietNamNet News,,0.223529411764706,454303696,25,https://static-images.vnncdn.net/vps_images_publish/000001/00000Q/2024/5/24/vietnam-news-headlines-may-252024-c6b22b45e70c4cbf9a67d78e1d0b1f72-2951.webp?width=0&s=4I8aW7Yo_qiwMgqdsLaziw,

From the mid-1960s through 2016, Colombia was torn by conflict between the government, leftist guerrilla movements and right-wing paramilitary groups. Now the government and rebels are working to carry out a sweeping accord that addresses many critical sectors, including environmental damages and restoration.

University of Notre Dame researchers Richard Marcantonio and Josefina Echavarria Alvarez study peace and conflict issues, including their effects on the environment. They currently are advising negotiations between the Colombian government and several rebel factions over wartime damage to soil, water and other natural resources. They explain that while Colombia's transition from war to peace has been difficult, the accord offers a model for addressing the ravages of war in places such as Gaza and Ukraine.

Few agreements include environmental provisions, and even fewer see them carried out, even though research shows that many drivers of conflict can be directly or indirectly related to the environment.

We work with a research program at the University of Notre Dame called the Peace Accords Matrix, which monitors the implementation of comprehensive peace accords in 34 countries worldwide. Only 10 of the accords have natural resource management provisions agreements, and these typically have not triggered major steps to protect the environment.

Colombia's is seen as the most comprehensive peace accord that has been signed to date. It considers issues ranging from security to social justice and political participation, in great detail.

The accord acknowledges that a peaceful postwar society requires not only respect for human rights but also ""protection of the environment, respect for nature and its renewable and nonrenewable resources and biodiversity."" More than 20% of the commitments in the agreement have an environmental connection.

They fall into four main categories:

- Protecting environmental health through measures such as access to clean water

- Process issues, such as ensuring that communities can participate in decisions about rural programs and resource management

There also are gaps. For example, many protected areas have been deforested for ranching and coca production in the postaccord period. And there are no provisions addressing toxic pollution, an issue other agreements also neglect.

Often there are power vacuums during transitions between war and peace, when government agencies are working to reestablish their operations. Natural resources and environmental health need protection during these phases.

In Sierra Leone, for example, resource extraction by foreign companies drastically ramped up immediately after the Lome Peace Agreement eventually ended that nation's civil war in 2002. Companies exploited a lack of governance and support in the rural areas and often mined metals illegally or hazardously without any regulatory oversight. Today these areas still struggle with mining impacts, including contaminated drinking water and fish, the primary protein source in the area.

The damage is vast: There's air, water and soil contamination, deforestation and enormous quantities of waste, including ruined buildings, burned-out cars and thousands of tons of destroyed military equipment. Russia's destruction of the Kakhovka Dam flooded villages, destroyed crops and wrecked irrigation systems.

The cost estimates are staggering. A joint commission of the World Bank, the government of Ukraine and other institutions currently estimate direct damages at roughly US$152 billion.

In addition, cleaning up sites, rebuilding infrastructure and other repairs could cost more than $486 billion over the next decade, as of late 2023. That figure rises every day that the war continues.

There's broad interest in a green and sustainable reconstruction that would include steps like using sustainable building materials and powering the electricity grid with renewable energy. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been adamant that Russia must pay for the damage it has caused. It's still unclear how this would work, although some U.S. and European lawmakers support seizing frozen Russian assets held in Western banks to help cover the cost.

There is a legal basis for holding Russia accountable. In 2022, the U.N. General Assembly adopted a set of principles for protecting the environment during armed conflicts. Among other existing statutes, they draw on a protocol to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 that prohibits using ""methods or means of warfare which are intended, or may be expected, to cause widespread, long-term and severe damage to the natural environment.""

There has been only modest discussion so far of how to integrate these principles into a formal peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia. But a working group that included Ukrainian and European Union officials and former leaders from Sweden, Finland, Ireland and Brazil has recommended a framework for addressing environmental damage and holding perpetrators accountable.

Environmental damage in Gaza also is devastating. The U.N. estimated in early 2024 that over 100,000 cubic meters (26 million gallons) of untreated sewage and wastewater were flowing daily onto land or into the Mediterranean Sea.

Gaza's drinking water system was insufficient before the war and has been further weakened by military strikes. On average, Gazans now have access to about 3 liters of water per person per day - less than 1 gallon.

Thousands of buildings have been destroyed, spreading hazardous materials such as asbestos. Every bomb that's dropped disperses toxic materials that will persist in the soil unless it's remediated. Simultaneous environmental and infrastructure impacts, such as water and power shortages, are contributing to larger crises, such as the collapse of Gaza's health care system, that will have long-lasting human costs.

Integrating the environment into peace accords isn't easy. Resources such as energy, clean soil and water are vital for life, which is precisely why military forces may seek to control or destroy them. This is happening in both Ukraine and Gaza.

Peace negotiators tend to focus on social, political and economic issues, rather than environmental reparations. But leaving environmental damage unresolved until after a peace accord is signed keeps people who have been displaced and marginalized by conflict in precarious positions.

It may even cause fighting to resume. According to the U.N. Environment Program, at least 40% of all wars within states in the past 60 years have had a link to natural resources. In those cases, fighting was twice as likely to resume within five years after conflict ended.

We see some lessons for future negotiations.

First, it's important for accords to recognize environmental harm as one of war's main consequences and to acknowledge that a healthy environment is essential for sustainable livelihoods and peace.

Second, connecting environmental provisions with other issues, such as rural reform and political participation, can create better, more sustainable and equal conditions for reestablishing democracy. The Colombia accords are an example.

Third, it is important to clearly define goals, such as what infrastructure and institutions need to be rebuilt, who is in charge of getting those tasks done, and the timetable for doing it. This can help ensure that environmental restoration doesn't become a secondary goal.

Fourth, the international community has an important role to play in monitoring and verifying environmental restoration and providing financial and technical support. Foreign donors have already pledged $66 billion for rebuilding Ukraine and have said that they will require grantees to follow strict environmental standards in order to receive financing.

Reconstructing nations and simultaneously regenerating communities and ecosystems after wars is a daunting mission, but it's also an opportunity to build something better. We see Ukraine and Gaza as potential test cases for addressing war's toll on the environment and creating a more sustainable future.",flaglerlive.com,news,FlaglerLive,,-0.03529411764705881,454294898,1,https://flaglerlive.com/wp-content/uploads/war-pollution.jpg,

The company, one of the pioneers in the field of climate technology investments in Central and Eastern Europe, participated in Balkan Energy Forum 2024, which gathered 500 participants from 30 countries.

Director of janom Energy and Battery Matej Šanta was a speaker on a panel on accelerating energy storage investments in the region.

Andrej Sršeň said it is a private equity group investing in renewable energy sources, battery storage, and innovative energy solutions.

Over the last two decades, the company has been operating in Central Europe, the Nordics and Finland.

""Therefore, we take BEF 2024 not only as an opportunity to invest into local projects, but also to share our knowledge and address the challenges the sector is facing,"" Sršeň stressed.

Conference participants get how important these topics are for their countries

By increasing the share of renewables in the energy mix and developing battery storage capacity, the Western Balkans are doing good things not only for the environment, but also for themselves because they are strengthening energy security, in his view.

At the same time, they are contributing to cheaper energy generation and the creation of modern and exciting jobs while attracting foreign direct investments as investors require clean and local electricity, Sršeň explained.

""We feel that the conference participants get how important these topics are for their countries. So we hope that we can do our part as an investor and mentor of local developers of the projects,"" he noted.

The future 30 MW photovoltaic facility in Croatia is the firm's first-ever investment in the country. It is eyeing other wind and PV projects in Croatia with an estimated overall capacity of over 200 MW, which will require investing an estimated EUR 300 million.

The company has long followed the renewables development potential in Croatia, Sršeň said when the project was announced.

Janom Investments was established in Slovakia in 2008. It operates several solar and hydropower plants in Slovakia and the Czech Republic. The company developed wind farms Tyrinselkä and Soidinmäki in Finland, with a combined capacity of 70 MW, and later sold them to Aquila Capital.

It also invests in climate technologies. It is one of the founding investors in Greenway, the largest operator of charging networks for electric vehicles in Poland and Slovakia, with more than 2,500 charging points.

This is a saving of £122 over the course of a year - or around £10 a month - the energy regulator said - meaning households can expect to pay significantly less for their energy this summer. It is around £500 less than its level in July last year when it was £2,074.

The fall was attributed to a significant decline in wholesale energy costs since mid-November. However the drop in prices was less than experts had hoped: analyst Cornwall Insight had previously predicted the cap would fall even further to £1,463.

Markets were spooked late last year when the war in Gaza hit Israel's gas fields, reducing output to Egypt where it is processed into liquefied natural gas (LNG) and impacting supply.

Cornwall Insight said disruptions to the Balticconnector pipeline between Finland and Estonia, and industrial action at gas production facilities in Australia were also affecting prices.

Ofgem's new cap means energy bills are the lowest they have been for two years.

Last year, a government-subsidised discount knocked £400 off every home's energy bills in the five months between November 2022 and March 2023.

But with this help no longer available and standing charges costing as much as £300 a year, some 7.2 million billpayers endured the most expensive winter on record, according to the Resolution Foundation think tank.

Here, The Telegraph covers what the energy price cap is, whether it's time to consider a fixed-term deal, and what you can do now to protect yourself from an energy price rise this winter.

The price cap limits what energy providers can charge customers on a ""standard variable tariff"". It does not apply to fixed-rate deals. Most households are currently on variable deals as providers were unable to offer competitive fixes throughout the energy crisis.

The cap is not a limit on the amount households will pay each year. The rate is based on usage - so use more, and you'll pay more.

The cap is determined by wholesale costs and is revised every three months. The price cap rose from a low of £1,042 in February 2020 to £1,971 in April 2022. As Russia's war in Ukraine intensified, driving up wholesale prices, the cap continued to rise - eventually reaching a peak of £4,279 in January 2023.

This prompted the Government to intervene in September 2022 by introducing the Energy Price Guarantee, a similar cap on energy bills that limited the average household bill to £2,500 a year regardless of the turmoil in the wholesale market.

From July, when the Ofgem-set price cap finally fell below the government-backed EPG, households on variable deals automatically reverted to the former.

It is important to understand the price cap does not limit the amount you will pay over the course of a year. The amount of energy a typical household uses in one year is known as the typical domestic consumption value (TDCV) - and the headline figure of £1,690 is simply how much the TDCV costs under current market rates.

The cap simply fixes the rates at which you are charged for your gas and electricity usage, as well as the standing charges for both.

Standing charges are billed to households at a daily rate regardless of how much energy they use - and these will remain unchanged so that households pay roughly £6.40 a week, or £334 a year for a house using electricity and gas.

From July 1 to September 31, the unit rate for electricity will fall from 24.50p to 22.36p per kWh. Gas will fall from 6.04p to 5.48p per kWh.

In short, your electrical appliances will cost around 9pc less to run from April than they do now, and your heating (if gas) will also cost around 9pc less.

To take an example of how the price cap affects your own usage, an electric kettle of water costs around 4p to boil under the April price cap.

The average Briton drinks 884 cups of tea a year, according to a 2015 YouGov survey, meaning if you were to boil a fresh kettle of water for every cup, that would cost you £35.36. Under the July cap, which lasts from July 1 to September 31, this will cost you £32.20 a year - saving you £3.16, although costs can vary slightly depending on the power use of your kettle.

Electric showers will cost 16p for every five minutes, or £1.15 a week, assuming one shower a day - this doubles to £2.29 for 10-minute showers. A family of four doing this would rack up £9.17 a week on showers alone.

Under the July cap, washing machines, tumble dryers and dishwashers will remain expensive despite falling rates. A typical eco cycle on a fully loaded washing machine will cost 28p - and a 90-minute cycle on a washing machine will cost 96p - and an hour's ironing costs 33p on top of that.

One full cycle on a tumble dryer with a full load will cost £1.06 under new rates, while an eco cycle on a dishwasher will cost 20p, according to Citizens Advice.

Though bills are typically lower in summer regardless, the price cap is forecast to rise again in October, making this an ideal time to sort out your home's energy efficiency if you haven't already.

There are some simple things you can do now to stand you in better stead for when temperatures drop.

Getting your boiler serviced once a year is a good way to make sure it's running as efficiently as possible. Many people won't be thinking much about their boilers during the summer months, but it can be a good time to book a service - some engineers may be less busy, and may even offer ""off-peak"" prices.

What's more, if something is found to be wrong with your boiler, you won't need to worry about bringing in energy-guzzling electric heaters should you need to switch it off for repairs.

A quarter of heat is lost through the roof of an uninsulated home, whether you live in a tiny cottage or a sprawling mansion. Installing loft insulation only costs between £400 and £1,200 for the average house and should pay for itself many times over in its 40-year lifetime, something well worth considering while bills remain high.

Before the energy crisis, households were used to shopping around for competitive fixed-price deals.

However, the energy crisis upended the market, leaving variable rates governed by the price cap as the only viable option. Fixed rates became so expensive that providers stopped offering them altogether.

However, as wholesale prices have cooled, a number of fixed-rate deals have come on the market after years of being unavailable.

Myron Jobson, of analyst Interactive Investor said: ""The fall in energy bills could prompt a much-needed return of decent competition in the energy market, with competitive fixed-price deals overdue for a comeback.

""However, suppliers might not be in a rush to offer more competitive deals, and any return of competition to the market is likely to be slow.""

Gareth Kloet, of comparison site GoCompare, said the change in price cap was a good opportunity for households to assess whether they were paying a competitive rate for their power use.

He said: ""If you are thinking about switching your energy deal, consider whether you will have to pay any early exit fees if you leave before your current deal is up. Looking at all of your options on a comparison site is an effective way to see which options are available to you at the moment.""

Energy providers have ramped up exit fees in recent years, meaning that a household looking to ditch an unfavourable rate will likely pay £150 - £75 per fuel.

Several providers have introduced fixed rates that are significantly cheaper than the current cap, but such fixes may end up costing consumers more in the long run.

Will Owen, Uswitch energy expert, said: ""If you'd prefer to avoid the uncertainty of rising costs in winter, now is a good time to think about taking a fixed energy deal, which would let you lock in rates while prices are cheaper.

""Fixed energy tariffs are the cheapest they've been since summer 2021 and there are some great value deals currently worth considering.""

Proponents of fixed-rate deals argue they offer long-term security, as unlike variable tariffs they cannot change throughout the duration of the deal. This could shield households from shocks in the wholesale market.

Analysts across the sector predict the cap will rise again when it is reviewed in October, meaning consumers who lock in at rates comparable to the current cap may end up saving money in the long run.

Dr Craig Lowrey, of Cornwall Insight, added: ""This further reduction in the price cap is a welcome relief for consumers after a challenging period of high energy costs. However, the anticipated rise in bills as we move into the winter months, emphasises the continued volatility of the market and the importance of providing protection for vulnerable households.

""It is clear the cap in its current form is not going to bring down bills to pre-crisis levels. However, while the general election is likely to put a halt to any immediate reforms to household energy bills, parties may use this opportunity to highlight how they intend to approach this challenge in the future.""",finance.yahoo.com,news,Yahoo!

This is a saving of £122 over the course of a year - or around £10 a month - the energy regulator said - meaning households can expect to pay significantly less for their energy this summer. It is around £500 less than its level in July last year when it was £2,074.

The fall was attributed to a significant decline in wholesale energy costs since mid-November. However the drop in prices was less than experts had hoped: analyst Cornwall Insight had previously predicted the cap would fall even further to £1,463.

Markets were spooked late last year when the war in Gaza hit Israel's gas fields, reducing output to Egypt where it is processed into liquefied natural gas (LNG) and impacting supply.

Cornwall Insight said disruptions to the Balticconnector pipeline between Finland and Estonia, and industrial action at gas production facilities in Australia were also affecting prices.

Ofgem's new cap means energy bills are the lowest they have been for two years.

Last year, a government-subsidised discount knocked £400 off every home's energy bills in the five months between November 2022 and March 2023.

But with this help no longer available and standing charges costing as much as £300 a year, some 7.2 million billpayers endured the most expensive winter on record, according to the Resolution Foundation think tank.

Here, The Telegraph covers what the energy price cap is, whether it's time to consider a fixed-term deal, and what you can do now to protect yourself from an energy price rise this winter.

What is the energy price cap?

The price cap limits what energy providers can charge customers on a ""standard variable tariff"". It does not apply to fixed-rate deals. Most households are currently on variable deals as providers were unable to offer competitive fixes throughout the energy crisis.

The cap is not a limit on the amount households will pay each year. The rate is based on usage - so use more, and you'll pay more.

The cap is determined by wholesale costs and is revised every three months. The price cap rose from a low of £1,042 in February 2020 to £1,971 in April 2022. As Russia's war in Ukraine intensified, driving up wholesale prices, the cap continued to rise - eventually reaching a peak of £4,279 in January 2023.

This prompted the Government to intervene in September 2022 by introducing the Energy Price Guarantee, a similar cap on energy bills that limited the average household bill to £2,500 a year regardless of the turmoil in the wholesale market.

From July, when the Ofgem-set price cap finally fell below the government-backed EPG, households on variable deals automatically reverted to the former.

It is important to understand the price cap does not limit the amount you will pay over the course of a year. The amount of energy a typical household uses in one year is known as the typical domestic consumption value (TDCV) - and the headline figure of £1,690 is simply how much the TDCV costs under current market rates.

The cap simply fixes the rates at which you are charged for your gas and electricity usage, as well as the standing charges for both.

Standing charges are billed to households at a daily rate regardless of how much energy they use - and these will remain unchanged so that households pay roughly £6.40 a week, or £334 a year for a house using electricity and gas.

How much will I save when prices go down?

From July 1 to September 31, the unit rate for electricity will fall from 24.50p to 22.36p per kWh. Gas will fall from 6.04p to 5.48p per kWh.

In short, your electrical appliances will cost around 9pc less to run from April than they do now, and your heating (if gas) will also cost around 9pc less.

To take an example of how the price cap affects your own usage, an electric kettle of water costs around 4p to boil under the April price cap.

The average Briton drinks 884 cups of tea a year, according to a 2015 YouGov survey, meaning if you were to boil a fresh kettle of water for every cup, that would cost you £35.36. Under the July cap, which lasts from July 1 to September 31, this will cost you £32.20 a year - saving you £3.16, although costs can vary slightly depending on the power use of your kettle.

Electric showers will cost 16p for every five minutes, or £1.15 a week, assuming one shower a day - this doubles to £2.29 for 10-minute showers. A family of four doing this would rack up £9.17 a week on showers alone.

Under the July cap, washing machines, tumble dryers and dishwashers will remain expensive despite falling rates. A typical eco cycle on a fully loaded washing machine will cost 28p - and a 90-minute cycle on a washing machine will cost 96p - and an hour's ironing costs 33p on top of that.

One full cycle on a tumble dryer with a full load will cost £1.06 under new rates, while an eco cycle on a dishwasher will cost 20p, according to Citizens Advice.

Easy ways to save money on energy bills

Though bills are typically lower in summer regardless, the price cap is forecast to rise again in October, making this an ideal time to sort out your home's energy efficiency if you haven't already.

There are some simple things you can do now to stand you in better stead for when temperatures drop.

Get your boiler serviced

Getting your boiler serviced once a year is a good way to make sure it's running as efficiently as possible. Many people won't be thinking much about their boilers during the summer months, but it can be a good time to book a service - some engineers may be less busy, and may even offer ""off-peak"" prices.

What's more, if something is found to be wrong with your boiler, you won't need to worry about bringing in energy-guzzling electric heaters should you need to switch it off for repairs.

Sort your insulation

A quarter of heat is lost through the roof of an uninsulated home, whether you live in a tiny cottage or a sprawling mansion. Installing loft insulation only costs between £400 and £1,200 for the average house and should pay for itself many times over in its 40-year lifetime, something well worth considering while bills remain high.

Should I buy a fixed-tariff deal?

Before the energy crisis, households were used to shopping around for competitive fixed-price deals.

However, the energy crisis upended the market, leaving variable rates governed by the price cap as the only viable option. Fixed rates became so expensive that providers stopped offering them altogether.

However, as wholesale prices have cooled, a number of fixed-rate deals have come on the market after years of being unavailable.

Myron Jobson, of analyst Interactive Investor said: ""The fall in energy bills could prompt a much-needed return of decent competition in the energy market, with competitive fixed-price deals overdue for a comeback.

""However, suppliers might not be in a rush to offer more competitive deals, and any return of competition to the market is likely to be slow.""

Gareth Kloet, of comparison site GoCompare, said the change in price cap was a good opportunity for households to assess whether they were paying a competitive rate for their power use.

He said: ""If you are thinking about switching your energy deal, consider whether you will have to pay any early exit fees if you leave before your current deal is up. Looking at all of your options on a comparison site is an effective way to see which options are available to you at the moment.""

As the joint initiative just turned two, the European Commission released country reports tracking progress.

Diversifying the EU's energy supplies, speeding up the green transition and improving the bloc's energy security are the goals of the REPowerEU plan which celebrated its two-year anniversary recently.

On Tuesday, EU ministers gave final approval to the electricity market reform - also geared towards improving the bloc's energy security. The reform further promotes the expansion of renewable energies and should better protect consumers from escalating electricity prices in the future.

Two years of REPowerEU

Faced with the difficulties and disruptions in the global energy market caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the European Commission launched the REPowerEU plan in May 2022. The plan foresees energy saving goals, the production of clean energy and the diversification of energy supplies - and ultimately ending the dependency on Russian fossil fuels.

Since the adoption of the REPowerEU plan, the EU has successfully reduced gas supplies from Russia. The share of gas from Russia - by pipeline and Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) - made up 45 percent of all imported gas in 2021, but only 15 percent in 2023. The Union replaced it with gas from other third countries. Norway and the USA have become the largest gas suppliers.

Seaborne imports of Russian crude oil, refined petroleum products and Russian coal imports have been banned through EU sanctions.

Natural gas consumption: How much did member states reduce?

In 27 country reports released for the two-year anniversary of REPowerEU, the European Commission compiled member states' performances between August 2022 and January 2024. Each country report includes a country-specific analysis on a range of points, for example on the key energy figures, diversification of energy supplies, energy price developments or the natural gas demand reduction.

The EU countries had agreed on a voluntary 15 percent reduction target of natural gas consumption and almost all countries have managed to lower their gas consumption. On EU level, the countries achieved a decrease of 18 percent.

21 countries lowered their gas consumption even further than the agreed-upon reduction target, including Denmark (-40%), Finland (-39%), Latvia (-30%), Sweden (-29%), Lithuania (-29%), Estonia (-28%), the Netherlands (-27%), Luxembourg (-26%), Portugal (-23%), Slovakia (-22%), France (-20%), Romania (-19%), Austria (-19%), Hungary (-18%) and Bulgaria (-18%), Italy (-17%), Croatia (-17%), Czechia (-17%), Greece (-16%), Germany (-16%) and Belgium (-16%).

According to the European Commission's data, only five countries did not meet the 15 percent reduction target. Among those are Spain (-12%), Slovenia (-10%), Poland (-8%), Ireland (-4%) and Malta, the only country which increased its gas consumption by ten percent. According to the report, Cyprus does not use natural gas.

Slovenia: Cutting down on consumption, but still reliant on Russian gas

In the case of Slovenia, the REPowerEU report pointed out that while the country 'has taken measures to strengthen alternative supplies of natural gas', it 'effectively remains reliant on Russian gas imported through Austria'.

Data by the Slovenian Energy Agency shows that in 2023 Slovenia imported 68.3 percent of gas from Austria and 28.3 percent from Algeria, through Italy. The agency cannot say with certainty how much of the gas imported from Austria is of Russian origin.

Even though gas importers have not had direct contracts for supply of gas from Russia for 2023 or 2024, the Energy Agency believes that the share of Russian gas was still predominant both in 2023 and in the first part of 2024.

Moving forward on renewables with room for improvement

The EU and its member states are continuously working towards becoming more sustainable and less reliant on fossil fuels. What have countries achieved so far?

In 2023, according to the European Commission, Portugal for example installed around 1.3 gigawatts of renewable electricity capacity, bringing the total to 18.4 gigawatts - in comparison to 5.1 gigawatts in 2021. Additionally, the annual growth rate of installed renewable energy capacity increased to 7.6 percent compared to 6.1 percent in 2021. However, the country's energy mix still included 69 percent fossil fuels in 2022.

Neighbouring Spain accelerated its transition towards a decarbonised energy system. According to Spanish grid operator Red Electrica, renewables accounted for 65.2 percent of the Spanish electricity mix in March - an all-time high. Still, the REPowerEU Spain report states that fossil fuels continue to play a central role in the country's energy system, representing 70.1 percent of primary energy imported in 2021.

Croatia quickly deduced its dependence on Russian gas imports by increasing its own production and intensifying the use of the existing LNG terminal. However, Croatia is still highly dependent on energy imports from countries outside the EU. Fossil fuels also continue to play an important role in Croatia's energy mix, as they accounted for 72 percent of gross available energy in 2022.

Moving into a greener direction, the country could soon start to produce green hydrogen: INA, the leading Croatian oil and gas company, recently signed two contracts related to renewable energy projects - one for the production of green hydrogen and the other for a bio-methane production facility. The completion of the construction of both plants is expected in 2026. The green hydrogen project, together with its solar plant and logistic capacity, will be co-financed via the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF).

The EU's RRF is a tool providing grants and loans to support reforms and investments in member states. It should, among other things, help member states become more sustainable, boost progress with the green and digital transition and achieve the EU target of climate neutrality by 2050.

...just hang on for a year

In Bulgaria, one of the major national energy reforms has been postponed by a year, which means the artificial maintenance of coal capacity will remain for at least another twelve months. This, in turn, could lead to the country not receiving the expected 1.3 billion BNG (around 665.15 million Euro) under the Bulgarian National Recovery and Resilience Plan which is funded under the EU's RFF. The energy reform is a mandatory requirement.

While Bulgarian MPs justified this citing a lack of readiness to switch from a regulated to a free electricity market or funds, several media outlets and experts attributed the decision mostly to pre-election populism.

A reformed energy market for security and a green future

This week, the electricity market reform took its final hurdle after representatives from EU member states and the European Parliament had signed off on the market reforms last December.

Belgium's Energy Minister Tinne Van der Straeten described the day as a 'milestone for the EU' on the path to a carbon-free and greener future. 'By adopting the electricity market reform, we are empowering consumers, ensuring security of supply and paving the way for a more stable, predictable and sustainable energy market.'

New long-term contracts between governments and electricity producers, under which the state would chip in if the market price drops below an agreed price, are central to the reform efforts.This is meant to incentivise domestic green and nuclear power production by ensuring a return on investments.

It also protects consumers who, in the future, have the right to both fixed-price contracts and contracts with dynamic prices. This would allow consumers to opt for both secure, long-term prices and contracts with changing prices if they want to take advantage of price fluctuations - for example, to use electricity when it is cheaper for charging electric cars or for heat pumps.

How does the electricity market work?

The electricity market in the EU works according to the merit-order principle, defining the order in which power plants connected to the electricity exchange are used to deliver energy and to determine the market price.

Those that can produce electricity at relatively low marginal cost, like wind farms, are used first to cover demand. But as demand rises beyond those initial sources' capabilities, higher marginal cost sources are used.

The final price therefore depends on which sources need to be used to meet demand, as well as fluctuations in the costs of using those sources. For example, a surge in natural gas prices raises the cost of using gas-fired power plants. (AGERPRES: RO - editors: Mariana Ionescu, Cristina Zaharia)

Taking into account the fact that Moldovan President M. Sandu previously proposed holding a referendum simultaneously with the presidential elections, the topic of European integration actually took center stage on the electoral agenda, dividing potential candidates for the presidency into supporters and opponents of rapprochement with the EU. In the context of the Transnistrian conflict, as well as the ongoing war in Ukraine, the results of the presidential elections in the Republic of Moldova will have a strategic impact on determining the course of the future development of the Republic of Moldova, including the issue of preserving the territorial integrity of the state.

Unstable Leadership

In November 2020, Maia Sandu was elected to the post of President of the Republic of Moldova. The head of state received a record 57.75% of the votes. This success was largely due to a number of factors. The first, M. Sandu's main competitor, Igor Dodon, spoiled relations with his former political allies, who had serious political influence in society. We are talking, first of all, about Renato Usatîi, the leader of ""Our Party,"" (Nasha Partia) who took 3rd place in the first round of the 2020 elections and called on his supporters to vote for M. Sandu in the second round. Second, the key theses of M. Sandu's election program were the fight against corruption, justice reform and de-oligarchization of the state. Third, M. Sandu made proposals for developing relations with both the European Union and Russia. Thus, she managed to attract many Russian-speaking citizens of the Republic of Moldova to her side. Fourth, an innovative approach in M. Sandu's campaign was the massive participation in voting of the Moldovan diaspora, whose votes turned out to be decisive for victory in the second round of elections.

An unprecedented credit of trust from citizens, as well as the support of European and American partners, allowed M. Sandu to achieve the dissolution of parliament and the calling of early elections in April 2021. As a result of the new election campaign on July 11, 2021, the pro-presidential PAS party won 63 out of 101 seats in parliament. This balance of power allowed PAS to independently pass bills and appoint a prime minister. Thus, as a result of the 2019-2020 elections, the full extent of executive and legislative power was concentrated in the hands of M. Sandu. The concentration of real political power in the hands of the president created the preconditions for the implementation of election promises and reforms. However, despite serious experience in opposition activities, most members of M. Sandu's team did not have sufficient administrative experience in government. For example, since the removal of the Prosecutor General of Moldova, Alexandru Stoianoglo, from office in October 2021, the authorities have not been able to elect a new prosecutor general to this day. The very removal from office of A. Stoianoglo was declared illegal on October 24, 2023 by a decision of the ECHR.

A serious miscalculation of the Moldovan Government was the revision in October 2021 of the gas payment formula when concluding a new contract with Gazprom JSC. The head of the Moldovan delegation, Andrei Spinu, insisted on new conditions for signing the agreement. However, changes in the gas payment formula, as well as an increase in gas prices on the European market during this period, resulted in a doubling of the final cost for Moldovan citizens. These and other management mistakes of M. Sandu's team allowed the opposition to move on to harsh criticism of the president, as well as to mass protests demanding new early parliamentary elections. Thus, at the beginning of January 2022, Sandu's political prospects for re-election were assessed as insignificant. The party in power looked confused, and Galva of the state itself could simply disappear from the information space for several weeks.

Consolidating political leadership

February 24, 2022 was a turning point not only for Ukraine, but also for President Maia Sandu personally. In the first weeks of the war, the leadership of Moldova was afraid of the advance of the Russian army in the south and the amphibious landing operation with the aim of capturing Odessa and thereby reaching the borders of Moldova. The withdrawal of Russian troops from the territory of the Kyiv region and the removal of the threat around Odessa allowed M. Sandu to seize control of the political situation in the country. Widespread international support for Ukraine, the arrival of US Secretary of State A. Blinken in Chisinau on March 6, 2022, as well as the holding of the second European Summit in Moldova on June 1, 2023, helped M. Sandu completely shift the focus of public attention from internal problems to external challenges and tasks. From that moment on, difficulties in the state's economy were interpreted as a consequence of the war on the territory of Ukraine, or the result of hybrid Russian attacks on Moldova.

Moreover, it was the war in Ukraine that became the most suitable reason for M. Sandu's team to clear Moldova's information space from Russian influence, which has traditionally supported political and public organizations in Moldova that advocate strategic relations with Russia. To solve this and other problems, the Parliament of Moldova decided to introduce a state of emergency, which was in force in the country from February 2022 to December 30, 2023. During this period of time, at the request of the SIS (Moldovan intelligence service) in October 2023, the authorities closed six television channels and 22 Internet portals. They refused to supply Russian gas (with the exception of gas for Transnistria). In August 2023, Chisinau expelled 22 employees of the Russian embassy, and in June 2023, the Constitutional Court banned the activities of the political party SHOR. The result of these efforts was the adoption by Parliament in December 2023 of a new National Security Strategy of the Republic of Moldova, in which Russia is listed as one of the two main threats to the Moldovan state. It was simply impossible to imagine such a situation two years ago. Along with an active anti-Russian policy, the war in Ukraine became a decisive factor for Moldova receiving EU candidate status in June 2023, as well as the EU decision in December 2023 to begin negotiations with Moldova on accession to the European Community.

At the same time, successes in foreign policy, as well as serious European financial assistance, could not fully compensate for the failures of M. Sandu's team in domestic economic policy. New mass opposition rallies, rising prices for electricity, gas and food have become a serious reason for the disappointment of Moldovan citizens in the policies of the Moldovan president. This negative trend was confirmed by the results of local elections in November 2023. Despite all the administrative resources and media control, PAS mayoral candidates were unable to win the elections not only in Chisinau, they lost in all major cities of the country. This failure was partially offset by the victory of PAS representatives in 19 of the 32 district councils. Thus, the unsatisfactory results in the local elections became a clear signal that M. Sandu needs to look for new approaches to achieve victory in the next presidential elections in 2024.

Sandu's victory in the first round as a super task

On December 24, 2023, in her television address, President M. Sandu announced that she would participate in the presidential elections, and also proposed holding a referendum on Moldova's accession to the European Union. Despite the fact that the idea of European integration is supported by the majority of Moldovan citizens, M. Sandu's initiative was criticized both by the opposition and pro-European parties. The main argument used by critics of this idea was that the EU referendum should not be linked to ongoing election campaigns, where citizens vote for different candidates. In this case, the topic of European integration becomes key in the election campaign of the current president. In this regard, there are high chances that M. Sandu's opponents will vote against Moldova's accession to the EU, although in general they support the idea of European integration. Sociological research on this issue indicates that society is divided into approximately two equal parts on the question of whether presidential elections and a referendum should be held on the same day.

Despite the controversial nature of this initiative, Maia Sandu herself enjoys a very high level of trust among the citizens six months before the elections; none of the leaders of the opposition parties managed to catch up with the Moldovan president in terms of trust rating in four years. However, this does not mean that the Moldovan opposition has no chance of winning the presidential election campaign. An analysis of various sociological studies shows that when the opposition unites and a single candidate is nominated, there are real opportunities for the opposition candidate to win. M. Sandu's team is well aware of the existing risks and will make every effort to ensure that their candidate wins in the first round. It is from this point of view that we can consider the introduction on April 27, 2024 of a form of postal voting for the diaspora living in the USA, Canada, Norway, Sweden, Finland and Iceland. It is also obvious that the US Democratic Party, as a strategic partner of M. Sandu, will provide serious methodological advice on organizing voting by mail, since it is in this form of voting that Democrats are traditionally strong in the United States.

At the moment, the leading opposition parties: the Socialist Party (PSRM), the Communist Party (PCRM), the Chance Party, which is controlled by businessman Ilan Shor, cannot agree on a single candidate for the upcoming elections. As Irina Vlah, ex-head of the Gagauz autonomy and leader of the opposition movement ""Platforma Moldova"", said, the opposition will support any candidate who makes it to the second round of elections together with M. Sandu. How realistic such a scenario is, remains an open question, since the former President of Moldova, Igor Dodon, who has the highest rating among opposition actors, has failed to become a consolidating political figure for the Moldovan opposition.

Geopolitical dimension of the elections

Since the signing of the Ceasefire Agreement in the Transnistrian region in June 1992, as well as the adoption of the Constitution in 1994, which established the constitutional principle of neutrality, a unique balance of military-political forces has developed on the territory of the Republic of Moldova, influencing the socio-economic situation in republic. On the one hand, Russia traditionally has a strong influence in Transnistria, Gagauzia and the north of Moldova, on the other hand, the EU and the USA, and the role of Romania must be highlighted separately, are systematically pursuing a course to promote Moldova along the European path of development.

The war in Ukraine, as well as the idea of holding a referendum on Moldova's accession to the EU, have seriously aggravated contradictions in Moldovan society on key issues of the country's development. In particular, on the prospects for cooperation with Russia, on strengthening military-political interaction with NATO, on the problem of closing the media and censorship issues. It should be noted that the upcoming referendum on Moldova's accession to the EU is of a constitutional nature. If citizens support the idea of Moldova joining the EU, the principle of European integration will be enshrined in the Constitution of Moldova and will have a priority status over national legislation. In turn, this may increase political tension between Tiraspol and Chisinau in the context of the settlement of the Transnistrian conflict. Since in 2006, Transnistria held its own referendum, in which 98% of citizens spoke in favor of independence and gradual entry into the Russian Federation. Serious concerns among experts in terms of escalation of the situation are caused by Bucharest's legislative initiative on the possibility of using the Romanian army to protect Romanian citizens. Taking into account the fact that about 600 thousand citizens of Moldova have Romanian citizenship, then formally, with an official request from Chisinau to Romania for military assistance, such military support can be provided. It is obvious that this kind of initiative can only be implemented in practice if the course of hostilities in Ukraine changes, and the new offensive of the Russian army to the Odesa region becomes possible.

In any case, no matter how the regional security situation develops, the battle for the presidency of the Republic of Moldova between Russia and the West will be intense. And the fact that this confrontation is taking place through political means gives hope that peace will continue to remain in Moldova.

The funding package comprises a new €15m Series B equity funding round led by the Finnish private equity fund Taaleri Bioindustry Fund I, with follow-on investments from existing shareholders Nordic Foodtech VC, Voima Ventures, and Valio.

This funding is complemented by the Finnish Climate Fund, which has extended a €7m junior loan to support the project and a €2m Climate and Environmental Loan provided by Finnvera. The capital raised comes on top of the previously reported €12m recycling and reuse investment grant from Business Finland, making the factory fully funded.

Set for completion by the end of 2025 and projected to cost €33m, the startup's new plant will convert food industry side-streams into Enifer's Pekilo fungi-based protein ingredients. At its core, the factory will harbor a full-sized industrial fermenter, standing more than 12 meters tall and measuring more than 4.5 meters in diameter, in which the mycoprotein is grown.

It will be built within an existing industrial building in Kantvik, Kirkkonummi, Finland. ""It's a brownfield site, but we're not tying into any particular feedstock there. We are leveraging the site for its existing infrastructure,"" Simo Ellilä, CEO and co-founder of Enifer, told FeedNavigator.

The site, bordering the Baltic Sea and only a 30-minute drive from Helsinki city center and Enifer's existing R&D facilities, offers all the required utilities, including steam, electricity, process and cooling water, and wastewater treatment.

Set to ramp up operations in 2026, the factory, once it is at full capacity, will produce 500 kilograms per hour of mycoprotein.

Target markets

Pet food will be a target market initially for the new facility, with aqua feed also potentially on the site's radar.

""The production costs will be relatively high so it makes sense to eventually target food production at this site. However, this project serves as a crucial demonstration of our technology. While we await the novel foods permit, our intention is to sell into the pet food market, where margins are higher than in aqua feed. Despite the higher production costs, we remain hopeful that we can make early commercial launches in health-oriented or starter salmon feeds from this first factory,"" continued Ellilä.

The Pekilo fermentation process was originally developed in Finland in the 1970s and used to upcycle forest industry side-streams into feed-grade mycoprotein. Enifer has breathed new life into the process, adapting it to new raw material streams from food and agricultural industries and developing a food-grade version of the mycoprotein ingredient.

The company will file for EU novel foods approval of the ingredient in 2024 and expects to receive approval during 2026.

Feedstocks

The startup's process can utilize a wide range of feedstocks: ""Once we switch to food production, lactose will become a critical feedstock raw material,"" outlined the CEO.

Valio, one of the backers of Enifer, is keen on upcycling its lactose into a food-grade product, which presents a solid business case, he said.

""However, during the initial years when we are producing feed-grade products, we will use several alternative feedstocks. Molasses is an obvious choice, but we are also evaluating diverse types of side-streams, and the final mix has not yet been decided.""

Joint venture facilities

Last year, Ellilä explained that for aqua feed production, the biotech company was exploring partnerships with third parties -- specifically operators in the bioethanol space -- through joint ventures or licensing deals. Bioethanol sites produce large volumes of stillage, a liquid waste remaining after ethanol distillation, which Enifer's process can valorize.

""The original plan was to scale via that route,"" the CEO said. ""But we encountered a few hurdles. One challenge is reaching a deal with these huge multinational biofuel companies. When you're a startup operating from a garage, even with a validated historical process, it's difficult to convince them to build a plant together.""

Additionally, investors expressed concerns about the scale-up plan relying on joint ventures or co-locating with these companies, he said.

""They questioned the reliability, asking, 'What if they turn off the tap?'

""For these reasons, we concluded that we need to build an intermediate-sized plant of our own to establish our independence. This approach allows us to stand on our own two feet before launching into joint ventures, which are still very much in progress. We are pursuing several joint venture facilities because they offer the right economics for aquaculture.""

Asked if Enifer has secured any offtake deals with pet food or feed players, Ellilä said: ""There's no solid offtake agreements, but we have many letters of intent that we expect to convert into binding contracts once the factory ramps up [in 2026].""",feednavigator.com,news,feednavigator.com,Jane Byrne,0.1764705882352942,454249950,13,https://www.feednavigator.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/publications/feed/feednavigator.com/news/r-d/protein-innovator-enifer-secures-36m-in-funding/17455693-1-eng-GB/Protein-innovator-Enifer-secures-36m-in-funding.jpg,eng-9591959

U.S. government gives EV makers two year reprieve on FEOC graphite for batteries. The U.S. Treasury and Internal Revenue Service have extended tax credits for electric vehicles containing Chinese graphite for another two years, allowing EV makers more flexibility to manufacture and sell vehicles that are eligible for the $7,500 tax credit...For determining qualifying critical mineral content for purposes of the critical minerals requirement, today's release provides a new test, the traced qualifying value add test. Under this test, manufacturers must conduct a detailed supply chain tracing to determine the actual value-added percentage for extraction, processing, and recycling. The actual percentage is used to determine the value for the applicable critical mineral that is qualifying. Manufacturers may continue to use the 50 percent roll up described in the proposed regulations as a transition rule until 2027...Friday's ruling will expand the timetable to use graphite and other critical minerals until 2027, giving EV makers much needed breathing room to locate other sources of critical minerals that do not fall within FEOC restrictions...Once the extension runs out in 2027, the limits on foreign-made components and minerals becomes increasingly more restrictive. By 2027, 80% of critical minerals and 80% of battery components must originate in the U.S. In 2028, 90% of battery components must come from the U.S., while in 2029 80% of critical minerals and 100% of battery components must be domestic.

Cobalt Market Update: Q1 2024 in Review. Cobalt supply ballooned in 2023, and the excess continued to weigh on prices in Q1 of this year...

""Our forecasting team estimates the cobalt oversupply to be around 12,400 tonnes in 2024."" The Benchmark team expects this surplus position to last into 2025... ""The EV market is set to take off further in the coming years, and critical components, like cobalt, will quickly see their demand rise much faster than the supply can match,"" said Aubry. ""By 2030, a significant supply gap will form, and if the market does not sufficiently adapt, we may see cobalt prices exceed the heights of 2022.""

Finland's defence posture has changed since the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, but there are key differences between the Finns' defence plans and those of their Baltic neighbours to the south.

The city centre of Lappeenranta lies only 20 kilometres from Finland's southeastern border with Russia. By car, that journey only takes about 20 minutes, placing the city in a potentially vulnerable position if Finland were to face a military threat from the east.

While the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania are building a chain of fortifications along their eastern borders to repel any possible Russian military incursion, Finland has no such plans to militarily reinforce its eastern border.

In Lappeenranta, people are relaxed about that plan.

""Yes, a frontline would form quite quickly if such a situation arose. The Finnish Defence Forces has also made agreements with landowners that fortifications could be built during peacetime,"" said Ari-Pekka Meuronen, the City of Lappeenranta's head of security and risk management.

Lappeenranta updated its contingency plans after Russia invaded Ukraine, but there are currently no indications of an immediate threat.

Evacuation plans have been discussed in recent times, and the Ministry of the Interior published new instructions in January. Updates to the plans are now being made in different parts of Finland.

""We have recently gone through the evacuation plans in detail. They have been refined and made more detailed,"" Meuronen said, adding that evacuation plans used to be broader in scope but they have now been updated at the level of villages and city districts.

Russia has hit power plants and electricity grids in Ukraine, a scenario for which Lappeenranta has made preliminary preparations.

""We have purchased large and small backup power plants and placed them in different parts of the city,"" Meuronen told Yle.

Baltics bolstering borders

Defence strategy and possible evacuations have been hot topics elsewhere on the EU's eastern border, as military defence is becoming an increasingly visible part of EU policy.

The EU has set up a European Defence Fund to support joint defence industrial projects between member states. Proposals for a new defence commissioner post at the EU have also gained traction.

The incoming European Parliament, to be elected in June, will have to make more decisions on EU defence policy.

In the Baltics, preparations aimed at thwarting any potential military attack are under way by building a chain of fortifications on the eastern border -- the Baltic Defence Line. The idea is to stop the enemy immediately at the border and not to let them go deeper into the country.

""This will give time to evacuate the civilian population and get allied reinforcements on the ground,"" explained Lukas Milevski, an associate professor of military policy at Leiden University in the Netherlands.

Poland also recently announced a major 2.5 billion euro programme for eastern border security, including the construction of fortifications on its eastern border with Belarus.

The importance of the EU's eastern border security was also underlined by the recent visit of European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen to Imatra on Finland's southeastern border.

Finland's defence preparedness

Finland's defensive strategy does not seek to stop the enemy in a fixed line immediately on the border. Instead, it would allow invading forces deeper into the country with a view to Finnish forces responding with a strategy of manoeuvre warfare, which focuses on being able to counterattack with rapid movements.

""The Finnish thinking has been to allow the enemy to advance a little inwards and then beat them back,"" military policy expert Lieutenant Colonel Juhani Pihlajamaa summarised.

In practice, this means that the defence must have depth and terrain on Finland's eastern border where defensive battles would be fought.

Finland's geography of dense forests is also better suited for this strategy than the relatively flat plains of the Baltics.

Separately, an unidentified aircraft was spotted flying along the Finnish-Russian border on the Russian side by the online flight monitoring service Flightradar24 on Thursday afternoon. The flight service showed the route of the plane, taking off and landing at a St Petersburg airport, but was not able to determine whether the plane was private or state-owned.",yle.fi,news,Yle.fi,,-0.05882352941176472,454245191,41,"https://images.cdn.yle.fi/image/upload/c_crop,x_0,y_447,w_4368,h_2457/w_1200,ar_1.91,c_fill/q_auto:eco,f_auto,fl_lossy/v1716545715/39-126866466167fd393f88",

To generate this isotope, the NPP carried out successful pilot irradiation of the starting substance. Before that, the plant obtained the corresponding generation license. A pilot batch preceding the start of production is a mandatory requirement.

Director of the Leningrad NPP, Vladimir Pereguda commented: ""Today, radiopharmaceuticals with samarium-153 are widely used in palliative care to relieve pain that occurs with bone metastases; as well as in traumatology in the case of chronic musculoskeletal diseases. Samarium-153 isotope treatment can make it possible to avoid opioid analgesic use, while also inhibiting the progression of bone metastases and ensuring a lasting pain relief.""

The current Rosatom project envisages the medical isotope production at the Kursk and Smolensk nuclear power plants following the Leningrad NPP.

Successful development of the project in Russia may help expand the geography of the production of radiopharmaceuticals with samarium-153 and other medical isotopes. This is also an important factor for Africa, as Rosatom has partnerships with foreign companies, including in medical development.

By gaining access to radioisotopes, countries on the continent can improve their healthcare systems. This helps increase the number of people who can receive the necessary medical care, and also improve the standard of living and life expectancy of local citizens.

Rosatom Power Division generates electrical and thermal energy at nuclear power plants.

Rosenergoatom JSC includes all 10 nuclear power plants in Russia (as the concern's branches), as well as the companies that support the generating company's activities. Currently, Russian NPPs account for about 19% of the total electricity generated in Russia.

Rosenergoatom JSC is capable of rhythmically producing molybdenum-99, iodine-131, lutetium-177, and samarium-153 at the power reactors of the Leningrad NPP, which are used in the diagnosis and treatment of various diseases; as well as radiation-doped silicon to meet the growing needs of the Russian electronics.

The Leningrad NPP (Sosnovy Bor, Leningrad region) boasts the largest installed capacity of all nuclear power plants in Russia, which is equal to 4400 MW. The plant is situated on the shore of the Gulf of Finland. It has two operative units with RBMK-1000 and two units with VVER-1200. After 45 years of operation, power units 1 and 2 with RBMK-1000 were shut down for decommissioning. Two VVER-1200 units replaced them being commissioned in 2018 and 2021. These have a design service life of 60 years with a 20-year extension possibility. Two more new power units, 7 and 8, with VVER-1200, are scheduled to be commissioned in 2030 and 2032, respectively. They will replace the capacities of units 3 and 4 with RBMK-1000. Each VVER-1200 power unit will annually produce more than 8.5 billion kWh of electricity. For more than 20 years, the plant has been generating isotopes used throughout the world. This is the first domestic NPP-producing isotope.

Isotope JSC is the industry integrator of Rosatom products sales and promotion, the official supplier of products of Rosatom Isotope Network to the global market, and a key supplier of the same to the domestic market. Isotope JSC has partnership relations with 170 foreign companies in 50 countries and about 600 companies in Russia, including health, manufacturing, and research facilities.

Field-specific departments and large Russian companies place great importance on the increase of healthcare level as well as its availability, which constitutes a significant factor in increasing the length and quality of life.

Scientists in Finland have unveiled a revolutionary new frontier in food production: harnessing the power of microbes and thin air.

This groundbreaking technology, spearheaded by the company Solar Foods, has the potential to transform the agricultural industry, ushering in an era of unparalleled sustainability and efficiency.

Solar Foods' groundbreaking technique centers on harnessing the metabolic prowess of single-cell microbes. These microscopic powerhouses, often bacteria or yeast, are cultivated in tightly controlled bioreactors.

Imagine a series of stainless steel tanks, meticulously monitored and adjusted to create the perfect environment for microbial growth. Inside these bioreactors, the microbes are bathed in a carefully formulated nutrient broth, a recipe constantly being refined to optimize both yield and nutritional content.

The magic, however, lies in the air. Unlike traditional agriculture reliant on sunshine and rain, Solar Foods' technology utilizes the very air we breathe.

Air, a seemingly unremarkable mixture of gases, is cleverly split using a process called electrolysis.

This separates the nitrogen and oxygen, providing the essential building blocks for the microbes to synthesize proteins. But the microbes need energy to perform this feat.

Here's where the magic truly unfolds. Solar Foods leverages renewable energy sources like solar or wind power to provide the electricity that fuels the microbes' growth. Through a fermentation process similar to what produces yogurt or beer, the microbes rapidly multiply, producing a protein-rich powder called Solein.

This unassuming powder boasts an impressive nutritional profile. Solein contains all nine essential amino acids, the building blocks of protein, making it a viable substitute for meat, dairy, and eggs.

It's also a good source of vitamins, minerals, and fiber, offering a complete and balanced nutritional package.

The environmental benefits of Solein production are truly revolutionary. Traditional livestock farming casts a long shadow on our planet.

Animals raised for food are major contributors to greenhouse gas emissions, with methane, a potent greenhouse gas, released through their digestive processes.

Additionally, deforestation to create grazing land further contributes to climate change. Solar Foods' technology disrupts this paradigm.

The production process requires minimal land and water, making it ideal for regions struggling with resource scarcity.

Deserts, once considered barren wastelands for food production, could potentially become hubs for Solein production.

Moreover, the bioreactors' reliance on renewable energy sources further minimizes the environmental footprint.

The development of air-based food presents a beacon of hope in the fight against global hunger. Solein's versatility and extended shelf life make it a perfect solution for areas with limited access to fresh produce.

Unlike fruits and vegetables, Solein doesn't spoil easily. It can be stored for long periods without refrigeration, making it ideal for transportation to remote areas or for stockpiling in case of emergencies.

Imagine humanitarian aid missions delivering not just basic staples but a complete and nutritious food source that can withstand harsh conditions.

The production process is also inherently scalable. Solar Foods' current production facility in Finland is a pilot plant, a stepping stone on the path to a more substantial future.

The company is already planning to build a much larger plant, exponentially increasing production capacity. This scalability is crucial for meeting the growing demand for food as the global population continues to rise.

Experts predict that the global population will reach 10 billion by 2050, placing immense pressure on our current food systems. Solein offers a potential solution, a way to ensure food security for generations to come.

Beyond its potential to address global hunger, Solein has the potential to revolutionize the food industry. The bland, beige powder might seem unappetizing at first glance.

Furthermore, Solein can be flavored and textured to mimic a variety of familiar foods. This could pave the way for a new generation of plant-based meat alternatives that are more realistic and appealing to consumers, potentially shifting dietary habits towards a more sustainable future.

Solar Foods is currently awaiting regulatory approval from the European Union to sell Solein commercially. This approval process is crucial, ensuring the safety and quality of this innovative food source.

However, with successful approval, this revolutionary technology has the potential to reshape our food systems, paving the way for a more sustainable and equitable future.

Air-based food may usher in an era where food security is no longer a distant dream, but a tangible reality, accessible to all corners of the globe.

The platform, developed by Solnet Group, allows commercial and solar utilities to join a collective pool of virtual power plants, enabling them to participate in balancing markets and offering greater grid stability. Companies participating in the VPP network receive compensation for being on standby and providing production flexibility.

Solar utilities and energy storage units can play a crucial role in grid balancing services, helping counteract the variability of renewable energy generation and generating extra income for participants, says the firm. ""Previously, such market opportunities were available only to large-scale energy consumers and producers, but now smaller commercial solar utilities and variable-capacity energy storage can also partake.""

Solnet Manager is launching first in Finland, with planned subsequent markets including the Netherlands and Germany.

""With the launch of Solnet Manager, we are addressing a crucial gap in virtual power plant participation for small and mid-scale installations,"" says Arttur Kulvik, SVP and co-founder of Solnet Group, who has been responsible for the development of Solnet Manager.

""This will bring a new era to solar PV and energy storage markets, as it makes onboarding variable-size utilities for balance market participation easy, cost-effective, and profitable. In doing so, they can become part of the solution for overcoming the volatile nature of renewable energy production and grid congestion issues, earning additional revenue while ensuring the optimal functioning of energy grids.

Livestock farming is one of the main culprits in greenhouse gas emissions, the primary cause of global warming.

Cellular agriculture, where food or nutrients are grown from cell cultures, is increasingly seen as a green alternative to animal agriculture.

Lab-grown meat, eggs and milk have made headlines in recent years, with scientists using animal cell cultures, a process some have criticized as unnatural, highly processed, energy-consuming and costly. But at Solar Foods' recently opened factory outside Helsinki, scientists are using new technology to grow protein out of cells using air and electricity.

By feeding a microbe with carbon dioxide, hydrogen and some minerals, and powering the process with electricity from renewable sources, the company has managed to create a protein-rich powder that can be used as a milk and egg substitute.

""We can source our main feedstock for the microbe from the air,"" Solar Foods chief executive Pasi Vainikka told AFP, as he gave a tour of the company's new facilities near Helsinki.

""We have started the production of the world's most sustainable protein.""

Founded by Vainikka and Juha-Pekka Pitkanen in 2017, Solar Foods launched the ""world's first factory growing food out of thin air"" in April.

""Much of the animal-like protein of today can actually be produced through cellular agriculture and we can let agricultural land re-wild and thereby build carbon stock,"" Vainikka said, referring to the process whereby forests and soil absorb and store carbon.

One kilo of the new protein, dubbed ""solein,"" emits 130 times less greenhouse gases than the same amount of protein produced by beef production in the European Union, a 2021 scientific study claimed.

Vainikka navigates his way through the factory's laboratory and into the control room, where a dozen people at computer screens monitor the production process.

Transforming food production and consumption is at the heart of combating the climate crisis and preventing biodiversity loss, according to Emilia Nordlund, head of industrial biotechnology and food research at the VTT Technical Research Center.

Yet current projections show the consumption of meat is expected to increase in coming years.

""Industrial food production, especially livestock production, is one of the biggest causes of greenhouse gas emissions and the biggest cause of biodiversity loss, eutrophication and freshwater usage,"" she said.

New food production technologies can help cut emissions and ""decentralise and diversify food production,"" Nordlund said.

""However, at the same time, we must improve the existing food production methods to make them more sustainable and resilient,"" she added.

Fermentation technology used to produce different nutrients, such as proteins, has been around for decades.

But the field has expanded significantly in recent years with new technological solutions and research projects emerging worldwide.

Some of the most active start-up hubs focusing on cellular agriculture are in the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands and Israel, Nordlund said.

""We are in a crucial phase as we will see which start-ups will survive,"" she said, adding that stalling bureaucracy was slowing cellular agriculture's take-off in the EU.

Dressed in protective gear to prevent bacteria contamination in the factory, Vainikka showed off a giant steel tank in a shiny production hall.

""This is a fermenter holding 20,000 liters,"" he said, explaining that the microbe multiplies inside the tank as it gets fed the greenhouse gas.

Liquid containing the microbes is continuously extracted from the tank to be processed into the yellowish protein-rich powder with a flavour described as ""nutty"" and ""creamy.""

""The fermenter produces the same amount of protein per day as 300 milking cows or 50,000 laying hens,"" Vainikka said.

That equals ""five million meals' worth of protein per year.""

For now, the main purpose of the small Finnish plant employing around 40 people is to ""prove that the technology scales"", so it can attract the necessary investments pending European regulatory approval.

While the protein has been cleared for sale in Singapore where some restaurants have used it to make ice cream, it is still awaiting classification as a food product in the EU and the United States.

To have any real impact, the aim is to ""build an industrial plant 100 times the size of this one,"" Vainikka said.",hurriyetdailynews.com,news,Hurriyet Daily News,,0.02745098039215677,454230432,9,https://image.hurimg.com/i/hurriyet/75/200x200/665035d05631c2d1bebf5ed1.jpg,

He could end up walking away with your mandate.

Riho Terras: It was not.

Other delegates told me that you looked quite worried on the plane ride over.

Terras: Perhaps I look worried when thinking about a lot of things. But this particular development hasn't really affected me. And I believe it is important for Isamaa to secure at least two seats in the European Parliament. Ratas' coming has increased that chance.

What would the situation be like were Jüri Ratas the frontrunner and you the number nine instead?

Terras: Had it happened, it would have deserved thinking about. As things are, I don't see much sense in analyzing it.

A good part of campaigning is already behind us. What would have been different for you had your places been reversed, Jüri Ratas?

Jüri Ratas: First of all, I did not join Isamaa to haggle over candidate list positions.

While I was not, I'm pretty sure this matter was discussed.

Ratas: What was discussed was how it was important for me to contribute to the European Parliament elections campaign, be on the list. The matter of where on the list did not come up. It was based on my values, and since my previous party and I grew apart, the way I was brought up was always very patriotic.

When you asked Riho about whether he's worried... This is not the first time we've worked together. We also worked well together when Riho was EDF commander and I served as prime minister. I remember when we went to Mali together for Operation Barkhane. So we've worked together in previous jobs. And I value Riho's European Parliament contribution greatly. He is surely a deserving frontrunner for Isamaa, and I completely agree with the good general in that Isamaa is making an effort today to land two seats.

In terms of what makes politicians worried, whether on a plane or when meeting people, is the state the Estonian economy finds itself in. The coping of the Estonian people. And our security situation in Europe.

Polls suggest you're both among favorites and have a good chance of making the European Parliament. Isamaa leader Urmas Reinsalu is also popular. Do you travel together or are you pursuing two totally different campaigns?

Terras: We do everything one does when campaigning, mainly go from place to place.

Do you do it separately or together?

Terras: We are a group, we also feature on some of the same posters, but we travel separately for greater efficiency.

I have to admit that the first concern people have today is security, followed by their financial situation. The government has put the Estonian economy on par with that of Yemen. We'll need to do something about it. Time will tell how this can be achieved.

Looking at the polls, Riho Terras, what has Jüri Ratas done to achieve such a spike in popularity?

Terras: He is simply very skilled in social media. I believe it benefits Isamaa a great deal when someone has such a knack for social media visibility. Ratas' success also rests on his clear messages.

Ratas: If I may comment in brief. First, as concerns the polls. I have been in politics for over 20 years. While politicians do keep an eye on ratings, they're like yesterday's news for me. Today, we need to work for the present and future. I agree with Riho in that we work for the same values and principles. The European Commission just finished its 2024 economic forecast for all 27 member states. And Estonia is, unfortunately, the only country there on course for recession at -0.5 percent. Isamaa sees that relevant domestic decisions could and should have been different.

In terms of what I've been doing, I was in Paide and Türi yesterday. People ask us to fight for them and improve their ability to cope. It is clear that €40 does not buy what it used to a year ago, and it can be put in European Parliament elections context.

Let's stay on you and your campaigns. My kids said yesterday that everywhere they look on social media, they see Jüri Ratas. Your social media presence is impressive. How much has it cost you? What's the ballpark? Are we talking about hundreds, thousands or tens of thousands of euros?

Ratas: To talk about social media advertising, there's more of it today than there was six months ago. But it's definitely not in the tens of thousands. All told, it's more than €1,000 by now, which needs to be declared. The news have also treated with how much Urmas Reinsalu and I have paid for social media advertising. I agree that social media is an important medium, but it has never been the main thing for me. The most important thing is meeting people in the flesh and really talking with them. People clearly over the age of 60 came up to me in Paide, Põltsamaa and Türi and told me that they keep up with me on social media and that I should keep it up. I think it's good when people get their information from various sources.

Riho Terras, how much have you spent and what is the budget?

Terras: The British say that you do not talk about money in civilized company. But I'm sure expenses reports will provide a clear picture of who spent how much and where. Meeting people is just as important in my book. For example, I visited with potato farmer and chairman of the Estonian Farmers Union Kalle Hamburg yesterday, spoke at the Kohila School. I'll head for Hiiumaa, Saaremaa and Muhumaa tomorrow. I've been to Valga and Võru. I meet a lot of people, a lot of farmers, and I listen to their concerns.

The farmers' problems are acute. Farmers in Estonia are impacted by Europe's green reforms. Domestic food production has become so expensive that food processors are closing shop one after the other. It cannot be sustainable in the long run. Food security is the most important thing after physical security, and life in rural areas is also a security matter. Life in Võru and Valga is part of security. These are the things I hear from people and can raise in the European Parliament, things I have and will continue to raise.

Permit me a question about a van before we wrap up the advertising topic. Driving down Pirita tee, I see Jüri Ratas' advertising van parked near the Memorial to Victims of Communism one morning and near Russalka the next. Who moves the van? Do you do it yourself or do you have help?

Ratas: I've moved the van several times, though I believe these images are from a few weeks ago. I have use of the van. It was in Jõgeva and Tartu counties yesterday and is in Tallinn today.

You drive it to Jõgeva and then to Rapla from there? Is that how it works?

Ratas: I had the van all to myself yesterday to attend meetings in Rapla. Next came Järva and Jõgeva counties and finally Tartu County.

It's up to the voter to decide who to send to Europe. You mentioned party leader Urmas Reinsalu. Every one of the nine people making up Isamaa's list, and they include men and women as well as political newcomers, and the party chairman are making an effort today. I've worked with Urmas Reinsalu as prime minister when he served as foreign minister and justice minister. But my greatest desire is for Estonia to get a new government and prime minister, and I believe Urmas Reinsalu deserves the latter office.

That will not be happening during the time of this Riigikogu.

Ratas: We need to face the facts and parliamentary mathematics that give the Reform Party 37 plus one seats today. And we're very unlikely to see a new prime minister come from any other party. That said, I do believe we will get a new prime minister in the coming months as Kaja Kallas will go after a job for herself during the next European Council meeting or the one after that. Which is how it should be.

At European Parliament elections, people vote based on one's experience and the ability to make it in Europe as well as reputation back home. I believe Isamaa has a lot of dignified candidates who meet these criteria.

Jüri Ratas has been an Isamaa member for a very short time. Riho Terras, who do you see voting for Jüri Ratas? Will he bring his former fans from his days at the Center Party with him, or will he take away some of your voters? Who is Ratas' voter?

Ratas: An Isamaa voter is Jüri Ratas' voter today. No matter who they are. Everyone on Isamaa's list are out there catching votes for the party. I've only been an Isamaa member for five years myself. Secondly, Jüri Ratas' years of experience have shaped his constituents. I would not look for agendas in terms of who is taking away whose votes.

Everyone must work to make sure Isamaa voters turn up to put the ruling coalition in its place, tell them what they're doing is wrong. For Isamaa to win this election and get two European Parliament seats where we can put our skills to use for Estonia.

In terms of mine... When I first joined the European Parliament, I decided to be less vocal on national defense as I had been in it for long years. I got up to speed with agriculture, worked in the Industry, Research and Energy Committee, which was very exciting, while also keeping up with the defense industry. Today, when there's war, my biggest strength is that I can explain to my colleagues, especially German colleagues in the European People's Party (EPP), which is the biggest group, what is really happening in Ukraine. I appear in German media, I've appeared on Germany's so-called public media talk shows in order to tell Germans - friends, there's war, and it's not just our war, it's everyone's war. That is what I can do and plan on doing moving forward.

Ratas: If I may add. I wholeheartedly agree with Riho and as an Isamaa candidate, seeing as voter turnout has traditionally been low [for European elections] and will be lower than for national elections also this time, please come out and support us!

Young people might not turn out to vote, and your supporters include quite a lot of young people.

Ratas: It's always difficult to say who one's supporters are. I think I've been in Estonian politics 23-24 years. I have supporters in different age groups. So I'm not afraid of appearing before working people, the elderly or young people. I believe or at least hope that I have supporters in all groups.

But what I wanted to say about domestic policy considerations. It's said that we shouldn't mix domestic policy and EU elections. But if we look at the Reform Party for a moment, when MEP Andrus Ansip (Reform) criticized government policy and Prime Minister Kaja Kallas (Reform), he was told off and will not be running in the elections. At the same time, Urmas Paet (Reform) has not criticized these policies and he tops Reform's list of candidates today. This shows that standing behind the candidates are the same political parties that are active in Estonia today, the ones in the coalition - the Reform Party, Social Democratic Party and Eesti 200.

Riho Terras, you are standing next to the person who signed the green transition agreement. Everything we're discussing, where to find money for LULUCF, all these other climate targets were agreed by Jüri Ratas as prime minister. You've been fighting against it in the European Parliament. How does that make you feel?

Terras: I completely disagree here. I've never fought it, and people who suggest I'm against a cleaner environment are putting words in my mouth. The agreements need to be complied with. What I oppose is using orders and planned economy measures to do it.

It was clear when the agreement was passed that it could only be done in the conditions of planned economy. Markets do not work so quickly as to allow us to achieve these things by 2035.

Terras: That is just not true. The U.S. has shown that it is possible to plot a green transition course by subsidizing modern technologies. Instead of ordering people to insulate their houses by a certain date. And then you realize that it would cost €25 billion for all 25,000 households affected to insulate their buildings, while the subsidy for it comes to a billion or less. We don't have enough money to do it.

Did Jüri Ratas do the right thing by signing the agreement pledging climate neutrality by 2050?

Terras: Yes, it needs to be our goal. Most definitely. You cannot hit ambitious goals without first setting them. But our methods of getting there must not create more red tape, resemble planned economy and lack effects analysis. It is obvious that the measures pushed through using the votes of social democrats and greens, including the Estonian Social Democrats, will not work. Such as banning internal combustion engines from 2035 or the energy performance directive in question. Or all this agricultural legislation. When I asked the social democrat responsible for this field in the committee whether effects have been analyzed, I was told that you cannot put on a revolution with effects analyses. It concerned the farm to fork strategy specifically. This shows that no one has crunched the numbers for how much it will cost us and what will be its impact on Europe's competitiveness.

Jüri Ratas, I'm sure you'll be asked why you decided to sign the agreement for many years to come.

Ratas: In short, it's because I thought it was the right thing to do. The EU would never have agreed on the 2050 target had all 27 member states not agreed in 2019. They did. We had the coalition government of Isamaa, EKRE and the Center Party at the time. Do I believe it is the right thing? Of course I do. And the steps we've agreed for 2030 are feasible for Estonia.

But from there, having a goal is not the same as being on an expressway to get absolutely everything done. On the contrary. Today, we must boldly say it when we do not agree with something. Take the renovation thing, which I've heard Riho talk about in interviews, is it important? I would say it's extremely important, while it must not be laid on the shoulders of residents and apartment associations. That is where we need to use our experience from the European Parliament, Commission and Council to say that Estonia needs support from the EU. While renovation of buildings will translate into smaller heating bills eventually, it is also important from the point of view of the environment. So I would not equate these goals with the so-called green frenzy. We need to come back from there and meet in the middle. The green frenzy cannot be allowed to shut down our economy and impact people's subsistence.

The main question for Estonia will be energy, electricity, its sources. It requires several things today. It requires a third energy link with Finland, the Estlink-3; we also need to work with TalTech and other universities toward carbon capture, which is already happening to some degree. But we also need courage for the government to move forward with the Paldiski pumped storage plant. We need a more versatile mix of energy.

Allow me to round out the environmental chapter with a major issue Riho has also pointed to - the sheer amount of bureaucracy coming from Europe, also for the agricultural sector. The new application round kicked off this Monday. It has been made so complicated, administrative. Fail to tick a single box and you can basically kiss your subsidies goodbye. Estonia must stand up for its principles also in this regard.

Let us also talk about Riho Terras' work. You've opposed the energy performance directive and failed to show up for the final vote.

Terras: No, because it was not necessary. It was nonsense forced on us from the first. Jana is talking nonsense. I was opposed to it all along. The EPP was largely opposed. We lost by a few votes. So it's all nonsense.

It is difficult for us to judge from Tallinn how active or successful you are over there [in the European Parliament]. But reports make for one quantifiable thing. And here Jana Toom is on top with 22 reports. Jaak Madison and Urmas Paet are signatories on around a dozen, while you only have three to your name.

Terras: I did a few at first, while I soon realized there was nothing there and decided to pick a different one. I spent a year and a half working on the pan-European electronic identity, I was involved with the artificial intelligence report as the EPP's deputy coordinator. It took a lot of energy. While Jana Toom may have a lot of reports, they are mostly on defending the rights of Russian citizens, which have almost no bearing on processes. There is also the fact that it is difficult to get important reports in large groups, you need to fight for them. We have 178 people who all want reports.

I secured a very important report in the defense industry roadmap as it is. I also had to collect so-called points and had agreements in place that I would be working on the report. But it arrived too late and will land in the new Parliament.

At the same time, I was closely involved with Ukraine. I've definitely written the most letters to the Commission, pointing to important topics for Estonia's and global security. Over 100 delegates have endorsed those letters. I'm in the support for Ukraine group, U.S. cooperation group. I also support Estonian hunters by being a member of the hunting group where I've had to do a lot of work. Those accusing me of not doing enough can just look at my track record.

I'm sure you didn't come here to pose as twin brothers who see eye to eye on everything. What are the fundamental differences between you? In tax policy, for example. Jüri Ratas has been a proponent of progressive income tax for years. Are you one too?

Terras: No.

What else? Jüri Ratas has been a member of the Center Party, and the Center Party has addressed the concerns of Russian-speaking people in Estonia. You have not. How else are you different?

Terras: I cannot say. Isamaa has agreed on a program for these European elections. The party and its nine candidates have all contributed to it. We all agree to these items.

I'm deeply convinced that taxation needs to be up to member states, and we shouldn't even discuss some of it moving into the hands of the EU, which is what the social democrats have repeatedly suggested. The liberals have also mentioned it. I cannot say to what extent we have differences in terms of the environment. From what I've heard here, they are not great. As concerns security, I believe we both understand that the war in Ukraine needs to be won. Europe's defensive ability needs to be such to ensure credible security should the worst happen and Ukraine lose the war. We must also consider what would happen were the U.S. to dial back its support. I refuse to believe the U.S. would quit NATO or give up defending Europe. But countries will be required to provide more input, more money. That is what we must work toward together.

Ratas: I gave this matter some thought. I was reminded of 2017. The Council was in Italy and it was the 60th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome. We had the chance to meet with leaders and the Pope, and the Pope also gave a speech. There were still 28 member states then, and the Pope said that while very different countries had come together, these differences coming together is the strength of the EU. We must find that consensus.

And yes, I do understand what you are trying to do as a journalist. You'd like to build a concrete wall between us. But I will tear it down. There can be no question, we are working for a common goal, which put briefly is for Estonia and the EU to have good politicians and policy, which is what I believe Isamaa offers through its candidates, values and program. You asked about tax policy. I've been saying for 23 years that taxes need to be collected where there's money, instead of taxing some people to death.

In Estonia today, when people can afford less, inflation is up, the economy is in recession for the third consecutive year, I believe there is nowhere for taxes to come from.

Terras: Especially as concerns the car tax.

Ratas: Meeting with people - [you hear about] the VAT hike, which used to be just 10 percent. The land tax hike, car tax, sugar tax - where are they? All of these things are hanging over our heads, and the coalition today is waiting to put the pedal to the metal [regarding these things] on June 10, just so you could ask our dear prime minister on the ""Esimene stuudio"" [debate show] why were these things not talked about, and she'll say it was because these are not popular topics.

What I mean to say is that it is important for Isamaa to do well at these elections. Why? Isamaa is a member of the largest political family in the European Union - the EPP. And this political family is bound to grow.

Our interest, as mentioned by the previous speaker, is that there are various aspects of security policy, which all need to be taken care of, and I see no differences here. Ursula von der Leyen has said that Ukraine needs to be supported for as long as it takes for them to win, and I believe it to be a strong statement, also considering her experience as Germany's defense minister. Through it, we can put the EU on a faster track in security and economic policy and competitiveness.

Thinking about where the differences may be, I have been more involved with social topics in the past. Perhaps that's the difference.

Who could take your place as deputy speaker should you be elected?

Ratas: Estonians are not in the habit of getting ahead of ourselves.

Terras: Turn out, Isamaa voters, as we need to send a message to the ruling coalition!",news.err.ee,news,ERR,Indrek Kiisler,0.1137254901960785,454225187,1,https://s.err.ee/photo/crop/2024/05/22/2407092h5dd6t24.jpg,

Digital infrastructure company Equinix aims to address these demands with a focus on sustainability-guided innovation, improving efficiency, increasing its use of renewable energy, optimising performance in its supply chain and reducing emissions.

Releasing its 2023 Integrated Sustainability Report, the company highlighted some key initiatives that it has undertaken to address such challenges.

To ensure consistent and reliable backup power, the company is trialling the use of hydrogenated vegetable oil (HVO). This initiative aims to achieve up to a 90% reduction in carbon emissions for their backup generators. Additionally, the company utilises liquid cooling to deliver high-density workloads like AI with the cooling they need while managing resource usage, including energy and water.

""Liquid cooling requires less energy than traditional air cooling, which helps us save energy while maintaining the performance of innovative technologies like AI for our customers,"" says Jason Plamondon, Senior Sustainability Manager, Asia-Pacific, Equinix.

The company collaborates with universities, government agencies and industry bodies to develop sustainable technologies, such as hydrogen fuel cells and software-defined power. ""Additionally, we set science-based targets to reduce operational emissions by 50% and engage 66% of suppliers to set their own targets by 2030. We also performed a pioneering retrofit project in Singapore, enhancing cooling efficiency with electronically commutated (EC) fans,"" he adds.

Plamondon reveals that the aim is achieve 100% renewable energy coverage by 2030 through a comprehensive strategy that includes power purchase agreements, energy attribute certificates and significant investments in energy efficiency. ""These agreements are expected to contribute over 3,000,000 megawatt hours (MWhs) of renewable energy annually to local grids across the US, Australia, France, Finland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and Singapore, once operational,"" he says.

In India, the firm has achieved 100% renewable energy coverage, a company spokesperson highlights.

Equinix's 2023 sustainability report also mentions significant achievements in climate action, renewable energy investment and social impact. ""We reduced Scope 1 and 2 operational emissions by 24% from our 2019 baseline and increased Scope 3 emissions coverage to 25% through supplier-set science-based targets from 17% to 25%, aiming for 66% by 2025,"" he states.

The company's climate impact reduction strategy includes reducing emissions throughout the value chain and engaging suppliers in emission reduction efforts. ""In 2023, our total energy consumption for APAC was 1,719 GWh, with renewable energy consumption at 1,349 GWh. Renewable energy coverage versus our electricity usage in APAC reached 81%,"" Plamondon adds.",economictimes.indiatimes.com,news,Economic Times,,0.2313725490196079,454223049,1,"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-110382688,width-1200,height-630,imgsize-68792,overlay-etrise/photo.jpg",eng-9584744

A global collective intelligence system on the future of S&T is needed to share advances in science and assess how to implement next technologies to the benefit of humanity. The speed of scientific breakthroughs and technological applications to improve the human condition is being accelerated by computational science and engineering, artificial intelligence, automated research workflows, common database protocols, Moore's law, and Nielsen's law of internet bandwidth (50% speed increase per year). Future synergies among synthetic biology, 3D/4D printing, artificial intelligence, robotics, atomically precise fabrication and other forms of nanotechnology, tele-everything, drones, augmented and virtual reality, falling costs of renewable energy, and collective intelligence systems will make the last 25 years seem slow compared with the next 25. Progress is being made with super conductivity, epigenomics, medical use of Bio3D printing, and understanding dark matter and the origins of the universe with the James Webb telescope.

China landed the Zhurong rover on Mars, demonstrated quantum entanglement between an orbital satellite and Earth, and created the first quantum communications network connecting local banks, municipal power grids, and e-government websites, and LEO to MEO-GEO quantum wide-area communication satellite network. The HP Laser Fusion 3D printer is changing what is possible in precision and complex manufacturing with 30,000 nozzles printing 340 million voxels per second. Artificial intelligence already diagnoses cancer better than doctors, robots outperform humans in many tasks, Google's AlphaZero learns faster without preprogramming data than AlphaGo, GPT-4 integrates AI for text, video, audio, and coding, and artificial general intelligence (AGI) could arrive in a few years. About 3 million industrial robots are in operation today and growing at 400,000 per year. South Korea has the most robots per capita, followed by Singapore, Japan, and Germany, while China has the most robots. Asia accounted for 73% of all newly deployed robots installed in 2022.

R&D spending and patent applications continue to increase: 116 countries spent $2.476 trillion on R&D 2022, an increase of 5.43% over 2022. WIPO received 278,100 international patent applications the largest per year. Asia led with 54.7% of the 2022 applications, up from 40.3% in 2012. Global R&D expenditures were 2.7% of world GDP in 2021 and averaged 4.7% annual growth between 2010 and 2020 (when adjusted for inflation), and dropped to 3% annual growth during pandemic 2020. South Korea, Taiwan, and Israel rank highest since 2000 in R&D annual growth expenditures, followed by the United States. As of 2021, Israel's R&D intensity (investment as a share of national economy) is the highest in the world.

The world's fastest computer is the USA's Frontier with 1.1 Exaflops/second, followed by Japan's Fugaku 442 petaflops, and Finland's LUMI with 375 petaflops and then USA's Summit and Sierra both from IBM, and then Sunway TaihuLight from China. Quantum computers are also progressing rapidly. IBM announced it will have a 1,000-qubit chip in 2023 and 1-million-qubit chip by 2030 (30 qubits allows for 10 trillion calculations per second; however, qubits and algorithms are not standardized making comparisons imprecise). Meanwhile Canada's D-Wave is exploring the coverage of quantum computing and machine learning to create quantum AI. Data storage in single molecules promises to increase data storage density by 100-fold. Future biological computing could use A, T, C and G (the four chemical bases that make up DNA) instead of ones and zeros.

By 2050 everyone could have access to cloud quantum/AI anywhere at any time to help experience the best use of one's time each moment. However, quantum computing also means that security codes are potentially vulnerable -- from hacking government military and intelligence systems affecting geopolitical stability to financial systems affecting social trust. The Internet-of-things (IoT) is forecast to include nearly 30 billion objects by 2030. Global civilization could become augmented by an integrated worldwide web of sensors and AI acting like a global machine getting more intelligent every moment. This means that tele-everything is potentially vulnerable -- from hacking driverless cars, planes, and ships to brain/computer interfaces and nanomedicine.

Robots are likely to permeate most of human life in the foreseeable future from repairing cells in our bodies to building space cities in orbit, on the moon, and Mars. Since robots will be increasingly managed by artificial intelligence (AI) and there are three kinds of AI: artificial narrow intelligence (ANI), artificial general intelligence (AGI), and artificial super intelligence (ASI), then three kinds of robots are possible: ANI/Robots, AGI/Robots, and ASI/Robots. And since they can scale from very small to very large, all three could eventually be found in our bodies and in outer space. The US military's X-37B space robot plane has been used for orbital missions since 2010. Robots will also be able to change their shapes and functions (transformers) moving from one situation to the next. Integration of self-learning AI, machine vision, and robots will accelerate their human-like presence. Materials science is developing self-healing and self-assembly materials and with laboratory automation and AI the time required for synthesis and testing of materials is being reduced from months to days. However S&T progress can be affected by data loss through digital obsolescence and link rot, along with mounting electricity demand for energy-intensive systems like AI, blockchain, and quantum computing.

E-waste pollution is growing worldwide, with the potential to poison groundwater. Nanoparticles and some small-scale pollutants like micro-plastics and organic insecticides might bio-accumulate in the body, causing health problems. As electric vehicles proliferate, disposal and recycling of batteries will become a more important environmental issue. The industrial and information ages produced more jobs than they eliminated; but the speed, capacity, synergies, scope, and global dynamics of the coming technological changes may make it different this time and lead to new-Luddite movements. Synthetic biology could be used in biowarfare and by terrorists with such new organisms escaping their environments, causing massive damage to nature. Solutions to the nanotech ""gray goo"" problem (endless self-replicating nano machines) are not yet convincing. Un-regulated future artificial general intelligence (AGI) could evolve into an artificial superintelligence beyond human control and understanding. Some science and philosophers think that AI is a natural next step in evolution.

In the meantime, computer-mediated elementary brain-to-brain communications have been demonstrated; Neuralink has US-FDA approval for human brain-computer implant research; autonomous (and semi-autonomous) robots have conducted surgery; AI has been used to erase painful memories; a single atom has been X-rayed; experiments with gene editing of gamete cells and human embryos have the potential for eliminating inherited diseases and tendencies to get contagious diseases; every neural connection has been mapped in a larval fruit fly; and there are AI-designed dynamic and bio-compatible both macro- and micro- devices through DNA and protein materials for health and other purposes. Epigenomics uses compounds that attach to DNA and modify its function (they do not change the sequence of the DNA but they change the way cells use the DNA's instructions). Genetic chimeras have been created: monkey embryos containing human cells lasted 19 days after fertilization. Stem cells are being used to repair tissue, potentially altering the aging process; and genetic code has been transmitted in digital form to print viruses, demonstrating the ability to teleport life forms to remote locations, even distant planets.

Smart structures are used to monitor deep surgical wounds; intelligent wearable devices utilize advanced materials and chips for temperature regulation, self-healing, energy production (solar energy and kinetic energy) and collection. Bio-mimetic materials are continuously moving towards intelligence and refinement both in researching and manufacturing processes. For example, organic-inorganic nacre-mimetic composites have shown great potential as lightweight load bearing structural materials for diverse engineering fields, such as bio-medicine, aerospace, military, and automotive industries. Higher temperature, lower pressure superconductivity is being achieved for conducting electricity, levitating trains, and improving electronics. Massive artificial photosynthesis is in development for new forms of energy and materials and to absorb atmospheric CO more efficiently than nature to help reverse climate change.

Private space tourism has begun, over 5,560 confirmed exoplanets have been found, upping the odds of future contact with extraterrestrial life, building blocks of life (methenium, CH3+ (and/or carbon cation, C+) detected in interstellar space, and the Webb telescope, 100 times more powerful than the Hubble, may let us see the beginnings of the universe. China's Chang'e-6 was launched to collect rocks on the far side of the Moon and NASA's Ingenuity helicopter has flown on Mars.

So, what else is next? New combinations and manipulations of genetic molecules and life forms will be developed to create the biological revolution, as new combinations of matter and energy created the industrial revolution. Atomically precise fabrication will build machines to revolutionize efficiency of physical production. Implantable biosensors in micro-robots in the body will diagnose and provide therapies while transmitting virtual reality imagery outside the body. Space elevators between Earth and orbit may give low-cost access to orbital space, and longer-range options for space travel are being explored, such as matter-antimatter reactions, fusion, ion drive, photonic propulsion, plasma ejection, and solar sails. However, over 670,000 pieces of debris (one centimeter in diameter or more) and more than 170 million pieces 1 mm or more traveling at 27,400 kilometers per hour (17,000 mph) are orbiting Earth, threatening future access to outer space.

The history of S&T demonstrates that advances can have unintended negative consequences as well as benefits. We need a global collective intelligence system to track S&T advances, forecast consequences, and document a range of views so that all can understand the potential consequences of new and possible future S&T, and from this develop policies that create incentives for S&T to address our global challenges. There is no global capacity for technology assessment. The world needs serious and systematic conversations about these issues. The UN plans a Summit of the Future September 2024, a Futures Lab, and to produce periodic strategic foresight and global risk reports. There are IEEE and ISO technology-related standards, but no comprehensive system to anticipate and manage what promises to be increasingly universal and explosive technological advances.

As a result of all these changes, and others not yet on the horizon, far more individuals will have far more access to far more powerful means to access more capacities worldwide at far lower costs with far less control by power elites than in the past. Unfortunately, there is little relationship between some of the accelerating advances in S&T and what is covered in the conventional news, discussed by politicians, taught in schools, or filling the public mind around the world",millennium-project.org,news,millennium-project.org,,0.5529411764705883,454221828,5,,

Pictures and video by Alessandro Rampazzo

At a factory in Finland, the ""farmers of the future"" are making a new food protein by feeding a microbe air and electricity, proving that protein can be produced without traditional agriculture.

Livestock farming is one of the main culprits in greenhouse gas emissions, the primary cause of global warming.

Cellular agriculture, where food or nutrients are grown from cell cultures, is increasingly seen as a green alternative to animal agriculture.

Lab-grown meat, eggs and milk have made headlines in recent years, with scientists using animal cell cultures -- a process some have criticised as unnatural, highly processed, energy-consuming and costly.

But at Solar Foods' recently opened factory outside Helsinki, scientists are using new technology to grow protein out of cells using air and electricity.

By feeding a microbe with carbon dioxide, hydrogen and some minerals, and powering the process with electricity from renewable sources, the company has managed to create a protein-rich powder that can be used as a milk and egg substitute.

""We can source our main feedstock for the microbe from the air,"" Solar Foods chief executive Pasi Vainikka told AFP, as he gave a tour of the company's new facilities near Helsinki.

""We have started the production of the world's most sustainable protein.""

Founded by Vainikka and Juha-Pekka Pitkanen in 2017, Solar Foods launched the ""world's first factory growing food out of thin air"" in April.

""Much of the animal-like protein of today can actually be produced through cellular agriculture and we can let agricultural land re-wild and thereby build carbon stock,"" Vainikka said, referring to the process whereby forests and soil absorb and store carbon.

One kilo of the new protein, dubbed ""solein"", emits 130 times less greenhouse gases than the same amount of protein produced by beef production in the European Union, a 2021 scientific study claimed.

Vainikka navigates his way through the factory's laboratory and into the control room, where a dozen people at computer screens monitor the production process.

""These are our future farmers,"" Vainikka said.

Transforming food production and consumption is at the heart of combating the climate crisis and preventing biodiversity loss, according to Emilia Nordlund, head of industrial biotechnology and food research at the VTT Technical Research Centre.

Yet current projections show the consumption of meat is expected to increase in coming years.

""Industrial food production, especially livestock production, is one of the biggest causes of greenhouse gas emissions (and) the biggest cause of biodiversity loss, eutrophication and freshwater usage,"" she said.

New food production technologies can help cut emissions and ""decentralise and diversify food production"", Nordlund said.

""However, at the same time, we must improve the existing food production methods to make them more sustainable and resilient,"" she added.

Fermentation technology used to produce different nutrients, such as proteins, has been around for decades.

But the field has expanded significantly in recent years with new technological solutions and research projects emerging worldwide.

Some of the most active start-up hubs focusing on cellular agriculture are in the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands and Israel, Nordlund said.

""We are in a crucial phase as we will see which start-ups will survive,"" she said, adding that stalling bureaucracy was slowing cellular agriculture's take-off in the EU.

Dressed in protective gear to prevent bacteria contamination in the factory, Vainikka showed off a giant steel tank in a shiny production hall.

""This is a fermenter holding 20,000 litres,"" he said, explaining that the microbe multiplies inside the tank as it gets fed the greenhouse gas.

Liquid containing the microbes is continuously extracted from the tank to be processed into the yellowish protein-rich powder with a flavour described as ""nutty"" and ""creamy"".

""The fermenter produces the same amount of protein per day as 300 milking cows or 50,000 laying hens,"" Vainikka said.

That equals ""five million meals' worth of protein per year"".

For now, the main purpose of the small Finnish plant employing around 40 people is to ""prove that the technology scales"", so it can attract the necessary investments pending European regulatory approval.

While the protein has been cleared for sale in Singapore where some restaurants have used it to make ice cream, it is still awaiting classification as a food product in the EU and the United States.

To have any real impact, the aim is to ""build an industrial plant 100 times the size of this one"", Vainikka said.",barrons.com,news,Barrons,,-0.05098039215686279,454204032,9,https://www.barrons.com/asset/external-media/afp/AFP3109216059458584627981183134183431563069---1.jpg,eng-9592326

Cellular agriculture, where food or nutrients are grown from cell cultures, is increasingly seen as a green alternative to animal agriculture.

Lab-grown meat, eggs and milk have made headlines in recent years, with scientists using animal cell cultures -- a process some have criticised as unnatural, highly processed, energy-consuming and costly.

But at Solar Foods' recently opened factory outside Helsinki, scientists are using new technology to grow protein out of cells using air and electricity.

By feeding a microbe with carbon dioxide, hydrogen and some minerals, and powering the process with electricity from renewable sources, the company has managed to create a protein-rich powder that can be used as a milk and egg substitute.

""We can source our main feedstock for the microbe from the air,"" Solar Foods chief executive Pasi Vainikka told AFP, as he gave a tour of the company's new facilities near Helsinki.

""We have started the production of the world's most sustainable protein.""

Founded by Vainikka and Juha-Pekka Pitkanen in 2017, Solar Foods launched the ""world's first factory growing food out of thin air"" in April.

""Much of the animal-like protein of today can actually be produced through cellular agriculture and we can let agricultural land re-wild and thereby build carbon stock,"" Vainikka said, referring to the process whereby forests and soil absorb and store carbon.

One kilo of the new protein, dubbed ""solein"", emits 130 times less greenhouse gases than the same amount of protein produced by beef production in the European Union, a 2021 scientific study claimed.

Vainikka navigates his way through the factory's laboratory and into the control room, where a dozen people at computer screens monitor the production process.

Transforming food production and consumption is at the heart of combating the climate crisis and preventing biodiversity loss, according to Emilia Nordlund, head of industrial biotechnology and food research at the VTT Technical Research Centre.

Yet current projections show the consumption of meat is expected to increase in coming years.

""Industrial food production, especially livestock production, is one of the biggest causes of greenhouse gas emissions (and) the biggest cause of biodiversity loss, eutrophication and freshwater usage,"" she said.

New food production technologies can help cut emissions and ""decentralise and diversify food production"", Nordlund said.

""However, at the same time, we must improve the existing food production methods to make them more sustainable and resilient,"" she added.

Fermentation technology used to produce different nutrients, such as proteins, has been around for decades.

But the field has expanded significantly in recent years with new technological solutions and research projects emerging worldwide.

- Slow progress -

Some of the most active start-up hubs focusing on cellular agriculture are in the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands and Israel, Nordlund said.

""We are in a crucial phase as we will see which start-ups will survive,"" she said, adding that stalling bureaucracy was slowing cellular agriculture's take-off in the EU.

Dressed in protective gear to prevent bacteria contamination in the factory, Vainikka showed off a giant steel tank in a shiny production hall.

""This is a fermenter holding 20,000 litres,"" he said, explaining that the microbe multiplies inside the tank as it gets fed the greenhouse gas.

Liquid containing the microbes is continuously extracted from the tank to be processed into the yellowish protein-rich powder with a flavour described as ""nutty"" and ""creamy"".

""The fermenter produces the same amount of protein per day as 300 milking cows or 50,000 laying hens,"" Vainikka said.

That equals ""five million meals' worth of protein per year"".

For now, the main purpose of the small Finnish plant employing around 40 people is to ""prove that the technology scales"", so it can attract the necessary investments pending European regulatory approval.

While the protein has been cleared for sale in Singapore where some restaurants have used it to make ice cream, it is still awaiting classification as a food product in the EU and the United States.

To have any real impact, the aim is to ""build an industrial plant 100 times the size of this one"", Vainikka said.",yahoo.com,news,Yahoo,,0.01960784313725483,454184555,9,https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/ekzlxTeFeIjG8wIO2k7raQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/jit/6415665815001/8ba85e5e-e1ea-4cb8-b1f9-d995f723abe2/main/1280x720/39s637ms/match/image.jpg,

Here's what scientists say you REALLY need,"Have you started stockpiling? Email jonathan.chadwick@mailonline.co.uk

Britons have been urged to 'prepare for an emergency' by stockpiling essentials in case they can't leave their home.

On a new government website, a 'household emergency plan' reveals a list of 'emergency supplies' such as bottled water, wet wipes and non-perishable food.

But according to scientists, the list omits some important items that could aid survival in the event of flooding, fires, a new health pandemic or even nuclear war.

Robert Handfield, a professor of supply chain management at North Carolina State University, said households could also do with a gas-powered generator.

This could be used as a backup power source for homes during power outages in the event of a severe weather event, for example.

Gas-powered generators use a gas combustion engine - meaning users would have to feed theirs natural gas or liquid propane as a fuel source.

'We are subject to strong storms and flooding, and electricity is a fundamental need,' Professor Handfield told MailOnline.

Another item that could come in handy is a chainsaw - although not for the purpose of self-defence in the case of some sort of societal breakdown as you might initially think.

'Some people often carry a chain saw if you are in a neighborhood with a lot of trees,' Professor Handfield added.

'If they fall onto your home, it's important to get them off.'

In the case of a pandemic or a scenario requiring protection from smoke, he recommends an N95 face mask, which is better at filtering out airborne particles than surgical masks or cloth face coverings.

On a less hopeful note, Professor Alan Robock, a climatologist at Rutgers University, said if there is a nuclear war 'there is nothing that can be done to prepare for it'.

'The only solution is to rid the world of nuclear weapons,' he told MailOnline.

The site links to a printable 'household emergency plan' that includes its list of 'emergency supplies' such as bottled water, a wind-up torch, wet wipes, non-perishable food, a first aid kit and spare batteries.

One of the most-notable omissions from the government's list was toilet paper, possibly to avoid another shortage as seen during the Covid era, although wet wipes could make a more versatile substitute.

However, Brits are urged against panic-buying such items, which could lead to shelves quickly emptying, as triggered by Covid four years ago.

Ben Kerrane, an expert in consumer behaviour at Manchester Metropolitan University, was one of around 20 academics who helped the government compile the list.

'People need to start gathering things slowly and incrementally, if they can,' he told MailOnline.

The government also advises people to 'consider what supplies you and your household might need during an emergency lasting a few days'.

The initiative was spearheaded by Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden, who has been inspired by similar preparations in countries such as Finland.

The Nordic country expects households to be able to cope for 72 hours in situations where 'society's services are disrupted or even discontinued'.

Finns are encouraged to stockpile food and water and be prepared to 'shelter indoors' by taping up gaps in windows and 'waiting calmly for instructions' on the radio.

Mr Dowden has previously introduced an 'emergency alert' system, which allows authorities to trigger an alarm on millions of mobile phones to inform people of a potential crisis.

Fans of apocalyptic movies like Contagion and 28 Days Later are more resilient and better prepared to cope with the coronavirus pandemic, study claims

Movies that portray the end of the world or post-apocalyptic scenarios - known as 'prepper' films - helped viewers deal with the coronavirus pandemic, a study claims.

Psychologists have found that people who watched films depicting social chaos and the collapse of global order were better prepared for the virus.

Fans of 'prepper' genres, including alien-invasion, apocalyptic, and zombie films, exhibited higher levels of resilience and preparedness in experiments.

The researchers say an exposure to frightening fiction allows audiences to practice coping strategies that can be beneficial in real-world situations.

In times of relative peace following the end of the Cold War, intelligence gathering in other States' territorial waters and Exclusive Economic Zones (eez s) seemed to pose no immediate threat to peace and security. The situation has changed with Russia's attack on Ukraine. There is a high risk that Russia, as part of its hybrid campaign against nato members, will further attempt to interfere with European communication, electricity, and energy infrastructure, especially in the maritime domain.

The blowing up of the Nord Stream pipelines in September 2022 and the damaging of the Balticconnector gas pipeline in the Gulf of Finland in October 2023 have shown (leaving aside the problem of attribution in each case) that the disruption of underwater supply lines for oil and gas is a realistic scenario due to the fact that it is impossible to effectively protect such infrastructure on the sea floor. Submarine data and power cables are also particularly vulnerable. Attacks on cables can be carried out without technologically advanced capabilities by civilian ships, such as fishing trawlers, research vessels, yachts, or even container ships ""hidden in common marine traffic"". As one journalist put it, for severing cable connections, ""all it takes is a heavy anchor, the will to drag it, and the knowledge of just where to do so"". More precise operations can be conducted by scuba divers, manned or un-manned underwater vehicles, and deep-diving submarines. Recent examples of cable cutting incidents in Northern European waters include the vanishing of a large subsection of a research data cable off the North Norwegian coast (April 2021), the disruption of a fibre-optic communication cable connecting the archipelago of Spitzbergen with the Norwegian mainland (January 2022), the cutting of cables between Shetland and the Scottish mainland, as well as between Shetland and the Faroe Islands (October 2022), and the damaging of a telecommunications cable connecting Finland and Estonia in the Viro Strait (October 2023).

The effort and cost of sabotage against underwater cables and pipelines can be considered minimal compared to the potential impact. Within the global network of submarine communications infrastructure, not every data cable or landing station is critical. However, there are a number of nodes that are vital for connecting Europe with other regions of the world. They are located off the south-west coast of the United Kingdom, in the Bay of Biscay, off the Portuguese Atlantic coast, and off Marseilles. Coordinated and simultaneous strikes against these nodes could largely paralyse Internet traffic in Europe. An attack disrupting key oil and gas supply lines could also have serious cascading effects. Depending on the location and extent of the damage, it can take months or even years to repair a pipeline on the seabed. All in all, a simple act of sabotage - strategically targeted at particularly critical parts of the cable or pipeline infrastructure - can put enormous pressure on the affected States.

Therefore, Russian activities in the waters surrounding the European continent are alarming. In April 2023, a team of investigative journalists from Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden revealed that Moscow is running a large-scale programme to systematically map critical infrastructure and its vulnerabilities in the North and Baltic Seas. Security experts consider these activities as preparation for future sabotage. European waters are home to thousands of kilometres of cables, including data cables that connect the European mainland with the United Kingdom and the United States. Moreover, Europe has an extensive network of underwater pipelines. Another potential target are the numerous wind farms, especially in the North Sea.

According to media sources, the mapping is conducted by a fleet of approximately 50 Russian ships, which have underwater surveillance technology onboard. Reportedly, the ships use to turn off their positional transmitters when operating in the vicinity of critical infrastructure. In their documentary, the journalists focussed on the Admiral Vladimirsky, classified as an oceanographic research vessel, which had been spotted nearby military installations at the northeast coast of Scotland as well as close to several wind farms along the British and Dutch coasts. The reports say that the ship also travelled through Danish territorial waters with its transmitter turned off. A journalist who approached the Admiral Vladimirsky said he was confronted by armed security guards standing on deck. During an earlier research expedition to the South Pole, the ship reportedly deployed a proton magnetometer, which is a device that can be used to detect metallic objects on the seabed.

The fact that Russian ships - whether 'ghost ships' or vessels clearly identifiable as military or research vessels - are mapping foreign maritime infrastructure is not new. Such activities are said to date back to the 1990s and 2000s. Since 2014, however, these efforts have intensified, observers say. In 2015, the US Government got alarmed about Russian submarines and spy ships aggressively operating near vital undersea cables close to US coastlines. Russian vessels conducting intelligence operations around Europe were spotted also in Irish and Portuguese waters and in the Mediterranean. For example, in August 2021, the Yantar was observed sailing through Ireland's eez. The Yantar is officially an oceanographic research vessel, but its missions are believed to include cable cutting, laying of taps on undersea cables, and intelligence gathering. The ship is also capable of hosting deep-diving submersibles and a range of remotely operated and autonomous underwater vehicles.

Among the priority areas for improving mobilisation training and mobilisation readiness in the field of maritime activity ranges ""improving the procedure for the conscription and use of transport, fishing, and specialized vessels of all forms of ownership, (...) by the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, other troops, and military units conducting special operations in peacetime (emphasis added)"".

In response to the growing threat of strategic sabotage, nato has established a new cell for coordinating the protection of critical undersea infrastructure, which is responsible, among other things, for enhancing surveillance of particularly vulnerable installations and structures. National efforts are also becoming more determined. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, for example, announced in October 2023 that more than 20,000 British troops with warships, fighter jets, and helicopters will be deployed across Northern Europe to tackle hybrid threats and protect critical infrastructure in the region.

Against this background, this article examines the legal framework under which States could take action against Russian vessels engaged in mapping critical infrastructure in the North and Baltic Seas. The analysis focuses on the international law of the sea, not on the law of State responsibility or the jus contra bellum. Section 2 shows that the mapping of infrastructure in the territorial sea of another State without the authorisation or consent of that State is incompatible with the regime of innocent passage. The coastal State may therefore adopt laws and regulations, and take a variety of enforcement measures, to sanction ships carrying out unauthorised mapping activities in its territorial sea. Section 3 deals with straits used for international navigation. Here, the legislative and enforcement powers of the bordering States are more limited. This makes it difficult to justify action against Russian spy ships in such straits. Section 4 analyses the legal situation in the eez, where all States enjoy the freedom of navigation. An important question is whether collecting intelligence in a foreign eez constitutes an internationally lawful use of the sea related to the freedom of navigation. In any case, the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (losc) does not give the coastal State clear authority to prevent foreign vessels from mapping infrastructure in its eez. However, coastal States must be able to exercise effectively their sovereign rights for the exploration and exploitation of the natural resources of the eez and continental shelf. This implies that coastal States must be allowed to take the necessary measures to protect the infrastructure that serves the exercise of those sovereign rights. Hence, the article discusses to what extent coastal States may take measures against foreign vessels suspected of being involved in the preparation of acts of sabotage in the eez and on the continental shelf.

Livestock farming is one of the main culprits in greenhouse gas emissions, the primary cause of global warming.

Cellular agriculture, where food or nutrients are grown from cell cultures, is increasingly seen as a green alternative to animal agriculture.

Lab-grown meat, eggs and milk have made headlines in recent years, with scientists using animal cell cultures -- a process some have criticised as unnatural, highly processed, energy-consuming and costly.

But at Solar Foods' recently opened factory outside Helsinki, scientists are using new technology to grow protein out of cells using air and electricity.

By feeding a microbe with carbon dioxide, hydrogen and some minerals, and powering the process with electricity from renewable sources, the company has managed to create a protein-rich powder that can be used as a milk and egg substitute.

""We can source our main feedstock for the microbe from the air,"" Solar Foods chief executive Pasi Vainikka told AFP, as he gave a tour of the company's new facilities near Helsinki.

""We have started the production of the world's most sustainable protein.""

Founded by Vainikka and Juha-Pekka Pitkanen in 2017, Solar Foods launched the ""world's first factory growing food out of thin air"" in April.

""Much of the animal-like protein of today can actually be produced through cellular agriculture and we can let agricultural land re-wild and thereby build carbon stock,"" Vainikka said, referring to the process whereby forests and soil absorb and store carbon.

One kilo of the new protein, dubbed ""solein"", emits 130 times less greenhouse gases than the same amount of protein produced by beef production in the European Union, a 2021 scientific study claimed.

Vainikka navigates his way through the factory's laboratory and into the control room, where a dozen people at computer screens monitor the production process.

Transforming food production and consumption is at the heart of combating the climate crisis and preventing biodiversity loss, according to Emilia Nordlund, head of industrial biotechnology and food research at the VTT Technical Research Centre.

Yet current projections show the consumption of meat is expected to increase in coming years.

""Industrial food production, especially livestock production, is one of the biggest causes of greenhouse gas emissions (and) the biggest cause of biodiversity loss, eutrophication and freshwater usage,"" she said.

New food production technologies can help cut emissions and ""decentralise and diversify food production"", Nordlund said.

""However, at the same time, we must improve the existing food production methods to make them more sustainable and resilient,"" she added.

Fermentation technology used to produce different nutrients, such as proteins, has been around for decades.

But the field has expanded significantly in recent years with new technological solutions and research projects emerging worldwide.

- Slow progress -

Some of the most active start-up hubs focusing on cellular agriculture are in the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands and Israel, Nordlund said.

""We are in a crucial phase as we will see which start-ups will survive,"" she said, adding that stalling bureaucracy was slowing cellular agriculture's take-off in the EU.

Dressed in protective gear to prevent bacteria contamination in the factory, Vainikka showed off a giant steel tank in a shiny production hall.

""This is a fermenter holding 20,000 litres,"" he said, explaining that the microbe multiplies inside the tank as it gets fed the greenhouse gas.

Liquid containing the microbes is continuously extracted from the tank to be processed into the yellowish protein-rich powder with a flavour described as ""nutty"" and ""creamy"".

""The fermenter produces the same amount of protein per day as 300 milking cows or 50,000 laying hens,"" Vainikka said.

That equals ""five million meals' worth of protein per year"".

For now, the main purpose of the small Finnish plant employing around 40 people is to ""prove that the technology scales"", so it can attract the necessary investments pending European regulatory approval.

While the protein has been cleared for sale in Singapore where some restaurants have used it to make ice cream, it is still awaiting classification as a food product in the EU and the United States.

This is due to several factors, including the proportion of European land in the Arctic, which is the fastest-warming region on Earth. Europe's fast warming is also caused by changes in atmospheric circulation which cause more frequent summer heatwaves. Glaciers are melting, and there are changes in the pattern of precipitation. An increase in extreme rainfall is leading to catastrophic events, such as the widespread flooding seen in Italy, Greece, Slovenia, Norway and Sweden in 2023. Meanwhile, southern Europe has suffered from widespread droughts and wildfires. Overall, the frequency and severity of extreme events is increasing. Estimates indicate economic losses from weather- and climate-related events in Europe reached €13.4 billion in 2023. Millions of people were affected, and at least 151 lives were lost in due to flooding, storms, and wildfires.

The seventh edition of the European State of the Climate (ESOTC) covers conditions during 2023 and, for the first time, was produced jointly by the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). The report presents a detailed analysis of climate conditions, key events, and their impacts across the continent. It is a crucial resource for understanding the current climate situation. ESOTC 2023 also provides valuable insights into climate policy and action, particularly in the context of human health, and updates of the C3S Climate Indicators that describe the long-term evolution of several key variables that are used to assess the global and regional trends of our changing climate.

Commenting on the report's significance, Carlo Buontempo, Director of C3S, said: 'Climate data, information, and insight have never been as important as they are now. And the information contained in this report will certainly be extremely valuable in taking stock of our current vulnerability and informing our future action.'

The report shows that 2023 was the joint warmest or second warmest year on record in Europe. Temperatures were around 1.0°C above average, and around 2.5°C above the pre-industrial levels.

For most of Europe, 2023 ranked among the top ten warmest years, with southeastern Europe and parts of western and central Europe experiencing their warmest year on record. Also, temperatures remained above average for 11 months, with September being the warmest September on record.

The year also saw a record number of days with 'extreme heat stress', equivalent to a 'feels-like' temperature exceeding 46°C. On 23 July, 41% of southern Europe experienced 'strong', 'very strong' or 'extreme' heat stress at the peak of a heatwave.

In Europe, heat-related mortality has risen by approximately 30% in the past two decades, with an increase recorded in 94% of European regions monitored.

'We see the adverse health impacts related to extreme events and the need to strengthen climate resilience in the health sector,' said Elisabeth Hamdouch, Deputy Head of Unit at the Directorate General for Defence Industry and Space (DEFIS) at an ESOTC media briefing.

The report shows that the average sea surface temperature (SST) for European seas was the warmest on record for the year as a whole.

In June, the Atlantic Ocean west of Ireland and surrounding the United Kingdom experienced a record-breaking marine heatwave, categorised as 'extreme' and, in certain regions, even 'beyond extreme', with SSTs soaring as high as 5°C above average.

In July and August there were marine heatwaves in the Mediterranean Sea, during which SSTs reached up to 5.5°C above average in some areas, indicating 'extreme' conditions. August also witnessed the onset of another marine heatwave in the Atlantic Ocean, west of the Iberian Peninsula.

In 2023, Europe faced many flood events across the continent, affecting an estimated 1.6 million people.

In May, for example, Italy experienced widespread flooding, during which 23 rivers burst their banks. This led to 36,000 people being evacuated and tragically resulted in 15 deaths. In August, two-thirds of Slovenia was flooded, leading to the evacuation of 8,000 individuals and the loss of six lives. Norway and Sweden also suffered flooding in August, aggravated by the partial collapse of a hydroelectric power plant in Norway.

September brought record-breaking rainfall and flooding to Greece, Bulgaria, and Turkey. This led to 17 casualties in Greece, eight in Turkey, and four in Bulgaria. Around 700 square kilometres of Greek territory were flooded, with some areas receiving an average year's worth of rainfall in just one day.

The report provides a detailed analysis of several of the largest flood events in Europe in 2023, and a new interactive webpage provides information on many more extreme events across the continent and their impacts.

The data in ESOTC 2023 also shows that the fire season started earlier than average, with significant fires in Mediterranean mountain ranges, like the Pyrenees, in February. Subsequent dry conditions led to large fires, particularly in the Iberian Peninsula, exacerbated by below-average precipitation and lower-than-average soil moisture in March and April. 'Extreme' fire danger was observed in northern Europe in early summer, followed by similar conditions in the south during July and August, culminating in the EU's largest recorded fire, scorching 96,000 hectares in Alexandroupolis, Greece.

The 2023 wildfire season in the EU saw the fourth-largest burnt area on record, totalling around 500,000 hectares.

In 2023, a record proportion of actual electricity generation in Europe was from renewable sources, at 43%, compared to 36% in 2022. Climate-driven electricity demand was above average in southern Europe due to cooling required during exceptional summer temperatures, and in Scandinavia, where cooler-than-average temperatures in several months led to increased demand for heating.

For the year as a whole, the potential for solar photovoltaic power generation was below average in northwestern and central Europe and above average in southwestern and southern Europe and Fennoscandia (geographical peninsula in Europe which includes the Scandinavian and Kola peninsulas, mainland Finland, and Karelia). The potential for run-of-river hydropower generation was above average across much of Europe, linked to above-average precipitation and river flow. Increased storm activity from October to December resulted in above-average potential for wind power production.

In 2023, much of Europe experienced fewer days with snow than average. Many locations in Fennoscandia, however, saw a near-average or higher-than-average number of snow days.

With some exceptions, Europe generally saw a well-below-average number of days with snow during winter, and a near-average or below-average number during spring. In the Alps in winter, just three regions saw more days with snow than average, while most saw far fewer than average.

Since the 1800s, glaciers worldwide have been shrinking, and those in the Alps are no exception. In 2023, they lost even more ice due to a lack of snow in winter and warmer-than-average summer temperatures. The report reveals that glaciers in the Alps lost about 10% of their volume in the two years from 2022 to 2023.

Since the 1990s, the Arctic has been warming at a rate well above the global average. For Arctic land, the report shows that 2023 was the fifth warmest year on record. The five warmest years on record for Arctic land have all occurred since 2016. Svalbard is one of the fastest-warming places on Earth. In 2023, the average summer temperature there was the highest on record, linked in part to below-average sea ice cover and above-average SSTs. In Greenland, below-average temperatures in May and June led to the delayed onset of the ice sheet melt season. In July and August, however, heatwaves led to substantial summer melt and greater-than-average annual ice loss despite the late start to the melt season.

In 2023, the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions saw high levels of wildfire activity, and the second-highest carbon emissions from wildfires on record. The majority of high-latitude wildfires occurred in Canada between May and September, contributing to the highest total annual emissions for the western Arctic on record. In July, the prevailing weather conditions transported smoke from Canadian wildfires to Greenland, possibly contributing to a significant melt event as ash deposits cause increased susceptibility to solar radiation.

The sea ice extent in the Arctic was lower than average for most of the year. In March, it was the fifth lowest on record, and in September, it was the sixth lowest.

From June to December, each month was warmer than the same month in any previous year. It was the first year in which every day saw temperatures that were at least 1°C higher than the pre-industrial level. Almost half of the days were 1.5°C higher, and two days reached 2°C above the pre-industrial level.

The amount of heat stored in the oceans also hit a record high. The transition from La Niña to El Niño, and conditions in the Indian Ocean, contributed to an increase in global upper ocean heat content from 2022 to 2023.

Global sea levels continued to rise, reaching new record highs in the first six months of the year. And they're rising faster than before, with potentially significant impacts for coastal areas.

Greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane, which trap heat in the atmosphere, continued to increase. They reached levels not seen in hundreds of thousands of years. Methane levels increased much more than the 2010s average increase, while the increase in carbon dioxide levels was comparable to the records from previous years.

Glaciers worldwide lost a considerable amount of ice in 2023 -- around 600 gigatonnes of water, which is equivalent to about five times the amount of ice contained in all of central Europe's glaciers. This loss raised sea levels by 1.7 mm, the largest annual increase due to glacier melt on record.

Antarctic sea ice reached record-low extents for the time of year during eight months of 2023, and reached a record minimum in February, with a monthly value 33% below average. Arctic sea ice extent remained below average through most of the year.

Commenting on the report's findings, Celeste Saulo, Secretary-General of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), said: 'The climate crisis is the biggest challenge of our generation. The cost of climate action may seem high, but the cost of inaction is much higher. As this report shows, we need to leverage science to provide solutions for the good of society.'

Andrew Ferrone, Head of the meteorological department at the Administration of Technical Agricultural Services (ASTA) in Luxembourg, said: ""The World Health Organization's (WHO) European regional office declared the climate crisis a public health emergency in July 2023, recognising the escalating adverse health impacts of extreme weather events.""

Since 1970, extreme heat has been the leading cause of weather- and climate-related fatalities in Europe. 23 of the 30 most severe heatwaves have occurred since 2000, and five in the last three years. Between 55,000 and 72,000 deaths due to heatwaves were estimated in the summers of 2003, 2010 and 2022. An estimate for 2023 is not yet available.

Heat-related mortality has increased by around 30% in the past 20 years in Europe. In their commitments under the Paris Agreement, European countries have prominently emphasised mitigation efforts, but fewer than a quarter have integrated health into their adaptation strategies.

The report highlights that climate services are vital for safeguarding lives, and that tailored climate services for the health sector are effective in increasing resilience. In Europe, 78% of countries provide data services for the health sector, but only 28% provide climate services, and there is room for improvement in customising them to the sector's needs.

Climate indicators track essential variables to assess global and regional climate changes. The report shows that greenhouse gas concentrations continue to increase. Carbon dioxide and methane again reached record levels in 2023. Surface air and sea temperatures have notably increased since pre-industrial times.

The ocean absorbs up to 90% of the excess heat associated with greenhouse gas emissions. Ocean heat content is increasing, primarily in the upper layers.

Glaciers, sea ice, and ice sheets are experiencing significant melt and contributing to rising sea levels. The Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets, if entirely melted, could raise global mean sea level by around 65 metres.",copernicus.eu,news,copernicus.eu,,-0.1137254901960785,454158552,5,,

Vantaa, Finland: At a factory in Finland, the ""farmers of the future"" are making a new food protein by feeding a microbe air and electricity, proving that protein can be produced without traditional agriculture.

Livestock farming is one of the main culprits in greenhouse gas emissions, the primary cause of global warming.

Cellular agriculture, where food or nutrients are grown from cell cultures, is increasingly seen as a green alternative to animal agriculture.

Lab-grown meat, eggs and milk have made headlines in recent years, with scientists using animal cell cultures - a process some have criticised as unnatural, highly processed, energy-consuming and costly.

But at Solar Foods' recently opened factory outside Helsinki, scientists are using new technology to grow protein out of cells using air and electricity.

By feeding a microbe with carbon dioxide, hydrogen and some minerals, and powering the process with electricity from renewable sources, the company has managed to create a protein-rich powder that can be used as a milk and egg substitute.

""We can source our main feedstock for the microbe from the air,"" Solar Foods chief executive Pasi Vainikka told AFP, as he gave a tour of the company's new facilities near Helsinki.

""We have started the production of the world's most sustainable protein.""

Founded by Vainikka and Juha-Pekka Pitkanen in 2017, Solar Foods launched the ""world's first factory growing food out of thin air"" in April.

""Much of the animal-like protein of today can actually be produced through cellular agriculture and we can let agricultural land re-wild and thereby build carbon stock,"" Vainikka said, referring to the process whereby forests and soil absorb and store carbon.

One kilo of the new protein, dubbed ""solein"", emits 130 times less greenhouse gases than the same amount of protein produced by beef production in the European Union, a 2021 scientific study claimed.

Vainikka navigates his way through the factory's laboratory and into the control room, where a dozen people at computer screens monitor the production process.

""These are our future farmers,"" Vainikka said.

Part of the solution

Transforming food production and consumption is at the heart of combating the climate crisis and preventing biodiversity loss, according to Emilia Nordlund, head of industrial biotechnology and food research at the VTT Technical Research Centre.

Yet current projections show the consumption of meat is expected to increase in coming years.

""Industrial food production, especially livestock production, is one of the biggest causes of greenhouse gas emissions (and) the biggest cause of biodiversity loss, eutrophication and freshwater usage,"" she said.

New food production technologies can help cut emissions and ""decentralise and diversify food production"", Nordlund said.

""However, at the same time, we must improve the existing food production methods to make them more sustainable and resilient,"" she added.

Fermentation technology used to produce different nutrients, such as proteins, has been around for decades.

But the field has expanded significantly in recent years with new technological solutions and research projects emerging worldwide.

Slow progress

Some of the most active start-up hubs focusing on cellular agriculture are in the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands and Israel, Nordlund said.

""We are in a crucial phase as we will see which start-ups will survive,"" she said, adding that stalling bureaucracy was slowing cellular agriculture's take-off in the EU.

Dressed in protective gear to prevent bacteria contamination in the factory, Vainikka showed off a giant steel tank in a shiny production hall.

""This is a fermenter holding 20,000 litres,"" he said, explaining that the microbe multiplies inside the tank as it gets fed the greenhouse gas.

Liquid containing the microbes is continuously extracted from the tank to be processed into the yellowish protein-rich powder with a flavour described as ""nutty"" and ""creamy"".

""The fermenter produces the same amount of protein per day as 300 milking cows or 50,000 laying hens,"" Vainikka said.

That equals ""five million meals' worth of protein per year"".

For now, the main purpose of the small Finnish plant employing around 40 people is to ""prove that the technology scales"", so it can attract the necessary investments pending European regulatory approval.

While the protein has been cleared for sale in Singapore where some restaurants have used it to make ice cream, it is still awaiting classification as a food product in the EU and the United States.

To have any real impact, the aim is to ""build an industrial plant 100 times the size of this one"", Vainikka said.",gulfnews.com,news,GULF NEWS,Agence France-Presse,-0.05098039215686279,454157141,17,https://imagevars.gulfnews.com/2024/05/23/Food-prepared-with-Solein-protein-is-pictured-at-the-headquarters-of-the-Solar-Foods-company-in-Vantaa--Finland.-_18fa504a0ac_medium.jpg,

The site will convert food industry side streams into Enifer's sustainable Pekilo fungi-based protein ingredients and is expected to be the ""world's first"" commercial plant to produce such a mycoprotein ingredient from side stream raw materials.

This comes after the start-up commenced construction of its mycoprotein facility in the Uusimaa region of Finland after netting €12 million (US$13.1 million) in funding earlier this year.

The factory is projected to cost €33 million (US$35.7 million) and will formulate up to 3,000 tons of Pekilo annually, which is ""enough to cover the annual protein needs of approximately 40,000 people,"" says the company.

""Mycoprotein is the missing ingredient for a more sustainable food chain -- the facility in Kantvik serves as a key steppingstone on our path to making mycoprotein a cornerstone of protein supply, with several future factories already being planned,"" says Simo Ellilä, CEO and co-founder of Enifer.

The construction is set to finish by the end of next year.

""Brownfield project""

The plant will be built as a ""brownfield project"" within an existing industrial building in Kantvik, Kirkkonummi, Finland, close to Enifer's existing R&D facilities.

The research facility will offer the upcoming factory all the required utilities, including steam, electricity, process and cooling water and waste-water treatment.

The factory will commence operations in 2026 and once it is at total capacity, it will produce 500 kg of mycoprotein per hour.

The new plant will house a 12 meters tall industrial fermenter measuring more than 4.5 meters in diameter to grow Pekilo mycoprotein.

Upcycling side streams to protein

The Pekilo fermentation process was initially developed in Finland in the 1970s and used to upcycle forest industry side streams into feed-grade mycoprotein, Enifer highlights.

The company modified the innovation by adapting it to new raw material streams from the food and agricultural industries, formulating a ""food-grade version"" of the mycoprotein ingredient.

Enifer formulates the ingredient by cultivating a specific species of fungus in a fermentation process similar to brewing beer or making soy sauce.

The Pekilo mycoprotein powder is rich in high-quality protein and fiber, while also being neutral in color and taste. This makes the ingredient a nutritious product for diverse food applications.

""Enifer and its partners have already demonstrated its use across meat and dairy alternatives, baking, pastries and snacks,"" notes the company.

Supporting alt-protein demands

The cash injection is expected to bolster Enifer's efforts to propel its alt-protein advancements.

""We believe that there is an increased need for alternative proteins as the global population grows,"" says Tero Saarno, managing director of Taaleri Bioindustry, which is leading the €15 million (US$16.26 million) Series B equity funding round.

""Demand is also supported globally by environmental and ethical considerations.""

The Finnish Climate Fund has also extended a €7 million (US$7.6 million) capital loan to support the project along with a €2 million (US$2.16 million) Climate and Environmental Loan provided by Finnvera.

Finnish Climate Fund's CEO, Toni Mikkonen, agrees that the need for proteins is rising.

""Food production is, even at the level of technologies that can already be scaled, an unsolved key part of the climate challenge. In the future, sustainable food production will be based on several different solutions and the demand for new types of proteins is predicted to grow significantly over the next decade.""

Enifer is a spin-off company from VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland. It will file for Novel Foods approval of the novel ingredient this year and expects to receive approval in 2026.",foodingredientsfirst.com,news,foodingredientsfirst.com,,0.0117647058823529,454153540,17,https://article.innovamarketinsights360.com/articleimgs/article_images/638520537055330045638405560816765931Enifer_28.11.2023_0089_final.jpg,eng-9591959

Eviden Poland team, part of the international Poland-Finland team, is on podium for second year in a row

Paris, May 23, 2024 - Eviden, the Atos Group business leading in digital, cloud, big data and security today announces that four of its cybersecurity experts based in Poland and two in Romania have participated in the largest international cyber defense exercise, ""Locked Shields 2024"", organized by the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence (CCDCOE) . Due to the company's capabilities and the expertise of its people, Eviden representatives from Poland contributed to the Poland-Finland team that was awarded 2nd place, following on from Poland's 3rd place ranking last year. This year also marks the 2nd consecutive participation of Romania, which teamed up with cybersecurity specialists from other countries.

The exercise took place between 22 - 26 April and brought together almost 4,000 military and civilian cyber defense professionals, from more than 40 nations. Locked Shields as a platform enables countries to exchange best practices, innovate strategies, and collectively improve their cyber incident response capabilities.

Eviden experts, through their participation in Locked Shields, have showcased a remarkable ability to navigate the complex cyber battleground, demonstrating resilience and strategic acumen in safeguarding digital fortresses. Their collective expertise has been pivotal in fortifying cyber defenses and fostering a culture of continuous learning and innovation.

Chris Moret, Global Head of Cybersecurity Services at Eviden, Atos Group: ""Eviden takes pride in our team's achievements showcased at Locked Shields 2024. Being part of such an important project underscores the caliber of expertise within our company and reaffirms our dedication to fortifying cyber defenses on a global scale"".

LtCol Urmet Tomp, Director of Locked Shields 2024: ""Every year, Locked Shields aims to push the boundaries of what can be achieved in cyber defence training, and 2024 has been no exception. The skills trained here directly translate to stronger national defences against real-world cyber threats, enhancing our collective security"".

Dr Mart Noorma, Director of the NATO CCDCOE: ""The purpose of the exercise is to help our nations develop their capabilities to face cyber threats as a coalition. We have real threats around us, and most of our participants came out of the trenches of real cyber warfare to participate in Locked Shields. I am confident they will go back defending their nations stronger than ever"".

Major General Engineer Gheorghe Iordache, Commander of the Cyber Defence Command, Romanian Ministry of National Defence: ""We need to strengthen the link with the private sector to face more easily certain challenges which, at one point, could exceed our possibilities of reaction. It is no secret that NATO is also trying to bring together military and civilian specialized institutions in order to have a common reaction and to have some common compatibilities regarding the threats coming from the cyber space.""

Together with colleagues from other countries, all Eviden experts proved the readiness of a fictitious country's defense structures against cyber-attacks targeting critical infrastructures. In addition to securing complex IT and operational systems, participating teams must be effective across a wide range of disciplines, including incident reporting and solving forensic, legal, media operations, and information warfare challenges.

The Eviden's cyber security experts from Romania - Sergiu-Andrei Chirlejan (Threat Hunting team) and Bogdan Irimia (Software Mediation team) - were part of the international defense team (also called ""Blue Team""). This year marked Romania's fourth consecutive participation, and 2nd for the Eviden Romania, teaming up with cybersecurity specialists from Bulgaria and Republic of Moldova. The Romanian team was coordinated by the Cyber Defense Agency within the Cyber Defense Command and consists of over 150 specialists from the national defense institutions, public order and national security system, but also from private companies active in the field, Eviden Romania being one of them.

From Poland, Bartosz Wawrzyniak (Threat Intelligence team), Piotr Mazurkiewicz (Computer Security Incident Response team), Damian Falatyn (Computer Security Incident Response team) and Michal Cichorz (Computer Security Incident Response team) were part of the Finland-Poland team. They were part of the team that took 2nd place, making it two years in a row they've reached podium success. For Poland, this was the 3rd participation in the exercise, this year jointly with a team of cybersecurity experts from Finland.

Their achievement was powered by Eviden's cloud-based Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR) investigator tooling, which proved valuable during the forensics investigation. The exercise's strength lies in its comprehensive approach, combining technical skills with strategic, legal, and communication expertise to develop a diverse defense strategy. The Poland team was coordinated by Cyberspace Defense Forces Component Command.

What is Locked Shields?

Locked Shields is the largest international Live Fire Exercise (LFX) in cyber-defense and is the most advanced in terms of technical expertise required. Participants are involved in a Red Team vs. Blue Team training exercise, where rapid response teams from NATO member states and partner countries help a fictitious country under a large-scale cyberattack to protect in real time computer networks of the government and critical national infrastructures (banking systems, gas and electricity distribution systems, satellite communication systems and 5G) against multiple and multidirectional cyber-attacks. Thus, teams can assess the ability to maintain functional systems in real situations and under special conditions.

The exercise is designed to train and test teams of specialists by engaging them in solving complex scenarios and massive cyber incidents under intense pressure, including the areas of strategic decision, legal, public communication, as well as the evaluation, based on score, of the ability of teams to adapt and protect their own networks.

At a factory in Finland, the ""farmers of the future"" are making a new food protein by feeding a microbe air and electricity, proving that protein can be produced without traditional agriculture.

Livestock farming is one of the main culprits in greenhouse gas emissions, the primary cause of global warming.

Cellular agriculture, where food or nutrients are grown from cell cultures, is increasingly seen as a green alternative to animal agriculture.

Lab-grown meat, eggs and milk have made headlines in recent years, with scientists using animal cell cultures -- a process some have criticised as unnatural, highly processed, energy-consuming and costly.

But at Solar Foods' recently opened factory outside Helsinki, scientists are using new technology to grow protein out of cells using air and electricity.

By feeding a microbe with carbon dioxide, hydrogen and some minerals, and powering the process with electricity from renewable sources, the company has managed to create a protein-rich powder that can be used as a milk and egg substitute.

""We can source our main feedstock for the microbe from the air,"" Solar Foods chief executive Pasi Vainikka told AFP, as he gave a tour of the company's new facilities near Helsinki.

""We have started the production of the world's most sustainable protein.""

Founded by Vainikka and Juha-Pekka Pitkanen in 2017, Solar Foods launched the ""world's first factory growing food out of thin air"" in April.

""Much of the animal-like protein of today can actually be produced through cellular agriculture and we can let agricultural land re-wild and thereby build carbon stock,"" Vainikka said, referring to the process whereby forests and soil absorb and store carbon.

One kilo of the new protein, dubbed ""solein"", emits 130 times less greenhouse gases than the same amount of protein produced by beef production in the European Union, a 2021 scientific study claimed.

Vainikka navigates his way through the factory's laboratory and into the control room, where a dozen people at computer screens monitor the production process.

""These are our future farmers,"" Vainikka said.

- Part of the solution -

Transforming food production and consumption is at the heart of combating the climate crisis and preventing biodiversity loss, according to Emilia Nordlund, head of industrial biotechnology and food research at the VTT Technical Research Centre.

Yet current projections show the consumption of meat is expected to increase in coming years.

""Industrial food production, especially livestock production, is one of the biggest causes of greenhouse gas emissions (and) the biggest cause of biodiversity loss, eutrophication and freshwater usage,"" she said.

New food production technologies can help cut emissions and ""decentralise and diversify food production"", Nordlund said.

""However, at the same time, we must improve the existing food production methods to make them more sustainable and resilient,"" she added.

Fermentation technology used to produce different nutrients, such as proteins, has been around for decades.

But the field has expanded significantly in recent years with new technological solutions and research projects emerging worldwide.

- Slow progress -

Some of the most active start-up hubs focusing on cellular agriculture are in the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands and Israel, Nordlund said.

""We are in a crucial phase as we will see which start-ups will survive,"" she said, adding that stalling bureaucracy was slowing cellular agriculture's take-off in the EU.

Dressed in protective gear to prevent bacteria contamination in the factory, Vainikka showed off a giant steel tank in a shiny production hall.

""This is a fermenter holding 20,000 litres,"" he said, explaining that the microbe multiplies inside the tank as it gets fed the greenhouse gas.

Liquid containing the microbes is continuously extracted from the tank to be processed into the yellowish protein-rich powder with a flavour described as ""nutty"" and ""creamy"".

""The fermenter produces the same amount of protein per day as 300 milking cows or 50,000 laying hens,"" Vainikka said.

That equals ""five million meals' worth of protein per year"".

For now, the main purpose of the small Finnish plant employing around 40 people is to ""prove that the technology scales"", so it can attract the necessary investments pending European regulatory approval.

While the protein has been cleared for sale in Singapore where some restaurants have used it to make ice cream, it is still awaiting classification as a food product in the EU and the United States.

To have any real impact, the aim is to ""build an industrial plant 100 times the size of this one"", Vainikka said.

Eviden Poland team, part of the international Poland-Finland team, is on podium for second year in a row

Paris, May 23, 2024 - Eviden, the Atos Group business leading in digital, cloud, big data and security today announces that four of its cybersecurity experts based in Poland and two in Romania have participated in the largest international cyber defense exercise, ""Locked Shields 2024"", organized by the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence (CCDCOE) . Due to the company's capabilities and the expertise of its people, Eviden representatives from Poland contributed to the Poland-Finland team that was awarded 2nd place, following on from Poland's 3rd place ranking last year. This year also marks the 2nd consecutive participation of Romania, which teamed up with cybersecurity specialists from other countries.

The exercise took place between 22 - 26 April and brought together almost 4,000 military and civilian cyber defense professionals, from more than 40 nations. Locked Shields as a platform enables countries to exchange best practices, innovate strategies, and collectively improve their cyber incident response capabilities.

Eviden experts, through their participation in Locked Shields, have showcased a remarkable ability to navigate the complex cyber battleground, demonstrating resilience and strategic acumen in safeguarding digital fortresses. Their collective expertise has been pivotal in fortifying cyber defenses and fostering a culture of continuous learning and innovation.

Chris Moret, Global Head of Cybersecurity Services at Eviden, Atos Group: ""Eviden takes pride in our team's achievements showcased at Locked Shields 2024. Being part of such an important project underscores the caliber of expertise within our company and reaffirms our dedication to fortifying cyber defenses on a global scale"".

LtCol Urmet Tomp, Director of Locked Shields 2024: ""Every year, Locked Shields aims to push the boundaries of what can be achieved in cyber defence training, and 2024 has been no exception. The skills trained here directly translate to stronger national defences against real-world cyber threats, enhancing our collective security"".

Dr Mart Noorma, Director of the NATO CCDCOE: ""The purpose of the exercise is to help our nations develop their capabilities to face cyber threats as a coalition. We have real threats around us, and most of our participants came out of the trenches of real cyber warfare to participate in Locked Shields. I am confident they will go back defending their nations stronger than ever"".

Major General Engineer Gheorghe Iordache, Commander of the Cyber Defence Command, Romanian Ministry of National Defence: ""We need to strengthen the link with the private sector to face more easily certain challenges which, at one point, could exceed our possibilities of reaction. It is no secret that NATO is also trying to bring together military and civilian specialized institutions in order to have a common reaction and to have some common compatibilities regarding the threats coming from the cyber space.""

Together with colleagues from other countries, all Eviden experts proved the readiness of a fictitious country's defense structures against cyber-attacks targeting critical infrastructures. In addition to securing complex IT and operational systems, participating teams must be effective across a wide range of disciplines, including incident reporting and solving forensic, legal, media operations, and information warfare challenges.

The Eviden's cyber security experts from Romania - Sergiu-Andrei Chirlejan (Threat Hunting team) and Bogdan Irimia (Software Mediation team) - were part of the international defense team (also called ""Blue Team""). This year marked Romania's fourth consecutive participation, and 2nd for the Eviden Romania, teaming up with cybersecurity specialists from Bulgaria and Republic of Moldova. The Romanian team was coordinated by the Cyber Defense Agency within the Cyber Defense Command and consists of over 150 specialists from the national defense institutions, public order and national security system, but also from private companies active in the field, Eviden Romania being one of them.

From Poland, Bartosz Wawrzyniak (Threat Intelligence team), Piotr Mazurkiewicz (Computer Security Incident Response team), Damian Falatyn (Computer Security Incident Response team) and Michal Cichorz (Computer Security Incident Response team) were part of the Finland-Poland team. They were part of the team that took 2nd place, making it two years in a row they've reached podium success. For Poland, this was the 3rd participation in the exercise, this year jointly with a team of cybersecurity experts from Finland.

Their achievement was powered by Eviden's cloud-based Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR) investigator tooling, which proved valuable during the forensics investigation. The exercise's strength lies in its comprehensive approach, combining technical skills with strategic, legal, and communication expertise to develop a diverse defense strategy. The Poland team was coordinated by Cyberspace Defense Forces Component Command.

What is Locked Shields?

Locked Shields is the largest international Live Fire Exercise (LFX) in cyber-defense and is the most advanced in terms of technical expertise required. Participants are involved in a Red Team vs. Blue Team training exercise, where rapid response teams from NATO member states and partner countries help a fictitious country under a large-scale cyberattack to protect in real time computer networks of the government and critical national infrastructures (banking systems, gas and electricity distribution systems, satellite communication systems and 5G) against multiple and multidirectional cyber-attacks. Thus, teams can assess the ability to maintain functional systems in real situations and under special conditions.

The exercise is designed to train and test teams of specialists by engaging them in solving complex scenarios and massive cyber incidents under intense pressure, including the areas of strategic decision, legal, public communication, as well as the evaluation, based on score, of the ability of teams to adapt and protect their own networks.

""We are in a crucial phase as we will see which start-ups will survive,"" she said, adding that stalling bureaucracy was slowing cellular agriculture's take-off in the EU.

Dressed in protective gear to prevent bacteria contamination in the factory, Vainikka showed off a giant steel tank in a shiny production hall.

""This is a fermenter holding 20,000 litres,"" he said, explaining that the microbe multiplies inside the tank as it gets fed the greenhouse gas.

Liquid containing the microbes is continuously extracted from the tank to be processed into the yellowish protein-rich powder with a flavour described as ""nutty"" and ""creamy"".

""The fermenter produces the same amount of protein per day as 300 milking cows or 50,000 laying hens,"" Vainikka said.

That equals ""five million meals' worth of protein per year"".

For now, the main purpose of the small Finnish plant employing around 40 people is to ""prove that the technology scales"", so it can attract the necessary investments pending European regulatory approval.

While the protein has been cleared for sale in Singapore where some restaurants have used it to make ice cream, it is still awaiting classification as a food product in the EU and the United States.

To have any real impact, the aim is to ""build an industrial plant 100 times the size of this one"", Vainikka said.

Livestock farming is one of the main culprits in greenhouse gas emissions, the primary cause of global warming.

Cellular agriculture, where food or nutrients are grown from cell cultures, is increasingly seen as a green alternative to animal agriculture.

Lab-grown meat, eggs and milk have made headlines in recent years, with scientists using animal cell cultures -- a process some have criticised as unnatural, highly processed, energy-consuming and costly.

But at Solar Foods' recently opened factory outside Helsinki, scientists are using new technology to grow protein out of cells using air and electricity.

By feeding a microbe with carbon dioxide, hydrogen and some minerals, and powering the process with electricity from renewable sources, the company has managed to create a protein-rich powder that can be used as a milk and egg substitute.

""We can source our main feedstock for the microbe from the air,"" Solar Foods chief executive Pasi Vainikka told AFP, as he gave a tour of the company's new facilities near Helsinki.

""We have started the production of the world's most sustainable protein.""

Founded by Vainikka and Juha-Pekka Pitkanen in 2017, Solar Foods launched the ""world's first factory growing food out of thin air"" in April.

""Much of the animal-like protein of today can actually be produced through cellular agriculture and we can let agricultural land re-wild and thereby build carbon stock,"" Vainikka said, referring to the process whereby forests and soil absorb and store carbon.

One kilo of the new protein, dubbed ""solein"", emits 130 times less greenhouse gases than the same amount of protein produced by beef production in the European Union, a 2021 scientific study claimed.

Vainikka navigates his way through the factory's laboratory and into the control room, where a dozen people at computer screens monitor the production process.

""These are our future farmers,"" Vainikka said.

Transforming food production and consumption is at the heart of combating the climate crisis and preventing biodiversity loss, according to Emilia Nordlund, head of industrial biotechnology and food research at the VTT Technical Research Centre.

Yet current projections show the consumption of meat is expected to increase in coming years.

""Industrial food production, especially livestock production, is one of the biggest causes of greenhouse gas emissions (and) the biggest cause of biodiversity loss, eutrophication and freshwater usage,"" she said.

New food production technologies can help cut emissions and ""decentralise and diversify food production"", Nordlund said.

""However, at the same time, we must improve the existing food production methods to make them more sustainable and resilient,"" she added.

Fermentation technology used to produce different nutrients, such as proteins, has been around for decades.

But the field has expanded significantly in recent years with new technological solutions and research projects emerging worldwide.

Some of the most active start-up hubs focusing on cellular agriculture are in the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands and Israel, Nordlund said.

Eviden wins 2nd place in the world's largest cyber defense exercise

Eviden Poland team, part of the international Poland-Finland team, is on podium for second year in a row

Paris, May 23, 2024 - Eviden, the Atos Group business leading in digital, cloud, big data and security today announces that four of its cybersecurity experts based in Poland and two in Romania have participated in the largest international cyber defense exercise, ""Locked Shields 2024"", organized by the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence. Due to the company's capabilities and the expertise of its people, Eviden representatives from Poland contributed to the Poland-Finland team that was awarded 2nd place, following on from Poland's 3rd place ranking last year. This year also marks the 2nd consecutive participation of Romania, which teamed up with cybersecurity specialists from other countries.

The exercise took place between 22 - 26 April and brought together almost 4,000 military and civilian cyber defense professionals, from more than 40 nations. Locked Shields as a platform enables countries to exchange best practices, innovate strategies, and collectively improve their cyber incident response capabilities.

Eviden experts, through their participation in Locked Shields, have showcased a remarkable ability to navigate the complex cyber battleground, demonstrating resilience and strategic acumen in safeguarding digital fortresses. Their collective expertise has been pivotal in fortifying cyber defenses and fostering a culture of continuous learning and innovation.

Chris Moret, Global Head of Cybersecurity Services at Eviden, Atos Group: ""Eviden takes pride in our team's achievements showcased at Locked Shields 2024. Being part of such an important project underscores the caliber of expertise within our company and reaffirms our dedication to fortifying cyber defenses on a global scale"".

LtCol Urmet Tomp, Director of Locked Shields 2024: ""Every year, Locked Shields aims to push the boundaries of what can be achieved in cyber defence training, and 2024 has been no exception. The skills trained here directly translate to stronger national defences against real-world cyber threats, enhancing our collective security"".

Dr Mart Noorma, Director of the NATO CCDCOE: ""The purpose of the exercise is to help our nations develop their capabilities to face cyber threats as a coalition. We have real threats around us, and most of our participants came out of the trenches of real cyber warfare to participate in Locked Shields. I am confident they will go back defending their nations stronger than ever"".

Major GeneralEngineer Gheorghe Iordache, Commander of the Cyber Defence Command, Romanian Ministry of National Defence: ""We need to strengthen the link with the private sector to face more easily certain challenges which, at one point, could exceed our possibilities of reaction. It is no secret that NATO is also trying to bring together military and civilian specialized institutions in order to have a common reaction and to have some common compatibilities regarding the threats coming from the cyber space.""

Together with colleagues from other countries, all Eviden experts proved the readiness of a fictitious country's defense structures against cyber-attacks targeting critical infrastructures. In addition to securing complex IT and operational systems, participating teams must be effective across a wide range of disciplines, including incident reporting and solving forensic, legal, media operations, and information warfare challenges.

About our teams

The Eviden's cyber security experts from Romania - Sergiu-Andrei Chirlejan (Threat Hunting team) and Bogdan Irimia (Software Mediation team) - were part of the international defense team (also called ""Blue Team""). This year marked Romania's fourth consecutive participation, and 2nd for the Eviden Romania, teaming up with cybersecurity specialists from Bulgaria and Republic of Moldova. The Romanian team was coordinated by the Cyber Defense Agency within the Cyber Defense Command and consists of over 150 specialists from the national defense institutions, public order and national security system, but also from private companies active in the field, Eviden Romania being one of them.

From Poland, Bartosz Wawrzyniak (Threat Intelligence team), Piotr Mazurkiewicz (Computer Security Incident Response team), Damian Falatyn (Computer Security Incident Response team) and Michal Cichorz (Computer Security Incident Response team) were part of the Finland-Poland team. They were part of the team that took 2nd place, making it two years in a row they've reached podium success. For Poland, this was the 3rd participation in the exercise, this year jointly with a team of cybersecurity experts from Finland.

Their achievement was powered by Eviden's cloud-based Digital Forensics and Incident Responseinvestigator tooling, which proved valuable during the forensics investigation. The exercise's strength lies in its comprehensive approach, combining technical skills with strategic, legal, and communication expertise to develop a diverse defense strategy. The Poland team was coordinated by Cyberspace Defense Forces Component Command.

What is Locked Shields?

Locked Shields is the largest international Live Fire Exercise (LFX) in cyber-defense and is the most advanced in terms of technical expertise required. Participants are involved in a Red Team vs. Blue Team training exercise, where rapid response teams from NATO member states and partner countries help a fictitious country under a large-scale cyberattack to protect in real time computer networks of the government and critical national infrastructures (banking systems, gas and electricity distribution systems, satellite communication systems and 5G) against multiple and multidirectional cyber-attacks. Thus, teams can assess the ability to maintain functional systems in real situations and under special conditions.

The exercise is designed to train and test teams of specialists by engaging them in solving complex scenarios and massive cyber incidents under intense pressure, including the areas of strategic decision, legal, public communication, as well as the evaluation, based on score, of the ability of teams to adapt and protect their own networks.

Livestock farming is one of the main culprits in greenhouse gas emissions, the primary cause of global warming.

Cellular agriculture, where food or nutrients are grown from cell cultures, is increasingly seen as a green alternative to animal agriculture.

Lab-grown meat, eggs and milk have made headlines in recent years, with scientists using animal cell cultures -- a process some have criticised as unnatural, highly processed, energy-consuming and costly.

But at Solar Foods' recently opened factory outside Helsinki, scientists are using new technology to grow protein out of cells using air and electricity.

By feeding a microbe with carbon dioxide, hydrogen and some minerals, and powering the process with electricity from renewable sources, the company has managed to create a protein-rich powder that can be used as a milk and egg substitute.

""We can source our main feedstock for the microbe from the air,"" Solar Foods chief executive Pasi Vainikka told AFP, as he gave a tour of the company's new facilities near Helsinki.

""We have started the production of the world's most sustainable protein.""

Founded by Vainikka and Juha-Pekka Pitkanen in 2017, Solar Foods launched the ""world's first factory growing food out of thin air"" in April.

""Much of the animal-like protein of today can actually be produced through cellular agriculture and we can let agricultural land re-wild and thereby build carbon stock,"" Vainikka said, referring to the process whereby forests and soil absorb and store carbon.

One kilo of the new protein, dubbed ""solein"", emits 130 times less greenhouse gases than the same amount of protein produced by beef production in the European Union, a 2021 scientific study claimed.

Vainikka navigates his way through the factory's laboratory and into the control room, where a dozen people at computer screens monitor the production process.

Transforming food production and consumption is at the heart of combating the climate crisis and preventing biodiversity loss, according to Emilia Nordlund, head of industrial biotechnology and food research at the VTT Technical Research Centre.

Yet current projections show the consumption of meat is expected to increase in coming years.

""Industrial food production, especially livestock production, is one of the biggest causes of greenhouse gas emissions (and) the biggest cause of biodiversity loss, eutrophication and freshwater usage,"" she said.

New food production technologies can help cut emissions and ""decentralise and diversify food production"", Nordlund said.

""However, at the same time, we must improve the existing food production methods to make them more sustainable and resilient,"" she added.

Fermentation technology used to produce different nutrients, such as proteins, has been around for decades.

But the field has expanded significantly in recent years with new technological solutions and research projects emerging worldwide.

- Slow progress -

Some of the most active start-up hubs focusing on cellular agriculture are in the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands and Israel, Nordlund said.

""We are in a crucial phase as we will see which start-ups will survive,"" she said, adding that stalling bureaucracy was slowing cellular agriculture's take-off in the EU.

Dressed in protective gear to prevent bacteria contamination in the factory, Vainikka showed off a giant steel tank in a shiny production hall.

""This is a fermenter holding 20,000 litres,"" he said, explaining that the microbe multiplies inside the tank as it gets fed the greenhouse gas.

Liquid containing the microbes is continuously extracted from the tank to be processed into the yellowish protein-rich powder with a flavour described as ""nutty"" and ""creamy"".

""The fermenter produces the same amount of protein per day as 300 milking cows or 50,000 laying hens,"" Vainikka said.

That equals ""five million meals' worth of protein per year"".

For now, the main purpose of the small Finnish plant employing around 40 people is to ""prove that the technology scales"", so it can attract the necessary investments pending European regulatory approval.

While the protein has been cleared for sale in Singapore where some restaurants have used it to make ice cream, it is still awaiting classification as a food product in the EU and the United States.

At a factory in Finland, the ""farmers of the future"" are making a new food protein by feeding a microbe air and electricity, proving that protein can be produced without traditional agriculture.

Livestock farming is one of the main culprits in greenhouse gas emissions, the primary cause of global warming.

Cellular agriculture, where food or nutrients are grown from cell cultures, is increasingly seen as a green alternative to animal agriculture.

Lab-grown meat, eggs and milk have made headlines in recent years, with scientists using animal cell cultures -- a process some have criticised as unnatural, highly processed, energy-consuming and costly.

But at Solar Foods' recently opened factory outside Helsinki, scientists are using new technology to grow protein out of cells using air and electricity.

By feeding a microbe with carbon dioxide, hydrogen and some minerals, and powering the process with electricity from renewable sources, the company has managed to create a protein-rich powder that can be used as a milk and egg substitute.

""We can source our main feedstock for the microbe from the air,"" Solar Foods chief executive Pasi Vainikka told AFP, as he gave a tour of the company's new facilities near Helsinki.

""We have started the production of the world's most sustainable protein.""

Founded by Vainikka and Juha-Pekka Pitkanen in 2017, Solar Foods launched the ""world's first factory growing food out of thin air"" in April.

""Much of the animal-like protein of today can actually be produced through cellular agriculture and we can let agricultural land re-wild and thereby build carbon stock,"" Vainikka said, referring to the process whereby forests and soil absorb and store carbon.

One kilo of the new protein, dubbed ""solein"", emits 130 times less greenhouse gases than the same amount of protein produced by beef production in the European Union, a 2021 scientific study claimed.

Vainikka navigates his way through the factory's laboratory and into the control room, where a dozen people at computer screens monitor the production process.

""These are our future farmers,"" Vainikka said.

Transforming food production and consumption is at the heart of combating the climate crisis and preventing biodiversity loss, according to Emilia Nordlund, head of industrial biotechnology and food research at the VTT Technical Research Centre.

Yet current projections show the consumption of meat is expected to increase in coming years.

""Industrial food production, especially livestock production, is one of the biggest causes of greenhouse gas emissions (and) the biggest cause of biodiversity loss, eutrophication and freshwater usage,"" she said.

New food production technologies can help cut emissions and ""decentralise and diversify food production"", Nordlund said.

""However, at the same time, we must improve the existing food production methods to make them more sustainable and resilient,"" she added.

Fermentation technology used to produce different nutrients, such as proteins, has been around for decades.

But the field has expanded significantly in recent years with new technological solutions and research projects emerging worldwide.

Some of the most active start-up hubs focusing on cellular agriculture are in the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands and Israel, Nordlund said.

""We are in a crucial phase as we will see which start-ups will survive,"" she said, adding that stalling bureaucracy was slowing cellular agriculture's take-off in the EU.

Dressed in protective gear to prevent bacteria contamination in the factory, Vainikka showed off a giant steel tank in a shiny production hall.

""This is a fermenter holding 20,000 litres,"" he said, explaining that the microbe multiplies inside the tank as it gets fed the greenhouse gas.

Liquid containing the microbes is continuously extracted from the tank to be processed into the yellowish protein-rich powder with a flavour described as ""nutty"" and ""creamy"".

""The fermenter produces the same amount of protein per day as 300 milking cows or 50,000 laying hens,"" Vainikka said.

That equals ""five million meals' worth of protein per year"".

For now, the main purpose of the small Finnish plant employing around 40 people is to ""prove that the technology scales"", so it can attract the necessary investments pending European regulatory approval.

While the protein has been cleared for sale in Singapore where some restaurants have used it to make ice cream, it is still awaiting classification as a food product in the EU and the United States.

Eviden Poland team, part of the international Poland-Finland team, is on podium for second year in a row

Paris, May 23, 2024 - Eviden, the Atos Group business leading in digital, cloud, big data and security today announces that four of its cybersecurity experts based in Poland and two in Romania have participated in the largest international cyber defense exercise, ""Locked Shields 2024"", organized by the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence (CCDCOE) . Due to the company's capabilities and the expertise of its people, Eviden representatives from Poland contributed to the Poland-Finland team that was awarded 2nd place, following on from Poland's 3rd place ranking last year. This year also marks the 2nd consecutive participation of Romania, which teamed up with cybersecurity specialists from other countries.

The exercise took place between 22 - 26 April and brought together almost 4,000 military and civilian cyber defense professionals, from more than 40 nations. Locked Shields as a platform enables countries to exchange best practices, innovate strategies, and collectively improve their cyber incident response capabilities.

Eviden experts, through their participation in Locked Shields, have showcased a remarkable ability to navigate the complex cyber battleground, demonstrating resilience and strategic acumen in safeguarding digital fortresses. Their collective expertise has been pivotal in fortifying cyber defenses and fostering a culture of continuous learning and innovation.

Chris Moret, Global Head of Cybersecurity Services at Eviden, Atos Group: ""Eviden takes pride in our team's achievements showcased at Locked Shields 2024. Being part of such an important project underscores the caliber of expertise within our company and reaffirms our dedication to fortifying cyber defenses on a global scale"".

LtCol Urmet Tomp, Director of Locked Shields 2024: ""Every year, Locked Shields aims to push the boundaries of what can be achieved in cyber defence training, and 2024 has been no exception. The skills trained here directly translate to stronger national defences against real-world cyber threats, enhancing our collective security"".

Dr Mart Noorma, Director of the NATO CCDCOE: ""The purpose of the exercise is to help our nations develop their capabilities to face cyber threats as a coalition. We have real threats around us, and most of our participants came out of the trenches of real cyber warfare to participate in Locked Shields. I am confident they will go back defending their nations stronger than ever"".

Major General Engineer Gheorghe Iordache, Commander of the Cyber Defence Command, Romanian Ministry of National Defence: ""We need to strengthen the link with the private sector to face more easily certain challenges which, at one point, could exceed our possibilities of reaction. It is no secret that NATO is also trying to bring together military and civilian specialized institutions in order to have a common reaction and to have some common compatibilities regarding the threats coming from the cyber space.""

Together with colleagues from other countries, all Eviden experts proved the readiness of a fictitious country's defense structures against cyber-attacks targeting critical infrastructures. In addition to securing complex IT and operational systems, participating teams must be effective across a wide range of disciplines, including incident reporting and solving forensic, legal, media operations, and information warfare challenges.

The Eviden's cyber security experts from Romania - Sergiu-Andrei Chirlejan (Threat Hunting team) and Bogdan Irimia (Software Mediation team) - were part of the international defense team (also called ""Blue Team""). This year marked Romania's fourth consecutive participation, and 2nd for the Eviden Romania, teaming up with cybersecurity specialists from Bulgaria and Republic of Moldova. The Romanian team was coordinated by the Cyber Defense Agency within the Cyber Defense Command and consists of over 150 specialists from the national defense institutions, public order and national security system, but also from private companies active in the field, Eviden Romania being one of them.

From Poland, Bartosz Wawrzyniak (Threat Intelligence team), Piotr Mazurkiewicz (Computer Security Incident Response team), Damian Falatyn (Computer Security Incident Response team) and Michal Cichorz (Computer Security Incident Response team) were part of the Finland-Poland team. They were part of the team that took 2nd place, making it two years in a row they've reached podium success. For Poland, this was the 3rd participation in the exercise, this year jointly with a team of cybersecurity experts from Finland.

Their achievement was powered by Eviden's cloud-based Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR) investigator tooling, which proved valuable during the forensics investigation. The exercise's strength lies in its comprehensive approach, combining technical skills with strategic, legal, and communication expertise to develop a diverse defense strategy. The Poland team was coordinated by Cyberspace Defense Forces Component Command.

What is Locked Shields?

Locked Shields is the largest international Live Fire Exercise (LFX) in cyber-defense and is the most advanced in terms of technical expertise required. Participants are involved in a Red Team vs. Blue Team training exercise, where rapid response teams from NATO member states and partner countries help a fictitious country under a large-scale cyberattack to protect in real time computer networks of the government and critical national infrastructures (banking systems, gas and electricity distribution systems, satellite communication systems and 5G) against multiple and multidirectional cyber-attacks. Thus, teams can assess the ability to maintain functional systems in real situations and under special conditions.

The exercise is designed to train and test teams of specialists by engaging them in solving complex scenarios and massive cyber incidents under intense pressure, including the areas of strategic decision, legal, public communication, as well as the evaluation, based on score, of the ability of teams to adapt and protect their own networks.

The factory, which is set for completion by the end of 2025 and projected to cost €33 million, will convert food industry side streams into Enifer's sustainable PEKILO® fungi-based protein ingredients. The plant will be the world's first commercial plant to produce such a mycoprotein ingredient from sidestream raw materials.

The factory will produce up to 3,000 tons of PEKILO® a year, which is enough to cover the annual protein needs of approximately 40,000 people. The production of PEKILO® mycoprotein has a low carbon footprint and requires minimal land and water, making it a very sustainable alternative to animal and plant proteins.

The new funding package comprises a new €15 million Series B equity funding round led by the Finnish private equity fund Taaleri Bioindustry Fund I, with follow-on investments from existing shareholders Nordic Foodtech VC, Voima Ventures, and Valio. This funding is complemented by the Finnish Climate Fund, which has extended a €7 million junior loan to support the project and a €2 million Climate and Environmental Loan provided by Finnvera. This funding comes on top of the previously reported €12 million recycling and reuse investment grant from Business Finland, making the factory fully funded.

""We are very happy to start cooperation with Enifer. We believe that there is an increased need for alternative proteins as the global population grows. Demand is also supported globally by environmental and ethical considerations. Taaleri Bioindustry Fund I's investment enables commercial scale production. We are confident in Enifer's opportunities to expand,"" commented Tero Saarno, Managing Director, Taaleri Bioindustry.

""The world's population and the need for protein are growing. Food production is - even at the level of technologies that can already be scaled - an unsolved key part of the climate challenge. In the future, sustainable food production will be based on several different solutions and the demand for new types of proteins is predicted to grow significantly over the next decade. Enifer's already tested technology is interesting as the nutrients of various side streams can be upcycled and their processing value increased instead of energy use,"" the Finnish Climate Fund's acting CEO Toni Mikkonen described the funding decision.

The factory will be built as a brownfield project within an existing industrial building in Kantvik, Kirkkonummi, Finland. The site bordering the Baltic Sea is only a 30-minute drive from Helsinki city center and Enifer's existing R&D facilities. The site also offers the upcoming factory with all the required utilities, including steam, electricity, process and cooling water, and waste-water treatment. The factory will begin ramping up operations in 2026, and once it is at full capacity, it will produce 500 kilograms per hour of mycoprotein.

PEKILO® mycoprotein is produced by cultivating a specific species of fungus in a fermentation process that is not too distinct from brewing beer or making soy sauce. The produced PEKILO® mycoprotein powder contains a lot of high-quality protein and fiber. It is also neutral in color and taste, making it an excellent source of nutrition in the most diverse food applications. Enifer and its partners have already demonstrated its use across meat and dairy alternatives, baking, pastries and snacks.

At its core, the factory will harbor a full-sized industrial fermenter, standing more than 12 meters tall and measuring more than 4.5 meters in diameter, in which the PEKILO® mycoprotein is grown. The factory will directly employ some 15 people during regular operations and more than twice this number during construction and commissioning.

The PEKILO® fermentation process was originally developed in Finland in the 1970s and used to upcycle forest industry side streams into feed-grade mycoprotein. Enifer has breathed new life into this unique innovation, adapting it to new raw material streams from food and agricultural industries and developing a food-grade version of the mycoprotein ingredient.

PEKILO mycoprotein is made by growing a specific type of fungus through fermentation, similar to brewing beer or making soy sauce. The resulting powder is rich in high-quality protein and fibre and it has a neutral colour and taste. This makes it a versatile ingredient for many foods.

Enifer and its partners have already used it in meat and dairy alternatives, baking, pastries, and snacks.

The PEKILO fermentation process was created in Finland in the 1970s to turn forest industry by-products into animal feed. Enifer has updated this process to use by-products from the food and agriculture industries, making a food-grade version of the mycoprotein.

The company plans to apply for Novel Foods approval in 2024 and expects to get approval by 2026.

Simo Ellilä, CEO and co-founder of Enifer says, ""At Enifer, we're extremely excited to announce the kick-off of our first factory investment project. For over half a century, Kantvik has been at the heart of Finnish bioindustries, and I could not think of a better location to bring PEKILO fermentation back to life.""

""I would like to thank our new investors, in particular Taaleri Bioindustry and the Finnish Climate Fund, for joining us in our mission.""

""Mycoprotein is the missing ingredient for a more sustainable food chain - the facility in Kantvik serves as a key steppingstone on our path to making mycoprotein a cornerstone of protein supply, with several future factories already being planned.""

Enifer is a company born at the VTT Technical Research Centre in Finland. It was started by five scientists in 2020 to improve and commercialise the PEKILO technology. The founders include Simo Ellilä, Joosu Kuivanen, Heikki Keskitalo, Ville Pihlajaniemi and Anssi Rantasalo.

Originally used by the Finnish forest industry, PEKILO turns waste into high-protein mycoprotein.

The European Commission, which is examining the deal, sent a questionnaire to the companies' rivals and customers this month, asking for replies early this week, the person said. EEX is Europe's leading electricity and natural gas exchange, serving 800 participants.

""One dedicated section in the questionnaire is about conglomerate effects,"" the person said, referring to the impact on competition from the merger of two companies in closely related but not competing markets.

""The Commission would like to understand whether the merged entity could use its strong position in one market to increase its market position in markets of similar products,"" the person said.

The questionnaire asked if the merged entity might do this by offering products only as part of bundles for a fixed fee or making the sale of one product conditional on the sale of another related one, the person said.

The Commission, which last year said the merged company could have an incentive to raise trading fees or worsen conditions for market participants, declined to comment.

The questionnaire also asked about the impact of the deal on prices and the barriers for rivals to enter the market, the person said.

EEX and Nasdaq in their response to the Commission last year said the deal posed no significant threat to competition in Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Norway or any other EU country, that it would not eliminate competition between the two companies, and that market reaction had been positive.

Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to The Navigator Company conference call and webcast for the first quarter results. Joining us today are the following Directors, Antonio Redondo, Fernando Araujo, Nuno Santos, Joao Le, Dorival Almeida, and Antonio Quirino Soares. As usual, we will start with a brief presentation, and we will have a Q&A session at the end. The presentation can be accessed through the links available on the website, and questions may be addressed also through the webcast platform. Antonio, we will start by commenting on the main highlights of the quarter. I hand over to Antonio.

Antonio Redondo

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us once again today. I'm very happy to be here and to share with you our first quarter results. As we will see in today's presentation, the resilience of Navigator's business model and our strong financial position has enabled to present the highest result for a first quarter in the company's history. I will start with Slide 4 for a global overview of the year. The first quarter of 2024 got off to a very positive start. As pulp and paper demand continued to improve, a trend already seen in the second half of last year.

Pulp and paper prices increased quarter-on-quarter, driven by dynamic demand, a relatively slim pipeline, significant backlogs from key pulp suppliers and several supply constraints.

For example, logistical restrictions in the Red Sea and other areas of the globe, strikes in Finland and several incidents and limitations of supply around the world. Navigator recorded a total turnover of EUR 536 million, the highest result achieved in the first quarter, up 9% from the last quarter and up 7% year-on-year. EBITDA stood at EUR 133 million, keeping a strong EBITDA margin of 25%.

Navigator has implemented price increases for uncoated woodfree paper. And actually, from November when prices in Europe and in overseas markets started to move upwards again to April. Navigators and uncoated woodfree price increased by around 3% in Europe, actually 4% outside Iberia and 9% in overseas markets and the total of 5% for our sales mix. Regarding cash costs, we again recorded a significant reduction year-on-year in all segments from 9% to 16%.

While staying focused on our diversification plan, the first quarter Navigator launched and offer to acquire Accrol, a leading independent converter in the U.K.'s consumer tissue market. The bid is already approved by Accrol shareholders and will become effective this week on May 24. With the integration of Accrol, we anticipate consolidated turnover in the tissue segment of around EUR 518 million, doubling the segment's turnover. We will give further details later in the presentation. Fernando will start with the main financial highlights. Fernando, please go ahead.

Fernando Araujo

Thank you, Antonio. Turning to Slide 5. As mentioned, turnover stood at EUR 536 million a result for the first quarter, 9% quarter-on-quarter and 7% year-on-year. CapEx totaling EUR 41 million, similar to the 2023 figure of which approximately 32% was certified as a value environment or sustainability invested. We maintain a consistent conservative financial policy with a net debt EBITDA ratio at 0.88%. Once again, the flexibility of our business model, adjusting production to demand, fixed and various cost mentioned, commercial performance and activity adjustments business with 4 diseases in protecting margins and stabilizing results.

Actually, if we turn to Slide 6, you can see that in the last 9 quarters with the exception of the refinery T2 to T4 set period. Our EBITDA margin varies between EUR 122 million BRL 133 million. Is remarkable for a cyclical industry in an increasing volatile work. Focused on Slide 6. This quarter, we recorded higher sales volume. The volume of better sales stood at 355,000 tonnes, up 10% under the first quarter with sales in value growing by 12%. Year-on-year, we received an increase of 29% in dollar and 9% in [indiscernible] up sales reached 110,000 tonnes, up 30% quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year, while the value of the sale was 28% quarter-on-quarter and down 2% year-on-year. To be noted that Navigator is not only a very efficient paper producer, but also one of the most efficient of provision in the year.

The volume of tissue sales stood at 38,000 tonnes, down by 6% quarter-on-quarter due to lower production available, which affects sales and up by 59% year-on-year, driven by the integration of Navigator Tissue Ejea. In values, sales grew by 41% year-on-year and there was a downward correction of 12% in relation to the previous quarter. My colleagues will be more [Indiscernible] on the performance subsidies individual business. Turning now to Slide 7. We can take a good look as the main impact on [Indiscernible] in a year-on-year comparison.

This quarter, the downward cost of price reputed by the dynamics of the post market was more than offset by increase in volumes and a reduction in cash costs. We remain focused on managing cash by improving purchase price indication and optimizing consumption, especially of fiber, including wood and chemicals as well as logistic but also on continued efforts to contain fixed costs. As a result, as Antonio mentioned, this quarter, we have recorded again a reduction in cash costs in relation to the same period in 2023 by between 9% and 16% or 4.5%, breaking and writing tissue and paper.

Total fixed costs ended the period 5% higher than the same period in 2023 due to the inclusion of the tissue at a higher unit and renewal of the [Indiscernible] program.

In this context, Navigator exceeds an EBITDA of EUR 133 million in the first quarter.

Turning to Slide 8. We have an announced quarterly EBITDA versus last quarter. Quarter-on-quarter, box-sales volumes and market price increased, driven by a strong order book and the positive evolution of BHKP, which roughly leads, Nuno will comment on later session.

In the paper and tissue segment, downward rent cost per month with reductions between 4% and 5% following the top segment costs remain stable. It should be noted that first quarter of 2024 was impacted by the grid in the Red Sea personal change to Latin American notes and proving freight rates to buy worldwide. Despite these constraints, Navigator managed to keep maritime track [Indiscernible]. Quirino will now comment on both prices.

Quirino, please?

Antonio Quirino Soares

Thank you, Fernando. Moving to Slide 10. We have the evolution of pulp and paper. The first quarter of 2024 ended with a benchmark index for hardwood pulp, PIX BHKP, rising to USD 1,242 per ton. Since the start of the year, pulp prices have grown by approximately 22%, and everything suggests they will continue upwards at least over the next quarter, currently at USD 1,381 per ton, which is the highest nominal value ever reached and an increase to EUR 1,440 , which has been announced, which should be reached in the next few weeks.

Prices in China mirrored the development in Europe, reaching a net USD 684 at the end of the quarter, up 5% since the start of the year 2024. The benchmark index for office paper prices in Europe, PIX A4 B-copy ended the quarter at EUR 1105 per ton, up by 1% from the start of the year, which was EUR 1,093 per ton. Moving to Slide 11.

We have summarized the main developments in uncoated woodfree. The upward course of demand observed in the second half of last year continued during this first quarter. The pulp global demand for printing and writings grew by 0.3% in the first quarter at March with stronger demand for uncoated woodfree papers, which was up by 0.8% in contract contrasts to coated woodfree papers, which were down by 1.2%. Demand for paper produced from mechanical pulp grew by 0.3%.

In Europe, in particular, the pulp demand for uncoated woodfree paper grew significantly up by about 10% this quarter, with the folio segment as the top performer at 20% growth. But also the office paper segment, which, in principle, would be more vulnerable to the trend towards digitalization, presented also office paper, a growth of 10%, while realms grew by 5% year-on-year.

As a result, the positive trend in the pace of new orders in the second half of 2023 continued in the first quarter of this year with an order-to-capacity ratio, reaching 90% versus 70% in the first half of last year and 80% in the second half of 2022.Moving to the U.S., demand dropped by about 1%. The parent uncoated woodfree consumption in other world regions grew by 1% in February with China recording an impressive 12% year-on-year, which compares to the compound annual growth rate historically of 5.8% since '21 to '24.

As just mentioned, the benchmark for office paper prices in Europe recorded the modest increase. Nevertheless, the average sales price in navigates paper segment to show strongly, up by around 2% quarter-on-quarter. Significantly, as Antonio mentioned, from November to April Navigator's uncoated woodfree price increased by around 3% in Europe, 4% outside Iberia in Europe and 9% in overseas markets, which gives a total of 5% increase for the total sales mix.

It should be noted that paper total turnover for Navigator continues at a high-level this quarter. In challenging markets, own brands and high-value segments provide extra protection for Navigator's results. Nuno will give some market context. Nuno?

Nuno Santos

Thank you, Quirino. Turning to Slide 12. As Quirino mentioned, the first half of '24 witnessed a significant and rapid increase in pulp prices. Supply and demand dynamic was decisive for the increase in prices. China remains the driving force behind the recovery, thanks to new paper, packaging and tissue capacity, which started in the second half of '23, around close to 1 million tonnes of printing and writing paper, 1 million tons of virgin fiber-based packaging and 1 million tonnes of tissue. Focal, the developed economies have also presented growth in hardwood demand due to the performance of downstream markets, especially in Europe, up 4.2% in February versus last year. Performance at end consumers in Europe was better than expected, especially in the printing and writing paper industry, where order books grew substantially.

On the supply side, logistical constraints in the Red Sea, constraints on supply in Canada, the strike in Finland and the unavailability of output from one of the largest pulp mills of a leading player, METSA, also in Finland due to an incident at the production unit, put upwards pressure on long fiber prices, adding further to the substitution of long fiber by short fiber.

This situation was aggravated already this quarter with supply limitations in Latin America due to port strikes in Chile and floods in Brazil and in Asia with a boiler explosion as well.At the same time, further pressure on prices has stemmed from the structural increase in pulp production costs, which continue to incorporate very significant increases in wood, chemicals, freight and labor in relation to pre-pandemic levels. These rising costs are having a more severe impact in Latin America, Scandinavia and Canada than in Portugal.

On the other hand, the year started with stocks at low levels, above all at ports in Europe, but also at manufacturers. The level of stocks at European ports remains below the average for the past 5 years. In China's stocks at ports increased over the quarter, explained mostly by the fact that much of the volumes traded in the second half of '23 arrived only in the first quarter, somewhat behind scale. These late deliveries have also helped sustain higher prices and price increases. Looking now at Slide 13, the tissue performance.

Demand for tissue paper showed positive dynamics at the start of '24. After a period of destocking in the first month of '23, the first 2 months of '24 saw growth of 2% in Europe. Navigator's International sales outside Portugal accounted for 71% of turnover. The Spanish market took the largest share with 42% of our tissue sales followed by France with 23% in the U.K., which accounted for roughly 4% of sales.

Finished goods represented 94% of our total versus 87% in the first quarter last year. And [indiscernible] of course, represented the remaining 6% versus the 13% last year. In terms of client segments, at home or consumer retail business, has grown in importance currently accounting for around 80% [Indiscernible] while away from home and Cash & Carry account for the remaining 20%. In 2016, the split was actually 36% for consumer and 64% for the remaining segments.

Navigator's focus on innovation and differentiation continues to be welcomed by [indiscernible] with sales of Milbrands growing by 11% year-on-year in the first quarter of '24, strongly driven by our retail business, where growth of these brands stood at 25%. To be noted that versus 2006 Milbrand doubled in volume, more than doubled in volumes. Dorival will now comment on the main development in packaging.

Dorival Almeida

Thank you, Nuno. After a challenging year in 2023 with a drop in business in several segments, European market has started to show signs of recovery in 2024. Segments where we operate grew by 14% year-on-year. In this context, Navigator's packaging business enjoyed stronger and more consistent demand in the main segments. At the same time, as a positive impact can already be seen from the move into several new segments, above all within flexible packaging.

The process of trials and market placement is still underway, consists of a large-scale approach to new clients backed up by more than 250 market trials to date in a commercial operation, 100% based on Navigator's on brand, J-Craft. In addition, with regard to the project for integrated production of eucalyptus molded pulp products designed to replace single-use plastic and alumin packaging in the food service and food packaging market continues to progress, and production is planned to start up in the second half of '24 under the J-Craft, Beer Shield brand.

The new industrial facility will have production capacity for approximately 100 million units a year, making it the largest integrated unit with 100% eucalyptus fiber in Europe, moving to a fast-growing, high potential market. Operations will start with 4 products for the food sector and the new mill offers production flexibility and scalability in order to exploit the various opportunists opening up for replacing plastics. Moving on to Slide 15 to comment briefly on CapEx. This first quarter, the CapEx investment reached EUR 41 million as Fernando mentioned, of which approximately EUR 13 million were ESG investment accounting for 2% of the total.

The CapEx amount focused mainly on project for decarbonization, production capacity maintenance, plant modernization, efficiency improvement as well as the structure and safety projects. The main projects include the new high-efficiency recovery boiler in Setubal, the new bleaching tower in Washing presses in Aveiro pulp mill, the new fossil free line kiln in Fiera using biomass as fuel, the conversion of the Setubal and kiln to burn biomass and the new solar energy plant in Federados.

As already mentioned in last quarters, Navigator will continue with a high level of value-added investment in order to improve the environmental performance of our sites and implement our strategy for developing a packaging business.

Taking advantage of the next-generation funds that is mandatory to be completed by the end of 2025.For eligible investments, there is an incentive rate of around 40%. Thus Navigator will receive over EUR 100 million in gains, EUR 24 million already received of which EUR 3 million this quarter. To conclude, these investments embrace our sustainability commitment, but also our innovation and diversification efforts to increase efficiency, improve and sustain our results. Fernando will comment on our financial position.

Fernando Araujo

Thank you, Dorival. On Slide 16, the debt maturity profile. Group debt profile remains positive. Navigator has well balanced there remain 5% of total debt issue on the state enabled to maintain growth and anchor in a scenario of slightly rising in U.S. Also, it is worth noting that the company has a solid balance sheet of close to EUR 150 million of liquidity, both a long-term and use credit lines and cash on main, allowing us to [indiscernible] from one.

After the disbursement resulting from marginal equation operation mentioned, in addition to the long-term finance agreement with European investment and of EUR 115 million, which can be drawn in 3 renting in 12 years. New long-term green financial operations have already been signed in order to maintain enables financial CA with balance maturities and wanted to sustainable impact. We will now hand over to Joao.

Joao Le

Thank you, Fernando. Turn to Slide 17, please. Navigator is fully committed to sustainability. And in this slide, we highlight some of our 2023 numbers, dedicated not only to environmental but also social and governance business transformation, innovation and diversification. My colleagues have mentioned during the presentation, a few actions taken that demonstrate our continued work in all sustainability dimensions.

In particular, Dorival just mentioned sustainable investments, but also Michael League highlighted our focus on optimizing consumption and innovation across all segments. We are committed to creating sustainable value for our shareholders and for society in the world.

Leading future generation is a better planet through natural recycled volume via the ratable social products and solutions that contribute to government segregation, oxygen production biodiversity protection, so information and an climate.

Turn to Slide 18, please. The different initiatives and projects undertaken of the year include the Navigator forestry processes club, a pioneering and unique scheme for strengthening the relations with its partners and making an important contribution to a significant increase in port forestry yields and [indiscernible] by disseminating sustainable and active management practices in the country's woodlands.

With the slogan, working together for the forest, Navigator forestry pores plus set up to support our forestry sectors partners on a collaborative basis in implementing active and responsible forestry management. The technological platform is used to provide agent acceleration solutions, a central purchasing unit and Pari range and benefits in addition to direct access to programs supporting production, provision of forest management tools, training and also co-investment opportunities.

By increasing the area of land in Portugal on which best forestry are applied in all certification requirements are complied with the project will bring benefits that extend well beyond a stronger eucalyptus sector. It will also contribute to lower fire risk less CO2 emissions increased biodiversity with more conservation areas and to a more dynamic economy in inland regions of Portugal.

Since November 2023, that [indiscernible] grown to more than 100 members, representing around EUR 400 million and EUR 1,845 direct crops, creating value planned in the future. I will now hand over to Antonio.

Antonio Redondo

Thank you. Let's please turn to Slide 19 with a wrap-up of the Q1 results. It's not enough to underline that we again achieved solid results despite market volatility, in fact, the highest results for the first quarter. As mentioned, 2024 got off to a positive start with a significant increase in demand for pulp, paper and tissue. We registered strong order books and positive evolution in prices across all segments.

Also, Navigator encore paper prices increase has been implemented and a significant drop in cash costs was achieved, thanks to purchase price negotiations and better consumption efficiency, especially for fiber, chemicals and logistics. We also continue to proceed with our diversification plan. This quarter, we launched an offer to acquire Accrol, a leading independent tissue converters in U.K. approved by Accrol shareholders that will become effective this week by May to 24.

This acquisition will enable us to roughly double our tissue business. And in the Packaging segment, the molded pulp project proceeds as planned. In the meanwhile, we have again demonstrated the consistency of our conservative financial policies, maintaining our sustainability and investment commitment. Let's turn to Slide 21 with a glance of new business opportunities. Going forward, our sound financial position allows us to consider opportunities for debottlenecking in our core business, investing in efficiency and innovation, as already mentioned by Dorival.

Navigator remains committed to sustainability investment and innovation plans in all segments in which it operates. As already mentioned, in the second half of 2024, we will start up an innovative unit for the integrated production of molded eucalyptus savino designed to replace single-use plus packaging and aluminum in the foodservice and food packaging market with the start-up scheduled as mentioned for the second half of this year.

For a medium to long-term perspective, we are still looking into the attractiveness of investing in Greenford, both be of full in the shorter term and if or synthetic falls afterwards. And our R&D program is moving forward to explore and develop new bioproducts from eucalyptus waters with a vast range of applications in different industries, such as the automobile sector, textiles, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics and the food industry and actually even for the defense segment.

In particular, in the tissue business, this quarter, we took a step forward in our diversification strategy, as already mentioned. I will now hand over to Nuno to comment exactly this Accrol acquisition.

Nuno Santos

Thank you, Antonio. Let's then turn to Slide 22. As Antonio just said, Accrol represents a step forward in our strategy for sustained expansion of our tissue business, namely in the Western European market. Accrol has a strong alignment and convergence of values with Navigator, namely with sustainability, product quality and innovation and service level excellence. With a leading position in the U.K. private label market with 12% market share in the overall consumer tissue market and 22% market share in the private level segment and operating on an import parity market based on reels.

This acquisition will enable us to grow, providing greater scale in the business and more diversification. With 2 new tissue segments, wet wipes and facials, as well as providing synergies with our tissue business. With the integration of Accrol, we anticipate consolidated turnover in the tissue business of around EUR 580 million, close to EUR 600 million with the U.K. market expected to contribute to around 50% of total tissue turnover. I will now hand over to Antonio, who will wrap up with a few words on the outlook.

Antonio Redondo

Thank you, Nuno. Let's please turn to Slide 24. The current geopolitical tensions, which have created high complex situation in industrial and logistical operations are leading to increased volatility in international markets, reducing at the same time visibility. That said, for Q2 2024, the favorable evolution of demand in pulp business is expected to continue in spite uncertainties. The new capacity coming online, 2.6 million tons per year is expected to have a relatively slow ramp-up.

Having said that, we expect a long cycle of above average pulp prices due to the increase in the industry's cost base in relation to pre-pandemic levels as well as increased CapEx, both in new forest plantations and investor development and no further relevant increase in supply during at least a good part of 3 years. In the paper segment in Europe, paper prices could benefit for a more balanced market structure that, combined with strong pressure on costs, is so far resulting in paper price increases.

In fact, capacity reductions, restrictions on imports from outside Europe, which will continue both for logistical reasons and due to compliance with PSC regulations and structural increases in the cost base will certainly lead to price increases even in scenarios of reduced demand. To highlight that, Navigator announced a price increase for all uncoated free papers by up to 5% in Europe that has been fully implemented in the lease prices since the beginning of April, and this will be followed in May and June by upward revisions of deals with fixed monthly costly price.

Additionally, as a result of the continued rise in oil prices, it is likely that we will implement another increase during Q3. The second quarter started with stronger prices, but a slowdown in order book growth, which is '23. Q2 started with stronger prices. However, the recent decrease in order inflow and above all, the seasonal sold-down in Q2 and especially Q3, will bring likely volumes down, but paper volumes at Danvers are expected to be clearly above 2022 levels.

In the tissue segment, demand continues to rise at interesting levels and growth of 2.6% is estimated for Europe during 2024. Tissue prices should continue to reflect the evolution of input cost. Example for the pulp price solution and in fact, Navigator announced an 8% to 10% price increase for May. In this segment, Navigator continues to leverage synergies driven by business growth, particularly with the acquisition of Navigator Tissue Ejea and growing with the new acquisition of Accrol.

Business and diversification to tissue, operational flexibility between paper and pulp market mix at the [Indiscernible], production adjustment and efficient merci strategy, combined with rigorous programs to control costs as well as the company's strong financial position have enabled us to deliver consistently strong and stable results in changing and volatile market context.

We are confident that all these factors in parallel with the continuous development of both our packaging and energy businesses will continue to point to the resilience of Navigator's model.

Thank you.

Ana Canha

Thank you. And to this ends our presentation. We are now open for the Q&A session.

Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Enrique Parrondo from JB Capital.

Enrique Parrondo

I have 3. The first one on the outlook for paper specifically on this slowdown that you're expecting, sequential slowdown from high levels into the second quarter and the remainder of the year. Maybe could you give us some color on what volume expectations and what sort of declines are you seeing? And what makes you so confident on price increases for the third quarter based on this declining order books?

Second one is on Accrol's acquisition. I know it's still early in the process, but you even mentioned in the presentation, leverage synergies for the group. If my understanding is correctly, I believe that these will be largely cost focused, yet they will rely on CapEx investments to boost tissue reel production later than be integrated into our gross converting capacity. Maybe you could give us some sort of guidance on CapEx expectations.

Is this correct? And what sort of synergies could we expect? That will be helpful.

And the final one on financing. How should we think of the 2024 and 2025 maturities and your liquidity position after the acquisition of the Accrol Group?

Antonio Redondo

Okay. Thank you very much, Enrique, for your interest for the sake of clarity, I'm going to repeat the 3 questions just to make sure that we fully understood them, okay? So, your first question is about outlook for paper slow down. How do we see this slow down? How confident we are with the volumes and the price increases that we are either implementing or considering to implement.

Enrique Parrondo

That's correct, yes.

Antonio Redondo

Your second question is about leveraging Accrol synergies. So, the basis for those synergies and you'd like to have communication of potential CapEx investment to produce other rules to convert at Accrol?

Enrique Parrondo

That's right.

Antonio Redondo

And the third question is about financing and how do we see our maturity position in '24 or '25 solving across acquisition?

Enrique Parrondo

That's right, yes.

Antonio Redondo

Okay. I'm going to give comments for the first 2 questions. I'd like Quirino to complement the first, Nuno to complement on the second, and I'll ask Fernando to answer the third question. Regarding the first question, we actually see this slowdown. This slowdown is also somewhat related to the summer that is approaching, and there is always seasonality over the summer. Anyhow, we have assisted on that in previous calls and in this call once again.

The visibility is shorter and shorter. So, there is not a huge visibility that we can share, but we can share and we, of course, not change guidance that we can share with you what we see.We anticipate that Q2 will not be volume-wise materially different from Q1, but will be significantly above Q2 last year. And hopefully, prices on Q2 also will not be very different from what we have been achieving so far.

Eventually, we have mentioned implementation of another price increase in Q3.Why are we confident? Because the cost base of the industry has significantly increased on the pulp, and we can touch that around.

We have already alluded to that during the call on pulp, but also on paper. So, even in a scenario where the market is eventually not as buoyant in Q2 and in Q3, like it was in Q4 last year and Q1 this year, the pressure to increase prices through all the producers is increasing. So, we are confident that the prices will go through as they have been going through at least for us and as we mentioned, an action in this situation. Quirino, do you want to add something, please?

Antonio Quirino Soares

Just a note on imports. So, we continue to see a reduction in the form on units, which also is part of the equation. So, we see up to March, the latest figure is a reduction of around 12% in imports. So, this comes with the trend from last year, so it adds to the reduction of last year and goes in the same direction of, let's say, creating better condition for the price increase as well.

Antonio Redondo

Regarding Accrol, a couple of comments. Of course, this acquisition is different from the acquisition we did last year in Ejea in terms of synergies. But we believe that we will have some operational synergies. And on top of that, you have 2 basic synergies that will be relevant. One is, this is a listed company that we will obviously consider to delist. And on top of that, we have synergies by reducing the management of Accrol.

Indeed, Accrol opens the opportunity and the possibility to develop further materials capacity to convert into a coal. There is no decision yet if and when to do this CapEx investments. And, of course, there are synergies on this investment also depending where we will do the investment. Investment can be done in Portugal or it can be done in one of the other 2 locations we have today, we have tissue assets. So, yes, it opens a possibility. Yes, this is something that we will study, but we are far from taking a decision and any kind of CapEx amount and synergies coming from this investment will very much depend on where the investments will be.

Nuno Santos

I mean I just can reiterate basically what Antonio said. In fact, as you said, it's too early yet to estimate synergies, so I will not contradict you, and I will not share any numbers at this stage. On the cost synergies, yes, Antonio mentioned 2 examples, the delisting of Accrol and the top management, of course, that we can also make shorter in terms of our overhead of Accrol's business.

In terms of the new paper machine that we can build, you know that Accrol sources entirely, it's model. It does not have any production of paper machine of paper of mother reels. So, it sources 100% of its needs. We, of course, one possibility, as Antonio mentioned, is to build a new paper machine.

And this will have relevant synergies. I can illustrate some of them. So, if we do it next to an already existing paper machine of hours, it will have natural synergies of operating next to an existing machine. If we will do it integrated with one of our pulp mills, it will have the integration together with the pulp operations. So, not needing to dry the pulp not to transport a pulp. And if we will build it here, we will have a dedicated logistics operation fully dedicated to the U.K. and to Accrol, which also we estimate will have relevant synergies.

We also understand that by having a fully dedicated paper machine, not only we will have higher efficiency and output in our machine, but also we will be able to improve the output and the efficiency of the Accrol converting line because we'll be able to have to source and to use wider paper. So, there's a series of synergies that I just illustrated associated with building a new paper machine, our paper machine together integrated with our pulp mills.

Finally, there's also some relevant potential synergies on the sales commercial side. Accrol is present in 2 segments that we are not facials and wet wipes, and we will obviously try to explore that and see if we can have and find some cross-selling opportunities related especially to these 2 product segments.

Fernando Araujo

Investments and commercials, I think, as you can see on Slide 16, our average maturity is 3 years. We expect by the end of the year to be even above these 3 years, at least 3.3 years for instance. At the end of 2025, we expect to be in the same 3 years. I want to stress that we have used our liquidity to buy Accrol. This means we didn't go to the market to have extra funds for that.

Nevertheless, we have signed several agreements. One is already communicated to the market since last December. This one with the European Investment Bank with a maturity of 12 years. And we have recently signed but not issued yet more bank agreements and between 5 and 7 years. This means that in our size, maturity, it's not an issue, liquidity neither. And in what concerns net to EBITDA ratio, we do not expect never to in the next time to exceed the 2x, but we expect to be below that in [Indiscernible].

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Bruno Bessa from Caixa Bank BPI.

Bruno Bessa

I have 3, if I may. The first focuses on the paper price evolution and the gap to hope. So, what we have been seeing is a relevant reduction in terms of the price gap between paper and pulp in Europe already below the historical average. My question here is trying to understand if you see room for capacity shutdowns in the short term? And if there are any kind of rumors of the potential new shutdowns being announced over the coming quarters because of this. So, this will be the first question.

The second question, if you could explain a bit the numbers of Accrol because if I'm not wrong, I think that in 2024, there will be some sales decline when compared to 2023 but margins will be significantly higher.

I think that from slightly more than 6% to around 11% on your projections. So, it will be interesting to understand what are the drivers behind this evolution? And the third question, it's true that margins apparently will improve significantly in 2024, but they will still be according to my calculations below those margins of Navigator's tissue business. My question here is, if you believe that Accrol could reach those margins of Navigator's current tissue business in the short term, meaning before any additional CapEx to build a new paper machine to vertically integrate this company. I don't know if you hear my questions.

Antonio Redondo

Yes. I'm trying to repeat them, just to make sure that we fully understand. The first question was about paper price evolution gap to pulp. You noticed the gap being reduced. And consequently, you'd like to know if we believe there is room for further capacity shutdowns in the short term? Or actually, if there are some market rumors on that?

Bruno Bessa

Correct.

Antonio Redondo

Second question is about the numbers for Accrol. You believe that sales declined vis-a-vis 2023, but margins increased vis-a-vis 2023?

Bruno Bessa

Correct. If you could explain.

Antonio Redondo

Okay. And the third question is that, although margins have improved in 2024 in your view, vis-a-vis 2023, if we see that the bridge to Navigator's margins will be reduced without further CapEx?

Bruno Bessa

That's correct.

Antonio Redondo

Okay. So, I will make introductory comments for the first 3 questions. I will ask Quirino to comment further on the first, and Nuno to comment on the second and the third. Regarding the gap, yes, indeed, the gap is linked with the fact that pulp has a more nervous commodity typically react quicker to increases and decreases of prices and paper and tissue probably even slower. They react slower than pulp. So, it's normal that during at least a period of time, those margins sometimes are amplified when the cycle goes down and they are reduced when the cycle goes up.

And, yes, indeed, there are not only rumors, but I believe already an announcement of a shutdown in U.S.A. of 1 mill. Actually, a mill that was already shutting down and due to a very good demand in the recent period started up again, but the mill is likely noncompetitive, and it will be again shut down. Quirino will know the figures better than I do, but I think we are speaking about short of 200,000 tonnes, 170,000 to 180,000 tonnes.

Further than that, to be honest, and, of course, the reduction that happened in Germany end of last year, beginning of this year, I don't have any further indications from the market of any capacity shutdowns, but probably K&S.

Antonio Quirino Soares

Well, we have the same information. So, the gaps, yes, they tend to be high with some that will move on the pole side. Today's situation is not the first time it happens in such a narrowing of the gap. So, we have seen it in previous cycles, like '18 or even '21, '22. So, this is not a new situation. Concerning the capacity reductions, indeed, the U.S.

yield that Antonio mentioned, indeed, 170,000 tonnes, reducing capacity in the U.S. So, this is an important contribution to balance the market over there.

And in Europe, indeed, there was a shutdown, in Germany, relevant shutdown, particularly affecting the region, Central of Europe and one specific product, portfolio sheets. It was relevant in that segment. But other than that, there is no news, and I would not do any comment on that.

Antonio Redondo

Regarding the second and third question, I'll try probably to answer them more or less in conjunction. We cannot comment the numbers of Accrol for the year 2024. The year ended in April figures are not yet published and comments, so, I cannot comment that. I can comment based on the first 6 months results that are public. Regarding margins, yes, it's normal that in 2024, margins are higher than in 2023 because in 2023, remember, Accrol a converter. They buy mother reels.

Mother reels prices are very much linked with pulp prices. Pulp prices have been reducing through 2023 and actually increasing again in the last part of 2023 early 2024. So, it's normal that they bought mother reels at a better price in 2024 fiscal year than in 2023. So, margins have consequently improved. And as you know, this is very much linked to the gap in between selling price of tissue, which is, again, as we said before, more stable than the commodity price that is linked to the mother reels.

Regarding the evolution of margins into Accrol, again, we cannot provide you any guidance. But don't forget, Accrol is a converter. And even the best of converters, and we believe Accrol is one of the best, if not the best converter is typically your margin that is somewhere between 50% to 100% smaller than a margin of an integrated producer with the tissue machines. So, if we have a margin, let's say, of 16% for an integrated producer of tissue machines and converted, might have probably 8% to 12%.

So, Accrol has the margins of a converter, not an integrated producer. So, I think it's very difficult to anticipate that without further CapEx in tissue machine, those margins will approach the merge of an integrated producer like ourselves.

Nuno Santos

I just confirm what you said. I mean 1 or 2 notes here? Yes, indeed, '24 numbers in terms of sales top line will most likely be reduced versus '23, but be aware that they will be much higher than what happened in '22 and '21 their top line. And again, as Antonio mentioned, this is due to a better management, let's say, of the equation of price reels, price of sale. What happened is that Accrol was able to have a wider margin and not passing through to downstream, again, it was able to achieve upstream in terms of mother reels sourcing.

So, this optimization of margin in terms of price of sales versus price of mother reels will be key, and we hope to continue to do a good management of this margin. And again, this is the number. Normal tissue EBITDA margins in converting are around 8%.

Accrol for sure, will present soon higher margins than that. It actually had presented the most recent EBITDA margins were higher than 8%.As Antonio mentioned, typical integrated, integrated, meaning not both, meaning the paper machine and converting operations. EBITDA margins of these type of players are around 16%. You can only do that because you invested in CapEx and you are producing your own mother reel, your own paper.

So, it is not possible to ask for a converting operation to present the same EBITDA margins that you can have with a paper and converting operations as it is not possible to ask a tissue operation to present the EBITDA margin with the pulp operation integrated. So, basically, this is it. Of course, if we follow what we have discussed earlier about integrating and building a paper machine, we will, for sure, increase the EBITDA margins of overall our tissue business.

Antonio Quirino Soares

Let me just add something on I think we have mentioned that in previous calls, but I think for the sake of the discussions we are having it might be interesting to remember. When we speak about an integrated margin of tissue of 16% and when you compare this with an integrated margin of graphic paper coaters and coats, you name it, of course, 16% on tissue in terms of euros per ton of margin is significantly above the same 16% in uncoated woodfree just because the pricing between uncoated woodfree or coated woodfree and tissue is almost 1% to 2%. So, the same percentage margin equates in much higher euros per ton in tissue than in printing and writing papers.

The next question comes from the line of Antonio Seladas from AS Independent Research.

António Seladas

So, I just have 2 and one clarification. First one is related with your gross margin that went down sequentially, I guess, costs probably would cost. I don't know if you provide more color on this issue, that is the first question. Second question is related with pulp prices, your sales pulp prices went slightly down, your average price from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, which is weird because we know that pulp prices went up. So, can you explain the reason? And the last question is just a clarification.

I understood that uncoated woodfree volumes should be more or less flat from the first to the second quarter.

Antonio Redondo

Okay, let me try to refresh your questions to make sure they were fully understood. The first question is about gross margin sequentially Q4 '23, Q1, '24, where you noticed a slowdown. And you'd like to see if this slowdown is related with the cost, namely, the cost of raw materials, namely the cost of woods. Your second question is that you believe average pulp prices were slightly down from Q4 '23 to Q1 '24. So, you'd like to confirm that. And your last question is to confirm as well if we believe that volume-wise uncoated woodfree will be more or less flat Q2 to Q1.

António Seladas

Exactly. Thank you very much.

Antonio Redondo

Let me try to give some quick answers and ask my colleagues to complement. So, Quirino will complement 1 and 3 and Nuno will complement 2.The gross margin, discretionary reduction of gross margin in between Q4 last year and Q1 this year was, of course, not related with prices was, of course, not related to cash cost. Cash cost and I think we mentioned that during the call have been reduced sequentially less than, of course, year-on-year.

Year-on-year, we mentioned 9% to 16% quarter-on-quarter, I'm quoting by memory was 4% to 5% transaction with pulp more or less flat and note it was not also wood that has increased. It was actually extraordinary results that affected EBITDA margin in Q4 last year, and they were not in Q1 this year. Regarding your comment about pulp prices, I don't think your comment is right. I don't think the prices were slightly down, but Nuno afterwards will comment on that.

I think they actually went up. Obviously, it's always difficult to compare when mix are different, but I don't think it they went down. Last comment or last question about uncoated woodfree being more or less flat, yes, we expect uncoated woodfree in terms of volume to be more or less flat vis-a-vis Q1. I'd like Quirino to comment question 3, probably Fernando question 1 and Nuno question 2.

Antonio Quirino Soares

Starting with the uncoated woodfree volume, we have just confirmed our expectations today for Q1 is pretty much aligned with the volumes of Q1 both actually uncoated packaging sales in both segments, of course, volume-wise and continuing. And actually, with the explanation we provided on price evolution, actually, on the buy side, we see an improvement on Q2 versus Q1. So, we look at the same ballpark on [Indiscernible]

Nuno Santos

On the pulp price. I only have here now in front of me the net mill price is not exactly the net prices, the net new prices, the price acted from logistical costs. But from Q4 last year to Q1 this year, it actually went up by 7%, EUR 37 per tonne. So, either we made some confusion in our communication or there's some confusion on your side, but prices went up EUR 37 per tonne, 7% from Q4 2023 to Q1 '24.

Fernando Araujo

That made in the last quarter has been is was 5%. It's not a big issue. But as already mentioned, it's related with non-recording and it's related with some mentions that we received in the last quarter.

António Seladas

Just a follow-up. So, no recurring costs that was accounted on the gross margin, yes, on the cost.

Fernando Araujo

[Indiscernible] That's why increase the EBITDA margin[Indiscernible]

António Seladas

Regarding the third price, pulp surprise may be a bit of confusion on my side.

Antonio Redondo

Sorry. I'm sorry, we missed your last comment. Will you be so kind to repeat, please?

António Seladas

I was just saying that on the sales price on pulp sales price, I made some confusion on my side.

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And we have a follow-up question from the line of Enrique Parrondo from JB Capital.

Enrique Parrondo

Just 2 follow-ups. Well, one follow-up and another new question. On the question my colleague asked on the gap between pulp prices and paper prices in Europe. Is it correct to think that we should look at this, I mean, I guess that we should look at this gap from a net pulp price perspective, right? And I've been doing some math and if we look at pre-COVID levels, paper prices have been, on average, 70% above net pulp prices in Europe.

Currently stand at close to that level. Is that the right way of thinking?

And my second question would be on the molded cellulose capacity expected to ramp up in the second half of the year. What sort of contribution, economic contribution can we expect from this business line on a recurring basis? Is there a unitary economics that we can track? Or if you could give us some color on this, it would be helpful.

Antonio Redondo

Okay. So, your first question is, you believe computing net versus net, the actual gap is not very different from pre-COVID levels. It is what you say?

Enrique Parrondo

That's right. Yes around 70%

Antonio Redondo

The second question is about if we are able to provide some color on unitary contribution of the molded cellular business?

Enrique Parrondo

That's correct. Yes.

Antonio Redondo

Those are actually very quick to answer. The first one, to be honest, we don't have here in front of us the historical data, I'm sure you have. So, if you have the right discounts on net, which is always doubtful, if we know the exact net discounts, you can do the math yourself, and I'm sure you're right to the conclusion better than ourselves. But it's not easy to track what are exactly the discounts or what were exactly discounts pre-COVID, during COVID and today. But I agree with you, the gap should be done more net-net than gross.

Don't forget as well that big for paper is also not net, it's gross. And we should take into consideration discounts on paper as well. Nothing to do with the amount of discount on pulp, but they are also subject to discounts. On model cellulose, it's also very easy and quick to answer. We cannot provide you anything because we are, first of all, shattering completely new territory. This is the first integrated unit of molded cellulose with eucalyptus-based pulp in Europe.

Is the largest one, is a completely novel product for us and for the South of Europe.We just want to make sure that the advantages of sustainability that we provide are well priced by our customers. As mentioned before, this is a project that is relatively small for the size of our business.

So, it's an introduction to a new business segment that will hopefully help to reinforce our packaging strategy.

There are no further questions from the conference call at this time. So, I will move to the webcast one. A question on the webcast is from Gil Domingos Mavens and he asks, regarding your energy sales, going forward, is the price levels in the Veria market remains at levels. The Q1 revenues is what we should expect? And another question is, why is the EBITDA impact of this fall in the energy level?

Antonio Redondo

Sorry, I'm not sure if I fully understood the question. Can you please repeat them?

Operator

Yes. Regarding to our energy levels, going forward, if the price levels in the Veria market remains at levels, the Q1 revenues is what we should expect? And the other question is, what is the EBITDA impact of this fall in the energy level?

Antonio Redondo

Okay. I will ask Nuno to comment but please understand that we cannot give this kind of guidance. We can give you a generic view of the question, but we cannot give you any specific answer.

Nuno Santos

Okay. So basically, in fact, I don't know if you are aware, but today, our sales are basically energy sales resulting for biomass cogeneration plants. Most of these have feed-in tariffs. So, in fact, our average price of energy sales should remain constant for the rest of the year. The fact that full prices, spot prices in energy are going down, they have actually a positive impact in our EBITDA level. So, as I said, I repeat, our top line, our energy sales are mostly done out of feed-in tariffs with constant prices.

They do not reflect spot prices. We have, of course, purchases of electricity in the market that, of course, are lower cost at this stage. They positively impact our EBITDA.

Operator

There are no further questions at this time. I hand the conference back to you.

Throughout 2023, Finland faced rising electricity prices and inflation. Kela responded by introducing measures such as assistance with electricity costs and increasing the proportion of housing costs covered by basic social assistance. Additionally, temporary benefit increases and a 4.2 percent adjustment to benefits tied to the national pension index helped mitigate the effects of inflation on social security.

The start of operations by the new wellbeing services counties at the beginning of 2023 significantly influenced Kela's activities. These counties are now responsible for organizing social and health services, functions closely linked to Kela's duties. Antila emphasized the importance of this cooperation, which has begun positively, to ensure effective service delivery.

The ongoing war in Ukraine also affected Kela's benefit processing and customer service. From March 2023, Ukrainians residing in Finland became eligible for Kela benefits. However, the number of Ukrainian beneficiaries has been lower and the transition to Kela benefits smoother than initially anticipated.

Kela played a crucial role in supporting the development of Finland's new Government Programme, providing expertise through its Kanta services, researchers, and actuaries. This programme has introduced significant changes to social security benefits. Since last autumn, Kela has been actively informing customers about upcoming cuts and changes, preparing for their implementation through staff training and information system updates.

Antila highlighted the importance of improved data mobility, a key component of the new Government Programme. Enhanced data sharing among public authorities, such as wellbeing services counties and TE Services, is expected to streamline processes and generate savings in public expenditure.

""The emphasis on improved data mobility in the Government Programme is critical. It facilitates better cooperation with partner organizations and reduces public expenditure, making life easier for millions of our customers,"" Antila stated.

Kela's 2023 report reflects its adaptability and resilience in the face of economic and geopolitical challenges. By implementing strategic measures and fostering inter-agency cooperation, Kela continues to uphold its commitment to providing essential social security services to the Finnish population.

Also, there is a focus on decreasing CO2 emissions from the food value chain. The production of traditional animal- and plant-based proteins cannot be doubled to meet this demand and there is an urgent need for novel and innovative sources of protein.

Finnish biotech startup Enifer, a spin-off company from VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland, tackles this demand. The company has announced the completion of a funding package of €36 million.

The new funding package comprises a new €15 million Series B equity round led by the Finnish private equity fund Taaleri Bioindustry Fund I, with follow-on investments from existing shareholders Nordic Foodtech VC, Voima Ventures (backed Kuva Space and MVision AI), and Valio. This funding is complemented by the Finnish Climate Fund, which has extended a €7 million junior loan to support the project and a €2 million Climate and Environmental Loan provided by Finnvera. This funding comes on top of the previously reported €12 million recycling and reuse investment grant from Business Finland, making the factory fully funded.

This follows the €12 million investment grant from the European Union NextGenerationEU recovery instrument.

With this funding package, Enifer will start constructing a unique food-grade mycoprotein factory in Kirkkonummi, Finland. The factory, which is set for completion by the end of 2025 and is projected to cost €33 million, will convert food industry side streams into Enifer's sustainable PEKILO fungi-based protein ingredients. The plant will be the world's first commercial plant to produce such a mycoprotein ingredient from sidestream raw materials.

The factory will produce up to 3,000 tonnes of PEKILO a year, which is enough to cover the annual protein needs of approximately 40,000 people. The production of PEKILO mycoprotein has a low carbon footprint and requires minimal land and water, making it a very sustainable alternative to animal and plant proteins.

The factory will be built within an existing industrial building in Kantvik, Kirkkonummi, Finland. The site bordering the Baltic Sea is only a 30-minute drive from Helsinki city centre and Enifer's existing R&D facilities. The site also offers the upcoming factory with all the required utilities, including steam, electricity, process and cooling water, and waste-water treatment. The factory will begin ramping up operations in 2026, and once it is at full capacity, it will produce 500 kilograms per hour of mycoprotein.

At its core, the factory will harbour a full-sized industrial fermenter, standing more than 12 metres tall and measuring more than 4.5 metres in diameter, in which the PEKILO mycoprotein is grown. The factory will directly employ some 15 people during regular operations and more than twice this number during construction and commissioning.

Enifer was founded by five scientists - Anssi Rantasalo, Heikki Keskitalo, Joosu Kuivanen, Simo Ellilä, and Ville Pihlajaniemi in 2020. PEKILO mycoprotein is produced by cultivating a specific species of fungus in a fermentation process that is not too distinct from brewing beer or making soy sauce. The produced PEKILO mycoprotein powder contains a lot of high-quality protein and fibre. It is also neutral in colour and taste, making it an excellent source of nutrition in the most diverse food applications.

Enifer and its partners have already demonstrated its use across meat and dairy alternatives, baking, pastries and snacks.

The fermentation process was originally developed in Finland in the 1970s and used to upcycle forest industry side streams into feed-grade mycoprotein. Enifer has transformed this innovation, adapting it to new raw material streams from food and agricultural industries and developing a food-grade version of the mycoprotein ingredient.

""We are very happy to start cooperation with Enifer. We believe that there is an increased need for alternative proteins as the global population grows. Demand is also supported globally by environmental and ethical considerations. Taaleri Bioindustry Fund I's investment enables commercial scale production. We are confident in Enifer's opportunities to expand,"" said Tero Saarno, Managing Director, Taaleri Bioindustry.

""The world's population and the need for protein are growing. Food production is - even at the level of technologies that can already be scaled - an unsolved key part of the climate challenge. In the future, sustainable food production will be based on several different solutions and the demand for new types of proteins is predicted to grow significantly over the next decade. Enifer's already tested technology is interesting as the nutrients of various side streams can be upcycled and their processing value increased instead of energy use,"" added the Finnish Climate Fund's acting CEO Toni Mikkonen.

""At Enifer, we're extremely excited to announce the kick-off of our first factory investment project. For over half a century, Kantvik has been at the heart of Finnish bioindustries, and I could not think of a better location to bring PEKILO® fermentation back to life. I would like to thank our new investors, in particular Taaleri Bioindustry and the Finnish Climate Fund, for joining us in our mission. Mycoprotein is the missing ingredient for a more sustainable food chain - the facility in Kantvik serves as a key steppingstone on our path to making mycoprotein a cornerstone of protein supply, with several future factories already being planned,"" said Simo Ellilä, CEO and co-founder of Enifer.",techfundingnews.com,news,Tech Funding News,,0.2078431372549019,454140798,17,https://techfundingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Enifer-team.jpg,eng-9591959

The aim of the monitoring was to prepare an analysis of the types and number of fish that are being carried into the power plant with the cooling water. Drawing up a new analysis became necessary, since there are now three operating plant units instead of the previous two.

The conditions of the water permit granted for the power plant require that TVO perform fish stock analyses. It is a commitment to analysing the fish and fingerlings that are carried to the power plant with cooling water. A similar study was last conducted in 2010. The present analysis is more detailed than the previous one.

- The inclusion of fingerlings of less than 1 centimetre in length was a new addition to the study, and we tried to catch them in the inlet water channels of the plant units. No fingerlings were caught, however, says TVO's fishery researcher Ilkka Tammela.

Fish samples were taken from the flushing channels of sea water plants at all three plant units. The flushing channels collect all the so-called screenings that are carried in by the cooling water. In addition to algae, mussels and fish, screenings comprise water fauna and polyps.

Electricity generation at Olkiluoto does not significantly affect fishery in the area

For the analysis, a total of 26 samples were obtained of screenings and fish for each plant unit. According to the analysis, the total number of fish carried into the plant units at Olkiluoto during the monitoring period, which lasted slightly more than one year, was approximately 27.6 million (an estimated 42.4 tonnes in total weight).

Nowadays, more fish is being carried into the plant units with the cooling water as the cooling water flow of the plant units has been increased since the previous fish monitoring study and the Olkiluoto 3 plant unit has been commissioned.

- The number of individual fish is massive, of course, but it does consist of very small specimens. Based on the results from the monitoring, 95% of the fish carried in by the cooling water weighed less than or equal to 3 grams. Approximately 87% of the fish were economically non-significant fish species, Mr Tammela explains.

The three most common species of fish at the Olkiluoto 1 plant unit were the three-spined stickleback, nine-spined stickleback and gobies of the genus Pomatoschistus. At Olkiluoto 2, they were the three-spined stickleback, nine-spined stickleback and smelt and herring fingerlings, while at Olkiluoto 3 the most common species were the three-spined stickleback, herring and nine-spined stickleback.

A new invasive species in the Baltic Sea, the moss animal Conopeum chesapeakensis, was also discovered in the screenings during the monitoring, as we reported in early 2024: TVO - Environmental monitoring at Olkiluoto once again demonstrated its efficiency. Indeed, the island of Olkiluoto is one the most researched areas in Finland, and its diverse nature has been charted in detail. Environmental research has been conducted on the island since the 1970s, years before electricity production was launched.

The screenings that gather at the plant units are collected and delivered for appropriate processing at the composting plant. Removing the screenings also eliminates nutrients from the water, which reduces eutrophication.

The results of the study have been presented to the Centre for Economic Development, Transport and the Environment. TVO is also performing test fishing, age and growth determinations for fish, fishing for record-keeping purposes and surveys among professional and recreational fishermen in the waters near Olkiluoto.",news.cision.com,news,News Powered by Cision,,0.04313725490196085,454140676,5,https://mb.cision.com/Public/1401/3986575/961ada2d02c350f9_400x400ar.jpg,

The 42-year-old former economist, who just visited Ukraine, says that recent aid packages from the EU and US had been ""a good sign for Ukrainians"" and that ""for them the support is vital"".

""At the same time we understand that it might be that the war will last longer than we would like it to, so we must discuss how we will help Ukraine in 2025 and 2026,"" she told bne IntelliNews on the sidelines of the EBRD annual meeting in Yerevan last week.

To finance this continuing commitment, the West should not only use the net profit of frozen Russian sovereign assets in the West - as the EU Council approved this week - but the assets themselves.

""In our opinion the wisest decision would be to use Russia's frozen assets and deliver it to Ukraine,"" she argues. She also supports the US proposal at the G7 to use the assets as collateral on an issue of a potential $50bn issue of bonds to finance Ukraine.

To squeeze Russia further, Skaiste says that ""the prevention of the circumvention of sanctions is crucial"" and that they should be tightened particularly on the energy and the banking sectors.

""We must focus on implementation but we must not forget about broadening the scope of sanctions because there are still sectors that give Russia a lot of revenues,"" she points out.

Such measures require a EU decision but Lithuania, the other Baltic states, Poland and Finland are already pressing ahead with their own common sanctions targeting dual use goods that Russia could use in its war industry.

""We made our national list of dual use goods that should not be delivered to Russia and we are not letting those goods through our borders,"" she says.

Lithuania, which used to act as a conduit for exports to Russia, has decisively shifted away from that role, she says, a process that has been ongoing since well before the February 2022 invasion.

""The history lesson was much earlier than the full-scale invasion,"" Skaiste points out. ""Lithuanian business slowly but definitely turned to the West. Now our main partners are not in the east but in the western countries like Germany and the US. We can predict these partners; Russia is not predicable.""

The loss of the re-export business since the invasion has not had a big impact on the Lithuanian economy because there was little value-added in that trade.

""These [Russian trade] numbers have definitely decreased. We do not see a huge impact on the economy,"" she says.

As well as losing its Russian exports, Lithuania has also been engaged in a trade war with China over its acceptance of a Taiwanese diplomatic mission under the island's own name, rather than that of the capital Taipei.

Skaiste insists that ""the impact of the Chinese restrictions on our economy was limited"" as ""we were not dependent on that market"", which represents only 1% of exports. Moreover, exports to China and imports from China have since quietly recovered.

She says Lithuania has benefited from the way China's trade embargo was made an EU issue, with its partners joining an ongoing case against China at the WTO.

Vilnius has no plans to back down and would recommend other countries follow the same course. ""Our suggestion for other countries is they should lessen their dependence on autocratic regimes because you never know what they might do,"" Skaiste declares.

The main recent challenges to the Lithuanian economy have therefore been geopolitical, she says. ""Our economy performed quite well during these shocks.""

Lithuania's 0.3% decline in GDP last year was ""one of best results in the region"". This year the finance ministry forecasts 1.6%, though ""the latest data shows it might be even better"". At the same time, inflation - which had spiked at 24% in September 2022 - is forecast to fall below 2% on average this year.

Lithuania has been one of the star achievers since it joined the EU in 2004, though it has gained less attention than neighbours such as Poland. Its GDP per capita on a PPP basis has risen from around 50% of the EU average to around 90%. ""We definitely want to reach and overcome 100% of EU average GDP per capita, Skaiste says. ""We are an ambitious country.""

Lithuania has also maintained a conservative budget policy, and has rebuilt its fiscal buffers since the pandemic. Debt has fallen back below 40% of GDP, while the budget deficit is expected to be 3% of GDP this year, figures that many of its neighbours would envy.

However, going forward the finance ministry has to budget for costly investments in energy security and defence because of the Russia threat, as well as the long-term challenges of demographic shifts and climate change. The World Bank has also called for Lithuania to make stronger efforts to tackle poverty, where it still has one of the worst problems in Central Europe.

On energy, well before the war, her government built an LPG terminal at Klapeida that can also help supply gas to other Baltic states.

On electricity, it has invested in the electricity grid so that it can disconnect from the Russian Brell ring early next year with the other Baltic states and synchronise its network with that of Poland and the rest of the EU instead.

It has also overseen a big increase in wind and solar power. Skaiste says Lithuania now wants to be able to cover 100% of its electricity needs by 2030, from around 30% before the war and around 50% currently. This domestic power capacity would be entirely renewable. ""It is definitely achievable,"" she predicts.

""It is a long journey because it is very costly,"" she says. ""We did a great job. Now we can be completely independent. It is a big part of the resilience of our economy.""

""Green transformation is something that makes us independent,"" she argues, something that many nationalist politicians in Central Europe have yet to grasp.

Lithuania is also looking at nuclear power. ""We decided to focus more on renewables but we are preparing a new energy strategy for the next 10-20 years and one of the possibilities is small nuclear units,"" she says. ""We will explore the possibility to see if they fit in our strategy.""

The main current challenge now is ramping up defence spending, which the government has doubled to €2bn a year. In particular, the government needs to pay for a new national army division, universal conscription, and to prepare for the stationing of a German brigade in the country.

""Now the crucial debate in the country is about defence spending,"" Skaiste says. ""We need to increase defence spending by at least 0.5% of GDP if we want to pay for the things that need to be done. That is a lot.""

To pay for this the finance ministry is pushing for tax reform, which is set to be Skaiste's biggest challenge since she became finance minister two years ago.

""I think it would be wise to decide on tax revenues that could cover these challenges. I think there is a big problem,"" she says.

""If you say that the need for defence spending will last, it would be better not to compromise but to take a decision to last a long time,"" she adds.

However, discussions with other parties in the centre-right government ""were quite difficult"", she admits. ""We decided to postpone a final decision and discuss it in parts.""

The parliament has approved a green tax and cut tax exemptions for companies. A windfall tax on banks was agreed for 2023 and 2024 and Skaiste hinted that it might be prolonged for 2025 too. ""We see that bank profits are still very high and there is a national debate on keeping it for 2025,"" she says.

But more systemic tax-raising measures will have to be hammered out during the Seimas' spring session.

This has led to criticism from the European Commission, which has suggested an increase in property and green taxes to guarantee future fiscal stability.

The EU has also suspended some payments under its Recovery and Resilience Fund in a row over the government's tax measures, something that has enraged the finance minister. ""From my perspective, I don't think EU bureaucrats can ask me to do more than I have promised,"" she says.

The tax row comes ahead of what is likely to be a difficult election for the ruling coalition this October, with polls showing the opposition Social Democrats in a consistent lead.

Skaiste - who is seen as a potential future party leader - says that her Homeland Union-Lithuanian Christian Democrats usually do better than the polls predict, and that there is a still a chance that the government might be able to continue.

Yet even if the government changes, she stresses that there is likely to be little fundamental change in policy, since consensus has largely been maintained since the country regained its independence in 1990 and then achieved Nato and EU membership in 2004.

""The consensus on the reforms to be part of the European family was part of our success,"" Skaiste says. ""The policies have not changed much in these years of independence. The orientation of our foreign policy, our economy, that is something that we do not fight about inside the country.""",intellinews.com,news,Intellinews                        ,,0.3647058823529412,454139334,9,https://d39raawggeifpx.cloudfront.net/styles/16_9_desktop/s3/articleimages/Gintarė_Skaistė_Cropped.jpg,

EV charging points for heavy vehicles will be built in all Kesko's grocery trade logistics centres within the next few years. Kesko expects EV transports to reduce emissions significantly while improving efficiency. The total investment will amount to nearly €10 million.

""Kesko's grocery trade logistics centres send out some 700 loads across the country every day. As a large Finnish operator, we want to pave the way for more extensive utilisation of electric trucks. This is also an important step in our journey to reduce emissions, as transports account for some half the climate impact from our own operations,"" says Jyrki Tomminen, Vice President for Supply Chain Management, Logistics and Store Operations in Kesko's grocery trade division.

In addition to the central warehouse in Vantaa, Kesko has regional logistics terminals across the country, which handle deliveries to some 1,200 grocery stores and thousands of Kespro foodservice customers. This year, Kesko intends to update EV charging points in the Vantaa central warehouse, and to build new charging points in the regional terminals in Tampere and Seinäjoki.

""With the new charging points, we will be able to begin regular transports with electric trucks this year on the Vantaa-Tampere route. Electric trucks and vans will also be introduced for short-distance deliveries in Southern Finland and the Tampere and Seinäjoki regions. The plan is to gradually expand the number of electric trucks and vans in our subcontractor network, with the goal of having some 200 transport EVs operating by 2030,"" says Jarmo Nikupeteri, Production Director in charge of Kesko's grocery transports in Finland.

Next year, electric trucks will operate various key routes

According to Kesko's plans, electric trucks will begin operating the Vantaa-Turku and Tampere-Turku routes next year. For short-distance deliveries, new electric trucks will be introduced in Oulu, Turku, Mikkeli and Jyväskylä. New EV charging points for heavy vehicles will be built in the Oulu, Turku, Mikkeli and Jyväskylä terminals, while the Kuopio terminal is set to get one in 2026.

Kesko also aims to increase the use of electric vehicles in home deliveries for online grocery in upcoming years.

""Kesko's own K-Lataus will provide the new charging points for all locations. Entirely new charging points will be built in stores with a high level of online grocery activity, so that we can assure both our customers and vehicles delivering online orders will have sufficient access to charging,"" says Iiro Määttänen, Senior Manager in charge of K-Lataus.

The electricity used for EV charging on Kesko properties is free of carbon dioxide emissions.

Most Read from Bloomberg

And like nearly every patrol since Russia's invasion of Ukraine some two years ago, Westman found nothing of serious concern to report. But the serenity belies growing concerns over a crucial maritime gateway and shipping routes worth $160 billion a year.

The self-governing archipelago stretching across the middle of the Baltic Sea officially belongs to Finland, its residents speak Swedish, and Russia is tasked with enforcing an accord that has banned any military presence on its shores for over a century.

With Finland now a member of NATO and Russia jostling to assert its rights in the region, hawks say the unusual set up has become the Nordic country's greatest vulnerability, giving Moscow an open field should it ever decide to invade.

""If you have all the Aland Islands, you can block maritime traffic both to the Gulf of Bothnia and to the Gulf of Finland,"" said Pekka Toveri, a former major general in Finland's armed forces and member of parliament for the center-right National Coalition Party, part of the ruling coalition. ""Then we are pretty screwed.""

About 96% of Finland's trade flows through sea lanes near Aland. The ability to send goods entirely by land, over the top of Norway or Sweden into Finland, is limited by harsh Arctic winters, poorly maintained roads and different rail gauges. The area is also home to key communication and energy infrastructure, including undersea electricity and internet cables.

Finland forged a careful coexistence with its eastern neighbor after fighting two wars against the Soviet Union in the 20th century. Its shift towards the west culminated in a break from non-alignment when Putin sent tanks to Ukraine. Eight out of nine nations on the Baltic Sea are now NATO members; only Russia is not.

The next step in strengthening defenses should be to close the Russian consulate on the Aland Islands and allow Finnish forces to train on them, according to Toveri. He said the archipelago is more important to Finland than Gotland Island is to Sweden -- and the Swedish government remilitarized that island after Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, later re-introducing permanent troops, adding tanks and reactivating air defense systems.

Dismantling layers of international demilitarization agreements would be complex, though, and is unlikely for now. Recent polls suggest the 30,000 Aland residents see no great need to do so and the Finnish government recently reviewed the islands' status, without concluding changes should be made.

Instead, the focus is on vigilance and contingency planning. Wille Rydman, Finland's economy minister, said the country has prepared for scenarios ranging from an attempt by Russia to take control of the Baltic Sea, to more limited operations he declined to detail. They likely include acts of sabotage with plausible deniability aimed at testing NATO's resolve.

There has already been an increase in jamming of satellite signals used by airlines, smartphones and weapons systems in the Baltic Sea that officials said have largely been traced to areas near the Russian enclaves of St. Petersburg and Kaliningrad.

Jan Olav Hanses, chief executive of Viking Line Abp -- which is based on Aland and is a major carrier of goods between Sweden and Finland -- said he's introducing back-up systems to restore critical services in case his fleet's navigational systems are targeted next. ""We need to be prepared,"" Hanses said, adding that the company's sales and bookings were disrupted for 24 hours following a cyber attack on its website in October and that the hackers identified themselves as Russian.

Later this month, shippers key to Finland's security of supply, port operators and the National Emergency Supply Agency will practice using less optimal routes, as well as operating with reduced crews in the event seafarers are mobilized to serve with defense forces, according to Tiina Tuurnala, chief executive of the Finnish Shipowners' Association.

Finland has already updated emergency legislation that allows the state to guarantee insurance for vital cargo, ships, aircraft and other vehicles that transport them, along with their crews. Insurance typically amounts to around 1% to 1.5% of the insured value of a vessel -- Viking ships are worth as much as 200 million euros -- and that percentage could run into the double-digits for war or conflict insurance, Hanses said.

Despite the assurances and all the planning, the native of Finland who has lived in Aland for more than 35 years, said his preference would still be for troops to be stationed on the islands.

As Westman's crew maneuvered their 13.5-meter (44 meter) boat through a gentle chop, they consulted electronic charts of some 6,800 islands and skerries that make up the archipelago. The Baltic Sea is shallow -- one reason shipping routes are limited -- and treacherous, with rapakivi granite jutting out of the water throughout the islands or lurking below the surface.

Perched on a dark green gurney inside the cabin, Westman said his team has a high ""situational awareness"" of all maritime traffic including cargo, crews, the origin and ownership of ships, along with the profiles of visitors who arrive on 25 passenger vessels each day.

Founded in 1930 to chase smugglers during Finnish prohibition, the coastguard provides security in the absence of a military presence on Aland.

Coming under the auspices of Finland's Interior Ministry, its members carry sidearms and long guns. While they can't have army-grade equipment, they practice using such weapons during military drills on the mainland.

The Aland Islands have been impacted by every war in the Baltics since 1741, according to Kenneth Gustavsson, a local military historian, three of which ended with major treaties that shaped the identity of its residents.

An initial demilitarization pact was signed in 1856 after the Crimean War. Swedish became the official language as a result of protections won from the League of Nations following World War I, in an agreement that also granted sovereignty to Finland. Two decades later, the Soviet-Finland accord allowed the then-USSR to open a consulate and monitor the islands.

With those arrangements now under pressure, Alanders have found a way to express their displeasure with Russia while simultaneously demonstrating their commitment to peace.

Every day since Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, a small group of protesters gathers outside Russia's consulate in the capital, Mariehamn at precisely 5 p.m. Standing on the boulevard opposite the building -- next to a Ukrainian flag and a peace sign -- they hold a moment of silence, sing and shout: ""Putin to The Hague!"", a reference to the home of the international criminal court.

Then both sides return to their normal business, the consul free to travel the islands by boat and car with his wife to check Finland isn't trying to smuggle in weapons or soldiers -- though he's been keeping a low profile recently, and declined to be interviewed.

Earlier this spring, one of the protest regulars, Ulf Grussner, a retired businessman in his eighties, was arrested and fined €900 ($978) for carrying a weapon without a permit after he took a WWI-era rifle, asked his artist granddaughter to tie a knot in the barrel, and placed it outside the consul where it remained for more than a week before it was confiscated by police.

Grussner doesn't want the consulate closed, reasoning: ""It is better to see your enemy in his eyes and talk to him than to wonder where he is and what he is going to do."" And he says he feels safe because in the event of an Ukraine-type attack, the Finnish military would be legally obligated to defend the islands. Finland's government could also invoke NATO's collective defense pledge known as Article 5.

When Grussner's rifle -- a mini replica of the nonviolence sculpture outside the United Nations building in New York -- is released by police, a local museum has asked to exhibit it.

And like nearly every patrol since Russia's invasion of Ukraine some two years ago, Westman found nothing of serious concern to report. But the serenity belies growing concerns over a crucial maritime gateway and shipping routes worth $160 billion a year.

""Then we are pretty screwed.""

About 96% of Finland's trade flows through sea lanes near Aland. The ability to send goods entirely by land, over the top of Norway or Sweden into Finland, is limited by harsh Arctic winters, poorly maintained roads and different rail gauges. The area is also home to key communication and energy infrastructure, including undersea electricity and internet cables.

Finland forged a careful coexistence with its eastern neighbor after fighting two wars against the Soviet Union in the 20th century. Its shift towards the west culminated in a break from non-alignment when Putin sent tanks to Ukraine. Eight out of nine nations on the Baltic Sea are now NATO members; only Russia is not.

The next step in strengthening defenses should be to close the Russian consulate on the Aland Islands and allow Finnish forces to train on them, according to Toveri. He said the archipelago is more important to Finland than Gotland Island is to Sweden -- and the Swedish government remilitarized that island after Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, later re-introducing permanent troops, adding tanks and reactivating air defense systems.

Dismantling layers of international demilitarization agreements would be complex, though, and is unlikely for now. Recent polls suggest the 30,000 Aland residents see no great need to do so and the Finnish government recently reviewed the islands' status, without concluding changes should be made.

Instead, the focus is on vigilance and contingency planning. Wille Rydman, Finland's economy minister, said the country has prepared for scenarios ranging from an attempt by Russia to take control of the Baltic Sea, to more limited operations he declined to detail. They likely include acts of sabotage with plausible deniability aimed at testing NATO's resolve.

There has already been an increase in jamming of satellite signals used by airlines, smartphones and weapons systems in the Baltic Sea that officials said have largely been traced to areas near the Russian enclaves of St. Petersburg and Kaliningrad.

Jan Olav Hanses, chief executive of Viking Line Abp -- which is based on Aland and is a major carrier of goods between Sweden and Finland -- said he's introducing back-up systems to restore critical services in case his fleet's navigational systems are targeted next. ""We need to be prepared,"" Hanses said, adding that the company's sales and bookings were disrupted for 24 hours following a cyber attack on its website in October and that the hackers identified themselves as Russian.

Later this month, shippers key to Finland's security of supply, port operators and the National Emergency Supply Agency will practice using less optimal routes, as well as operating with reduced crews in the event seafarers are mobilized to serve with defense forces, according to Tiina Tuurnala, chief executive of the Finnish Shipowners' Association.

Finland has already updated emergency legislation that allows the state to guarantee insurance for vital cargo, ships, aircraft and other vehicles that transport them, along with their crews. Insurance typically amounts to around 1% to 1.5% of the insured value of a vessel -- Viking ships are worth as much as 200 million euros -- and that percentage could run into the double-digits for war or conflict insurance, Hanses said.

Despite the assurances and all the planning, the native of Finland who has lived in Aland for more than 35 years, said his preference would still be for troops to be stationed on the islands.

As Westman's crew maneuvered their 13.5-meter (44 meter) boat through a gentle chop, they consulted electronic charts of some 6,800 islands and skerries that make up the archipelago. The Baltic Sea is shallow -- one reason shipping routes are limited -- and treacherous, with rapakivi granite jutting out of the water throughout the islands or lurking below the surface.

Perched on a dark green gurney inside the cabin, Westman said his team has a high ""situational awareness"" of all maritime traffic including cargo, crews, the origin and ownership of ships, along with the profiles of visitors who arrive on 25 passenger vessels each day.

Founded in 1930 to chase smugglers during Finnish prohibition, the coastguard provides security in the absence of a military presence on Aland.

Coming under the auspices of Finland's Interior Ministry, its members carry sidearms and long guns. While they can't have army-grade equipment, they practice using such weapons during military drills on the mainland.

The Aland Islands have been impacted by every war in the Baltics since 1741, according to Kenneth Gustavsson, a local military historian, three of which ended with major treaties that shaped the identity of its residents.

An initial demilitarization pact was signed in 1856 after the Crimean War. Swedish became the official language as a result of protections won from the League of Nations following World War I, in an agreement that also granted sovereignty to Finland. Two decades later, the Soviet-Finland accord allowed the then-USSR to open a consulate and monitor the islands.

With those arrangements now under pressure, Alanders have found a way to express their displeasure with Russia while simultaneously demonstrating their commitment to peace.

Every day since Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, a small group of protesters gathers outside Russia's consulate in the capital, Mariehamn at precisely 5 p.m. Standing on the boulevard opposite the building -- next to a Ukrainian flag and a peace sign -- they hold a moment of silence, sing and shout: ""Putin to The Hague!"", a reference to the home of the international criminal court.

Then both sides return to their normal business, the consul free to travel the islands by boat and car with his wife to check Finland isn't trying to smuggle in weapons or soldiers -- though he's been keeping a low profile recently, and declined to be interviewed.

Earlier this spring, one of the protest regulars, Ulf Grussner, a retired businessman in his eighties, was arrested and fined €900 ($978) for carrying a weapon without a permit after he took a WWI-era rifle, asked his artist granddaughter to tie a knot in the barrel, and placed it outside the consul where it remained for more than a week before it was confiscated by police.

Grussner doesn't want the consulate closed, reasoning: ""It is better to see your enemy in his eyes and talk to him than to wonder where he is and what he is going to do."" And he says he feels safe because in the event of an Ukraine-type attack, the Finnish military would be legally obligated to defend the islands. Finland's government could also invoke NATO's collective defense pledge known as Article 5.

When Grussner's rifle -- a mini replica of the nonviolence sculpture outside the United Nations building in New York -- is released by police, a local museum has asked to exhibit it.

""I wouldn't say that we are afraid, but we are alert,"" said Aland government leader Katrin Sjogren when asked about resistance to remilitarizing. She added, ""At times like these, it becomes more important than ever to look for solutions that push the pendulum back toward peace.""

The subject matter of these pleas range from constitutional challenges to the provisions on law on control of administrative services in Delhi to directions for sending teachers to Finland for special training. In fact, in early 2023, the Delhi government faced strong criticism from the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for spending over Rs 20 crore on lawyers to defend it.

The main reason behind the Delhi government approaching the apex court instead of the high court is because of the pendency of a challenge to the GNCTD Act, 2023 which deals with the control of administrative services in the region.

History of the dispute:

In May 2023, a five-judge Supreme Court bench in a unanimous verdict ruled that the Delhi government has legislative and executive powers over all services except for public order, police and land.

The constitution bench headed by Chief Justice DY Chandrachud held that an elected government needs to have control over the administration. It said the Union territory of Delhi has a ""sui generis (unique) character"" and refused to agree with the 2019 judgment of justice Ashok Bhushan that the Delhi government has no power over services.

However, shortly after the top court's ruling, the Union government promulgated an ordinance effectively taking back control of administrative services. The ordinance became a law after Parliament cleared it in the monsoon session of 2023. The Delhi government has challenged the constitutional validity of this . The case is pending before the apex court, which is why the Delhi government is filing writ petitions in the Supreme Court whenever it runs into a wall in its confrontations with the LG. However, some of these petitions were filed even before the SC's judgment in the administrative services case.

Moneycontrol takes a look at the key cases that have been filed by the Delhi government against the LG and the stage they are at now.

Appointment of DERC chairperson:

In April 2023, the Delhi government filed the first writ petition on the issue of Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission (DERC). The government would go on to file two more petitions pertaining to DERC. The first dealt with the procedure for appointment of a chairperson for DERC, the second challenged the delay in approval to an amendment to the act governing DERC and the last plea challenged the portion of the GNCTD Act that dealt with the powers of appointment of the DERC chairperson.

In August 2023, the apex court stepped in and appointed retired Delhi High Court judge Jayant Nath as the DERC chair. The court made the appointment after a continuous logjam between Delhi government and LG over the issue. In this particular case, just the plea challenging the constitutional validity of the law pertaining to appointment of the chairperson remains pending for consideration.

Teachers' training in Finland:

Filed again in April 2023, this petition was against the LG's approval with riders to send government school teachers to Finland for training, and prohibiting teachers from receiving foreign training in the future. The apex court issued a notice to the LG in the plea. The main contention in the plea was that the LG could not have added the riders or prohibited future training without the advice of the council of ministers. This plea has remained pending for over a year now.

Petition to re-operationalise Farishtey scheme:

Filed in November 2023, this plea sought for directions for release of funds by the LG to re-operationalise the Delhi government's Farishtey scheme. The scheme extended cashless medical treatment for road accident victims. While the LG contended that he did not have any role to play in de-operationalising or re-operationalising it, the Supreme Court sought his response via a December 2023 notice. This plea too has been pending for over a year now.

Controversy over extension of tenure of Delhi's chief secretary:

The Delhi government in this plea filed in November 2023 moved the Supreme Court against the central government's decision to extend the tenure of Delhi's chief secretary by six months. Since the appointment of the chief secretary is an action that needs to be approved by the LG, he was also made a party to the litigation. However, the apex court eventually ruled in favour of the Centre's decision to extend the chief secretary's tenure.

Appointment of lawyers outside of panel:

Every government and all governmental authorities have a panel of lawyers to which court cases are assigned. However, if the case is very important for the government, it engages non-empanelled lawyers. The Delhi government too has a panel of lawyers. However, it filed a plea in the Supreme Court alleging that the Centre and LG passed an order restricting its options to engage lawyers and senior lawyers of its choice. On the day of the hearing, the Delhi government alleged that the fees payable to lawyers who appeared for the government in past cases were stuck pending clearance from the LG's office. The court asked the LG and the Union government to clear these bills and not to make a ""prestige issue"" out of it. This case will now come up for hearing in July.

Appeals against NGT orders:

In 2023, the Delhi government filed two appeals against the orders of the National Green Tribunal (NGT).

Helsinki, Finland, May 22, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Gevulot, a purpose-built L1, is launching the first shared prover layer optimized exclusively for zero-knowledge (ZK) proof generation and verification, starting with its mainnet prover network, Firestarter, going live on July 15. Whitelisted projects will receive public good access to the mainnet. Gevulot also provides an in-depth explanation of ZK Endgame and its approach to ZK, to ultimately bring the compute and cost overhead of verifiability to near zero.

The Gevulot Devnet is currently a free public good testnet for registered users and Galxe community participation is encouraged. Interested developers can start offloading provable compute or start benchmarking proof systems to enjoy production-ready proof generation to offset their existing overhead costs. As Gevulot scales, organizations interested in running prover nodes can apply here for the ZkCloud compute network, which currently has a pipeline of over 10,000 CPUs and GPUs which meet institutional requirements.

Gevulot's Approach to ZK Endgame

The Gevulot team believes zero-knowledge proving will characterize distributed systems in the near future. Zero-knowledge proofs enhance a blockchain network's scalability, compatibility with other networks and applications, and privacy. Their purpose is validating computations and improving transaction integrity without revealing additional information.

A growing niche in the industry, including Gevulot, believes today's infrastructure is not ready to embrace ZK proving yet. On the contrary, most applications rely on permissioned proving from a single prover, drifting away from the fundamental definition of a decentralized ecosystem, which should embody credible neutrality and censorship resistance.

Gevulot aims to solve the issues of present-day proving infrastructures and accelerate zero-knowledge proving adoption by building the ZkCloud, a decentralized compute network optimized for offloading arbitrary provable compute. This solution is slated to help unlock the near limitless compute capacity on blockchains via decentralized zero-knowledge proofs, which would represent the apex of distributed systems evolution. In other words, it would be the zero-knowledge endgame and, as the team puts it on their blog, ""nothing short of all the world's compute being verifiable or as close to that as is allowed by physics.""

Zero-knowledge proving is rapidly evolving, drastically reducing the cost of verifying the accuracy of a third party's computation. This solves the ""cost of verifiability"" dilemma, which has bothered industry experts since the dawn of distributed systems technology. It also means we can rely on the performance and redundancy characteristics of trusted computation without requiring trust.

The ZK Endgame aims for the compute and cost overhead of verifiability to approach zero. In other words, to reach its goal, zero-knowledge proving must also bring the required compute time to zero, and not only its financial costs.

Reaching absolute zero costs of verifiability is most likely unachievable. However, getting as close as possible to zero for verifiability and compute time may be possible by getting ZK proving on a trend line that involves several new breakthroughs in cryptography, hardware, and other essential metrics, such as bandwidth and/or electricity costs.

Gevulot is building ZkCloud to take zero-knowledge, proving on a trend line to the ZK Endgame while pushing technological frontiers. The project considers itself a contributor to reaching the pinnacle of zero-knowledge proving in distributed systems. As Teemu PÃ¤ivinen, CEO and Co-founder of Gevulot, describes it:

""In our vision, we are the compute portion of this future cloud and world computer. We believe other teams will provide the data storage and other aspects of this cloud. I don't think it's going to be a single monolithic service. The only realistic chance of getting there is to utilize zero-knowledge proofs. Our short-term goal, which we're very much executing on currently and very excited about, is just lowering the cost considerably and then letting the cryptographers work their magic to make things faster.""

ZkCloud is redefining cloud infrastructure with a product that is decentralized, censorship-resistant, and permissionless while providing universal access for proving.

In keeping with its earlier announcement, the company waived grid service fees for January, February and June 2024.

On 21 September 2023, Fingrid announced that it would waive grid service fees for January, February and June of 2024 and that it plans to waive the fees for another three months in the latter half of 2024.

Fluctuations in the price of energy and large transmission volumes in the main grid have increased uncertainty in Fingrid's market-based cost items. The decision to collect grid service fees in July-December 2024 is based on the increase in the cost of transmission grid operations brought about by the expansion of the electricity system and the increase in weather-dependent electricity generation, and on the implementation of necessary grid investments.

An exceptional amount of congestion income, arising from differences in the price of electricity, accumulated for Fingrid in 2022 from the Finland-Sweden and Finland-Estonia transmission connections. The accumulated congestion income enabled the waiving of grid service fees in the first half of 2024. Between 1 January 2022 and 31 March 2024, Fingrid used roughly EUR 750 million in congestion income to benefit its customers by way of reduced grid service fees.

Fingrid will use accumulated congestion income for the benefit of its customers in future as well. The Energy Authority decides on the use of the congestion income received by Fingrid for investments, to cover costs and to lower grid service fees, in accordance with EU legislation.

The capacity to produce weather-dependent, renewable electricity has grown sharply in the past few years, which has also increased fluctuations in the price of electricity and the volume of main grid transmissions. The number of connection enquiries received by Fingrid indicates that electricity production and consumption will grow in the future, which calls for investments in the main grid. Fingrid's investment programme is progressing, and the level of investments will increase in the course of 2024.

The energy sector's changing operating environment coupled with the aforementioned trend weaken the predictability of operating costs. Variations in the company's costs naturally affect customer pricing and increase the need to adjust prices.

Fingrid's grid service customers are electricity producers, regional network operators and major electricity consumers. Households are not direct customers of Fingrid, and Fingrid's main grid accounts for around two per cent of a household's electricity price.

The proposal supports the Government's objective of keeping the general government deficit under 3.5 per cent of GDP in 2024.

The second supplementary budget proposal for 2024 will reduce the need for appropriations for the current year by EUR 53 million, while actual revenue will increase by EUR 141 million. Together, these will reduce the central government's net borrowing requirement by almost EUR 194 million, with net borrowing expected to total around EUR 12.7 billion in 2024. The budgeted amount of government debt at the end of 2024 is estimated to be approximately EUR 169 billion, which is around 60 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP).

Strengthening general government finances to avoid the EU's excessive deficit procedure

In line with the commitment made by the Government in the spending limits discussion this past spring, the second supplementary budget proposal for 2024 includes measures to strengthen general government finances in order to avoid triggering the EU's excessive deficit procedure. These include raising the general value-added tax rate and making adjustments to energy subsidies, costs arising from migration and the EU membership fee, for example, based on revised needs assessments and payment schedules. Necessary investments will be made within the limits of the room for manoeuvre in general government finances. Finland can avoid triggering the EU's excessive deficit procedure if the amount of deficit exceeding the 3 per cent reference value is minor and temporary. This means that the planned central government deficit for this year has to remain below 3.5 per cent of GDP. The excess deficit is temporary because according to the European Commission's forecast, Finland's deficit will fall below the 3 per cent reference value in 2025 to 2.8 per cent of GDP.

Government decides on additional investments in transport projects within the spending limits and in line with the investment programme outlined in the Government Programme

The Government will launch several significant transport projects across Finland to boost regional growth and accelerate the recovery of the construction sector from the economic downturn.

As part of the investment programme outlined in the Government Programme, the Government proposes the following projects: 1) main road 5 Leppävirta-Kuopio (proposed authority EUR 180 million), 2) main road 8 Edsevö-Lepplax (EUR 24 million), and 3) coastal railway development Kauklahti-Karis (EUR 30 million). The projects included in the investment programme will not increase the central government's borrowing requirement.

Finland will recognise a total of EUR 51.1 million from the EU's Connecting Europe Programme as revenue for transport projects. Of these funds, a total of EUR 11.2 million will be allocated to the Western Main Line (Länsirata Oy). With respect to need for appropriations for 2024, the Government also proposes using the programme's funds for the following projects: Koivisto and Pikkuhaara bridges to be built on main road 11 (Pori and Ulvila), improvements to main road 21 at Ailakkalahti-Kilpisjärvi and Enontekiö and the construction of an interchange on main road 3 at the border between Hämeenlinna and Janakkala.

An authorisation of EUR 8.17 million and an appropriation of EUR 1 million are proposed for the Kotka entrance road to main road 15 (Hyväntuulentie) in 2024. In addition, the intersection of main roads 3 and 19 will be improved in Jalasjärvi, Kurikka. A budget authority of EUR 11 million and an appropriation of EUR 1 million are proposed for project in 2024.

In addition, the Government proposes granting a budget authority of EUR 1.45 billion for long-term service contracts (20-21 years) for ferry services. The proposed authority and service agreements will not require additional appropriations as the funding is included in the annual spending limits for basic transport infrastructure management.

Necessary additional appropriations to cover costs of instrumentalised migration and compensate for support provided to Ukraine

EUR 3.3 million is proposed for the Border Guard, approximately EUR 0.5 million for the police and approximately EUR 0.7 million for Customs to cover the costs incurred due to instrumentalised migration. A further EUR 11 million is proposed for the Border Guard for the cost of investments in a surveillance system based on radio technology.

A total of approximately EUR 1.5 million is proposed to the Finnish Immigration Service for costs outlined in the government proposals on the border procedure and amendments to the Nationality Act.

The Government also proposes that additional appropriations related to the replacement of defence materiel delivered to Ukraine be included in the authorisation under the Defence Forces' development programme (UKR 2023), the total amount of which would increase by EUR 575.4 million. The costs of replacement procurements will be incurred in 2024-2032. In this context, the Government proposes increasing appropriations for defence materiel procurement by approximately EUR 1.1 million to cover the costs of support to Ukraine in 2024. In addition, an increase of EUR 6.1 million is proposed for the operating expenses of the Defence Forces to cover the costs of support to Ukraine. The Government further proposes adding EUR 152.8 million to appropriations for the administrative branch of the Ministry of Defence in accordance with the index adjustment.

An increase of EUR 1 million is proposed for the National Land Survey of Finland to renew its aerial image camera system, which also serves the needs of the Defence Forces.

The supplementary budget proposal also proposes an increase of approximately EUR 0.7 million to the operating expenses of the National Supervisory Authority for Welfare and Health to bring its service provider register (Soteri) up to the level required by the Act on the Supervision of Health and Social services.

Changes in needs estimates and payment schedules to reduce need for appropriations

The supplementary budget proposal includes several changes to payments and schedules, which will reduce the need for appropriations this year. For example, the Government proposes reducing the estimated appropriation for energy subsidies by EUR 141 and the estimated appropriation for renewable energy production subsidies by EUR 114 million. It also proposes reducing the appropriation reserved for projects under the EU Structural Fund by EUR 100 million due to lower payments than anticipated.

The Government proposes reducing Finland's EU membership by EUR 136 million based on a revised estimate. Expenditure related to migration has also been reduced. In line with the proposal, the appropriation reserved for the costs of receiving refugees and asylum seekers will be reduced by EUR 59.8 million based on revised projections of the number of migrants to Finland. It is proposed that the appropriation reserved for subsidies paid to customers of reception services be reduced by EUR 28.7 million due to revised projections.

As outlined in the Government Programme, the savings allocated to rural development will be compensated for by re-budgeting unused appropriations from the CAP transition period. This will make it possible to secure EU allocations to the fullest extent.

Interest expenditure to increase

The interest rate estimate has been revised in accordance with actual interest expenses, borrowing and the development of interest rates. The Government proposes increasing debt servicing expenditure by EUR 73.1 million. Interest expenditure is expected to total just over EUR 3.2 billion in 2024.

Decreasing tax revenue estimates due to weaker economic outlook

The Government proposes decreasing the tax revenue estimate by EUR 261 million. The new tax revenue estimate is based on the macroeconomic forecast published by the Ministry of Finance in April 2024.

The Government proposes increasing the general value-added tax rate and the tax payable on certain types of insurance from 24 per cent to 25.5 per cent as of 1 September 2024. These increases are expected to increase tax revenue by a total of EUR 182 million. On the other hand, the weakened economic outlook will reduce the amount of value-added tax revenue.

The Government proposes reducing the corporate tax revenue estimate EUR 469 million due to the weakened economic outlook. A reduction of EUR 150 million is also proposed to the estimated revenue from the temporary profit tax in the electricity and fossil fuels sectors based on the tax return data from electricity companies. By contrast, an increase of EUR 115 million is proposed to the revenue estimate for inheritance and gift tax and an increase of EUR 106 million to the revenue estimate for withholding tax on interest income based on accrual data.

An increase of EUR 412 million is proposed for the estimate of miscellaneous revenue. Revenue from the EU's Connecting Europe Facility will increase, and the proposal also includes an increase of EUR 300 million in the estimate of cancellations of appropriations carried over from previous years.

The second supplementary budget proposal for 2024 will be submitted to Parliament on Thursday 23 May at a government plenary session, after which the proposal will be published (in Finnish) on the Government budget proposals website.

The Government has made decisions that will improve the sustainability of public finances and create conditions for reversing the trend in indebtedness. The decisions aim to safeguard the key factors for future prosperity: employment, security, and knowledge and competence. Fairness has been one of the guiding principles of the decisions.

The objective of the Government is to safeguard the welfare society and its vital services for present and future generations alike. Finland must continue to be a country that provides high-quality education, well-functioning health services and care for anyone who needs it. A sustainable economy is a prerequisite for achieving this objective.

In the Government Programme, the Government committed to making decisions that would improve general government finances by a net EUR 6 billion at the 2027 level. However, Finland's general government finances have deteriorated. The adjustment measures already decided are not enough to ensure the stabilisation of the general government debt ratio by 2027. Without additional measures, general government debt will amount to almost 90 per cent of GDP in 2028. New measures to improve public finances are also required to ensure compliance with EU fiscal rules. To this end, the Government has decided on additional measures that will strengthen public finances by approximately EUR 3 billion. The objective is to prevent the Finnish economy from spinning out of control and Finland from triggering the EU's excessive deficit procedure.

Employment, security, and knowledge and competence are at the heart of the Government Programme. The adjustment measures will be implemented without compromising these cornerstones of our wellbeing and future. Sustainable prosperity is built on work and entrepreneurship. Finland will ensure both its internal and external security. Safeguarding favourable conditions for agriculture is part of ensuring the security of supply. Finland's success will continue to be based on a high level of expertise and competence in the future. The Government will stand by the permanent increase of EUR 200 million to the level of funding for primary and lower secondary education. This increase will enable the implementation of the Government Programme objective of increasing the minimum number of lessons in primary and lower secondary education by two to three weekly lessons per year to strengthen the basic skills of pupils. It will also enable the reform of learning support and make it possible to put the level of appropriations for equality funding on a permanent footing. The Government will also stand by the record-high additional investment of EUR 1 billion in research and development by 2027 in accordance with the R&D Funding Act.

The difficult economic situation is straining people's trust in society. The Government has chosen the necessary additional adjustment measures with due regard to intergenerational fairness. The measures will affect people in all income brackets, but efforts have been made to safeguard the position of the most vulnerable people. The Government has paid special attention to families, children and young people. Significant savings will be targeted at administration.

The Government will prepare a separate package of measures concerning children and young people with a permanent appropriation of EUR 5 million allocated to it. The package includes the development of a hybrid model for child welfare as proposed by the Ombudsman for Children and additional funding for youth work in schools and educational institutions, low-threshold mental health chat services and mother and child homes and shelters. Additional funding will also be allocated to the implementation of the action plan for combating youth and gang crime. The Government also decided on separate one-off funding of EUR 5 million for combating school bullying.

The Government will allocate EUR 10 million to the model replacing the adult education allowance with respect to the most critical sectors. In addition, the conditions for employment of women with an immigrant background will be improved by EUR 5 million.

In its spending limits discussion, the Government also made a decision concerning the hospital network. The Government will implement a solution that to a large extent corresponds to the first phase of the hospital network reform. The solution will affect night-time emergency services in primary healthcare and the service range and emergency services in certain hospitals providing specialised healthcare. The purpose of the reform is to balance public expenditure and, for its part, to ease the shortage of healthcare personnel.

The Government decided to reject the following phases of the hospital network reform proposed by the working group. In its spending limits discussion, the Government decided to implement alternative savings measures instead of the rejected phases of the reform in order to reach the savings outlined in the Annex of the Government Programme on financial decisions. These alternative savings amount to approximately EUR 75 million. The Ministry of Social Affairs and Health will provide more detailed information on the decision.

Finland will not recover through adjustments to general government finances alone. To this end, the Government decided in its spending limits discussion to accelerate investments as part of a growth package.

The Government made no changes to the investment programme agreed in the Government Programme. The investment programme will have an expansionary effect and will boost economic growth, which is important in the current economic cycle. The Government will make decisions on the next transport projects to be launched in connection with the May supplementary budget proposal and in the autumn government budget session.

New savings measures decided by the Government

In the new set of measures for strengthening general government finances decided by the Government, savings account for approximately EUR 1.6 billion at the 2028 level. Due to the difficult state of general government finances, adjustment measures are being directed broadly at all branches of government.

The number of central government employees has increased in recent years. At the end of 2023, the number was 81,696, which is around 12 per cent more than in 2017. The number has grown steadily over the years. Savings targeted at central government operational expenditure will be further significantly increased to improve the efficiency of central government activities. Ministries will prepare reductions to the duties and obligations of agencies within their branches of government as part of the productivity programmes they are preparing. Savings targeted at operational expenditure will likely have to be sought through reductions of personnel and through improving the efficiency of operational units.

The obligations of the wellbeing services counties will be scaled back as a savings measure. The Government has made efforts to secure health and social services, for example, by alleviating the skills shortage and improving the wellbeing services counties' possibilities to produce statutory services with the personnel resources available. The minimum staffing level required in 24-hour care for older people will be lowered, the stricter requirements recently introduced regarding the maximum waiting times for access to care will be revoked, and certain services will be excluded from the scope of public service provision.

Efforts to raise the level of competence will be safeguarded regardless of the additional adjustment measures. Funding or student places for education of young people completing their comprehensive school education or education of those without an initial vocational qualification will not be reduced. Accumulation of vocational education and training will be decreased through reducing funding for vocational education and training of adults who already have completed a vocational qualification or a tertiary degree. Students will be returned within the scope of the student housing supplement instead of the general housing allowance as of 1 August 2025. The level of the student housing supplement will be raised in proportion to the 2017 level; the maximum amount will be specified during further preparation.

The Government will moderately adjust the housing allowance for pensioners so that the savings impact will be targeted at the wealthiest pensioners receiving the allowance. Savings will also be directed at reimbursements for medicines and the financial base of pharmacies as part of a broader reform. The sickness allowance will be adjusted with a greater impact on the higher income brackets. Payment of national pensions to people residing abroad will end in accordance with EU practices. Furthermore, overlaps in vocational rehabilitation benefits resulting from the extension of compulsory education will be eliminated in accordance with the Government Programme by raising the age limit for the rehabilitation allowance and national pension from 16 to 18 years in respect of new beneficiaries. The Government does not propose any changes to the index increases for national pensions or earnings-related pensions.

Business subsidies will be cut. The Government will decrease the regional financial support for transport and Business Finland's Budget authority for grants other than RDI grants. The collection of fairway dues at full rate will be resumed. The employer tax deduction for training will be abolished, as the objectives set for the deduction have not been reached. Työkanava Oy, a wholly state-owned company, will cease its operations because its employment service operations have not met the objectives set for this special assignment company. The Government will seek more effective means to find employment for people with impaired capacity to work.

Other savings will be allocated to, for example, development cooperation and the project provision for unspecified transport projects.

On-budget revenue will grow as a result of implementing a moderate increase in the recognised revenue received from Metsähallitus without having to increase the scale of forest harvesting. Integration reimbursements to municipalities will also be reduced.

In addition to the savings from discretional government grants decided in the Government Programme, new savings will be allocated to central government transfers to municipalities in every area of responsibility.

Furthermore, the schedule for implementing certain savings specified in the Government Programme will be brought forward so that Finland can avoid triggering the excessive deficit procedure. For example, savings directed at the development of the transport infrastructure, development cooperation, discretionary government grants of the Ministry of Education and Culture, and grants promoting health and wellbeing will be brought forward.

The new savings will fully increase the amount of savings agreed in the Government Programme

Tax decisions made in the government spending limits discussion

The goal of Government taxation policy is to boost the purchasing power of households, improve incentives to work, and strengthen conditions for economic growth. Taxation must encourage people to start businesses and must support domestic ownership.

Due to the serious situation in public finances, the Government is implementing tax measures to strengthen public finances. These tax measures will have an impact of EUR 1.4 billion on public finances. The Government has chosen measures that treat people fairly and do as little harm as possible to economic growth. The Government also decided on tax measures to promote investments.

The tax ratio will not increase compared to 2023.

As new measures, the general value-added tax rate and the rate of tax on certain insurance premiums will be increased from the current 24 per cent to 25.5 per cent.

No index adjustment will be made to earned income taxation in 2025 to the two highest brackets of the central government income tax scale. In addition, the pension income allowance will be scaled back, but in such a way that the taxation of the smallest pensions will not increase. The tax increase on pension income will apply to people with a pension of EUR 23,000-57,000 per year. No changes will be made to the supplementary tax on pension income. The tax subsidy for voluntary pension savings will be discontinued from the start of 2027. The tax credit for household expenses will be reduced by EUR 100 million.

The validity of the tax subsidy for zero-emission, employer-subsidised cars will be extended, and the motor vehicle tax on electric vehicles and plug-in-hybrid vehicles will be increased. The tax on mined minerals, excise duty on tobacco products and excise duty on soft drinks will be increased more than previously decided. The tax on strong alcoholic beverages will be tied to the consumer price index. The tax subsidy for camper vans will be gradually discontinued over a 15-year transition period.

Starting in 2026, the deduction for donations will be expanded to donations to youth, culture, physical activity and sports organisations and to child organisations that meet certain criteria. The income base of municipalities will be bolstered by replacing the earned income allowance with an earned income deduction. This change will increase the tax revenue of municipalities and decrease those of the central government.

In accordance with the Government Programme, earned income tax bases are subject to an index adjustment in all income brackets in 2026 and 2027. The index adjustment will also be included as a technical assumption in 2028. Taxation of work will be gradually eased over the electoral period, with an emphasis on low and middle-income earners. A child increase to the earned income deduction based on the number of children will be adopted in 2025.

In its taxation decisions, the Government will take into account the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare's recommendations concerning health-based taxation. The reduced value-added tax rate for sweets and chocolate will be increased from 14 per cent to the general value-added tax rate of 25.5 per cent.

Economic growth package

The Government will take measures to support sustainable economic growth in all of Finland. Boosting economic growth is vital to the sustainability of public finances. The Government Programme includes several decisions that will boost economic growth. These include improving permit procedures for investments, improving market competitiveness and boosting R&D investments in the national economy. The programmes for northern and eastern Finland, which will be ready by the end of 2024, will contribute to opportunities for growth in these regions. In addition to the growth measures set out in the Government Programme, the Government will take significant new measures to speed up investments.

In the current geopolitical situation and in the context of the EU's changed state aid policy, competition for industrial investments has intensified, and Finland's competitive position has weakened. Finland's inbound investment plans and projects largely relate to the production of electricity. To speed up investments, the Government is preparing to adopt a tax credit for large-scale industrial investments that support the transition to a net zero economy, for example, investments in battery and hydrogen projects and fossil-fuel free steel industry. This kind of tax credit is permitted by the EU's Temporary Crisis and Transition Framework. The goal is to get large-scale, electricity-intensive industrial investments off the ground and to support the creation of an industrial ecosystem for the clean transition in Finland.

The Government will bolster the ability of the new Finnish Industry Investment group to promote investment by reallocating a total of EUR 300 million of state investment assets to it (EUR 100 million/year) for direct investments. This investment in growth aims, together with private financing, to assemble a financing package of about EUR 900 million for growth companies during the current parliamentary term.

There are currently a significant number of investments in energy production and energy-intensive investments being launched across Finland. In this situation, it is important to ensure that power grids do not become a bottleneck for investments needed by the market anywhere in Finland. The Government is committed to ensuring the Fingrid and Gasgrid are able to make investments. This will be achieved through good ownership steering and, if necessary, by strengthening the capital structure of these companies to meet the needs of energy-intensive industrial investments. The Government is also committed to ensuring the capacity of the main grid in all of Finland and to ensuring that investments are made.

The Government will investigate an expansion of the infrastructure exception to the cap on the deductibility of interest expenses with respect to major energy projects, and implement this where possible. The Government will also look into improving the ability of non-profit corporations to invest in investment funds incorporated as limited partnerships starting in 2026. The Government will also invest in the growth, competitiveness and profitability of the bioeconomy sector with additional money for food exports, security of supply and forest sector value chains.

The Government will adopt occupational diesel for heavy goods vehicles when the EU's new emissions trading scheme for fuel distributors enters into force in 2027.

Major new investments in research and development

The Act on State Funding of Research and Development (R&D Funding Act) provides for an increase in central government Budget authorities and appropriations intended for R&D operations to a total corresponding to 1.2 per cent of GDP by 2030. It has now been decided to increase R&D funding by EUR 194 million in 2025, EUR 367 million in 2026, EUR 592 million in 2027 and EUR 562 million in 2028.

The Government will increase Business Finland's Budget authority for R&D funding by EUR 85 million in 2025, EUR 200 million in 2026 and EUR 360 million in 2027 and from then on. Funding will be allocated particularly to supporting corporate R&D activities and to cooperation between businesses and researchers. The Government is reserving EUR 250 million in funding for the replacement of the EuroHPC LUMI supercomputer with a new supercomputer.

The Research Council of Finland's Budget Authority for research projects will be increased by EUR 15 million in 2025-2026 and by EUR 45 million starting in 2027. A permanent annual increase of EUR 15 million will be made to the Budget authority for applications to the Research Council of Finland for thematic research infrastructure funding. In addition, new targeted funding will be created for the Research Council of Finland for joint research infrastructures (incl. testing platforms). This targeted funding will be allocated a EUR 20 million Budget authority in 2026 and a EUR 50 million Budget authority from 2027 onwards. The Government will allocate a total of EUR 40 million to the fixed-term post doc programme for research institutes. The funding will enable the hiring of a total of 85 post doc researchers for three years.

The national co-financing of EU-financed R&D projects for higher education institutions and government research institutes will be increased by EUR 15 million in 2025, EUR 20 million in 2026 and EUR 25 million from 2027 onwards in addition to the EUR 35 million previously decided. Central government funding for university-level medical and social work research in healthcare units will be permanently increased by EUR 5 million. An annual increase of EUR 4 million will be made to bioeconomy research and development.

According to the R&D Funding Act, state R&D funding must increase in 2025-2028 by about EUR 280 million each year compared to the previous year. The Government will not allocate all of this increase at this point, but will leave some room for manoeuvre in the coming years. The increase for 2028 will not be allocated, because it falls within the next parliamentary term.

The Government recognises that the cultural and creative sectors are industries that have significant growth potential. Business Finland will promote the growth and exports of the creative sector. As part of R&D funding, the Government will promote an increase of the R&D intensity of the creative sector and will promote the commercialisation of research-based innovations created in the fields of art and culture.

Outlook for the Finnish economy

The Finnish economy is in recession and production fell last year more than previously forecast. The increase in prices and interest rates has reduced investments and household consumption. However, the economy is expected to return to growth in 2025, when slowing inflation and a downward turn in interest rates, together with fairly good income development, will increase the disposable income of households.

Investments will also grow when the construction sector recovers from its current slump and the outlook for the global economy improves. However, the Government's adjustment measures will reduce domestic demand and dampen economic growth in the next few years. The Ministry of Finance's Economic Survey, which includes its new forecast, will be published on 25 April 2024.

State of public finances

Subdued economic growth and the weak trend in employment mean that the growth in tax revenue will remain slow this year. At the same time, expenditure is growing fast. The general government deficit was 2.5 per cent last year and will grow to well over 3 per cent this year without any additional measures. The Government is committed to taking additional measures to ensure that Finland does not trigger the excessive deficit procedure in 2024. Without additional measures, the general government deficit will remain very deep. The additional adjustment measures now decided by the Government will improve the general government deficit starting in 2024. Based on the calculations under the policy scenario, the adjustment measures of the Government Programme together with the additional measures decided now are expected to stabilise the debt ratio trend.

The Government will curb the growth in expenditure. The additional adjustment measures will ensure that the expenditure ceiling decided in the General Government Fiscal Plan in autumn 2023 will not be exceeded. As a result of the additional adjustment measures, the Government has also taken a discretionary decision to reduce the expenditure ceiling during the parliamentary term by EUR 430 million in 2025, EUR 612 million in 2026 and EUR 492 million in 2027. The Government has also decided to reduce the supplementary budget provision by EUR 100 million per year and the unallocated reserve by EUR 197 million in 2025, EUR 175 in 2026 and EUR 331 million in 2027. In addition, the criteria changes to be made to expenditure outside the spending limits will reduce expenditure by about EUR 100 million per year. The criteria changes will not be considered structural corrections that raise the expenditure ceiling and, therefore, these measures will reduce the expenditure of on-budget entities accordingly.

Savings to be used for reducing indebtedness

The Government Programme's solution of channelling savings in off-budget entities towards strengthening the public debt ratio will be implemented in 2025 in accordance with the entries in the minutes of the Government's budget session on 19 September 2023. The contributions of employees and employers will be balanced in line with the decision made in the government budget session of 2023. The solution will not increase taxes paid by employees and enterprises on average starting in 2023.

The channelling solution will allow unemployment insurance contributions to change as usual. The employers' share of the solution will be implemented by increasing their health insurance contributions, which will lower the insurance contributions of employees correspondingly. The employees' share of the solution will be implemented by increasing their medical expenses contribution. The total amount to be channelled will be scaled in such a way that the effects of the proposals affecting the off-budget entities under Annex B of the Government Programme, which have been specified in the preparation, and the decisions made in connection with the General Government Fiscal Plan 2025-2028 will be channelled in their entirety to achieve the Government's economic policy objectives.

Funding of wellbeing services counties

Central government funding for the wellbeing services counties will total approximately EUR 26.2 billion in 2025. Compared to the previous General Government Fiscal Plan, the level of funding will increase by approximately EUR 1.8 billion. This growth is explained, in particular, by the ex-post control under the Act on the Funding of Wellbeing Services Counties, which will be implemented for the first time in 2025 and amount to around EUR 1.5 billion. The rising cost level, the anticipated growth in the need for services, and changes to the tasks of wellbeing services counties will also affect the changes in funding.

In 2028, central government funding for wellbeing services counties will be approximately EUR 25.1 billion at 2025 prices. It is estimated that the amount of the ex-post control will decrease in 2026-2028 as the finances of wellbeing services counties improve. Moreover, funding will be reduced due to the changes to the tasks of healthcare and social welfare agreed both in the Government Programme and now in connection with the General Government Fiscal Plan.

The measures in the Programme of Prime Minister Orpo's Government are, to a large extent, already included in the General Government Fiscal Plan of autumn 2023. Of the discretionary changes to duties, transferring the responsibility for funding the reimbursement of travel costs for emergency medical services to wellbeing services counties will affect the costs and funding of wellbeing services counties in particular. The impact will total about EUR 130 million starting 2026.

In addition, the General Government Fiscal Plan now outlines measures to scale back the obligations of wellbeing services counties related to, for example, the maximum waiting time guarantee in primary healthcare, the minimum staffing level in 24-hour care for older people, and limiting the range of services offered by social welfare and specialised health care. Client charges in healthcare and social welfare will be increased by an additional EUR 100 million on top of the increase of EUR 50 million already decided in the Government Programme.

The savings target for the division of responsibilities between hospitals and urgent and emergency health services has been reduced. In connection with the preparation of the changes to the funding model agreed in the Government Programme, transitional equalisations will be changed to achieve a one-off saving of EUR 15 million in 2026 and EUR 20 million in 2027. The entry into force of the maximum waiting time for access to therapy for children and young people will be pushed back four months to begin on 1 May 2025 to ensure smooth implementation.

These new decisions will lead to a net reduction in funding of wellbeing services counties of about EUR 350 million in 2025 and about EUR 550 million in 2028.

It is estimated that the changes in duties will reduce the costs and funding of wellbeing services counties in the same amount and, therefore, the measures will not strengthen the finances of wellbeing services counties. On the other hand, the poor availability of staff has challenged both the operations and finances of wellbeing services counties. The shortage of staff increases cost pressures and impairs the availability of services. When deciding on measures, one of the Government's objectives has been to ease the execution of statutory duties and reduce the pressure to recruit additional staff for social welfare and healthcare services.

Situation of municipal finances

In the next few years, there will be a serious imbalance between municipal revenue and expenditure, foreshadowing tax increases and tight budgetary discipline. Without new measures the loan portfolio of municipal finances runs a risk of substantial growth. In recent years, pandemic-related support paid by central government and tax revenue delays created by the health and social services reform have kept municipal finances close to balance. Following the health and social services reform, the room for manoeuvre in municipal finances decreased significantly, highlighting the importance of proactive planning of the service network and the assessment of the need for investments.

Central government transfers to municipalities for basic public services will be increased by EUR 277 million from 2025 onwards. This will cushion the effects of the 2023 year-end update to the transfer calculation on the revenue and expenditure transferred from municipalities to wellbeing services counties. The effectiveness of local income tax will be improved by abolishing the earned income allowance and by simultaneously adjusting the central government taxation of earned income to limit tax increases. As a result, local income tax revenue in mainland Finland will grow on an annual basis by EUR 340 million, while central government income tax revenue will fall by EUR 415 million. Compensations for municipalities' tax losses will be reduced proportionate to the growth in their local income tax revenue.

In addition, as part of the new adjustment measures, the duties and obligations of municipalities will be reduced, or the income from charges of municipalities will be increased, by EUR 100 million from 2025 onwards based on the preparation for the programme for reducing the duties and obligations of municipalities and on the further work to be carried out before the government budget session.

The Government's new adjustment measures also target the municipal sector. However, it is estimated that the measures decided by the Government will improve municipal finances by a total of about EUR 130 million. In addition, the solution of channelling savings in off-budget entities, presented in the Government Programme, will reinforce the municipal finances by a total of just under EUR 100 million.

On-budget revenue and expenditure

Central government on-budget revenue, expenditure and balance, EUR billion

2024 (incl. first supplementary budget proposal) 2025 2026 2027 2028 Revenue, excl. net borrowing 75,1 76,7 79,9 82,1 84,0 Expenditure (at current prices) 88,1 87,6 88,5 89,6 91,0 Deficit 12,9 10,8 8,6 7,5 6,9

On-budget expenditure in 2025 is expected to be approximately EUR 87.6 billion, which is roughly EUR 0.5 billion more than that budgeted for 2024 (including the first supplementary budget proposal). The expenditure level will be lowered by reforms and expenditure savings in line with the Government Programme. The new adjustment measures decided now will reduce the level of central government expenditure by EUR 1.3 billion in 2025. The increase in the level of appropriations compared to 2024 is due to the ex-post control of the funding of the wellbeing services counties (EUR 1.5 billion) and the statutory and contractual index adjustments in 2025 (EUR 1.3 billion).

The slowing of inflation has halted the growth of general interest rates. However, annual debt interest payments are expected to rise from the EUR 3.1 billion projected for 2025 to EUR 4.0 billion by the end of the spending limits period.

The central government on-budget deficit is expected to total EUR 10.8 billion in 2025, which is EUR 2.1 billion more than that budgeted for 2024 (including the first supplementary budget proposal). In 2025-2028, the deficit will be EUR 8.5 billion on average per year.

Central government debt is expected to total around EUR 180 billion at the end of 2025, which is approximately 62 per cent in ratio to gross domestic product (GDP). Central government debt is estimated to be EUR 203 billion at the end of 2028, which is about 63 per cent in ratio to GDP.

The General Government Fiscal Plan will be adopted at the government plenary session on 25 April 2024. It will be published online on the same date.

Accounting for 3 to 4% of the EU's total CO2 emissions, or over 144 million tonnes of CO2 in 2019 alone, the sector has faced increasing pressure to transition towards more sustainable practices. However, recent initiatives within the framework of Interreg projects are showcasing promising strides towards greener maritime transport.

The EfficientFlow Project: Revolutionizing Port Operations

In the Baltic Sea, the ports of Gävle in Sweden and Rauma in Finland have spearheaded a transformative approach to maritime traffic management. Through the EU co-financed Interreg project 'EfficientFlow,' these ports have introduced innovative systems aimed at reducing emissions and enhancing operational efficiency.

At the heart of the 'EfficientFlow' project lies the Port Activity App, a digital tool designed to streamline port operations by enabling real-time updates of ship schedules. This technology facilitates better coordination of port calls, ultimately reducing waiting times for vessels. The result? A significant reduction in fuel consumption and carbon emissions, estimated to reach up to 20%.

Building upon the success of the Port Activity App, the project has also inspired the development of 'Time Slot Gävle,' a queuing management system that further optimizes port operations. By allowing ships to apply for queue tickets well in advance, this system enhances the predictability of port activities, leading to even greater energy and emissions savings.

Scaling Up for Global Impact

The success of the EfficientFlow project in Gävle and Rauma has paved the way for its adoption in over a dozen other ports in Finland. With plans to extend this open-source system to ports worldwide, the project holds the potential for substantial environmental savings on a global scale. Funded primarily by the EU Cohesion Policy's Interreg Central Baltic Programme, the project exemplifies the collaborative efforts needed to drive sustainable change in maritime transport.

Hydrogen-Powered Cargo Ships: A Game-Changer in the North Sea Basin

Meanwhile, in the North Sea Basin, another EU co-financed project from the Interreg North Sea Programme, has achieved a groundbreaking milestone in green shipping. Operating primarily in Denmark and the Netherlands, this project facilitated the creation of the world's first 100% hydrogen-driven cargo ships, named H2 Barge 1 and H2 Barge 2.

These vessels represent a paradigm shift in maritime transport, as they are powered by green hydrogen, produced using electricity from renewable sources. By eliminating emissions from their operations, the H2 Barge 1 and 2 are leading the charge towards a carbon-neutral shipping industry, reducing thousands of tonnes of CO2 emissions annually.

Overcoming Challenges: From Retrofitting to Renewable Energy Integration

The journey towards greener maritime transport has not been without its challenges. Retrofitting vessels from diesel to zero emissions required advanced technological solutions, including the integration of batteries and hydrogen fuel cells. However, the real innovation lay in addressing the energy needs of these vessels with renewable sources.

Within the same Interreg project, the University of Southern Denmark undertook research to develop an intelligent harbour concept on the Danish island of Ærø. By analyzing energy demands, simulating different scenarios, and suggesting incentives to steer demand in the electric grid, the project facilitated the integration of electric ferries into the island's transport system.

Collaboration for a Sustainable Future

The success stories of the Port Activity App project and the H2 Barge project underscore the importance of collaboration in driving the green shift in shipping. By harnessing EU Cohesion Policy funds and partnering with visionary private sector companies, Interreg projects are pioneering innovative solutions that hold the key to a more sustainable future for maritime transport. As these initiatives continue to evolve and expand, they offer hope for a cleaner, greener shipping industry that benefits both the environment and global economy.",ec.europa.eu,news,European Commission,,0.1843137254901961,454058891,5,,

He stressed that Public schools lack essential resources like laboratory equipment and computers, and this disparity is worsened by computer-based exams such as JAMB UTME, which disadvantaged students struggle with due to limited access to technology and electricity.

He suggested incentivizing professional counsellors to study abroad for career management in schools, as Nigeria lacks the necessary programs.

He stressed the importance of cultivating a love for learning over vocational training alone and highlighted the need for entrepreneurial skills rather than just job-specific training.

He advised students to pursue education wherever they find it, focusing on solving real-world problems.

For policymakers, he urged respect and better teacher training, emphasizing the need for STEM education.

With your extensive experience in education advocacy, what are some of the biggest challenges facing students from disadvantaged backgrounds in Nigeria?

""The Nigerian education system was not designed with the poor in mind. Public schools where most of them study are grossly under-resourced largely because children of the rich are not there.

""Those children lack access to laboratory equipment and computers, but we assess them through public examinations that are constructed on the assumption that all Nigerian students are computer literate.

""JAMB UTME is one example that stands out. The test is computer-based, which puts a serious obstacle in the way of poor students with regards to access to higher education in a country where a university degree has been presented to society as a meal ticket. WAEC is moving in the same direction.

""Most of the students I'm talking about don't have access to reliable electricity supply and broadband internet. Now, electricity supply in Nigeria has been configured to exclude the poor from access to the little supply available to the country.

""It is an open secret that in the age we live in, lack of access to electricity and internet spells precarity for the affected individuals. In this situation, social migration will remain a mirage for most disadvantaged people in Nigeria.""

Your doctoral research focused on career management for those from economically disadvantaged families. How can this system be implemented in Nigerian schools?

""We need the human capital to implement it. We don't have that now, but we can start by giving incentives to intellectually capable professional counsellors to go for graduate studies in career management in the UK or North America. We don't offer graduate studies in career management in Nigerian universities currently.

""I know what I know in this field because I studied in the UK and had the opportunity to do further research in this field in countries such as Finland, Sweden, Norway, and Austria.

""Meanwhile, we can leverage technology to help students who have access to the internet via the work we do at Nigerian Teachers Community. Some of our partners in the UK and Finland are happy to help if relevant education agencies in the country show interest in fixing this major missing link in Nigeria's education system.

""I will continue to help as a private citizen through my career counselling clinic, which is available both physically and virtually.""

You've mentioned projects across Europe and North America. How do these international experiences inform your approach to education in Nigeria?

""Graciously, I benefitted from cutting-edge training in career management abroad, studying in places such as Cambridge University and Austria's Centre for Innovation in Education. My recent research trip to Finland was a big eye-opener.

""My rich international experience makes me realize that our overfocus on certificate acquisition is one of our major obstacles to development. We need to define education and learning properly to ensure that our teachers do not continue to produce seekers of white-collar jobs in a world where young people are becoming multi-millionaires legitimately before they are twenty years old.

""We are bringing UK's top business school to Nigeria to work with about one hundred outstanding teenagers in August this year so those young people can experience early success at a global level. We are also bringing Finland's top teacher-training institution to help about one hundred Nigerian teachers acquire the latest teaching skills so we can start transforming the way we educate our children.

""What we call education in Nigeria currently is mere schooling that does not deliver learning. This must change for national development to take off. Our politicians must understand that education is truly the bedrock of development.

""It is that one thing you fix, and our other problems will evaporate. So, my privileged education and international network have separated my work from what regular educationists do. It's my hope that our governments will take full advantage of what we are doing.""

The new Student Loan Scheme is a hot topic. What are your thoughts on its potential impact on access to higher education?

""It is a good starting point if the spirit of the law establishing it is respected. All that money will be released directly to tertiary institutions in Nigeria. That's my understanding of what the government wants to do. That's a good idea so young people don't borrow money from public coffers and use it to indulge in self-aggrandizement.

""The student loan scheme does not, however, remove the hurdles poor students must overcome in pursuit of higher education. Children of the elites will get the loans because their parents will provide them the tuition services that will guarantee them access since the competition for university spaces remains stiff.

""We are not yet running an equitable education system. We are copying the American model, which has not worked well, even for Americans. Ultimately, we should look in the direction of the Scandinavian countries for good examples to copy.

""Education is a public good. The government must take financial responsibility for it. When you borrow money to go to school, you study what you believe will provide the financial returns that will enable you to pay your loan, not necessarily what you love and have gifts for.

""The system we are putting in place is gravitating towards this unfortunate end. We must correct it as soon as possible if we want a Nigeria that we will be proud of and the country that works well for everyone.""

There's a growing focus on skills development in education. How can Nigerian schools better prepare students for the job market?

""Our children should first be helped to take joy in learning. We should learn for learning's sake. That's how to become curious individuals who ask questions and challenge the status quo. Jobs are created by people who ask questions and make inquiries, not certificate holders who believe that society owes them jobs.

""The brain drain we are witnessing in Nigeria is largely fueled by this unfortunate type of education that makes young people think that it is their certificate that qualifies them for job opportunities. Employers and people with pains are seeking problem solvers and will pay handsome amounts to have their pain points removed.

""I hear a lot about the need for vocational training. The people talking about it most probably mean well, but I don't have evidence that proves that that is what we need desperately in our education system.

""Spending years teaching people how to fix cars, make cake and fix roofs may not be as empowering as becoming critical thinkers, excellent communicators, and leaders. You can learn how to make cake or even repair your water dispenser without spending years in school. YouTube can teach you that for free and will do better than most schools in the world because people make new videos to help you solve new problems.

""I'm an educationist and know that schools don't move that fast. We need entrepreneurs who do not have to be mechanics. They are people with the capacity to take calculated risks that create jobs for thousands of people and solve the problems of millions of people.

""Both our grammar schools and vocational institutions currently lack the capacity to deliver good results in that area. This is largely because the people attempting to produce entrepreneurs for us are not entrepreneurs themselves. You can't give what you don't have. Let's stop putting the cart before the horse.""

Your foundation offers a ""Study Abroad Bootcamp."" What are your views on the role of studying abroad in Nigerian education?

""We need to learn from those who have trodden the path before us, but we should send only critical-minded people abroad for further studies. This is to guarantee that they don't come home and impose Western solutions on Southern problems.

""The people we send abroad for further studies must be people who are patriotic enough to want to return home to help, and we must create an enabling environment for them to come home to help.

""The bootcamps we are associated with accommodate those needs. That's why they are popular with the discerning parents who send their teenage children to benefit from them. We prepare them to withstand the cultural shock they will experience abroad and give them the tools they need to stand out academically and in any other department that matters.

""We are now collaborating with a UK business school to ensure we can make the programme accessible to more teenagers in Nigeria and the wider African continent. It's now called the Rising African Scholars Programme (RASP). I'm happy that I'm making this indispensable contribution to the development of Nigeria and the wider African continent.""

The Nigerian Education Enhancement Project aims to lift millions out of poverty. Can you elaborate on the project's specific strategies?

""The project recognizes that teachers are at the centre of the education industry and that the best brains must be attracted and retained in the industry if we are to move our education forward. Well-trained, recognized, and rewarded teachers will help you get the results you want from education.

""We are doing poorly in this area as a country. The education policy arena in Nigeria is populated by misfits. They are in office to fill the quotas of their benefactors and not because they understand what we need to move our education forward.

""Our Education Enhancement Project is intervening to address those problems by leveraging the skills of our international partners to promote good education practices in Nigeria.

""Over half a million teachers are learning how to teach properly on our platform for free. The study abroad bootcamp we discussed earlier is one of the elements of the project. There are many others.""

Your online communities have garnered a large following. How do you leverage social media to address educational needs in Nigeria?

""In a modern society, people naturally gravitate toward where their friends are. What we have done is to meet education stakeholders in places where they hang out and serve them learning materials in ways that do not disrupt the fun they are having.

""People, including teachers and parents, learn on our platforms in engaging and entertaining ways. The beauty of what we are doing is that they are offered by well-informed people, including professors, for free.

""We are crowd-sourcing learning materials and delivering them for free. Our teachers' platform on Facebook called Nigeria Teachers is approaching three quarters of a million. Teachers ask questions on the platform about their jobs and get free answers in minutes from their colleagues around the world.

""The platform is also a place where teachers come to relax. It's a replication of the typical staff room in a school. We discuss lesson plan, school leadership and romance issues, among others there.

""It has become the most vibrant teachers' platform in the world, and we are getting international recognition for the work we are doing there. We also have other fora for students, parents, spirituality, and even cars for those who love automobiles. They run on a 24/7 basis.""

You offer programs like ""Management Training"" to equip graduates with job skills. How can such initiatives bridge the gap between education and employment?

""Our management training programmes focus on delivering employability skills to tertiary institution graduates. It's an open secret that our universities and polytechnics are not producing the kind of people employers want.

""The programmes we run bridge that gap and help the beneficiaries to gain the skills and confidence they need to do well in selection processes and also do well on the job.

""Most university lecturers lack industry exposure and therefore lack the capacity to prepare their students for what they will meet in the workplace. We don't waste time talking about irrelevant theories. We give them what they need to get the jobs they want or set up the businesses they are dreaming about.

""Interestingly, we deliver everything they need in only one week. They learn what universities struggle to teach them in four years within only one week. They find the experience amazing.""

What are some of the most promising trends you see in Nigerian education today?

""Education technology, homeschooling, and teachers' preference for freelance work.

""Education technology is helping to deliver education to people we cannot reach physically. That's a good thing, given the huge cost of moving from one place to another in today's Nigeria. The fuel subsidy is gone, and it is probably for good.

""More parents are unhappy with the quality and type of education their children are receiving in conventional classrooms and are rebelling against that, especially as it comes at a cost they consider unreasonable. I think they have a point.

""Many teachers do not know what learning means and waste children's time by making them cram a lot of information they don't need and demand parents' precious time through truckloads of assignments their children bring home every day.

""Schools must upgrade if they want to remain in business. The poor remuneration of teachers in Nigeria is driving the freelance movement. This is not good for our education system.

""Relationship stability is one of the qualities of a good education system. That involves school leaders, teachers and students working together for a long time.""

What are the biggest challenges you anticipate for the future of education in Nigeria?

""The brain drain we are witnessing in the industry is a huge challenge. It is robbing us of our best brains. Universities are the worst hit.

""Many STEM departments lack the professors they need to produce the human capital requisite for our development.

""Funding, access, teaching and learning, and governance are also problematic areas. It's my hope that the relevant authorities will find the wisdom to address those challenges urgently.""

In your view, what role can technology play in improving educational outcomes in Nigeria?

""I have already called your attention to what we are using technology to do for teachers. You can extrapolate it to other stakeholders in the industry. Technology when used appropriately, saves you money and time and helps you reach more people in ways that make them truly learn and at their own pace and convenience. We can't ignore the use of modern technology in our education system and remain competitive.""

Drawing on your experience, what advice would you give to a young Nigerian student passionate about education?

""Define education properly. Schooling does not automatically result in education. Get the education you want wherever you can find it. That place doesn't have to be called a university.

""The Nigerian education system takes too long to deliver what looks like education, but when scrutinized, it is not education but knowledge that may be useless.

""Find out what people with problems want. Get the skills that will solve those problems and learn how to promote yourself to people who need what you can do.

""Remember to study what you love and not what will give your parents bragging rights in the short run and make everybody unhappy in the long run.

""Invest in the acquisition of principles that endure not just the information you need to pass exams and earn a certificate that no one may ever bother about. People hardly ask me for my certificate. What puts food on my table comes through referrals.

""As Emerson said, 'if you do better jobs than others, the world will make a bitten path to your door even if you live in the woods.'""

As a leading education figure, what message do you have for policymakers on improving Nigerian education?

""Give teachers the respect, recognition and rewards they deserve. We are not aware of any education system that delivers results without teachers. Train them well for their jobs and give incentives to young people to study education courses, especially in STEM areas.",naijanews.com,news,Naija News,Ikenna Ngere,-0.01960784313725494,454054766,25,https://www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Students-Loan.webp,

The Calder Hall nuclear power station in the UK, the world's first, was commissioned in 1956. Almost 70 years ago. At the time, Australians were busy building the Snowy Mountains Project, hosting the Olympics and assembling our last FJ Holden.

Since then, we've developed world-leading industries in mining, LNG and agriculture, and built one of the largest, interconnected electricity networks in the world. We have excellent schools, TAFEs and universities. And there are now more than 400 nuclear power plants operating in 32 countries.

Without doubt, we'd need some help. For a start, we'd need to buy the technology along with specialist engineering and construction services from firms with the right hardware and experience. These are available in France, Japan, South Korea, the UK and the US, among others.

Delaying any important decision is counterproductive when the net-zero task is immense and urgent and success isn't guaranteed.

The other two questions are more difficult to answer because we simply don't know.

Whether we should build nuclear in Australia surely depends on whether it can be done safely and affordably. Those arguing against nuclear outright, or that we should delay a decision, also often say the combination of wind, solar and energy storage, perhaps with some natural gas generation, is impossible to beat on cost.

CSIRO's latest GenCost report again supports such views. Moreover, prominent cost blowouts, delays and even cancellations of nuclear projects in Finland, the UK and the US are cited as indicative of what Australia can expect.

In contrast, advocates for nuclear usually quote competitive costs for nuclear projects in China, South Korea and the UAE, and emphasise the reliability benefits of nuclear. Some also criticise the GenCost report.

But the confidence shown by both sides of this debate is striking since so very few, ourselves included, have any experience in nuclear power generation.

Entitled to incentives

Further, cost blowouts and delays are common for large infrastructure projects in many countries, and not just for nuclear. Snowy 2.0, several tunnels in our capital cities and electricity transmission projects in Australia and overseas come to mind immediately. There are many others.

And delaying any important decision is counterproductive when the net-zero task is immense and urgent, and success isn't guaranteed.

Indeed, any decision on whether we should build nuclear power in Australia must also consider much more than the unit cost of generation and its likely timeframe. The Net Zero Australia Project found that net-zero requires several hundred gigawatts of solar and wind, supported by tens of gigawatts of firming and thousands of kilometres of new transmission, just to supply domestic needs. And we'd need a lot more of all these things if we exported green commodities, too.

It remains to be seen whether we can do this in the next 30 years, particularly given increasing opposition from some stakeholders, workforce constraints and current permitting timelines. And whether such a system will deliver the lowest cost of reliable electricity as renewables becomes dominant is also far from clear. Models suggest it may, but models are not a source of truth.

Clearly, some nuclear would support system reliability as renewables grow, and it would reduce the renewable, storage and transmission capacity that we need to build. It therefore makes no sense to obstruct any investor wanting to develop nuclear or any other clean energy option.

Rather, we should encourage them all.

As for what kind of nuclear power plants to build, that's just more noise. Large and small nuclear have both been plagued by cost challenges in OECD countries; problems that the Koreans, Chinese and others seem to be able to avoid. The decision on what to build should therefore be left to developers and investors who understand costs, market proposition and development risk much better than any commentator.

So, that leaves our final question. What role should Australian governments play, aside from the unwinding of legislative bans?

First, we think that nuclear power should be entitled to the same incentives that other clean-generation technologies enjoy.

Second, the government should invest strategically to find out whether nuclear could be competitive. The Net-Zero Australia Project found that several trillion dollars need to be invested to reach net zero by 2050, irrespective of how. Governments could co-invest up to, say, $1 billion (about 0.02 per cent) of this total to support a few robust engineering, siting, and commercial feasibility studies, including fuel and waste management plans.

If no one co-invests in these studies, then we have a very quick answer. If these studies attract co-investment, it will be money well spent because we will learn from these studies' findings.

Either way, we cut through the noise and clarify our direction.",afr.com,news,Australian Financial Review,,0.1529411764705881,454048262,9,https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.53%2C$multiply_2%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/c_scale%2Cw_800%2Cq_88%2Cf_jpg/t_afr_opinion_no_age_social_wm/67a72f9190b2d816abe7bc36514d4ac3f208971a,eng-9588712

What are the benefits of a sauna for your skin?

Saunas can boost collagen production, helping you age in reverse

With temps upwards of 158-212 degrees F, saunas induce vasodilation, widening blood vessels. This causes increased blood flow throughout the body, including to the skin. Improved circulation can promote cell turnover and deliver more oxygen and nutrients to the skin cells, including those responsible for collagen production, the protein that provides structure to the skin, helping it maintain elasticity and firmness, attests Erika Luren, MA, MS, NP, founder of Parasol Aesthetics, Dermatology and Wellness.

Are saunas good for your skin? Yes! They can detoxify pores

Because skin is constantly exposed to the outside world, it's vulnerable to environmental stressors and toxins. Saunas promote sweating, which helps the body eliminate toxins and impurities. ""Studies show that sauna detoxification can rid skin of toxic elements like lead, copper, nickel, mercury and arsenic,"" says Kristina Krosky Helstowski, an aesthetician for Redwood Outdoors. ""Look at it as your garbage system dumping those toxins out and allowing the skin to expel those toxins that age us."" While the heat is shedding toxins from our skin, mechanical perspiration helps wash them away for good.

Saunas can exfoliate skin and help you shed dead skin cells

The high temperature in saunas causes the skin's surface to warm up, which can soften the outer layer of the skin, known as the stratum corneum. The combination of heat, steam and sweat collectively removes and softens dead skin cells, says Helstowski. Sweat also contains natural moisturizing factors, such as urea and amino acids, which can help to hydrate the skin and soften dead skin cells, facilitating their removal. If you want to go a step further, gently rub or massage your skin with your hands or a gentle exfoliating scrub while you're in the sauna. This physical exfoliation helps to loosen and remove dead skin cells, revealing smoother, more radiant skin underneath.

Are saunas good for your skin? Yes! They can help skincare absorb better

Because saunas warm the skin, opening up blood vessels, they also open our pores to help our skincare absorb better. ""When our pores are open, these products can penetrate deeper into the skin, maximizing their effectiveness,"" says Luren. It's important to note that skin can be a little more sensitive after a hot sauna session, so stick to gentle, hydrating products without any abrasive or irritating ingredients. For best results, Luren recommends following each session with a moisturizing cream boosted with ceramides.

Additionally, always cleanse your skin thoroughly before applying any skincare products to remove sweat, dirt and impurities that may have accumulated during your sauna session.

Saunas can prevent breakouts

Since acne is caused by gunked-up pores and dirt, oil and grime deep within the skin's surface, it's reasonable to think that a sauna can help fight breakouts. ""Because it does rid us of toxins and open pores by producing salty sweat, it can prevent those clogged pores that cause blackheads and whiteheads,"" says Luren. Saunas can also slow sebum production in the skin, i.e. oil, and make us less prone to acne in the first place. In the same vein, saunas can also be helpful in preventing ingrown hairs.

Are saunas good for your skin? Yes! They can fight stress, which helps skin

Chronic stress is well-documented for its negative effects on our skin and for exacerbating conditions like psoriasis, eczema and acne. ""Stress triggers the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, a trio of glands that play key roles in the body's response to stress. This can cause the production of local pro-inflammatory factors, such as cortisol and key hormones in the fight-or-flight stress response called catecholamines, which can direct immune cells from the bloodstream into the skin or stimulate pro-inflammatory skin cells,"" explains Harvard Health. Studies have also shown that psychological stress disrupts the top layer of our skin, which is essential for locking in moisture and keeping out germs, prolonging its ability to repair itself.

Saunas beat stress by providing a warm and comforting environment that helps to relax muscles and alleviate tension. The heat stimulates the release of endorphins, the body's natural feel-good chemicals. This can create euphoria and promote relaxation, reducing stress levels.

Many also enjoy using saunas as a social activity, whether with friends, family, fellow spa-goers or gym members. Social interaction like this can provide emotional support and a sense of connection, which can also be beneficial for stress relief.

What do I need to know before going into the sauna?

Certain medical conditions might make saunas unsafe for you, so always consult your doctor if you're unsure. That also goes for if you have eczema and psoriasis flare-ups. While saunas can be helpful for these conditions, Dr. Undavia says too much exposure to the sauna's dry air can unintentionally make dry, scaly patches worse.

The amount of time you spend in a sauna should also be monitored. ""10-20 minutes is optimal, and the frequency can be a few times a month to a few times a week depending on tolerance and benefits to the individual,"" advises Luren.

Finally, all that sweating can lead to dehydration, so drinking plenty of water before and after is important. You may also need to supplement with electrolytes since dehydration can sometimes deplete the body's electrolyte supply.

The combination of heat, steam and sweat collectively removes and softens dead skin cells, says Helstowski. Sweat also contains natural moisturizing factors, such as urea and amino acids, which can help to hydrate the skin and soften dead skin cells, facilitating their removal. If you want to go a step further, gently rub or massage your skin with your hands or a gentle exfoliating scrub while you're in the sauna. This physical exfoliation helps to loosen and remove dead skin cells, revealing smoother, more radiant skin underneath.

Are saunas good for your skin? Yes! They can help skincare absorb better

Because saunas warm the skin, opening up blood vessels, they also open our pores to help our skincare absorb better. ""When our pores are open, these products can penetrate deeper into the skin, maximizing their effectiveness,"" says Luren. It's important to note that skin can be a little more sensitive after a hot sauna session, so stick to gentle, hydrating products without any abrasive or irritating ingredients. For best results, Luren recommends following each session with a moisturizing cream boosted with ceramides.

Additionally, always cleanse your skin thoroughly before applying any skincare products to remove sweat, dirt and impurities that may have accumulated during your sauna session.

Saunas can prevent breakouts

Since acne is caused by gunked-up pores and dirt, oil and grime deep within the skin's surface, it's reasonable to think that a sauna can help fight breakouts. ""Because it does rid us of toxins and open pores by producing salty sweat, it can prevent those clogged pores that cause blackheads and whiteheads,"" says Luren. Saunas can also slow sebum production in the skin, i.e. oil, and make us less prone to acne in the first place. In the same vein, saunas can also be helpful in preventing ingrown hairs.

Are saunas good for your skin? Yes! They can fight stress, which helps skin

Chronic stress is well-documented for its negative effects on our skin and for exacerbating conditions like psoriasis, eczema and acne. ""Stress triggers the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, a trio of glands that play key roles in the body's response to stress. This can cause the production of local pro-inflammatory factors, such as cortisol and key hormones in the fight-or-flight stress response called catecholamines, which can direct immune cells from the bloodstream into the skin or stimulate pro-inflammatory skin cells,"" explains Harvard Health. Studies have also shown that psychological stress disrupts the top layer of our skin, which is essential for locking in moisture and keeping out germs, prolonging its ability to repair itself.

Saunas beat stress by providing a warm and comforting environment that helps to relax muscles and alleviate tension. The heat stimulates the release of endorphins, the body's natural feel-good chemicals. This can create euphoria and promote relaxation, reducing stress levels.

Many also enjoy using saunas as a social activity, whether with friends, family, fellow spa-goers or gym members. Social interaction like this can provide emotional support and a sense of connection, which can also be beneficial for stress relief.

What do I need to know before going into the sauna?

Certain medical conditions might make saunas unsafe for you, so always consult your doctor if you're unsure. That also goes for if you have eczema and psoriasis flare-ups. While saunas can be helpful for these conditions, Dr. Undavia says too much exposure to the sauna's dry air can unintentionally make dry, scaly patches worse.

The amount of time you spend in a sauna should also be monitored. ""10-20 minutes is optimal, and the frequency can be a few times a month to a few times a week depending on tolerance and benefits to the individual,"" advises Luren.

Finally, all that sweating can lead to dehydration, so drinking plenty of water before and after is important. You may also need to supplement with electrolytes since dehydration can sometimes deplete the body's electrolyte supply.

What are the benefits of a sauna for your skin?

Saunas can boost collagen production, helping you age in reverse

With temps upwards of 158-212 degrees F, saunas induce vasodilation, widening blood vessels. This causes increased blood flow throughout the body, including to the skin. Improved circulation can promote cell turnover and deliver more oxygen and nutrients to the skin cells, including those responsible for collagen production, the protein that provides structure to the skin, helping it maintain elasticity and firmness, attests Erika Luren, MA, MS, NP, founder of Parasol Aesthetics, Dermatology and Wellness.

Chronic stress is well-documented for its negative effects on our skin and for exacerbating conditions like psoriasis, eczema and acne. ""Stress triggers the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, a trio of glands that play key roles in the body's response to stress. This can cause the production of local pro-inflammatory factors, such as cortisol and key hormones in the fight-or-flight stress response called catecholamines, which can direct immune cells from the bloodstream into the skin or stimulate pro-inflammatory skin cells,"" explains Harvard Health. Studies have also shown that psychological stress disrupts the top layer of our skin, which is essential for locking in moisture and keeping out germs, prolonging its ability to repair itself.

Saunas beat stress by providing a warm and comforting environment that helps to relax muscles and alleviate tension. The heat stimulates the release of endorphins, the body's natural feel-good chemicals. This can create euphoria and promote relaxation, reducing stress levels.

Many also enjoy using saunas as a social activity, whether with friends, family, fellow spa-goers or gym members. Social interaction like this can provide emotional support and a sense of connection, which can also be beneficial for stress relief.

What do I need to know before going into the sauna?

Certain medical conditions might make saunas unsafe for you, so always consult your doctor if you're unsure. That also goes for if you have eczema and psoriasis flare-ups. While saunas can be helpful for these conditions, Dr. Undavia says too much exposure to the sauna's dry air can unintentionally make dry, scaly patches worse.

The amount of time you spend in a sauna should also be monitored. ""10-20 minutes is optimal, and the frequency can be a few times a month to a few times a week depending on tolerance and benefits to the individual,"" advises Luren.

Finally, all that sweating can lead to dehydration, so drinking plenty of water before and after is important. You may also need to supplement with electrolytes since dehydration can sometimes deplete the body's electrolyte supply.

What are the benefits of a sauna for your skin?

Saunas can boost collagen production, helping you age in reverse

With temps upwards of 158-212 degrees F, saunas induce vasodilation, widening blood vessels. This causes increased blood flow throughout the body, including to the skin. Improved circulation can promote cell turnover and deliver more oxygen and nutrients to the skin cells, including those responsible for collagen production, the protein that provides structure to the skin, helping it maintain elasticity and firmness, attests Erika Luren, MA, MS, NP, founder of Parasol Aesthetics, Dermatology and Wellness.

Are saunas good for your skin? Yes! They can detoxify pores

Because skin is constantly exposed to the outside world, it's vulnerable to environmental stressors and toxins. Saunas promote sweating, which helps the body eliminate toxins and impurities. ""Studies show that sauna detoxification can rid skin of toxic elements like lead, copper, nickel, mercury and arsenic,"" says Kristina Krosky Helstowski, an aesthetician for Redwood Outdoors. ""Look at it as your garbage system dumping those toxins out and allowing the skin to expel those toxins that age us."" While the heat is shedding toxins from our skin, mechanical perspiration helps wash them away for good.

Saunas can exfoliate skin and help you shed dead skin cells

The high temperature in saunas causes the skin's surface to warm up, which can soften the outer layer of the skin, known as the stratum corneum. The combination of heat, steam and sweat collectively removes and softens dead skin cells, says Helstowski. Sweat also contains natural moisturizing factors, such as urea and amino acids, which can help to hydrate the skin and soften dead skin cells, facilitating their removal. If you want to go a step further, gently rub or massage your skin with your hands or a gentle exfoliating scrub while you're in the sauna. This physical exfoliation helps to loosen and remove dead skin cells, revealing smoother, more radiant skin underneath.

Are saunas good for your skin? Yes! They can help skincare absorb better

Because saunas warm the skin, opening up blood vessels, they also open our pores to help our skincare absorb better. ""When our pores are open, these products can penetrate deeper into the skin, maximizing their effectiveness,"" says Luren. It's important to note that skin can be a little more sensitive after a hot sauna session, so stick to gentle, hydrating products without any abrasive or irritating ingredients. For best results, Luren recommends following each session with a moisturizing cream boosted with ceramides.

Additionally, always cleanse your skin thoroughly before applying any skincare products to remove sweat, dirt and impurities that may have accumulated during your sauna session.

Saunas can prevent breakouts

Since acne is caused by gunked-up pores and dirt, oil and grime deep within the skin's surface, it's reasonable to think that a sauna can help fight breakouts. ""Because it does rid us of toxins and open pores by producing salty sweat, it can prevent those clogged pores that cause blackheads and whiteheads,"" says Luren. Saunas can also slow sebum production in the skin, i.e. oil, and make us less prone to acne in the first place. In the same vein, saunas can also be helpful in preventing ingrown hairs.

The concept of 'sauna bathing' goes back thousands of years, originating in Finland as pits dug into the ground heated with hot stones.

What are the benefits of a sauna for your skin?

Saunas can boost collagen production, helping you age in reverse

With temps upwards of 158-212 degrees F, saunas induce vasodilation, widening blood vessels. This causes increased blood flow throughout the body, including to the skin. Improved circulation can promote cell turnover and deliver more oxygen and nutrients to the skin cells, including those responsible for collagen production, the protein that provides structure to the skin, helping it maintain elasticity and firmness, attests Erika Luren, MA, MS, NP, founder of Parasol Aesthetics, Dermatology and Wellness.

Are saunas good for your skin? Yes! They can detoxify pores

Because skin is constantly exposed to the outside world, it's vulnerable to environmental stressors and toxins. Saunas promote sweating, which helps the body eliminate toxins and impurities. ""Studies show that sauna detoxification can rid skin of toxic elements like lead, copper, nickel, mercury and arsenic,"" says Kristina Krosky Helstowski, an aesthetician for Redwood Outdoors. ""Look at it as your garbage system dumping those toxins out and allowing the skin to expel those toxins that age us."" While the heat is shedding toxins from our skin, mechanical perspiration helps wash them away for good.

Saunas can exfoliate skin and help you shed dead skin cells

The high temperature in saunas causes the skin's surface to warm up, which can soften the outer layer of the skin, known as the stratum corneum. The combination of heat, steam and sweat collectively removes and softens dead skin cells, says Helstowski. Sweat also contains natural moisturizing factors, such as urea and amino acids, which can help to hydrate the skin and soften dead skin cells, facilitating their removal. If you want to go a step further, gently rub or massage your skin with your hands or a gentle exfoliating scrub while you're in the sauna. This physical exfoliation helps to loosen and remove dead skin cells, revealing smoother, more radiant skin underneath.

Are saunas good for your skin? Yes! They can help skincare absorb better

Because saunas warm the skin, opening up blood vessels, they also open our pores to help our skincare absorb better. ""When our pores are open, these products can penetrate deeper into the skin, maximizing their effectiveness,"" says Luren. It's important to note that skin can be a little more sensitive after a hot sauna session, so stick to gentle, hydrating products without any abrasive or irritating ingredients. For best results, Luren recommends following each session with a moisturizing cream boosted with ceramides.

Additionally, always cleanse your skin thoroughly before applying any skincare products to remove sweat, dirt and impurities that may have accumulated during your sauna session.

Saunas can prevent breakouts

Since acne is caused by gunked-up pores and dirt, oil and grime deep within the skin's surface, it's reasonable to think that a sauna can help fight breakouts. ""Because it does rid us of toxins and open pores by producing salty sweat, it can prevent those clogged pores that cause blackheads and whiteheads,"" says Luren. Saunas can also slow sebum production in the skin, i.e. oil, and make us less prone to acne in the first place. In the same vein, saunas can also be helpful in preventing ingrown hairs.

Are saunas good for your skin? Yes! They can fight stress, which helps skin

Chronic stress is well-documented for its negative effects on our skin and for exacerbating conditions like psoriasis, eczema and acne. ""Stress triggers the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, a trio of glands that play key roles in the body's response to stress. This can cause the production of local pro-inflammatory factors, such as cortisol and key hormones in the fight-or-flight stress response called catecholamines, which can direct immune cells from the bloodstream into the skin or stimulate pro-inflammatory skin cells,"" explains Harvard Health. Studies have also shown that psychological stress disrupts the top layer of our skin, which is essential for locking in moisture and keeping out germs, prolonging its ability to repair itself.

Saunas beat stress by providing a warm and comforting environment that helps to relax muscles and alleviate tension. The heat stimulates the release of endorphins, the body's natural feel-good chemicals. This can create euphoria and promote relaxation, reducing stress levels.

Many also enjoy using saunas as a social activity, whether with friends, family, fellow spa-goers or gym members. Social interaction like this can provide emotional support and a sense of connection, which can also be beneficial for stress relief.

What do I need to know before going into the sauna?

Certain medical conditions might make saunas unsafe for you, so always consult your doctor if you're unsure. That also goes for if you have eczema and psoriasis flare-ups. While saunas can be helpful for these conditions, Dr. Undavia says too much exposure to the sauna's dry air can unintentionally make dry, scaly patches worse.

The amount of time you spend in a sauna should also be monitored. ""10-20 minutes is optimal, and the frequency can be a few times a month to a few times a week depending on tolerance and benefits to the individual,"" advises Luren.

Finally, all that sweating can lead to dehydration, so drinking plenty of water before and after is important. You may also need to supplement with electrolytes since dehydration can sometimes deplete the body's electrolyte supply.

The concept of 'sauna bathing' goes back thousands of years, originating in Finland as pits dug into the ground heated with hot stones. Nowadays, you can enjoy traditional Finnish sauna bathing in a hot cedar box pumped with dry air powered by electricity, wood-fired or infrared light. Water can be poured over hot rocks to make steam and increase humidity.

""Regular sauna use can help improve skin tone and reduce fine wrinkles by boosting circulation to the skin while the sweating a sauna induces can detoxify the skin and make it easier to clean out pores,"" says Samir Undavia, MD, a dual-board certified plastic surgeon in New Jersey.

What are the benefits of a sauna for your skin?

Saunas can boost collagen production, helping you age in reverse

With temps upwards of 158-212 degrees F, saunas induce vasodilation, widening blood vessels. This causes increased blood flow throughout the body, including to the skin. Improved circulation can promote cell turnover and deliver more oxygen and nutrients to the skin cells, including those responsible for collagen production, the protein that provides structure to the skin, helping it maintain elasticity and firmness, attests Erika Luren, MA, MS, NP, founder of Parasol Aesthetics, Dermatology and Wellness.

Are saunas good for your skin? Yes! They can detoxify pores

Because skin is constantly exposed to the outside world, it's vulnerable to environmental stressors and toxins. Saunas promote sweating, which helps the body eliminate toxins and impurities. ""Studies show that sauna detoxification can rid skin of toxic elements like lead, copper, nickel, mercury and arsenic,"" says Kristina Krosky Helstowski, an aesthetician for Redwood Outdoors. ""Look at it as your garbage system dumping those toxins out and allowing the skin to expel those toxins that age us."" While the heat is shedding toxins from our skin, mechanical perspiration helps wash them away for good.

Saunas can exfoliate skin and help you shed dead skin cells

The high temperature in saunas causes the skin's surface to warm up, which can soften the outer layer of the skin, known as the stratum corneum. The combination of heat, steam and sweat collectively removes and softens dead skin cells, says Helstowski. Sweat also contains natural moisturizing factors, such as urea and amino acids, which can help to hydrate the skin and soften dead skin cells, facilitating their removal. If you want to go a step further, gently rub or massage your skin with your hands or a gentle exfoliating scrub while you're in the sauna. This physical exfoliation helps to loosen and remove dead skin cells, revealing smoother, more radiant skin underneath.

Are saunas good for your skin? Yes! They can help skincare absorb better

Because saunas warm the skin, opening up blood vessels, they also open our pores to help our skincare absorb better. ""When our pores are open, these products can penetrate deeper into the skin, maximizing their effectiveness,"" says Luren. It's important to note that skin can be a little more sensitive after a hot sauna session, so stick to gentle, hydrating products without any abrasive or irritating ingredients. For best results, Luren recommends following each session with a moisturizing cream boosted with ceramides.

Additionally, always cleanse your skin thoroughly before applying any skincare products to remove sweat, dirt and impurities that may have accumulated during your sauna session.

Saunas can prevent breakouts

Since acne is caused by gunked-up pores and dirt, oil and grime deep within the skin's surface, it's reasonable to think that a sauna can help fight breakouts. ""Because it does rid us of toxins and open pores by producing salty sweat, it can prevent those clogged pores that cause blackheads and whiteheads,"" says Luren. Saunas can also slow sebum production in the skin, i.e. oil, and make us less prone to acne in the first place. In the same vein, saunas can also be helpful in preventing ingrown hairs.

Are saunas good for your skin? Yes! They can fight stress, which helps skin

Chronic stress is well-documented for its negative effects on our skin and for exacerbating conditions like psoriasis, eczema and acne. ""Stress triggers the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, a trio of glands that play key roles in the body's response to stress. This can cause the production of local pro-inflammatory factors, such as cortisol and key hormones in the fight-or-flight stress response called catecholamines, which can direct immune cells from the bloodstream into the skin or stimulate pro-inflammatory skin cells,"" explains Harvard Health. Studies have also shown that psychological stress disrupts the top layer of our skin, which is essential for locking in moisture and keeping out germs, prolonging its ability to repair itself.

Saunas beat stress by providing a warm and comforting environment that helps to relax muscles and alleviate tension. The heat stimulates the release of endorphins, the body's natural feel-good chemicals. This can create euphoria and promote relaxation, reducing stress levels.

Many also enjoy using saunas as a social activity, whether with friends, family, fellow spa-goers or gym members. Social interaction like this can provide emotional support and a sense of connection, which can also be beneficial for stress relief.

What do I need to know before going into the sauna?

Certain medical conditions might make saunas unsafe for you, so always consult your doctor if you're unsure. That also goes for if you have eczema and psoriasis flare-ups. While saunas can be helpful for these conditions, Dr. Undavia says too much exposure to the sauna's dry air can unintentionally make dry, scaly patches worse.

The amount of time you spend in a sauna should also be monitored. ""10-20 minutes is optimal, and the frequency can be a few times a month to a few times a week depending on tolerance and benefits to the individual,"" advises Luren.

Finally, all that sweating can lead to dehydration, so drinking plenty of water before and after is important. You may also need to supplement with electrolytes since dehydration can sometimes deplete the body's electrolyte supply.

Under its latest business model, Norway's Norsk Kjernekraft is looking to construct small modular reactors (SMRs) ""off-grid"" to support industry that needs reliable power, such as data centres, and access to heat, such as hydrogen production. ""In this way industry is ensured reliable electricity and Norsk Kjernekraft is ensured good project economics while renewable power can be freed up for other purposes. A win-win for all parties.""

Norsk Kjernekraft says the energy debate in Norway ""is far too focused on what is needed to reach the zero-emissions targets, and there are many [different] opinions about precisely this. The focus should be on how much power Norway can produce in a sustainable manner. Using renewables means power production is limited by how much land is available and how stable electricity can be delivered given weather-dependent sources.

""Sweden and Finland have a clear advantage in that they have decided to develop more nuclear power. Because nuclear power requires very little land, they can increase their power production and thus ensure continuous economic growth. They therefore gain a competitive advantage."" Compared with SMRs, wind turbines require 1,240 times more area and deliver 37% less electricity. In addition, the introduction of artificial intelligence makes current energy demand forecasts invalid ""because the need for data processing and data storage, unlike everything else, is unlimited"".

Norsk Kjernekraft proposes a new business model for nuclear power in Norway: Small modular reactors can be built where the power is needed. When hydropower was developed, industry had to be established near those facilities. However, power production can now be located near industry. ""Because nuclear power, like hydropower, lasts for 100 years (with two upgrades after 60 and 80 years respectively), it can do what hydropower did for Norway. After the power plants have been paid off, they can supply cheap electricity for a further 70-80 years. In addition to electricity, nuclear power produces a lot of high-temperature steam that can be used for heat-intensive industries.

Norsk Kjernekraft wants to build SMRs in connection with industrial areas where both electricity and heat can be used. SMRs can also be used as a redundant power supply - a far cheaper option than batteries. ""Norsk Kjernekraft will build SMRs ""off-grid"" in connection with industry that needs reliable electricity and access to heat. ""Norsk Kjernekraft can build 3-4 SMRs of 300 MWe to support a data centre. It will deliver 900-1200 MW of electricity (7.5-10 TWh a year) on an area equivalent to a couple or three football stadiums. It is enough to operate the data centre and, for example, a green electrolysis factory for hydrogen (where the heat can be utilised).""

In April, Norsk Kjernekraft launched an impact assessment for a site in the municipality of Oygarden in Vestland County as the possible location for a NPP comprising up to five SMRs. In 2023, the company signed agreements of intent to explore the feasibility of nuclear power with a number of municipalities. In June, it signed a letter of intent with TVO Nuclear Services (part of Finnish utility Teollisuuden Voima Oyj) to jointly investigate the deployment of SMRs in Norway. This related to the possible development of nuclear power in the Norwegian municipalities of Aure, Heim, Narvik and Vardø.

In November 2023, it submitted a proposal to the Ministry of Oil & Energy to assess the construction of a SMR power plant in the municipalities of Aure and Heim and is preparing a similar report for Vardø municipality. Also in November, Norsk Kjernekraft, Østfold Energi and the municipality of Halden founded a new company, Halden Kjernekraft AS, to investigate the construction of a NPP based on SMRs at Halden, where a research reactor once operated.",neimagazine.com,news,Nuclear Engineering International,,0.3647058823529412,454000708,29,https://www.neimagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2024/05/Data_Centre_SMR.jpg,

Outgoing head of state Gitanas Nauseda came very close to being re-elected in the 1st round of the presidential election in Lithuania on 12 May. He won 44.1% of the vote, well ahead of his main rival, Prime Minister Ingrida Simonyte (Homeland Union-Christian Democrats, TS-LKD), who won 19.8%.

Lithuania's two leaders will therefore meet again in the 2nd round on 26 May, for which the outgoing President of the Republic is the clear favourite.

The two candidates had already secured the lead in the 1st round of the previous presidential election, and faced each other in the second round on 26 May 2019.

As opinion polls had predicted, Ignas Vegele, known for his opposition to the government's policies during the Covid-19 pandemic, came third with 12.55% of the vote. He said that he had probably lost a third of the votes he could have won because of the presence of other candidates who shared his wish to change the political system, in particular Remigijus Zemaitaitis (Aube de Nenumas, NA), who came 4th with 9.25%.

Turnout was high: 58.80% of Lithuanians went to the polls, +1.43 points compared to the 1st round of the previous presidential election five years ago. This was the highest turnout since the presidential elections of 21 December 1997 and 4 January 1998.

Elected five years ago on the theme of prosperity, Gitanas Nauseda said he wanted to continue reducing inequalities in the country. ""My main objective was to reach the second round and I think I have,"" said Ingrida Simonyte when the results were announced.

""We are both serving public servants - I am the President of the Republic, she is the Prime Minister. Voters can assess my five years of work and her four years of work and draw their own conclusions,"" said the outgoing head of state. ""Gitanas Nauseda is seen as the safest choice for voters of almost all ideological persuasions,"" said Tomas Janeliunas, Professor of International Relations at Vilnius University.

Gitanas Nauseda represents continuity and therefore stability and security, two essential points in the eyes of Lithuanians against the backdrop of the war in Ukraine. Lithuania shares a border of just over 200 kilometres with the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad.

""The core mission of the President of the Republic is to defend Lithuania's geopolitical and security interests. Gitanas Nauseda's positions are close to those of the majority of Lithuanians. Moreover, there are no major differences between the positions of the main candidates on the European Union, Russia and NATO,"" points out Linas Kojala, Director of the Centre for Eastern European Studies. ""Lithuania's understanding of the Russian threat is unanimous and indisputable, and the main candidates agree on this point,"" added Linas Kojala.

Gitanas Nauseda and Ingrida Simonyte agree on the threat posed to Lithuania by Vladimir Putin's Russia. The country sees itself as the Russian army's next target should Moscow emerge victorious from the war in Ukraine.

Gitanas Nauseda has promised to continue putting pressure on Lithuania's Western allies to step up their military support for Ukraine. ""Ukrainian President Volodimir Zelensky has already said it all. The Ukrainians don't need our declarations of goodwill, which are useless in combat; they need air defences. As long as they don't have them, Ukraine will remain vulnerable"" declared the outgoing Lithuanian President.

Lithuania is one of Ukraine's biggest aid donors. Defence spending accounts for 2.75% of Vilnius's GDP. Ingrida Simonyte's government wants to increase this to 3% of GDP. Lithuania will also host a German brigade of around 5,000 soldiers on its territory between now and 2027. The three main candidates in the presidential election supported these projects.

Lithuania was also the first European country to completely do without Russian oil and gas. Vilnius imports electricity from Sweden, Poland and Finland, and is investing heavily in renewable energies.

However, Eduardas Vaitkus, a candidate calling for the lifting of sanctions against Russia, an end to military support for Ukraine and the normalisation of Vilnius's relations with Moscow and Minsk, received 7.33% of the vote. The candidate, running as an independent, claims that Vilnius' policy towards Russia and Ukraine is leading Lithuania into war.

Foreign policy and defence issues failed to provide a clear dividing line between the candidates, so it was personalities and socio-economic positions that steered Lithuanians' votes. ""Ingrida Simonyte is supported by voters from the Homeland Union-Christian Democrats and liberals, while Gitanas Nauseda is a left-wing candidate in terms of economic and social policy,"" said Ramunas Vilpisauskas, professor of political science at Vilnius University.

Finally, on 12 May, the second attempt to amend article 12 of the Constitution to legalise dual nationality failed. 1,396,828 voters, or almost 59% of the electorate, took part in the referendum on this subject. Of these, 1,014,304, or 73.90%, voted in favour of the change to allow dual nationality. However, it was essential that at least half of all eligible voters, i.e. 1,192,617 people, vote in favour of the amendment. This is the second failure after the referendum held on 12 May 2019, in which the turnout was too low to validate the vote (38.46%).

The question put to Lithuanians concerned a new wording for article 12 of chapter I of the Constitution, which sets out the conditions for acquiring Lithuanian nationality[1]. The proposed article read as follows ""Citizenship of the Republic of Lithuania shall be acquired by birth or on other bases established by law. The procedure for acquiring and losing citizenship shall be established by law"". Many political analysts have criticised the wording as unclear.

Around one million people have emigrated from Lithuania since the country regained independence on 11 March 1990. They have obtained the nationality of another country through naturalisation and have therefore had to give up their Lithuanian nationality, which they cannot pass on to their children. 1,200 Lithuanians lose their nationality every year when they acquire the nationality of another country.",robert-schuman.eu,news,Fondation Robert Schuman,,0.3254901960784313,453998374,1,https://server.www.robert-schuman.eu/storage/images/banque/largeur-975/2013-05-28-16-26-56.7014.jpg,

Second-life batteries are batteries that have reached the end of their ""automotive"" life but still have a residual capacity of about 70-80%. This means they can be used in stationary systems, in combination with renewable energy generation, such as wind and solar, and/or to supply services to the electricity network. Extending the life of batteries means reducing their carbon footprint and increasing the amount of renewable energy available on the grid. Second-life EV batteries can be used in various applications such as EV charging, grid connections, renewable energy storage, and power backup.

Some of the factors driving the growth of this market are efforts towards mitigating the environmental impact of battery disposal, the growing adoption of renewable energy sources, and the increasing demand for electric vehicles (EVs).

Cunning means the quality or skill of being clever at planning something to reach your goals, even by tricking others. Lately, it has emerged that Azerbaijan has also resorted to cunning strategies to punch above its weight.

Two recent events put Azerbaijan under the spotlight. Let's start with the most recent one.

Azeri President Ilham Aliyev met with Iran's President Ebrahim Raisi just minutes before the latter took off in a helicopter which crashed, killing all onboard. The occasion was the inauguration of a dam between the two countries, but the meeting was unusual because the relations between the two countries are complicated for several reasons.

Scholars put the population of Azerbaijanis in Iran at between 12 million and 23 million -- more than the population of Azerbaijan proper, which is 10 million. Tensions exist inside Iran because Iranian Azeris support Azerbaijan in the context of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, while Tehran officially sides with Armenia -- because Turkey is Iran's regional rival.

In particular, if the Nakhchivan corridor is built, it would connect mainland Azerbaijan with its exclave and also with its ally Turkey, giving Ankara a transport springboard to implement some of its ambitious pan-Turkic goals.

Another big reason is the special relationship between Azerbaijan and Israel, Tehran's arch-foe. Israel calls Azerbaijan a ""strategic partner"" as Israel's arms-for-energy trade with Azerbaijan has reportedly become a pillar of Israel's national security strategy.

More importantly, Azerbaijan provides logistics to Israel to spy on Iran.

As the Israeli daily Haaretz wrote on 11 April, ""the Israel-Azerbaijan relationship relies on an unholy trinity of oil, arms, and intelligence"".

Israel buys oil from Azerbaijan (about half of Israel's crude oil originates there) and sells it advanced military equipment. In return, Azerbaijan reportedly gives it access to its land and sea border with Israel's number one rival: Iran.""

Some commentators have hinted that Israeli intelligence officers were discretely present at the site during Raisi's visit. Others have suggested that possible Israeli foul play in the helicopter crash should not be dismissed.

Israel has a tradition of never claiming authorship of even its most daring and successful covert operations.

Is the death of Raisi the result of such an op? It's probably better not to know the answer - because a straightforward response could trigger a major war.

Another recent cunning play by Azerbaijan unfolded in a very remote location and involved an EU member - and not just any EU member.

France has accused Azerbaijan of meddling in its Pacific territory of New Caledonia by supporting independence movements there and spreading disinformation.

France's Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin has stated that Azerbaijan, along with China and Russia, is interfering in New Caledonia's internal matters. ""This isn't a fantasy. It's a reality,"" Darmanin told the France 2 TV channel, emphasizing the seriousness of the allegations.

The French government points to the sudden appearance of Azerbaijani flags at independence protests by the indigenous Kanak people and the backing of separatists by groups linked to Baku.

A French government source mentioned a ""pretty massive campaign"" on social media, with around 4,000 posts aimed at inciting violence and mistrust.

In 2023, Azerbaijan set up the so-called ""Baku Initiative group"", with the participation of representatives from various French territories seeking independence, aiming to support anti-colonial movements against France. It may be ignored abroad, but the Azeri press churns out statements from this ""organisation"".

Why has Azerbaijan suddenly become so fraternal with New Caledonia in its presumed anti-colonial fight?

The answer is simple.

France, the home of a large and influential Armenian diaspora, is siding with Armenia in the context of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Baku has officially accused Paris of ""stoking new wars"" by arming Armenia and has snubbed mediation with French participation.

Azerbaijan is a totalitarian state whose covert actions resemble the Kremlin playbook against French interests in Africa. New Caledonia is only an episode, we haven't seen the end of the story.

What has the EU done about Azerbaijan's provocative behaviour? The answer is nothing, absolutely nothing. The EU is eager to import more Azeri gas, and its leaders prefer to ignore it.

Let's not forget that Qatar, the other cunning state, tried to buy the services of several MEPs with wads of cash, but the EU took no action against Doha and sees it as a partner of utmost importance.

This also echoes Azerbaijan's past behaviour - the Azeri Laundromat - which saw billions laundered through Europe and into the pockets of politicians and institutions to curry favour.

This is the new Realpolitik with the cunning states - just don't say you have not been warned.

French President Emmanuel Macron should arrive in troubled New Caledonia on Tuesday night to set up ""a mission"", a government spokesperson said, as the situation in the French overseas territory in the South Pacific remains tense following a week of protests, with blockades in certain areas of the capital city Nouméa.

While operating a heat pump remains quite expensive in large parts of Europe, a report by the EU's official research body identifies three EU well suited to heat pumps, thanks to their competitively priced electricity when compared to gas.

Europe must leverage EU-level public spending to jump-start strategic cross-border business and ""take the edge off"" private investments that might otherwise be deemed too risky, said Eva Poptcheva, a member of the European Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.

A European travel tech industry group filed two separate complaints on Tuesday to French and Belgian data protection authorities over Ryanair's use of biometric data, according to a press release shared with Euractiv.

Two years after Russia invaded Ukraine, European arms and defence stockpiles are running low, and the bloc's industry is hesitating to invest in more production capabilities.

In Finland, security issues dominate debate three weeks before the European elections, where the centre-right government, allied with the far-right, has not ruled out cooperation with the ECR in the European Parliament.",euractiv.com,news,EurActiv.com,,0.01960784313725483,453997289,1,https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/The-Brief-web-version-8-1-800x450.png,

What gets far less play is the admittedly boring network of wires and substations -- high-voltage transmission lines and local distribution grids -- that allow all those electrons to flow where they're needed, when they're needed.

However, to meet our net zero goals, and take steps like transitioning to EVs and heat pumps, Canada needs to significantly amp up investment in both clean electricity, as well as that far-flung transmission and distribution network. The cost is a bit of a black box. ""We're going to need two or three times the amount of generation of electricity in order to fulfill our goals,"" says Guy Holburn, a professor of business and economics and founder of the Ivey Energy Policy and Management Centre at Western University. ""We've got some reasonable estimates there of how much that's going to cost. The transmission and distribution side is a little bit harder to accurately quantify the costs.""

Francis Bradley, president and CEO of Electricity Canada, says estimates for the price tag of electrification through to 2050 run from $400 billion to $1.7 trillion. An Ivey study reckons that 23,000 kilometres of new high-voltage transmission lines will be needed, including many that extend far into Canada's North -- a vast undertaking that involves negotiations with First Nations, complex environmental approvals and, increasingly, all the risks posed by raging wild fires. ""Recent work by the RBC Climate Institute essentially says we're probably investing roughly a third of what we need to be investing in this space,"" Bradley says.

Here's one recent example of how renewables and new transmission should be expanding in tandem: a new $6 billion transmission corridor being built by Hydro-Québec. That project pairs with new investments in wind farms as well as additional hydro-electric dams, which can store all that additional renewable power -- that is, the electricity generated by the turbines running the pumps that fill up the reservoirs -- and then dispatch it when the wind isn't blowing. The wrinkle? This line runs into New York State, a long-time Hydro-Québec customer, instead of supplying renewables to other parts of Canada.

Yet, energy policy expert Pierre-Olivier Pineau, a professor of management at HEC Montréal, argues we need more, not less, of this kind of thing. According to a 2020 study he carried out for The Transition Accelerator, a think tank that teams with other research groups, a highly integrated approach to electricity markets in northeastern North America -- one that involves extensive trade in power within a mega-region encompassing New York, New England, the Atlantic provinces, Ontario and Quebec -- could yield billions in savings on new renewable generation, even if consumption grows rapidly.

""More transmission is needed between states and provinces, to allow more hourly and seasonal trade in both directions,"" the report finds. ""Global cost savings, in a 100% decarbonization context, are estimated around $10 billion per year under regional collaboration (and more transmission interconnections), compared to a system without new interconnections.""

The reason? Underutilized renewable power, from large wind and solar farms, or behind hydro-dams, can be used to help meet demand elsewhere within the region. But, as Pineau observes, this future turns on a critical precondition: that all these regions significantly expand the transmission ""interties"" across state, provincial and national borders in order to produce a single grid as opposed to the Balkanized ones that exist now. To get there, their electricity system operators would have to collaborate in ways that are, well, inconceivable at present.

At least in North America. Pineau points to Nord Pool, the 31-year-old renewable electricity wholesale market that began in Norway and is now the system operator for 20 countries, including Sweden, Finland, Denmark and the Baltic states. When there's surplus electricity in one jurisdiction, it can be sold to another where there's demand. The whole enterprise turns on the existence of a regional transmission grid in which the national systems are compatible with one another because policy makers saw it made sense.

Here's the kicker of Pineau's story: ""It's unlike Quebec and Ontario, which are entirely non-compatible in their planning,"" he says. ""There's no harmonization of regulation, rules, systems planning. There's no nothing there. They don't even talk to each other when they plan.""

Indeed, there's mounting evidence that unlike the Nord Pool countries, Canada's transmission and distribution infrastructure isn't growing nearly fast enough to handle the looming surge in electricity demand attributable to EVs, heat pumps, giant data centres, etc.

In fact, a 2022 survey of utility executives conducted by Ivey's Energy Policy centre found they were least optimistic about the investment climate for transmission and distribution lines. In particular, Holburn and Bradley both point to gnarly systemic barriers that stand in the way of raising the capital required to upgrade and expand Canada's local distribution networks in order to meet Canada's ambitious electrification targets.

Exhibit A: every region has a different system. In Quebec and B.C., provincially owned utilities operate the whole show. Alberta's network is market-based. Some regions use lots of natural gas for home heating and others do it all with electricity. In Ontario, electricity is shunted around by Hydro One, which owns the province's transmission lines, as well as dozens of municipally owned local utilities -- many of them sleepy monopolies regulated by the Ontario Energy Board, which limits how much they can invest in their grid infrastructure.

Those barriers may be preventing smaller-scale distributed renewable projects -- some rooftop solar here, some battery storage there -- from accessing local grids, where they would effectively reduce the need for new large-scale generation projects (such as nuclear plants), as well as the upgraded wires required to bring all that new power to the places where it's needed.

""You've got this new conversation that's starting to take place in Canada, but has taken place in a very serious way in other parts of the world, about how do you manage this increasingly distributed system,"" says Evan Pivnick, a program manager at Clean Energy Canada. He says some local utilities are running pilot projects to look for potential solutions. ""Is Canada as a whole moving anywhere nearly fast enough on that? Absolutely not. How far behind we're lagging on the distributed energy resource conversation -- that's a detriment, and holds back the affordability gains we could be making for Canadians.""

Others are more skeptical: ""We'll need decentralized generation that's feasible,"" says Pineau. However, he adds, ""it makes the grid more complex. Overall, we won't be able to avoid large wind farms and large solar farms because especially in cities, the electricity intensity is so big that you cannot have enough rooftop solar panels. You will still need these transmission lines to balance generation and demand and load in different locations.""

Ultimately, he argues, Canada won't reach its electrification targets without adopting a radically new approach to electricity planning -- one that involves the federal government and all the provinces and territories, sitting around the same table and working out an alternative to the status quo, which is Balkanized and counter-productive.

""The real bottleneck,"" Pineau says, ""is that we don't take energy management seriously, so we are not planning accordingly. The federation is itself a problem because the federal government doesn't have jurisdiction over energy and electricity. They are seen as intruders in electricity policies, when ideally they should be seen as a facilitator and a coordinator because we need provinces to coordinate themselves.""",theglobeandmail.com,news,The Globe and Mail,,0.223529411764706,453996785,56,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/resizer/v2/TOAJ3LVFGNFH5AO2UMFEPC3C2A.jpg?auth=2d797c32356e8974ef1a8a2983f5ed8f1931c4615b0c9a5a2b6937094f45db42&width=560&quality=80,

Here's today's news:

IRAN HELICOPTER CRASH

The helicopter crash that killed Iranian president Ebrahim Raisi and several others was caused by an unspecified ""technical failure,"" Iranian state media reported. Meanwhile, U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller dismissed a suggestion by a former Iranian foreign minister that U.S. sanctions on Iran's aviation industry were responsible for the crash. Donica Phifer reports for Axios; Michael Crowley reports for the New York Times.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu criticized International Criminal Court prosecutor Karim Khan after the ICC announced it was seeking arrest warrants for him and other Israeli and Hamas officials. ""Khan creates a twisted and false moral equivalence between the leaders of Israel and the henchmen of Hamas,"" Netanyahu said, accusing Khan of ""callously pouring gasoline on the fires of antisemitism that are raging across the world."" Lior Soroka and Sammy Westfall report for the Washington Post.

More than 900,000 people, approximately 40% of Gaza's population, have been displaced in the past two weeks, U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said yesterday. He said that of those displaced, 812,000 are from Rafah and over 100,000 are from northern Gaza. Richard Roth and Hamdi Alkhshali report for CNN; Chao Deng and Fatima Abdulkarim report for the Wall Street Journal.

Israeli forces raided a militant stronghold in the occupied West Bank today, killing at least seven Palestinians, according to local authorities. Majdi Mohammed reports for AP News.

Medical workers in Israel have reported concerns to the BBC over the treatment of sick and injured Palestinian detainees from Gaza. The whistleblowers said that Gazan detainees are routinely kept shackled to hospital beds, blindfolded, and forced to wear diapers. They also detailed how procedures in one military hospital were ""routinely"" carried out without painkillers, and said critically ill patients being held in makeshift military facilities were being denied proper treatment. The Israeli military denies the allegations. Lucy Williamson reports for BBC News.

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR -- U.S. RESPONSE

President Biden has criticized the ICC's decision to seek arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Israeli defense minister Yoav Gallant for alleged atrocity crimes in Gaza. In a statement, Biden called the move ""outrageous,"" adding, ""Let me be clear: whatever this prosecutor might imply, there is no equivalence - none - between Israel and Hamas. We will always stand with Israel against threats to its security."" Speaking yesterday at a Jewish American Heritage Month event at the White House, Biden also said, ""What's happening in Gaza is not genocide. We reject that."" Barak Ravid reports for Axios; Elena Schneider, Jennifer Haberkorn, and Eli Stokols report for POLITICO.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken also denounced the ICC arrest warrants, saying, ""This decision does nothing to help, and could jeopardize, ongoing efforts to reach a ceasefire agreement.""

National security adviser Jake Sullivan met with Israeli leaders yesterday. Yoav Gallant said he briefed Sullivan ""on developments in the war"" against Hamas and hostage release efforts, adding in a statement that humanitarian plans for Gaza were also presented to Sullivan ""that complement operational activities on the ground."" Rachel Pannett and Adela Suliman report for the Washington Post.

House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) said yesterday that the House may vote on sanctions against the ICC for seeking an arrest warrant against Netanyahu. Rep. Chip Roy (R-TX) has introduced a bill that would sanction ICC officials who investigate U.S. citizens or allies. It is supported by nearly two dozen other Republicans, including Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY), chair of the House Republican Conference. Andrew Solender reports for Axios.

Nearly 570 metric tons of aid have been delivered across the U.S.-built temporary pier off Gaza's coast, U.S. Central Command said in a statement. The aid will be distributed by humanitarian partners, CENTCOM said, adding, ""The United States, United Kingdom, UAE, European Union, and many other partners have donated this humanitarian assistance."" CNN reports.

Ukraine for the first time yesterday ordered nationwide rolling blackouts to conserve energy. The blackouts ran from 6pm to midnight. The move comes as Ukrainian officials say they are once again struggling to keep electricity flowing as Russian forces increasingly strike power plants. Maria Varenikova, Constant Méheut, and Nataliia Novosolova report for the New York Times.

GLOBAL DEVELOPMENTS

Nine members of the far-right ""United Patriots"" group in Germany who allegedly planned to bring a prince into power by violently overthrowing the government went on trial today. The accused are part of a group within the Reichsbürger movement, which believes the modern German state is illegitimate. Their trial is expected to be one of the most complex court cases since West Germany tried Auschwitz concentration camp commanders in the 1960s. Christopher F. Schuetze reports for the New York Times; Jessica Parker reports for BBC News.

China has sanctioned a former U.S. lawmaker and supporter of Taiwan. China has banned Mike Gallagher (R-WI) from entering the country and adopted sanctions against him including asset freezes in response to his words and actions that ""interfered in China's internal affairs,"" the foreign ministry said today, without specifying what Gallagher had said or done. Gallagher has been a fierce critic of China and a strong supporter of Taiwan. Reuters reports.

An Australian military plane has landed in New Caledonia to collect travelers stranded after civil unrest shut down the island's international airport. It is the first of two Australian aircrafts arriving to rescue 300 citizens who have registered for assistance. A New Zealand air force flight has also arrived. Simon Atkinson reports for BBC News; Keiran Smith reports for AP News.

South Africa's top court has ruled that former president Jacob Zuma is not eligible to run for parliament in next week's general election. The unanimous ruling capped months-long speculation on whether the former leader of the ruling African National Congress would be able to stand again. Zuma was forced to resign as president in 2018 after a series of corruption scandals. David McKenzie reports for CNN; Gerald Imray reports for AP News.

Haiti's main international airport reopened yesterday for the first time in nearly three months after gang violence forced authorities to close it in early March. Dánica Coto reports for AP News.

Finland's government today proposed emergency legislation to block asylum seekers entering across its border with Russia. Finland believes Russia is prompting the border crossings over political antagonism since the Ukraine war, an accusation the Kremlin denies. Anne Kauranen and Essi Lehto report for Reuters.

TRUMP-LEGAL MATTERS

A defense witness in former President Trump's criminal case whom the judge threatened to remove from the trial over his behavior will return to the stand today. Trump's lawyers are hoping Robert Costello's testimony will help undermine the credibility of star witness Michael Cohen. Costello angered Judge Juan Merchan yesterday by making comments under his breath, rolling his eyes, and calling the exercise ""ridiculous."" Merchan told Costello he was being ""contemptuous,"" adding, ""If you try to stare me down one more time, I will remove you from the stand."" Michael R.

In previous articles for Carbon Brief, we discussed this initial surge in 2021 and explored the impact of the energy crisis in 2022.

Yet, despite a drop in heat pump sales in key European regions, the trends in 2023 are more nuanced than an outright downturn.

Heat pumps generally increased their position relative to fossil heating systems and, in some of the continent's biggest heating markets, they saw continued growth.

If policymakers want to keep the transition to low-carbon heating on track, then thorough, consistent and coordinated policy efforts remain critical to scaling up heat pump markets.

In 2023, the heat pump market's expansion in Europe hit a plateau, as shifts in policy, changing energy prices, a stagnating economy and backlash against climate initiatives adversely affected sales in several nations.

Across the continent, there was a general downturn in sales by about 5% compared with a year earlier, as shown in the figure below.

The impact was more pronounced in the segment of air-source heat pumps for space heating, with a 12% decrease in air-to-water and a 10% fall in air-to-air sales.

Conversely, the segment for hot water heat pumps - those used for heating water for use in the home - saw significant growth, surging by nearly 20%.

However, while still high in historical terms, these sales are far from what is required to meet climate goals.

The EU will need around 60m heat pumps by 2030 to get on track for net-zero by 2050, according to modelling from the European Commission.

The aggregated statistics presented above show that, as of the end of 2023, there were roughly 23m heat pumps across the 21 EU nations included in the data. (The figures also include, under ""Rest of Europe"", three non-EU countries, the UK, Norway and Switzerland, while excluding smaller EU markets.)

This means that an average of around six million installations would be needed per year out to 2030, in order to hit the 60m milestone, whereas the current pace of growth is closer to 2.5m per year.

Trends in 2023 went in the opposite direction to what would be required. Among the countries accounting for the largest decline in sales were Italy, Finland and Poland, as shown in the figure below.

According to market statistics from the European Heat Pump Association (EHPA), Italian sales fell to around 345,000 units in 2023, compared to 514,000 the previous year, a decrease of 33%.

In Finland, some 114,000 heat pumps were sold compared to nearly 200,000 in 2022. And in Poland, the market fell to 129,000 units after reaching 208,000 in 2022.

While the European market contracted overall, several individual countries saw strong market growth. In Germany, sales increased by 60% year-on-year from 276,000 in 2022 to 439,000 in 2023.

In the Netherlands, 154,000 heat pumps were sold, a 53% increase on 2022 levels of roughly 100,000. Belgium experienced Europe's largest market increase at 72%, breaking through 100,000 sales in one year for the first time.

In the UK, trade group the Heat Pump Association reported annual growth of 4% to reach more than 60,000 units sold. This data includes air-to-water and ground-source heat pumps, but does not account for air-to-air and is, therefore, incomplete.

The decrease in the European heat pump sales in 2023 is moving in the opposite direction to what would be required to meet Europe's decarbonisation goals. Nevertheless, the overall picture is more nuanced than this contrast suggests.

For example, in certain countries where homes are predominantly heated by fossil fuels, heat pumps have continued to gain market share.

France is the leader in this regard. The market share of heat pumps has been steadily growing over the past decade, with more heat pumps sold than gas and oil boilers for the first time in 2022.

This French trend continued in 2023 - as shown in the top left corner of the figure below. Fossil fuel boiler sales fell sharply by 23%, allowing heat pumps to reach 61% of the heating market despite also seeing a small fall in sales.

Germany (top right) has seen the heat pump market share steadily increasing year-on-year from around 10% in 2014 to 33% in 2023. Despite a booming fossil heating market, enough heat pumps were sold in 2023 that their market share continued to grow.

In Poland (centre left), although the market share of heat pumps plateaued in 2023, it has risen significantly to 40%, from just 10% in 2018. The Netherlands (bottom left) has also seen a rapid shift, with a heat pump market share of 18% in 2023, compared to just 1% in 2014.

Italy's heat pump market share (centre right), which is more stable, contracted in 2023 after two years of growth. In the UK (bottom right), heat pumps have roughly tripled their market share in five years, but from a very low base. Excluding air-to-air heat pump sales, only around 60,000 units were sold in 2023, with a current market share of roughly 3%.

Considering all six countries together - the largest markets for heating installations, all of which still have gas boilers as their predominant heating technology - the market share of heat pumps has tripled from around 8% in 2013 to 24% in 2023.

European countries are facing diverse challenges to growing heat pump sales. The plateauing of heat pump sales in France, Europe's largest market, is a key example of this.

On the one hand, the French government cut funding to one of the main heat pump support programmes by €1.4bn while announcing an increase in electricity tariffs. On the other, the regulator also announced a hike in gas tariffs, linking it directly to a decrease in gas consumption, among other factors, including the removal of a price cap.

This indicates an escalating financial vulnerability for customers remaining on the gas network in France. The heating industry expects a further contraction of the boiler market in 2024, although not at the pace seen in 2022-2023.

Elsewhere, the 2022-2023 heat pump market surge in Germany is not expected to continue, RAP analysis suggests. Already in the latter half of 2023, installations had slowed compared to the previous year, as had applications for the country's subsidy programme.

This is largely linked to Germany watering down its Building Energy Act. It remains to be seen to what extent mandatory municipal heat planning, part of the EU's revised Energy Efficiency Directive, will drive an uptake of heat pumps in the coming years.

Poland was Europe's fastest-growing market for heat pumps in 2022, with a 120% increase in sales in a single year. The 46% contraction of heat pump sales in 2023 was largely driven by a 40% drop in the single-family home boiler market, with total sales of fossil fuel heating systems falling in turn. As a result, heat pumps maintained their market share in 2023.

However, the unfavourable price ratio in Poland, typically more than three times as expensive for electricity as for gas, remains a key challenge. The recently elected government is considering policy reform options to address this, however.

Italy's steep market decline, especially for air-to-water heat pumps, which fell by more than 50%, moves the country in the wrong direction for decarbonising its heating sector. The country's 2023 heat pump sales were even lower than in 2021.

Key reasons for this include changes to the Superbonus energy efficiency support program, which lowered its reimbursement rate from 110% to 90% and a tightening of eligibility for the scheme.

The heat pump market in the Netherlands was one of Europe's fastest growing in 2023.

While there was a decline in sales in the country during the last quarter of 2023, due to supply chain constraints, the long-term outlook is for further growth. The market is expected to remain at similar levels throughout 2024.

However, regulation expected to come into effect in 2026 that would have phased out installations of stand-alone fossil fuel heating systems is now expected to be scrapped. The new Dutch right-wing coalition government announced a u-turn on the policy along with a raft of other climate measures in May.

In the UK, the heat pump market expanded slightly in 2023 compared to 2022. With around 60,000 units installed, however, it is well off the government's target of 600,000 installations per year by 2028.

In October, heat pump grants under the boiler upgrade scheme were increased from £5,000 to £7,500.

The government also recently confirmed that, from 2025, new homes will no longer be allowed to install fossil fuel heating systems or so-called ""hydrogen-ready"" boilers. This will result in a substantial market boost of more than 150,000 additional units per year, RAP analysis suggests, assuming most new homes will include heat pumps.

However, there is continued uncertainty around the clean heat market mechanism, the main instrument expected to drive heat pump installations in existing buildings.

A one-year postponement of the scheme - which will set a rising standard for heat pumps as a proportion of fossil fuel boiler sales - was recently announced following pressure from the gas boiler industry.

At EU level, previously strong indications of support have begun fading. The European Commission has delayed its heat pump action plan, which would have continued to lay the groundwork for the rapid expansion of the technology across the EU.

More than 60 chief executive officers across the heat pump industry criticised the decision, warning that it risked billions of euros in investments.

At the same time, the European Parliament and the European Council recently passed the revised Energy Performance in Buildings Directive, which will prohibit subsidies for standalone fossil fuel boilers after 2025 and aims for a full phaseout of fossil fuel boilers by 2040.

Heat pumps are the ""central technology"" for low-carbon heat and rapid growth in their market share is crucial for meeting national and international climate goals.

After expanding rapidly in 2021 and 2022, the plateau in the European heat pump market in 2023 highlights the impact of inconsistent policies in denting their long-term growth.

The variance in market performance across countries - stemming from a mix of policy shifts, funding cuts and regulatory changes - underscores the complexity of scaling heat pump technologies rapidly enough to meet Europe's decarbonisation goals.

Nonetheless, far more heat pumps are being installed than in previous years and heat pumps are continuing to gain market share in Europe's largest heating markets.

RAP analysis shows that consistent and forward-thinking policy packages are likely to be key to boosting this trend. Such interventions could lower the upfront cost of heat pumps and ensure their running cost competitiveness, as well as providing the industry with the market certainty necessary to spur investment, innovation and consumer confidence.",carbonbrief.org,news,Carbon Brief,,0.1215686274509804,453987882,9,https://www.carbonbrief.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2WR3BD8.jpg,eng-9588567

Mortgage holders and the public sector are adapting their spending to respond to higher interest rates, which has weakened demand but will lead to more balanced finances. However, as purchasing power improves and global demand picks up, the economy will start to grow again next year.

The Finnish economy was one of the poorest performers in Europe in 2023, as GDP contracted by 1% year-on-year. Finland is now suffering a lot more than other countries from the rise in interest rates because most households have mortgages with a variable rate. The era of extremely low interest rates led to an excessive construction boom in Finland, after which construction has since declined significantly and house prices have fallen in the new environment. This leads to a pertinent question: should Finns continue to tie their mortgage rates differently from borrowers in the large eurozone countries whose economies and inflation rates mostly determine the eurozone interest rate level?

Despite the contraction in global trade, Finland's goods exports continued to grow mildly last year. The strong performance of service exports, which has continued for many years, came to a halt last year when exports of ICT services, in particular, declined significantly.

However, the economy is expected to start growing again by the end of this year. Consumer confidence and real incomes are still weak, but the latter will gradually improve on the back of lower inflation, wage increases and falling interest rates. Moreover, a pick-up in global manufacturing has improved the outlook for the export sector, and the decline in construction is expected to finally end next year.

We forecast Finland's economic growth to be -1% this year. We expect the economy to begin growing again during the latter half of this year. We have downgraded GDP growth in 2025 to 1.5% as the Finnish government has announced major additional fiscal adjustment measures for next year, which will for their part slow down the recovery in consumer purchasing power. However, the adjustment measures are necessary for halting growth in government debt, which has continued for years.

The rise in consumer prices slowed down across the board. Consumer price inflation (CPI) was only 2.2% in March, compared to an average of 6.2% last year. The EU's harmonised index of consumer prices (HICP) fell by 0.5% in March. The HICP does not include the effect of loan interest.

Energy and food prices are already lower than last year, and the annual change in the prices of goods has fallen to near zero. Inflation is only kept up by an increase of about 3% in the prices of services year-on-year, which is due to the fact that last year's wage rises are now reflected in these prices. Interest rates will keep consumer price inflation in Finland high for the first half of this year, but in the latter half their impact on the consumer price index will most likely be negative.

We will see a slight jump in inflation in August-September, when the year-ago figures will no longer include a calculation error in electricity prices. Also, an increase in the general value added tax rate from 24% to 25.5% will raise most consumer prices. But on the whole, inflationary pressures are expected to be weak throughout the forecast period.",nordea.com,news,Nordea,,0.08235294117647052,453975227,17,https://www.nordea.com/sites/default/files/styles/olivero_hero/public/2024-04/helsinki-finland_1920x1080.png?itok=hH20HDjE,

As global renewable energy deployment accelerates, grid operators are grappling with challenges related to grid stability, such as diminishing inertia and system strength. Reactive Technologies addresses these challenges with its pioneering GridMetrix® technology, empowering system operators to monitor power system stability in real time. This capability enables operators to reduce renewable curtailment, prevent blackouts, and optimize spending on balancing services.

Growing Demand for Grid Technologies

The increasing integration of renewables into power systems worldwide is driving a surge in demand for Reactive's technology, including its Tradenergy® software, designed to help short-term power traders navigate the complexities of a renewables-dominated landscape. This most recent investment comes at a crucial juncture as Reactive Technologies strives to meet the escalating demand for its solutions.

M&G's investment is from Catalyst, a £5 billion purpose-led private assets strategy that invests in innovative companies tackling some of the world's biggest environmental and social challenges. The investment will further accelerate Reactive's mission to support key players in the global energy transition with real-time data that enables a net-zero future.

Proud of the support from M&G at this pivotal stage in the company's growth, Reactive Technologies' CEO Marc Borrett stated, ""This investment from M&G along with our existing investors, BGF and BEV , marks another significant milestone for Reactive Technologies. As we deliver more projects to support the global transition to Net Zero, this backing will empower us to deliver at scale, expand our commercial presence internationally, innovate further, and make a real contribution to a clean energy future.""

This funding round follows Reactive Technologies' previous successful funding rounds, including the 2021 investment led by BGF and BEV. The continued support from investors underscores confidence in Reactive's vision and commitment to supporting global decarbonization.

Enabling Net Zero

In the UK, Reactive's GridMetrix® service is estimated to be saving approximately 18 million tonnes of CO2 annually for the UK power system (or approximately 5.5% of total annual UK CO2 emissions). This figure is expected to rise significantly as greater measurement data enables National Grid ESO to safely operate with lower levels of stability, aligning with the pursuit of Net Zero. Globally, GridMetrix® has the potential to mitigate 1,450 million tons of CO2 annually.

The funding announcement comes on the heels of Reactive Technologies' successful entry into the US market, with a large-scale demonstration project in New York State in collaboration with multiple utilities. With additional projects on the horizon in the US, Asia, Europe, and the Middle East, Reactive is poised for substantial commercial growth and will actively increase its workforce to support these initiatives.

""Energy transition is a central theme to our strategy in Catalyst as we seek to invest in innovative solutions that drive environmental progress while delivering sustainable returns for investors,"" said Zachary Webb, Head of EMEA Investments in Catalyst, M&G Investments. ""We are proud to back Reactive Technologies, which is fast becoming a British success story. Our investment will support the company's international expansion, potentially transforming how grid systems operate worldwide to reduce unnecessary carbon emissions.""

""The positive experience of our collaboration with Reactive Technologies has been transformative, showcasing the power of direct measurement innovation in advancing the energy transition,"" said Julian Leslie, Head of Networks at National Grid ESO. ""Collaboration with other power grids is paramount if we are to achieve Net Zero globally. We take pride in pioneering this Net-Zero-enabling technology with Reactive, which now offers a replicable model that can materially contribute to clean energy systems worldwide.""

Dr. Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma of South Africa became the first woman Chairperson of the African Union Commission and Nigeria's Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala became the first female Director-General of WTO. 34% of the Speakers of Parliament in Southern and East African countries are women and 26% of national legislators are women. The 2023 Gender Parity Index rated Sub-Saharan Africa slightly below the global weighted average score; only better than Southern Asia and the Middle East and North Africa. ILO notes that women have a nearly 85% likelihood to be in vulnerable employment versus 70% likelihood for male. Adult female labor force participation is expected to slightly increase from almost 72% in 2014 to 72.4% in 2018, yet lower than their male counterparts, which is estimated at 87.7% and almost 89% respectively. Closing the wage and employment gender gap would mean an 121% income increase for women, valued at some $0.7 trillion. Although women represent 52% of the agricultural labor force, they have little or no land ownership and are further affected by increasing land-grabbing by foreign companies or countries. Low levels of education and qualification makes it very difficult for the region as a whole and for women specifically to escape the poverty vulnerability cycle.

Presently, the average fertility rate in the region is 5.1 and is not expected to drop below 3 by mid-century. Even though the global maternal mortality ratio has been declined greatly, with 55% of the about 800 maternal deaths per day occurring in sub-Saharan Africa. The region has the world's highest maternal mortality, with some countries' rates as high as 1,000 death per 100,000 live births. In Kenya, every two hours a woman dies in childbirth; that's 4,400 death per year, most of them preventable. About 20% of Kenyan women experienced online harassment. According to Save the Children, Niger is the worst country in which to be a mother. UNICEF reports that 1 in 11 children born in sub-Saharan Africa dies before the age of 5.

Violence against women is widespread and, in most cases unreported. In South Africa, there are an estimated 60,000 cases of sexual assault per year. Rape and sexual assaults are even more acute in the conflict-torn zones, mostly in the DRC, Sudan, and Nigeria (with Boko Haram) and the neighboring areas. Sexual violence is used as a weapon and continues with impunity. In some Muslim communities, mostly in Egypt and Uganda, female genital mutilation and cutting is still practiced, despite increased international opposition. Improved education system and investments for paid-job opportunities (mainly for the youth), increased social spending (in some countries, where only 4 to 6% of the GDP is allocated to social protection benefits); improved infrastructure systems (mainly water, sanitation, and electricity), and enforcement of gender-equity regulations are some basic changes needed to improve the status of women in Africa.

Middle East and North Africa: Women's rights in the MENA region remains critical and even worsening in some countries with the rise of religious extremism and expanded enforcement of the Sharia law. The region has the lowest gender parity of any region. ILO notes that the region's women are much more likely than men to be in vulnerable employment -- at a rate of 55% versus 32% in North Africa and 42% versus 27% in the Middle East. Only the United Arab Emirates has achieved parity at the parliamentary level. Lebanon has the highest parity for ministerial positions with 32% women. Tunisia is the first Arab country to have a woman as head of government (2021), while Israel was the first in the region with a female head of state (1969).

Stoning to death is still used as a legal form of punishment for ""adultery"" in several Muslim countries, and the purdah(female seclusion) and namus (virtue) customs persist in many Arab regions. Sexual harassment, rape, and sexual violence by ISIS (Islamic State) and other extremist groups and security forces across the region have reached intolerable levels. As of 2017, more than 200 million girls and women have been victims of genital mutilation and cutting in Africa and the Middle East where the practice is concentrated. However, these are increasingly being challenged by empowered women, the outcry of the globalsociety, and women's-rights icons such as Malala Yousafzai. In the Arab MENA region, philosophical, ethnic, and ethical assumptions have to change in order to make possible the structural transformations needed to improve the status of women. The international community could use sanctions and conditioned-aid, conditioned-partnership in international organizations and business partnerships to help accelerate the long-due change. Israel (ranked 65) is the best performing country in the region and has closed over 70% of the gender gap.

Asia and Oceania: High incomes and education levels in countries like Japan challenge old family structures. However, women occupy only 14.7% of senior leadership positions in Japan. If women participated in the economy equally to men, Japan's GDP could grow by 16%. Together with the Republic of Korea (where women hold 10% of leadership positions), they launched the Gender Parity Task Force to improve women's career opportunities. According to the Global Gender Gap report, Japan fell from 104 place in 2014 to 116 place in 2022 and 125 place in 2023. Republic of Korea rose from 117 to 107 place in 2023 and China fell from 102 to 107 place in 2023. The region's best performer was New Zealand ranked 4 followed by the Philippines (16), Australia (26th), while the worst performers are Iran (143) and Pakistan (142).

The East Asia and Pacific region have nearly closed enrollment gaps between girls and boys in primary, secondary, and tertiary education, with girls even outperforming boys in some countries. However, in South Asia, only Sri Lanka, the Maldives, and Bangladesh have reached gender parity in primary schools, reports UNESCO. China has closed the gap for primary education, and reached 46.6% parity in the ninth year of schooling. Women in China were 45.17% of the labor force in 2022 (up from 43.5% in 2020). An estimated 19% of executives in China are women compared to the world average of 25%. Only a quarter of researchers in East Asia and the Pacific Rim are women.

Although all countries of South Asia have ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, UNDP reports that gender inequality causes a 60.1% loss in human development in the region, while ActionAid estimates that closing the wage and employment gaps would mean a 73% income gain valued at some $4.3 trillion. Central Asia has closed 69.1% of its gender gap in 2022. WHO notes that the region has about 30% of the world's maternal deaths, the second highest globally. Mainly due to the dual legal civil and religious systems in many parts of Asia early and forced marriage, violence, discrimination with respect to inheritance and land ownership, dowry issues, and honor killings continue to be prevalent and unpunished. In Afghanistan, the criminal law prevents prosecutions for domestic violence, forced and child marriage, and there were calls to overturn the Law on Elimination of Violence Against Women for being counter to Islam. This prejudice against women costs Afghanistan about $1 billion per year. The project ""Engaging Young Men through Social Media for the Prevention of Violence against Women"" aims to end gender-based violence in Asia and the Pacific by using social media.

Bias in favor of sons continues to be of concern in many countries of the region. The sex ratio at birth in India 952 girls per 1,000 boys, due to abortions of female fetuses. China's one-child policy worked to reduce fertility rate, but the Communist Party leadership ended the policy and allowed married couples to have three children as of May 2021. Howevery, if they have more children, women worry about employment discrimination.

About 22% Eastern and South-Eastern Asian legislators are women, Oceania has 20%, Central and Southern Asia has 19%, and Western Asia has 18%. After adopting the political quota system, the share of women in the parliaments of Central Asian countries increased from none to over 20%, although they still have to struggle with the reminiscent patriarchal structures.

Europe: Gender parity is highest of all regions at 76.3%, with 20 out of 36 countries with at least 75% parity. Scotland was the first country to legislate free period products for those in need. Gender parity is an important part of the structural changes in Europe. The highest gender gap by sector is in politics -- on average at 80%. Women represent 37.2% of the members of the European Parliament, while only 8 of the 27 commissioners are women. The Nordic countries -- Iceland, Finland, Norway, and Sweden -- are among the top five ranked by the 2022 Global Gender Gap report, and the countries have closed their gender gap by between 80% to 86%. As of May 2016, across the EU, women account for 29% of national parliaments. Although Poland has passed a law that requires at least 35% of local candidates in general elections to be female, the rate of women in the Parliament after the last election is 27.4% (as of 2016). The inter-institutional women's caucus launched in December 2014 is supposed to address the gap by promoting gender equality in the EU institutions. In May 2016, women's share of board members of the largest publicly listed companies in the EU-28 was 23.3% (up from 11.9% in 2010). A draft EU directive voted by the EU Parliament in 2013 requires publicly-listed companies to have 40% of each sex on their board by 2020, and the Aspire Fund supports female business initiatives. A campaign has begun in Germany to get women in 30% of the management positions in journalism by 2017. Albania has reached a record 70% of women in its cabinet. Fifty percent of the researchers and engineers in Denmark and Norway are female.

In the EU, women represent 60% of university graduates and in 2012, on average 83% of women reached upper secondary school, compared to 77.5% of men. However, women earn on average 16% less per hour than men for the same work, or 31% less per year, since 32.6% of women are part-time workers. This also impacts old age living standards, with 23% of women aged 65 and over being at risk of poverty, compared to 17% of men. Nevertheless, Europe has the best social policies, including child care, maternity leave, and health care. Violence against women remains a concern, with some 33% of women in the EU having experienced physical and/or sexual violence since the age of 15. Some 10% of women complaining of sexual harassment or stalking through new technologies. About 80% of Russian women aged 16 to 60 years are employed and comprise 48.6% of employment. Women account for 43.4% of Russians with a PhD. Turkey, that aspires to join the EU, has yet to address its gender gap. As of July 2017, female representation in its parliament was only 14.6%, ranking 133 by the Global Gender Gap Index, and it has a large gender income gap (estimated income for female earning $10,501 compared to $26,893 for males.)

Latin America: The region continues to progress since 2017, with a 1.7% increase in 2023, bridging 74.3% of its overall gender parity. Women's participation in Latin American parliaments has improved due to the introduction of quotas in many countries. Argentina, Brazil, and Chile elected women heads of state. As of June 2017, 11 countries in the region have achieved more than 30% of women in parliament. In Mexico, 38% of the Chamber of Deputies are women and the President's Reform Initiative recommends that 50% of all political parties' candidates for popular positions should be women. Women held 1.6% of CEO position and 14.5% of corporate broad of directors in 2023. The 2014 Global Gender Gap report indicates that 14 of the 26 countries in the region have closed over 70% of the gender gap, with Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Jamacia being the region's highest ranked, while Guatemala, Belize, and Paraguay are the region's lowest ranked.

More women than men attain tertiary education across the region, but IMF's 2017 paper remarks that female labor participation was just over 50%, compared to 80% of males. Gender pay gaps also remains; women are still earning 26% less than their male peers. Rural and indigenous women work unpaid at least 16 hours a day. Despite economic and political progress, women's well-being continues to be hindered by machismo political and social structures and women easily become victims of organized crime in various forms. At least 4,473 women were killed by their husbands or relatives in 2021 in the region, up from 1,678 in 2014. As a result of restrictive legislation, one in three maternal deaths is due to abortion, and the lifetime risk of maternal death is 0.4%.

North America: The region ranks second behind Europe overall having closed 75% of the gender gap, though it is 1.9% lower than the previous edition, with the US 2.1% and Canada 0.2% declines. Women's share of the total labor force in North America was 46.6% in 2023 (46.5 in the U.S and 47.4% in Canada). Women earn more than their partners in about 10% of dual-earning households in the U.S. and 33% in Canada. As many women have higher education level than men and their number in senior management positions is increasing. However, only 5.8% of women hold CEO positions at S&P companies in the U.S., and 69.9% of mothers with children under age of 18 were working; compared to 92.7% of fathers. Silicon Valley has the largest pay gap in the U.S. with an earnings difference of $40,584 between genders. Women earn 78% of what men earn for comparable work, and the wage gap is worse for women of color. The gap was largest for Hispanic and Latina women who were paid 54% of what white men earned. Based on the trends of the past half-century of progress, the Institute for Women's Policy Research estimates that the U.S. national wage gap will close around year 2058. States vary significantly, with projections to 2038 in Florida and 2159 in Wyoming. The Paycheck Fairness Act (PFA) passed the House of Representatives on April 15, 2021 by a vote of 217-210, but failed in the Senate in June 2021 in a procedural vote.

Women's representation in the U.S. Senate in 2024 is 25% (25 Senators) and 29% (126 of 435) Congressional Representatives. Canada has 30% women in the House of Commons - the highest percent in its history, but only 1 of 13 provincial premiers are women. Both the U.S. and Canadian governments made critical cuts in domestic and international family planning programs for women. Since the Supreme Court Overturned Roe v. Wade, as of May 2024, abortion is banned in 14 states, gestational limit between 6 and 12 weeks in 5 states, limit between 15 and 22 weeks in 6 states, and

abortion is legal beyond 22 weeks in 25 states and D.C. The U.S. is among the countries with the costliest childbirth, most expensive day care, and the shortest parental leave. Among 41 nations, the U.S. is the only country which doesn't mandate national regulations or government-provided paid parental leave. These problems are even more critical as the share of one-parent families in the U.S. has increased; children living with a single mother is the second most common family arrangement. More than half of single mothers are living in extreme poverty.

Canada provides maternity or parental benefits. According to the Employment Insurance Maternity and Parental Benefits policy (except for Quebec Provence), which has its own parental insurance plan), the EI benefits generally pay 55% of one's average insurable weekly earnings, up to a maximum amount. (As of January 2017) Employers must give parents a minimum number of weeks for maternity, parental, and adoption leave. But employers don't have to pay them during such times. More than 40% of new parents surveyed said they could not afford maternity leave, and 81% of those who took the leave and returned to work, would have stayed on leave longer if they could have afforded it. The share of employed mothers with children aged 6 and over increased from 46% in 1976 to almost 80% by 2012, while women with children earn, on average, 12% less than women without children. In the U.S., violence against women was reduced by 55% since the passage of the Violence Against Women Act in 1994.",millennium-project.org,news,millennium-project.org,,0.05098039215686279,453971978,1,,

The two companies have established a framework development agreement aimed at developing 600 MW of photovoltaic projects up to the ""ready to build"" phase.

This marks FRV's first venture into a Nordic country, aligning with Will & Must's goal to prepare 1,000 hectares of land for solar deployment by 2027. The 600 MW capacity represents several projects at various planning stages, expected to reach the ""ready to build"" phase between 2024 and 2026.

Nordic countries are increasingly embracing photovoltaics as a complement to their predominantly wind-driven energy systems. The region offers vast tracts of available land and unique solar irradiation conditions, including longer daylight hours in summer, higher solar irradiation intensity, and the reflective properties of snow, which enhance solar efficiency. Additionally, photovoltaic cells perform better in cold environments. Finland is especially attractive as a pioneer in clean energy, with most of its electricity generation already fossil-free.

FRV's commitment to global renewable energy transition has seen the company expand rapidly, constructing over 50 renewable energy plants across Spain, Australia, Mexico, Italy, the United Kingdom, Armenia, and Jordan. The company also has a pipeline of over 24 GW of new projects in Finland and other markets, including Italy, Spain, Greece, Poland, the UK, Chile, Brazil, Australia, and New Zealand.

""We are delighted to offer our international experience and expertise in a promising new market like Finland. This is one of the most promising markets for renewable energy and we are convinced that our offer will be in high demand,"" said Andrea Fontana, Managing Director of FRV Europe.

Matti Parpala, Mikke Vepsäläinen, and Anssi Voipio, the founding team of Will & Must, expressed their enthusiasm: ""We are excitedly looking forward to cutting Finland's emissions and rapidly boosting the overall green transition together with FRV, which brings to the emerging Finnish photovoltaic market an unparalleled amount of experience in large-scale projects. We also strive to develop the projects in close cooperation with different stakeholders. This way, we hope to demonstrate the benefits to local landowners and communities, which in turn should ensure social acceptance so that the projects can be efficiently constructed.""

This strategic collaboration underscores both companies' dedication to advancing sustainable energy solutions and highlights Finland's potential as a key player in the renewable energy sector",solarquarter.com,news,SolarQuarter,,0.4274509803921569,453963179,17,https://solarquarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/FRV-breaks-into-Nordics.jpeg,eng-9583163

From the mid-1960s through 2016, Colombia was torn by conflict between the government, leftist guerrilla movements and right-wing paramilitary groups. Now the government and rebels are working to carry out a sweeping accord that addresses many critical sectors, including environmental damages and restoration.

University of Notre Dame researchers Richard Marcantonio and Josefina Echavarria Alvarez study peace and conflict issues, including their effects on the environment. They currently are advising negotiations between the Colombian government and several rebel factions over wartime damage to soil, water and other natural resources. They explain that while Colombia's transition from war to peace has been difficult, the accord offers a model for addressing the ravages of war in places such as Gaza and Ukraine.

Is it common for peace settlements to address environmental harm?

Few agreements include environmental provisions, and even fewer see them carried out, even though research shows that many drivers of conflict can be directly or indirectly related to the environment.

We work with a research program at the University of Notre Dame called the Peace Accords Matrix, which monitors the implementation of comprehensive peace accords in 34 countries worldwide. Only 10 of the accords have natural resource management provisions agreements, and these typically have not triggered major steps to protect the environment.

How is the Colombia accord different?

Colombia's is seen as the most comprehensive peace accord that has been signed to date. It considers issues ranging from security to social justice and political participation, in great detail.

The accord acknowledges that a peaceful postwar society requires not only respect for human rights but also ""protection of the environment, respect for nature and its renewable and nonrenewable resources and biodiversity."" More than 20% of the commitments in the agreement have an environmental connection.

They fall into four main categories:

- Adapting and responding to climate change

- Preserving natural resources and habitats

- Protecting environmental health through measures such as access to clean water

- Process issues, such as ensuring that communities can participate in decisions about rural programs and resource management

There also are gaps. For example, many protected areas have been deforested for ranching and coca production in the postaccord period. And there are no provisions addressing toxic pollution, an issue other agreements also neglect.

Often there are power vacuums during transitions between war and peace, when government agencies are working to reestablish their operations. Natural resources and environmental health need protection during these phases.

In Sierra Leone, for example, resource extraction by foreign companies drastically ramped up immediately after the Lome Peace Agreement eventually ended that nation's civil war in 2002. Companies exploited a lack of governance and support in the rural areas and often mined metals illegally or hazardously without any regulatory oversight. Today these areas still struggle with mining impacts, including contaminated drinking water and fish, the primary protein source in the area.

What is the environmental toll of war in Ukraine?

The damage is vast: There's air, water and soil contamination, deforestation and enormous quantities of waste, including ruined buildings, burned-out cars and thousands of tons of destroyed military equipment. Russia's destruction of the Kakhovka Dam flooded villages, destroyed crops and wrecked irrigation systems.

The cost estimates are staggering. A joint commission of the World Bank, the government of Ukraine and other institutions currently estimate direct damages at roughly US$152 billion.

In addition, cleaning up sites, rebuilding infrastructure and other repairs could cost more than $486 billion over the next decade, as of late 2023. That figure rises every day that the war continues.

There's broad interest in a green and sustainable reconstruction that would include steps like using sustainable building materials and powering the electricity grid with renewable energy. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been adamant that Russia must pay for the damage it has caused. It's still unclear how this would work, although some U.S. and European lawmakers support seizing frozen Russian assets held in Western banks to help cover the cost.

There is a legal basis for holding Russia accountable. In 2022, the U.N. General Assembly adopted a set of principles for protecting the environment during armed conflicts. Among other existing statutes, they draw on a protocol to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 that prohibits using ""methods or means of warfare which are intended, or may be expected, to cause widespread, long-term and severe damage to the natural environment.""

There has been only modest discussion so far of how to integrate these principles into a formal peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia. But a working group that included Ukrainian and European Union officials and former leaders from Sweden, Finland, Ireland and Brazil has recommended a framework for addressing environmental damage and holding perpetrators accountable.

What environmental impacts are known or asserted in Gaza?

Environmental damage in Gaza also is devastating. The U.N. estimated in early 2024 that over 100,000 cubic meters (26 million gallons) of untreated sewage and wastewater were flowing daily onto land or into the Mediterranean Sea.

Gaza's drinking water system was insufficient before the war and has been further weakened by military strikes. On average, Gazans now have access to about 3 liters of water per person per day - less than 1 gallon.

Thousands of buildings have been destroyed, spreading hazardous materials such as asbestos. Every bomb that's dropped disperses toxic materials that will persist in the soil unless it's remediated. Simultaneous environmental and infrastructure impacts, such as water and power shortages, are contributing to larger crises, such as the collapse of Gaza's health care system, that will have long-lasting human costs.

How can future peace accords address these impacts?

Integrating the environment into peace accords isn't easy. Resources such as energy, clean soil and water are vital for life, which is precisely why military forces may seek to control or destroy them. This is happening in both Ukraineand Gaza.

Peace negotiators tend to focus on social, political and economic issues, rather than environmental reparations. But leaving environmental damage unresolved until after a peace accord is signed keeps people who have been displaced and marginalized by conflict in precarious positions.

It may even cause fighting to resume. According to the U.N. Environment Program, at least 40% of all wars within states in the past 60 years have had a link to natural resources. In those cases, fighting was twice as likely to resume within five years after conflict ended.

We see some lessons for future negotiations.

First, it's important for accords to recognize environmental harm as one of war's main consequences and to acknowledge that a healthy environment is essential for sustainable livelihoods and peace.

Second, connecting environmental provisions with other issues, such as rural reform and political participation, can create better, more sustainable and equal conditions for reestablishing democracy. The Colombia accords are an example.

Third, it is important to clearly define goals, such as what infrastructure and institutions need to be rebuilt, who is in charge of getting those tasks done, and the timetable for doing it. This can help ensure that environmental restoration doesn't become a secondary goal.

Fourth, the international community has an important role to play in monitoring and verifying environmental restoration and providing financial and technical support. Foreign donors have already pledged $66 billion for rebuilding Ukraine and have said that they will require grantees to follow strict environmental standards in order to receive financing.

Reconstructing nations and simultaneously regenerating communities and ecosystems after wars is a daunting mission, but it's also an opportunity to build something better. We see Ukraine and Gaza as potential test cases for addressing war's toll on the environment and creating a more sustainable future.

The investment bank has told clients to buy UK-listed stocks, arguing that downward pressure on share prices from pension funds selling almost £2 trillion of assets has ended.

""The long-term structural overhang of UK pension fund selling is at an end; they simply have no more UK equities left to sell,"" the bank's research team said.

HSBC in fact expects retirement funds to start buying British stocks, amid political pressure to support the UK economy.

Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has repeatedly called for pension funds to buy British and introduced new rules forcing funds to publicly state how much money they put into London-listed stocks. Allocations to UK equities by pension funds have fallen from 53pc in 1997 to around 4pc today.

HSBC is one of the most closely followed equity strategists globally and a positive re-rating could prompt more money to flow into the London market.

The bank's rating upgrade, from neutral to overweight, means investors should consider putting a greater proportion of their money into the UK.

HSBC's analysts said a likely Labour victory in the upcoming election was unlikely to unsettle the stock market, removing a potential roadblock for investors considering backing Britain.

The optimistic outlook is a major boost for the UK stock market, which has been mired in gloom because of a lack of flotations and a string of companies quitting for New York and Frankfurt.

The UK market is cheaper than other global benchmarks, with the discount to the US stock market 23pc wider than normal.

Stocks are cheap in part because of downward pressure on prices from pension funds selling. British retirement funds have pulled an estimated £1.9 trillion from the market over the past three decades, according to HSBC.

However, the bank said holdings were now so small that further mass sales were unlikely.

HSBC upped its target for where the FTSE 100 will end the year from 8,100 to 8,750. The index closed at 8,424 on Monday night and has risen almost 9pc so far this year.

The bank last upgraded its view on UK stock from underweight to neutral in September 2023.

HSBC's recommendation is at odds with Coutts, the King's bank, which last month decided to downgrade its rating and said it would pull £1.9bn from the London stock market.

High interest rates needed 'some further time,' says Fed official

The US Federal Reserve should keep interest rates at their current elevated levels for longer than previously expected due to disappointing recent inflation data, a senior bank official has said.

The Fed has raised interest rates to a 23-year high and held them there as it looks to bring inflation down to its long-term target of 2pc.

But despite significant progress last year, the Fed's inflation fight has faced a setback this year, with the rate at which consumer prices are rising accelerating again in the first quarter.

Speaking at a conference in Florida, Fed vice chair for supervision Michael Barr said the bank had made ""tremendous progress"" in bringing inflation down from its 2022 peak, while unemployment - the other leg of its dual mandate - had remained low.

""We are not yet all the way to our target of 2pc,"" he said in prepared remarks, noting the ""disappointing"" recent inflation data. He added:

Semiconductor institute to be launched to support UK chip sector

An independent institute to oversee national strategy on expanding the UK's semiconductor industry is to be created, the Government has announced.

The UK Semiconductor Institute will bring together the Government, university researchers and the private sector to oversee growth in the computer chip sector, the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) said.

The increasing global reliance on technology has seen semiconductors become recognised as an area of global strategic significance, with the rise of artificial intelligence already sparking further demand for more powerful chips.

Currently, production in the sector is dominated by Taiwan, but last year the Government launched a £1bn strategy to boost UK innovation.

DSIT said the new institute would be tasked with ensuring chip researchers have the tools and infrastructure needed to carry out their work and create market-ready products.

It would also act as an entry point for tech businesses and international partners who wish to work with the UK market around the technology.

Gas prices have risen amid the potential for turmoil in the Middle East following a helicopter crash which killed Iran's president and foreign minister.

Europe's benchmark contract rose as much as 3.9pc in the wake of deaths of Ebrahim Raisi and Hossein Amir-Abdollahian.

Prices were already rising amid what Citi described as ""red hot demand"" from Asia amid record-setting heatwaves, driving up demand for energy to power air conditioning.

The UK equivalent gas contract has risen as much as 4.3pc.

GB News has accused Ofcom of trying to ""silence"" the channel by not allowing the ""public to question politicians directly"" after the regulator ruled that it broke due impartiality rules with the broadcast of an episode featuring Rishi Sunak.

People's Forum: The Prime Minister was a live hour-long programme on February 12 at 8pm and aired ahead of this year's expected general election.

In a statement, GB News said:

GB News also called itself the ""people's channel"" and the ""independently selected group of undecided voters"" questioned Mr Sunak ""robustly, intelligently, and freely"".

The channel also said that the Ofcom ruling was a ""watershed moment that should terrify anyone who believes, as we do, that the media's role is to give a voice to the people of the United Kingdom"".

GB News at risk of fine after breaking impartiality rules

GB News faces a sanction from the media regulator after it found that the broadcaster broke impartiality rules.

Ofcom said it is ""starting the process for consideration of a statutory sanction against GB News"" after finding that a ""People's Forum"" programme featuring Rishi Sunak represented ""a serious and repeated breach"".

Ofcom received 547 complaints about the live, hour-long programme broadcast in February, in which the Prime Minister took part in a question-and-answer session with a studio audience about the Government's policies and performance.

Keywords Studios shares surge as £2bn takeover offer deals fresh blow to City

Shares in video games services company Keywords Studios rocketed in early trading after it said it is in advanced talks to be taken private in a £2bn deal that delivers another blow to the City.

The company - which has worked on Fortnite, Call of Duty and Baldur's Gate 3 - was up as much as 69.9pc to just below £2.50 after it confirmed the discussions about a possible £2.55p per share with European private equity group EQT.

Keywords Studios, established in 1998, floated in London in 2013.

Bosses said they were minded to accept EQT's possible offer, having previously rejected four prior proposals.

The company said the latest offer represents a ""significant increase from the initial proposal"".

It comes amid a flurry of foreign investor interest in UK companies amid suppressed market valuations in the City.

Last month, US private equity group Thoma Bravo agreed to buy UK cybersecurity company Darktrace for about £4.2bn.

Victorian Plumbing has bought its arch rival online bathroom retailer Victoria Plum in a deal worth £22.5m.

The takeover comes just over six months after Victoria Plum plunged into administration and was bought in a so-called pre-pack deal to AHK Designs.

Victorian Plumbing said a cost-cutting plan was already under way at Doncaster-based Victoria Plum, given its recent administration process.

It brings together the two long-standing rivals, which met in court over a trademark dispute eight years ago.

Mark Radcliffe, chief executive of Victorian Plumbing, said the deal was ""another exciting strategic milestone"" for the company.

""The acquisition aligns with our ambitions to accelerate our growth,"" he said.

""We are pleased to welcome the existing Victoria Plum team to our group and look forward to continuing to provide customers with a fantastic range of bathroom products and accessories.""

Victorian Plumbing is headquartered in Skelmersdale, Lancashire, and employs 600 staff across nine sites in Lancashire, Manchester and Birmingham.

The firm said it expects Victoria Plum to ""broadly"" break even in the second half of 2024.

Uber to offer drivers £5,000 grant to switch to electric cars

Uber is making £5,000 grants available to its drivers in London who switch to an electric vehicle (EV).

The ride-hailing app company announced the measure to help it meet its previous commitment that all Uber vehicles in the capital will be fully electric by the end of 2025.

Drivers can spend their grant cash as a lump sum on an EV purchase, or on weekly payments for rental or rent-to-buy agreements.

Uber has also secured discounts of £12,000 to £17,000 on selected EVs for its drivers.

Around a quarter of miles for Uber journeys in London are in electric cars. There are more than 100,000 Uber vehicles in the UK, with around half in London.

Clock ticking on BHP's mining mega-deal with Anglo-American

Mining behemoth BHP must overcome major hurdles to salvage its faltering pursuit of rival Anglo American, analysts have said, as a midweek deadline for its takeover bid approaches.

UK-listed Anglo American has already knocked back two attempts by the Australian giant, which has until 5pm on Wednesday to up its offer, walk away, or launch a hostile takeover at enormous risk.

Any deal between two of the world's largest resources companies would fundamentally reshape the sector, with far-reaching consequences for commodities markets and the global energy transition.

The latest bid sits at £34bn, which would rank as one of the largest mining deals ever seen.

MineLife analyst Gavin Wendt said Anglo American's disinterested board had kept the larger competitor at bay for now. He said:

The FTSE 100 has moved higher in early trading amid a boost from metal miners after gold and copper hit record highs overnight.

The blue-chip FTSE 100 was up 0.3pc, while the mid-cap FTSE 250 climbed 0.4pc.

Precious metal miners and industrial metal miners led gains, as gold prices surged and copper hit an all-time peak.

Safe-haven gold rose after a helicopter crash which killed Iran's president, while copper has been boosted by China rolling out property stimulus measures and upbeat industrial output data. There are also concerns about supply.

Traders are looking forward to a speech later by the Bank of England's Deputy Governor Ben Broadbent, which could offer clues that could signal the timing of the first interest rate cut.

In corporate news, shares of AstraZeneca lost 0.5pc as the pharma giant announced plans to build a $1.5bn (£1.2bn) manufacturing facility in Singapore.

Keywords Studios jumped 63.3pc as European private equity group EQT entered advanced talks to buy the Dublin-based video game services company for £2.2bn.

The price of oil has inched upwards after the crash which killed Iran's president.

Brent crude, the international benchmark, rose 0.4pc to a one-week high of $84.33 after the aircraft came down in a mountainous area in Iran's East Azerbaijan province.

The Middle East also faces potential turmoil from Saudi Arabia.

Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman postponed a planned four-day trip to Japan due to concerns over the king's health.

News of the cancellation came after the state-run Saudi Press Agency reported that Prince Mohammed's father, King Salman Bin Abdulaziz, is suffering from inflammation of the lung and will be receiving antibiotics at Al Salam Palace in Jeddah.

MBS, who handles most day-to-day affairs in the kingdom, is next in line to the throne.

Value of Meadowhall Shopping Centre halved after British Land deal

The value of one of Britain's most prominent shopping centres has been cut in half in less than a decade, as British Land sold its stake in the site for £360m deal.

The commercial property developer has sold its share in the Meadowhall Shopping Centre in Sheffield to Norway's sovereign wealth fund.

Together with the £7m sale of some land earlier this year, the deal values the 200-acre Meadowhall estate, which sits next to the M1 motorway, at £734m in total.

Norway's sovereign wealth fund originally invested in the shopping centre in 2012, buying a 50pc stake in a deal which valued the site at £1.5bn.

British Land said the sale was in line with its aim to shift away from covered shopping centres in favour of investing in retail parks.

Simon Carter, chief executive of British Land, said:

AstraZeneca has announced plans to build a $1.5bn (£1.2bn) factory in Singapore as the drugs giant expands its manufacturing footprint around the world.

The plant will be Astra's first antibody drug-conjugate facility to produce the medicines from start to finish.

It is part of a global shift by drugmakers to ensure they have local manufacturing capacity for their products.

Ryanair 'optimistic' air fares will not face sharp increase this summer

Ryanair said it was ""cautiously optimistic"" that air fares will not rise sharply this summer season despite it receiving fewer new planes than expected.

The Irish carrier revealed profits grew by 34pc to a record €1.9bn (£1.6bn) last year.

Ryanair said it would be 23 jets short of the number Boeing was due to deliver by the end of July and there remained a risk - although ""unlikely"" - that deliveries could slip further.

It also revealed that former home secretary Amber Rudd would join the company as a non-executive director.

Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary warned two weeks ago that summer airfares would likely be lower than the 5pc to 10pc rise it expected as recently as late April.

The airline said on Monday its weaker forecast was ""heavily dependent"" on last-minute summer bookings.

The low-cost carrier flew a record 184m passengers in the year to the end of March.

It also announced a €700m share buyback that it said it would formally launch later this week.

Copper hits record high amid fears of supply shortage

Gold was not the only metal hitting record highs overnight.

Copper jumped to a fresh all-time peak amid expectations that increased demand will lead to supply shortages.

The price of copper on the London Metal Exchange rose above $11,000 a ton for the first time.

Prices have gained more than a quarter since the start of this year.

Thanks for joining me. Gold jumped to fresh record highs after Iran's president was killed in a helicopter crash.

Bullion jumped as much as 1.1pc to hit $2,440.59 an ounce after Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi, Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian and all the other passengers onboard died when the aircraft came down in northwest Iran.

His death has added to tensions in the Middle East, which analysts said increases the appeal of the metal, which is considered a safe haven in times of turmoil.

However, in a sign that markets were less concerned about the threat of instability, the price of oil remained relatively steady at $84 a barrel.

Nicholas Frappell, global head of institutional markets at ABC Refinery in Sydney, said: ""Gold's rally is news-driven with uncertainty about what happened in Iran.

""There is bound to be an element of jumping to conclusions on the basis of very little information.""

The rise in gold also comes amid optimism that the US Federal Reserve will make two interest rate cuts this year after inflation figures last week were lower than expected.

That offered support for the precious metal, which is priced in the dollar.

The investment bank has told clients to buy UK-listed stocks, arguing that downward pressure on share prices from pension funds selling almost £2 trillion of assets has ended.

""The long-term structural overhang of UK pension fund selling is at an end; they simply have no more UK equities left to sell,"" the bank's research team said.

HSBC in fact expects retirement funds to start buying British stocks, amid political pressure to support the UK economy.

Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has repeatedly called for pension funds to buy British and introduced new rules forcing funds to publicly state how much money they put into London-listed stocks. Allocations to UK equities by pension funds have fallen from 53pc in 1997 to around 4pc today.

HSBC is one of the most closely followed equity strategists globally and a positive re-rating could prompt more money to flow into the London market.

The bank's rating upgrade, from neutral to overweight, means investors should consider putting a greater proportion of their money into the UK.

HSBC's analysts said a likely Labour victory in the upcoming election was unlikely to unsettle the stock market, removing a potential roadblock for investors considering backing Britain.

The optimistic outlook is a major boost for the UK stock market, which has been mired in gloom because of a lack of flotations and a string of companies quitting for New York and Frankfurt.

The UK market is cheaper than other global benchmarks, with the discount to the US stock market 23pc wider than normal.

Stocks are cheap in part because of downward pressure on prices from pension funds selling. British retirement funds have pulled an estimated £1.9 trillion from the market over the past three decades, according to HSBC.

However, the bank said holdings were now so small that further mass sales were unlikely.

HSBC upped its target for where the FTSE 100 will end the year from 8,100 to 8,750. The index closed at 8,424 on Monday night and has risen almost 9pc so far this year.

The bank last upgraded its view on UK stock from underweight to neutral in September 2023.

HSBC's recommendation is at odds with Coutts, the King's bank, which last month decided to downgrade its rating and said it would pull £1.9bn from the London stock market.

The US Federal Reserve should keep interest rates at their current elevated levels for longer than previously expected due to disappointing recent inflation data, a senior bank official has said.

The Fed has raised interest rates to a 23-year high and held them there as it looks to bring inflation down to its long-term target of 2pc.

But despite significant progress last year, the Fed's inflation fight has faced a setback this year, with the rate at which consumer prices are rising accelerating again in the first quarter.

Speaking at a conference in Florida, Fed vice chair for supervision Michael Barr said the bank had made ""tremendous progress"" in bringing inflation down from its 2022 peak, while unemployment - the other leg of its dual mandate - had remained low.

""We are not yet all the way to our target of 2pc,"" he said in prepared remarks, noting the ""disappointing"" recent inflation data. He added:

The main US stock indexes were almost flat at open as investors awaited quarterly results from tech giant Nvidia, which are expected to move markets.

Ofcom's ruling the GB News broke impartiality rules with a programme featuring Rishi Sunak is ""one for GB News to respond to"" in the first stance, the Prime Minister's official spokesman said.

GB News has accused Ofcom of a ""terrifying"" attack on democracy after the regulator threatened the startup broadcaster with a fine.

The PM's spokesman said:

An independent institute to oversee national strategy on expanding the UK's semiconductor industry is to be created, the Government has announced.

The UK Semiconductor Institute will bring together the Government, university researchers and the private sector to oversee growth in the computer chip sector, the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) said.

The increasing global reliance on technology has seen semiconductors become recognised as an area of global strategic significance, with the rise of artificial intelligence already sparking further demand for more powerful chips.

Currently, production in the sector is dominated by Taiwan, but last year the Government launched a £1bn strategy to boost UK innovation.

DSIT said the new institute would be tasked with ensuring chip researchers have the tools and infrastructure needed to carry out their work and create market-ready products.

It would also act as an entry point for tech businesses and international partners who wish to work with the UK market around the technology.

US stock indexes edged higher in premarket trading ahead of likely tests from Nvidia's quarterly results and the Federal Reserve's policy meeting minutes.

The company said the latest offer represents a ""significant increase from the initial proposal"".

It comes amid a flurry of foreign investor interest in UK companies amid suppressed market valuations in the City.

Last month, US private equity group Thoma Bravo agreed to buy UK cybersecurity company Darktrace for about £4.2bn.

Victorian Plumbing has bought its arch rival online bathroom retailer Victoria Plum in a deal worth £22.5m.

The takeover comes just over six months after Victoria Plum plunged into administration and was bought in a so-called pre-pack deal to AHK Designs.

Victorian Plumbing said a cost-cutting plan was already under way at Doncaster-based Victoria Plum, given its recent administration process.

It brings together the two long-standing rivals, which met in court over a trademark dispute eight years ago.

Mark Radcliffe, chief executive of Victorian Plumbing, said the deal was ""another exciting strategic milestone"" for the company.

""The acquisition aligns with our ambitions to accelerate our growth,"" he said.

""We are pleased to welcome the existing Victoria Plum team to our group and look forward to continuing to provide customers with a fantastic range of bathroom products and accessories.""

Victorian Plumbing is headquartered in Skelmersdale, Lancashire, and employs 600 staff across nine sites in Lancashire, Manchester and Birmingham.

The firm said it expects Victoria Plum to ""broadly"" break even in the second half of 2024.

Uber is making £5,000 grants available to its drivers in London who switch to an electric vehicle (EV).

The ride-hailing app company announced the measure to help it meet its previous commitment that all Uber vehicles in the capital will be fully electric by the end of 2025.

Drivers can spend their grant cash as a lump sum on an EV purchase, or on weekly payments for rental or rent-to-buy agreements.

Uber has also secured discounts of £12,000 to £17,000 on selected EVs for its drivers.

Around a quarter of miles for Uber journeys in London are in electric cars. There are more than 100,000 Uber vehicles in the UK, with around half in London.

Uber's UK general manager Andrew Brem said:

Mining behemoth BHP must overcome major hurdles to salvage its faltering pursuit of rival Anglo American, analysts have said, as a midweek deadline for its takeover bid approaches.

UK-listed Anglo American has already knocked back two attempts by the Australian giant, which has until 5pm on Wednesday to up its offer, walk away, or launch a hostile takeover at enormous risk.

Any deal between two of the world's largest resources companies would fundamentally reshape the sector, with far-reaching consequences for commodities markets and the global energy transition.

The latest bid sits at £34bn, which would rank as one of the largest mining deals ever seen.

MineLife analyst Gavin Wendt said Anglo American's disinterested board had kept the larger competitor at bay for now. He said:

The FTSE 100 has moved higher in early trading amid a boost from metal miners after gold and copper hit record highs overnight.

The blue-chip FTSE 100 was up 0.3pc, while the mid-cap FTSE 250 climbed 0.4pc.

Precious metal miners and industrial metal miners led gains, as gold prices surged and copper hit an all-time peak.

Safe-haven gold rose after a helicopter crash which killed Iran's president, while copper has been boosted by China rolling out property stimulus measures and upbeat industrial output data. There are also concerns about supply.

Traders are looking forward to a speech later by the Bank of England's Deputy Governor Ben Broadbent, which could offer clues that could signal the timing of the first interest rate cut.

In corporate news, shares of AstraZeneca lost 0.5pc as the pharma giant announced plans to build a $1.5bn (£1.2bn) manufacturing facility in Singapore.

Keywords Studios jumped 63.3pc as European private equity group EQT entered advanced talks to buy the Dublin-based video game services company for £2.2bn.

The price of oil has inched upwards after the crash which killed Iran's president.

Brent crude, the international benchmark, rose 0.4pc to a one-week high of $84.33 after the aircraft came down in a mountainous area in Iran's East Azerbaijan province.

The Middle East also faces potential turmoil from Saudi Arabia.

Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman postponed a planned four-day trip to Japan due to concerns over the king's health.

News of the cancellation came after the state-run Saudi Press Agency reported that Prince Mohammed's father, King Salman Bin Abdulaziz, is suffering from inflammation of the lung and will be receiving antibiotics at Al Salam Palace in Jeddah.

MBS, who handles most day-to-day affairs in the kingdom, is next in line to the throne.

Warren Patterson, head of commodities strategy for ING, said:

The FTSE 100 began the week higher as investors await key inflation figures this week which could pave the way for the Bank of England to cut interest rates.

The UK's blue-chip stock index rose 0.2pc to 8,440.50 while the midcap FTSE 250 has risen 0.4pc to 20,831.97.

The latest inflation figures, which are expected to show a sharp drop towards the Bank of England's 2pc target, will be published on Wednesday.

The value of one of Britain's most prominent shopping centres has been cut in half in less than a decade, as British Land sold its stake in the site for £360m deal.

The commercial property developer has sold its share in the Meadowhall Shopping Centre in Sheffield to Norway's sovereign wealth fund.

Together with the £7m sale of some land earlier this year, the deal values the 200-acre Meadowhall estate, which sits next to the M1 motorway, at £734m in total.

Norway's sovereign wealth fund originally invested in the shopping centre in 2012, buying a 50pc stake in a deal which valued the site at £1.5bn.

British Land said the sale was in line with its aim to shift away from covered shopping centres in favour of investing in retail parks.

Simon Carter, chief executive of British Land, said:

AstraZeneca has announced plans to build a $1.5bn (£1.2bn) factory in Singapore as the drugs giant expands its manufacturing footprint around the world.

The plant will be Astra's first antibody drug-conjugate facility to produce the medicines from start to finish.

It is part of a global shift by drugmakers to ensure they have local manufacturing capacity for their products.

The company two months ago committing to a new £650m vaccine factory in Liverpool.

Ryanair said it was ""cautiously optimistic"" that air fares will not rise sharply this summer season despite it receiving fewer new planes than expected.

The Irish carrier revealed profits grew by 34pc to a record €1.9bn (£1.6bn) last year.

Ryanair said it would be 23 jets short of the number Boeing was due to deliver by the end of July and there remained a risk - although ""unlikely"" - that deliveries could slip further.

It also revealed that former home secretary Amber Rudd would join the company as a non-executive director.

Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary warned two weeks ago that summer airfares would likely be lower than the 5pc to 10pc rise it expected as recently as late April.

The airline said on Monday its weaker forecast was ""heavily dependent"" on last-minute summer bookings.

The low-cost carrier flew a record 184m passengers in the year to the end of March.

It also announced a €700m share buyback that it said it would formally launch later this week.

Gold was not the only metal hitting record highs overnight.

Copper jumped to a fresh all-time peak amid expectations that increased demand will lead to supply shortages.

The price of copper on the London Metal Exchange rose above $11,000 a ton for the first time.

Prices have gained more than a quarter since the start of this year.

Thanks for joining me. Gold jumped to fresh record highs after Iran's president was killed in a helicopter crash.

Bullion jumped as much as 1.1pc to hit $2,440.59 an ounce after Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi, Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian and all the other passengers onboard died when the aircraft came down in northwest Iran.

His death has added to tensions in the Middle East, which analysts said increases the appeal of the metal, which is considered a safe haven in times of turmoil.

However, in a sign that markets were less concerned about the threat of instability, the price of oil remained relatively steady at $84 a barrel.

Nicholas Frappell, global head of institutional markets at ABC Refinery in Sydney, said: ""Gold's rally is news-driven with uncertainty about what happened in Iran.

""There is bound to be an element of jumping to conclusions on the basis of very little information.""

The rise in gold also comes amid optimism that the US Federal Reserve will make two interest rate cuts this year after inflation figures last week were lower than expected.

That offered support for the precious metal, which is priced in the dollar.

Bargain basement prices for UK listed companies and expectations that defined benefit pension funds will be lured back to British stocks has prompted the bank's researchers to urge clients to shift more money into the London market.

The optimistic outlook is a major boost for the UK stock market, which has been mired in gloom due to a lack of flotations and companies quitting for New York and Frankfurt.

British pension funds have pulled an estimated £1.9 trillion from the market over the past three decades, according to HSBC, but the trend is set to reverse.

""The long-term structural overhang of UK pension fund selling is at an end; they simply have no more UK equities left to sell,"" the bank's research team said.

Labour victory in the upcoming General Election is also unlikely to unsettle the stock market.

The bank's upgrade on UK stocks, from neutral to overweight, means investors should consider putting a greater proportion of their investment portfolio into the UK.

The move is at odds with Coutts, the King's bank, which last month decided to go underweight UK equities and pull £1.9bn from the stock market.

HSBC is one of the most closely followed equity strategists globally and a positive re-rating could prompt more money to flow into the London market.

Allocations to UK equities by pension funds have fallen from 53pc in 1997 to around 4pc today.

HSBC expects allocations to increase rather than decline further after the government urged pension funds to spend more on UK equities.

The UK is also cheaper than other global benchmarks, with the discount to the US stock market 23pc wider than normal.

A boom in M&A, including a flurry of takeovers such as the Darktrace and BHP's £34bn bid for Anglo American, is also likely to cause more stockpickers to flood into the market in hopes of more dealmaking.

HSBC also upped its target for where the FTSE 100 will end the year to 8,750 from 8,100. The index closed at 8,424 today.

Legal & General throws weight behind Anglo American's management amid takeover risk

A top Anglo American shareholder has thrown its weight behind the miner and its plans to slim down as Anglo attempts to stave off a takeover from rival BHP, according to an FT report.

Anglo is racing to convince shareholders that its continued independence is in their interests by planning a break-up plan that will see some of its units, including the De Beers diamond business, sold off.

Legal & General Investment Management, which is one of the miner's top 10 investors with 2pc of the shares, is backing Anglo American's management.

UK manufacturing needs a 'turbo charged boost' to combat Chinese dominance, says expert

As we reported earlier today, the Government announced it will set up an independent UK Semiconductor Institute to promote Britain's semiconductor sector.

It follows the Government saying last year that it wanted to ""support the competitiveness of the semiconductor manufacturing sector that is critical to the UK tech ecosystem or the UK's national security"".

But concerns have been growing more widely in the West over the need to maintain a manufacturing base for key technologies.

It's not just chips. On Friday, Alicia Kearns MP, chairman of the Commons foreign affairs select committee, urged action on critical minerals, which are used in electric car batteries, amid news that China had made a major breakthrough in battery technology.

Robert Clark, an Armed Forces veteran who is a senior fellow at the think tank Civitas, told The Telegraph:

High interest rates needed 'some further time,' says Fed official

The US Federal Reserve should keep interest rates at their current elevated levels for longer than previously expected due to disappointing recent inflation data, a senior bank official has said.

The Fed has raised interest rates to a 23-year high and held them there as it looks to bring inflation down to its long-term target of 2pc.

But despite significant progress last year, the Fed's inflation fight has faced a setback this year, with the rate at which consumer prices are rising accelerating again in the first quarter.

Speaking at a conference in Florida, Fed vice chair for supervision Michael Barr said the bank had made ""tremendous progress"" in bringing inflation down from its 2022 peak, while unemployment - the other leg of its dual mandate - had remained low.

""We are not yet all the way to our target of 2pc,"" he said in prepared remarks, noting the ""disappointing"" recent inflation data. He added:

The main US stock indexes were almost flat at open as investors awaited quarterly results from tech giant Nvidia, which are expected to move markets.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 13.83 points, or less than 0.1pc, at the open to 39,989.76.

Semiconductor institute to be launched to support UK chip sector

An independent institute to oversee national strategy on expanding the UK's semiconductor industry is to be created, the Government has announced.

The UK Semiconductor Institute will bring together the Government, university researchers and the private sector to oversee growth in the computer chip sector, the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) said.

The increasing global reliance on technology has seen semiconductors become recognised as an area of global strategic significance, with the rise of artificial intelligence already sparking further demand for more powerful chips.

Currently, production in the sector is dominated by Taiwan, but last year the Government launched a £1bn strategy to boost UK innovation.

DSIT said the new institute would be tasked with ensuring chip researchers have the tools and infrastructure needed to carry out their work and create market-ready products.

It would also act as an entry point for tech businesses and international partners who wish to work with the UK market around the technology.

Keywords Studios shares surge as £2bn takeover offer deals fresh blow to City

Shares in video games services company Keywords Studios rocketed in early trading after it said it is in advanced talks to be taken private in a £2bn deal that delivers another blow to the City.

The company - which has worked on Fortnite, Call of Duty and Baldur's Gate 3 - was up as much as 69.9pc to just below £2.50 after it confirmed the discussions about a possible £2.55p per share with European private equity group EQT.

Clock ticking on BHP's mining mega-deal with Anglo-American

Mining behemoth BHP must overcome major hurdles to salvage its faltering pursuit of rival Anglo American, analysts have said, as a midweek deadline for its takeover bid approaches.

UK-listed Anglo American has already knocked back two attempts by the Australian giant, which has until 5pm on Wednesday to up its offer, walk away, or launch a hostile takeover at enormous risk.

Any deal between two of the world's largest resources companies would fundamentally reshape the sector, with far-reaching consequences for commodities markets and the global energy transition.

The latest bid sits at £34bn, which would rank as one of the largest mining deals ever seen.

MineLife analyst Gavin Wendt said Anglo American's disinterested board had kept the larger competitor at bay for now. He said:

The FTSE 100 has moved higher in early trading amid a boost from metal miners after gold and copper hit record highs overnight.

The blue-chip FTSE 100 was up 0.3pc, while the mid-cap FTSE 250 climbed 0.4pc.

Precious metal miners and industrial metal miners led gains, as gold prices surged and copper hit an all-time peak.

Safe-haven gold rose after a helicopter crash which killed Iran's president, while copper has been boosted by China rolling out property stimulus measures and upbeat industrial output data. There are also concerns about supply.

Traders are looking forward to a speech later by the Bank of England's Deputy Governor Ben Broadbent, which could offer clues that could signal the timing of the first interest rate cut.

In corporate news, shares of AstraZeneca lost 0.5pc as the pharma giant announced plans to build a $1.5bn (£1.2bn) manufacturing facility in Singapore.

Keywords Studios jumped 63.3pc as European private equity group EQT entered advanced talks to buy the Dublin-based video game services company for £2.2bn.

The price of oil has inched upwards after the crash which killed Iran's president.

Brent crude, the international benchmark, rose 0.4pc to a one-week high of $84.33 after the aircraft came down in a mountainous area in Iran's East Azerbaijan province.

The Middle East also faces potential turmoil from Saudi Arabia.

Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman postponed a planned four-day trip to Japan due to concerns over the king's health.

News of the cancellation came after the state-run Saudi Press Agency reported that Prince Mohammed's father, King Salman Bin Abdulaziz, is suffering from inflammation of the lung and will be receiving antibiotics at Al Salam Palace in Jeddah.

MBS, who handles most day-to-day affairs in the kingdom, is next in line to the throne.

Value of Meadowhall Shopping Centre halved after British Land deal

The value of one of Britain's most prominent shopping centres has been cut in half in less than a decade, as British Land sold its stake in the site for £360m deal.

The commercial property developer has sold its share in the Meadowhall Shopping Centre in Sheffield to Norway's sovereign wealth fund.

Together with the £7m sale of some land earlier this year, the deal values the 200-acre Meadowhall estate, which sits next to the M1 motorway, at £734m in total.

Norway's sovereign wealth fund originally invested in the shopping centre in 2012, buying a 50pc stake in a deal which valued the site at £1.5bn.

British Land said the sale was in line with its aim to shift away from covered shopping centres in favour of investing in retail parks.

Simon Carter, chief executive of British Land, said:

AstraZeneca has announced plans to build a $1.5bn (£1.2bn) factory in Singapore as the drugs giant expands its manufacturing footprint around the world.

The plant will be Astra's first antibody drug-conjugate facility to produce the medicines from start to finish.

It is part of a global shift by drugmakers to ensure they have local manufacturing capacity for their products.

The company two months ago committing to a new £650m vaccine factory in Liverpool.

Ryanair 'optimistic' air fares will not face sharp increase this summer

Ryanair said it was ""cautiously optimistic"" that air fares will not rise sharply this summer season despite it receiving fewer new planes than expected.

The Irish carrier revealed profits grew by 34pc to a record €1.9bn (£1.6bn) last year.

Ryanair said it would be 23 jets short of the number Boeing was due to deliver by the end of July and there remained a risk - although ""unlikely"" - that deliveries could slip further.

It also revealed that former home secretary Amber Rudd would join the company as a non-executive director.

Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary warned two weeks ago that summer airfares would likely be lower than the 5pc to 10pc rise it expected as recently as late April.

The airline said on Monday its weaker forecast was ""heavily dependent"" on last-minute summer bookings.

The low-cost carrier flew a record 184m passengers in the year to the end of March.

It also announced a €700m share buyback that it said it would formally launch later this week.

Copper hits record high amid fears of supply shortage

Gold was not the only metal hitting record highs overnight.

Copper jumped to a fresh all-time peak amid expectations that increased demand will lead to supply shortages.

The price of copper on the London Metal Exchange rose above $11,000 a ton for the first time.

Prices have gained more than a quarter since the start of this year.

Thanks for joining me. Gold jumped to fresh record highs after Iran's president was killed in a helicopter crash.

Bullion jumped as much as 1.1pc to hit $2,440.59 an ounce after Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi, Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian and all the other passengers onboard died when the aircraft came down in northwest Iran.

His death has added to tensions in the Middle East, which analysts said increases the appeal of the metal, which is considered a safe haven in times of turmoil.

However, in a sign that markets were less concerned about the threat of instability, the price of oil remained relatively steady at $84 a barrel.

Nicholas Frappell, global head of institutional markets at ABC Refinery in Sydney, said: ""Gold's rally is news-driven with uncertainty about what happened in Iran.

""There is bound to be an element of jumping to conclusions on the basis of very little information.""

The rise in gold also comes amid optimism that the US Federal Reserve will make two interest rate cuts this year after inflation figures last week were lower than expected.

That offered support for the precious metal, which is priced in the dollar.

Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) owned Google said it will invest an additional 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) to expand its data center campus in Finland.

This investment aims to bolster its artificial intelligence (AI) business in Europe, and underscores Google's commitment to enhancing its technological infrastructure and AI capabilities in the region.

Data centers have increasingly found homes in the Nordic countries, benefiting from the region's cooler climate, tax incentives, and ample renewable energy resources, reported Reuters.

However, neighboring countries like Sweden and Norway have started to voice concerns about hosting these energy-intensive facilities.

Industry experts suggest that these nations should prioritize renewable energy for high-value products like green steel.

Finland, in contrast, has seen a rapid expansion of its wind power capacity, growing by 75% to 5,677 megawatts in 2022.

This growth has occasionally led to negative electricity prices on windy days, indicating an excess of renewable energy.

Google's long-term contracts for wind power in Finland ensure a stable supply for its data centers, aligning with the country's renewable energy capabilities.

Analysts predict a significant rise in power consumption due to the surge in AI applications. Google cited this growing demand for AI as a key reason for its substantial investment.

The Hamina data center in Finland, which already operates with 97% carbon-free energy, exemplifies Google's commitment to sustainable practices.

The facility will also contribute to the local community by redirecting excess heat to Hamina's district heating network, benefiting households, schools, and public buildings.

Google has set an ambitious target to achieve net zero emissions across all its operations and value chain by 2030.

The Finnish investment is part of a broader strategy, which includes recent announcements of new data centers in the Netherlands and Belgium, aimed at expanding Google's infrastructure while adhering to environmental sustainability goals.

The tech giant made several announcements around Gemini and its upcoming AI-powered features at its annual I/O developer conference.

Alphabet stock has gained more than 40% in the last 12 months. Investors can gain exposure to the stock via Communication Services Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLC) and Vanguard Communication Services ETF (NYSE:VOX)

Those concerns are fully justified, as those data centers consume as much as 1.5% of all the electricity generated in the world today. That number could increase dramatically if the use of artificial intelligence expands as expected. There is a secondary concern associated with data centers, namely what to do with the heat created by all those chips, microprocessors, and servers? Google announced this week that it will send the waste heat from its data center in Hamina, Finland, to that community's district heating system.

The company says it expects the exported heat will provide 80% of the warmth needed to keep the homes and offices in Hamina cozy in the winter. The Google facility in Hamina gets 97% of its electricity from renewable sources, which means that captured heat will also be 97% carbon free. According to Ilari Soosalu, the mayor of Hamina: ""Google and the city of Hamina have a long and flourishing history together. Google is an excellent example of a company with strong sustainable future orientation. It feels good to be the hometown of Google in Finland.""

Here's a helpful video put together by Google to explain how the heat sharing system will work.

To date, the heat from Google's Hamina data center has been captured and recovered to heat the offices and buildings onsite. Starting next year, the warm temperature coming from the data center will be recovered to optimize the district heating network's energy efficiency and carbon emissions footprint. Google is aiming to achieve net zero emissions across all of its operations and value chain by 2030, supported by an ambitious clean energy goal to run all its offices and data centers on 24/7 carbon-free energy. This project helps bring it closer to achieving this goal while also supporting Finland's long standing commitment to environmental sustainability and technological innovation.

Google, Amazon, & Waste Heat

Why isn't Google doing this in more places? Primarily because many communities do not rely on district heating systems, which distributes heat from where it is created to where it is needed. Typically, those systems use the heat to warm a fluid -- usually water -- which is then pumped through insulated underground pipes to where it is needed. There, the warmed fluid is used to heat the ambient air, which is then distributed throughout a home or commercial space. The whole process is not particularly energy efficient, but it is far better than letting that heat escape into the atmosphere.

District heating tends to be used primarily in colder regions where communities are densely populated. The whole concept is not all that different from the days when living quarters and barns were combined so the heat of the animals would help keep the inhabitants warm. Google is not the only company that relies on huge server farms to keep track of all the information its business creates. Amazon is another one that has a voracious appetite for electricity to run its data centers. That means it also has a lot of excess heat it needs to get rid of.

Last year, in cooperation with Codema, the energy agency for Dublin, Ireland, Amazon participated in a project to upgrade the local district heating system in part of the city. Now students at Technological University Dublin and residents of the nearby Dublin County Council housing facility are being kept warm in part by waste heat from the Amazon data center in Dublin. The new facility replaces many of the old methane-fired boilers that used to heat those buildings. ""It's essentially a plug and play replacement for gas boilers,"" says John O'Shea, who leads the heat and electricity division at Codema. ""It operates at similar temperatures, so they don't need to undergo massive fabric upgrades or change radiator sizes. They can just take advantage of it.""

O'Shea and his team at Codema estimate the project is saving 1,400 tons of CO2 emissions every year, which equals a reduction of about 60% compared to the previous system of individual onsite boilers. Once fully operational, the system is expected to heat 47,000 square meters of local public buildings, 3,000 square meters of commercial buildings, and 135 apartments. Several other residential developers have also expressed interest. By 2050, O'Shea says 87% of buildings in Dublin County could be eligible for similar district heating systems.

The Amazon project in Dublin is just one of a growing number of district heating systems that use waste heat from data centers. That excess heat is a problem for companies like Google and Meta because it requires them to use more electricity to keep their servers cool. But to others, waste heat is a renewable energy source. ""You're basically reusing something that's currently being dumped, so there's no additional climate impact to it,"" O'Shea said.

Meta claims its data center in Odense, Denmark, delivers enough hot water to heat 6,900 local homes. Amazon's headquarters in Seattle has used excess heat from a data center in the Westin Building Exchange since 2019. In March of last year, Microsoft and Fortum, the Finnish energy company that maintains the Dublin system, announced that is was developing a system that would deliver heat to 100,000 Helsinki residents, saving 400,000 tons of carbon dioxide every year.

The Takeaway

Efficiency will be a key consideration in the quest to keep the Earth habitable. We simply no longer have the luxury of driving cars and trucks that waste 70% or more of the energy contained in a gallon of gasoline. Doing so is simply insanity. You wouldn't buy a bottle of expensive champagne and pour most of it down the drain. You wouldn't buy a lobster and throw the tail away. You wouldn't spend good money for a slice of prime rib and throw most of it in the garbage. So why do people think it is OK to waste the majority of the energy they buy with their hard-earned money?

Capturing waste heat makes so much sense, it's amazing more municipalities and companies aren't doing it. My old Irish grandmother used to say, ""One person's trash is another person's treasure."" We humans need to amend our profligate ways to use the energy we have more wisely. Google, Amazon, and others are leading the way, but the rest of us must soon follow or face the consequences. Researchers at the University of New South Wales have calculated that human activity has added heat equivalent to 25 billion atomic bombs to the environment. There is no possible way to argue that such wasteful practices are good for the long term health of our planet.",cleantechnica.com,news,CleanTechnica,Steve Hanley,0.192156862745098,453918129,29,https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Google-data-center-Finland.jpg,eng-9583763

The Nordic region has become a favored location for data centres due to its cooler climate, tax incentives, and abundant renewable energy. However, neighboring countries Sweden and Norway have recently expressed reservations about hosting data centres, with some experts advocating for the use of renewable power in higher-value products like green steel, Reuters news report said.

Finland, on the other hand, has significantly increased its wind power capacity, which grew by 75 percent to 5,677 megawatts in 2022 alone. This rapid expansion has occasionally driven electricity prices into the negative on particularly windy days, indicating surplus renewable capacity that can be utilized by data centres such as Google's. The tech giant has secured long-term contracts for wind power in Finland.

Analysts anticipate a substantial rise in data centres' power consumption due to the swift growth of AI applications. Google cited this anticipated demand, along with the near-total reliance on carbon-free energy at its existing Hamina data centre, as key reasons for its investment.

""Heat coming out of our Finnish data center will be re-routed to the district heating network in nearby Hamina, covering local households, schools, and public service buildings,"" Google said in its news statement.

The unusually cold weather played a significant role, with April temperatures in Helsinki and Jyväskylä being two and one-and-a-half degrees Celsius colder, respectively, than the previous year.

The average price of electricity in April was 4.89 cents per kilowatt-hour, a decrease from March's 5.89 cents, and significantly lower than April 2023's 6.06 cents. This drop in price encouraged the use of electric boilers for heating, which was in high demand due to the cold weather, particularly in the latter half of the month.

Nuclear power production took a hit due to the annual maintenance at the Olkiluoto plant, reducing its contribution to 29% of the electricity mix, down from 45% in April 2023. Despite this reduction, the shortfall did not lead to a spike in electricity prices thanks to increased production from wind and hydro power sources.

Wind power production saw a substantial boost, increasing by 56% compared to April 2023, thanks to favorable wind conditions and expanded capacity. Wind energy accounted for 22% of the total electricity production. Hydro power also played a crucial role, with production rising by 19% from the previous year, contributing to 20% of the total electricity output.

""Spring floods in Ostrobothnia, caused by melting snow and heavy rains, significantly boosted hydro power production,"" said Marja Rankila, a hydro power expert from Energy Industry Finland.

Electricity imports also played a significant role in meeting the increased demand, with imports constituting 11.5% of the total consumption in April 2024, up from less than 1% in April 2023. Most of this electricity was imported from Sweden, providing essential flexibility and stability to the market.

On the other hand, combined heat and power (CHP) production saw a marked decline, despite the cold weather increasing heating demand. CHP contributed 14% to the electricity mix, down by 24% compared to the previous year.

""CHP's role has been declining over the years, and this trend has accelerated,"" noted Jukka Leskelä, CEO of Energy Industry Finland. ""This shift is part of a broader transition towards electrifying heating in urban district heating networks and moving electricity production to distant wind and solar farms. This rapid transformation presents significant investment challenges for grid companies, which must adapt to the changing demands swiftly.""

Despite the decline, urban CHP plants remain crucial for ensuring the reliability and flexibility of the electricity supply.

Overall, the combination of increased household consumption, expanded renewable energy production, and strategic imports has allowed Finland to manage a cold April effectively without significant hikes in electricity prices.

Alphabet Inc GOOGL owned Google said it will invest an additional 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) to expand its data center campus in Finland.

This investment aims to bolster its artificial intelligence (AI) business in Europe, and underscores Google's commitment to enhancing its technological infrastructure and AI capabilities in the region.

Data centers have increasingly found homes in the Nordic countries, benefiting from the region's cooler climate, tax incentives, and ample renewable energy resources, reported Reuters.

However, neighboring countries like Sweden and Norway have started to voice concerns about hosting these energy-intensive facilities.

Industry experts suggest that these nations should prioritize renewable energy for high-value products like green steel.

Finland, in contrast, has seen a rapid expansion of its wind power capacity, growing by 75% to 5,677 megawatts in 2022.

This growth has occasionally led to negative electricity prices on windy days, indicating an excess of renewable energy.

Google's long-term contracts for wind power in Finland ensure a stable supply for its data centers, aligning with the country's renewable energy capabilities.

Analysts predict a significant rise in power consumption due to the surge in AI applications. Google cited this growing demand for AI as a key reason for its substantial investment.

The Hamina data center in Finland, which already operates with 97% carbon-free energy, exemplifies Google's commitment to sustainable practices.

The facility will also contribute to the local community by redirecting excess heat to Hamina's district heating network, benefiting households, schools, and public buildings.

Google has set an ambitious target to achieve net zero emissions across all its operations and value chain by 2030.

The Finnish investment is part of a broader strategy, which includes recent announcements of new data centers in the Netherlands and Belgium, aimed at expanding Google's infrastructure while adhering to environmental sustainability goals.

The tech giant made several announcements around Gemini and its upcoming AI-powered features at its annual I/O developer conference.

Alphabet stock has gained more than 40% in the last 12 months. Investors can gain exposure to the stock via Communication Services Select Sector SPDR Fund XLC and Vanguard Communication Services ETF VOX

Price Action: GOOGL shares are trading higher by 1.22% at $178.19 at the last check Monday.

From the mid-1960s through 2016, Colombia was torn by conflict between the government, leftist guerrilla movements and right-wing paramilitary groups. Now the government and rebels are working to carry out a sweeping accord that addresses many critical sectors, including environmental damages and restoration.

University of Notre Dame researchers Richard Marcantonio and Josefina Echavarria Alvarez study peace and conflict issues, including their effects on the environment. They currently are advising negotiations between the Colombian government and several rebel factions over wartime damage to soil, water and other natural resources. They explain that while Colombia's transition from war to peace has been difficult, the accord offers a model for addressing the ravages of war in places such as Gaza and Ukraine.

Few agreements include environmental provisions, and even fewer see them carried out, even though research shows that many drivers of conflict can be directly or indirectly related to the environment.

We work with a research program at the University of Notre Dame called the Peace Accords Matrix, which monitors the implementation of comprehensive peace accords in 34 countries worldwide. Only 10 of the accords have natural resource management provisions agreements, and these typically have not triggered major steps to protect the environment.

Colombia's is seen as the most comprehensive peace accord that has been signed to date. It considers issues ranging from security to social justice and political participation, in great detail.

The accord acknowledges that a peaceful postwar society requires not only respect for human rights but also ""protection of the environment, respect for nature and its renewable and nonrenewable resources and biodiversity."" More than 20% of the commitments in the agreement have an environmental connection.

- Protecting environmental health through measures such as access to clean water

- Process issues, such as ensuring that communities can participate in decisions about rural programs and resource management

There also are gaps. For example, many protected areas have been deforested for ranching and coca production in the postaccord period. And there are no provisions addressing toxic pollution, an issue other agreements also neglect.

Often there are power vacuums during transitions between war and peace, when government agencies are working to reestablish their operations. Natural resources and environmental health need protection during these phases.

In Sierra Leone, for example, resource extraction by foreign companies drastically ramped up immediately after the Lome Peace Agreement eventually ended that nation's civil war in 2002. Companies exploited a lack of governance and support in the rural areas and often mined metals illegally or hazardously without any regulatory oversight. Today these areas still struggle with mining impacts, including contaminated drinking water and fish, the primary protein source in the area.

The damage is vast: There's air, water and soil contamination, deforestation and enormous quantities of waste, including ruined buildings, burned-out cars and thousands of tons of destroyed military equipment. Russia's destruction of the Kakhovka Dam flooded villages, destroyed crops and wrecked irrigation systems.

The cost estimates are staggering. A joint commission of the World Bank, the government of Ukraine and other institutions currently estimate direct damages at roughly US$152 billion.

In addition, cleaning up sites, rebuilding infrastructure and other repairs could cost more than $486 billion over the next decade, as of late 2023. That figure rises every day that the war continues.

There's broad interest in a green and sustainable reconstruction that would include steps like using sustainable building materials and powering the electricity grid with renewable energy. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been adamant that Russia must pay for the damage it has caused. It's still unclear how this would work, although some U.S. and European lawmakers support seizing frozen Russian assets held in Western banks to help cover the cost.

There is a legal basis for holding Russia accountable. In 2022, the U.N. General Assembly adopted a set of principles for protecting the environment during armed conflicts. Among other existing statutes, they draw on a protocol to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 that prohibits using ""methods or means of warfare which are intended, or may be expected, to cause widespread, long-term and severe damage to the natural environment.""

There has been only modest discussion so far of how to integrate these principles into a formal peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia. But a working group that included Ukrainian and European Union officials and former leaders from Sweden, Finland, Ireland and Brazil has recommended a framework for addressing environmental damage and holding perpetrators accountable.

Environmental damage in Gaza also is devastating. The U.N. estimated in early 2024 that over 100,000 cubic meters (26 million gallons) of untreated sewage and wastewater were flowing daily onto land or into the Mediterranean Sea.

Gaza's drinking water system was insufficient before the war and has been further weakened by military strikes. On average, Gazans now have access to about 3 liters of water per person per day - less than 1 gallon.

Thousands of buildings have been destroyed, spreading hazardous materials such as asbestos. Every bomb that's dropped disperses toxic materials that will persist in the soil unless it's remediated. Simultaneous environmental and infrastructure impacts, such as water and power shortages, are contributing to larger crises, such as the collapse of Gaza's health care system, that will have long-lasting human costs.

Integrating the environment into peace accords isn't easy. Resources such as energy, clean soil and water are vital for life, which is precisely why military forces may seek to control or destroy them. This is happening in both Ukraine and Gaza.

Peace negotiators tend to focus on social, political and economic issues, rather than environmental reparations. But leaving environmental damage unresolved until after a peace accord is signed keeps people who have been displaced and marginalized by conflict in precarious positions.

It may even cause fighting to resume. According to the U.N. Environment Program, at least 40% of all wars within states in the past 60 years have had a link to natural resources. In those cases, fighting was twice as likely to resume within five years after conflict ended.

We see some lessons for future negotiations.

First, it's important for accords to recognize environmental harm as one of war's main consequences and to acknowledge that a healthy environment is essential for sustainable livelihoods and peace.

Second, connecting environmental provisions with other issues, such as rural reform and political participation, can create better, more sustainable and equal conditions for reestablishing democracy. The Colombia accords are an example.

Third, it is important to clearly define goals, such as what infrastructure and institutions need to be rebuilt, who is in charge of getting those tasks done, and the timetable for doing it. This can help ensure that environmental restoration doesn't become a secondary goal.

Fourth, the international community has an important role to play in monitoring and verifying environmental restoration and providing financial and technical support. Foreign donors have already pledged $66 billion for rebuilding Ukraine and have said that they will require grantees to follow strict environmental standards in order to receive financing.

Reconstructing nations and simultaneously regenerating communities and ecosystems after wars is a daunting mission, but it's also an opportunity to build something better. We see Ukraine and Gaza as potential test cases for addressing war's toll on the environment and creating a more sustainable future.",greaterdiversity.com,news,Greater Diversity News,,-0.03529411764705881,453907084,1,https://eadn-wc04-4874068.nxedge.io/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-2024-05-20-090408.png,

Global search and online advertising giant Google is expanding its large data centre in Hamina, Finland.

The firm has operated the centre in the southern city since 2011 and has expanded the facility a number of times.

Google currently employs around 400 people in Hamina and it is expected that the new expansion will create about 100 new jobs.

In addition to IT professionals, the centre also employs electrical workers, cleaners and security guards.

Google bought more land from the city a couple of years ago and opened its sixth data centre in 2020 in an old papermill formerly owned by Stora Enso. Its seaside location allows it to use seawater to cool the massive complex, which is powered by wind-generated electricity.

According to the data centre's manager, Jukka Vainonen, the expansion will cost around one billion euros, bringing investments the company has made at the facility to about 4.5 billion euros since the completion of its latest data centre.

If construction goes smoothly, Vainonen estimated that the new addition will be online and ready to serve customers towards the end of summer next year.

For the first time Google also plans to donate heat generated at the facility to local energy firm Hamina Energia. The facility has used the heat exclusively for its own purposes for the past decade.

Vainonen noted that the facility's excess heat will provide Hamina with about 80 percent of its district heating requirements.

We don't need the heat ourselves, so if we can do something good locally, it's great,"" he said.",yle.fi,news,Yle.fi,,0.192156862745098,453904912,1,"https://images.cdn.yle.fi/image/upload/c_crop,x_0,y_107,w_4031,h_2268/w_1200,ar_1.91,c_fill/q_auto:eco,f_auto,fl_lossy/v1716207387/39-1287925664b1729d5d81",eng-9583763

A look at EP pre-election campaigns - Baltic News Network,"Soon Latvia will need to choose which of the 16 parties to vote for in the upcoming European Parliament elections. BNN has compiled a brief summary of the promises Latvian parties have listed in their respective promotional campaigns.

1. Harmony social democratic party

Despite the painful loss in the 14th Saeima elections, Harmony is back on top. Following a request from LTV, SKDS performed a survey in May. Results showed that 7.1% of Latvian voters are prepared to vote for Harmony. This political party is in 3rd place in the popularity poll.

Harmony lists simple but important topics like social support, medicine, education, housing and human rights as the core principles of its campaign. The party is part of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament. ""The interests of Harmony's voters are taken into account on a European level, as opposed to Latvia, where leading politicians continue dividing voters into right and wrong groups.""

Harmony is also not too modest in congratulating itself, claiming that: ""The fact that as of the 1st of January 2024 the minimal wage in Latvia is EUR 700 us possible thanks to efforts from the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats, who insist on having a unified minimal wage principle in the EU"". As for its priorities, Harmony mentions that this year's EU budget needs to be bigger; more funding is needed to overcome crises and consequences of war. It is also necessary to control Europe's budget objectives more tightly.

When it comes to Latvia's obligations, it is important to prevent the risk of failure to use available EU funds, because ""various estimates suggest the country has lost between EUR 200 - 400 million"". Harmony also stresses that a separate financial support is needed for regions ""close to EU's external border and have suffered the most from the war - Latvia, especially Latgale, as well as Estonia, Lithuania and Finland."" The party also focuses on its main work horse - rights of Russian speakers. This much is listed in the party's campaign, specifically about the rights of Russian-speaking Europeans: ""[...] Russian language is not Russia's language. It is important for Latvia and the EU to develop and strengthen the European identity of Russian-speaking residents."" The party's campaign also mentions that ""the quality of Latvia's governance becomes more and more unprofessional every year and every cycle"" and ""the situation in the country is made even more complicated by the increased ethnic tension caused by the war and the mistakes made by leading politicians in Latvia, as well as intentional actions. Latvia needs to stop its continued downward economic and social spiral and the worsening of relations between Latvian and Russian speakers in the country. To do this, we need to change our country's management principles.""

2. JKP - New Conservative Party

According to results of the popularity poll, 1.7% of Latvian voters are prepared to vote for this party. The party's campaign mentions that ""JKP's goal in the EU is maximum possible protection of Latvia's interests - from language, security and business interests to the prosperity of every Latvian citizen."" In turn, among the ten cornerstones of work in the European Parliament, the JKP has put ""National interests above all"" as its main priority.

Then there is ""protection of Latvian language and culture"", ""Minimal bureaucracy and easy entrepreneurship"", ""Migration policy's change"", and ""Support for Ukraine is support for a safe Europe"". JKP also notes ""the time has come to slow down the green course"". ""We support a sustainable and environmentally friendly economy, but only without exaggerations. Until Latvia has reached the peak of EU's quality of life, its residents and national economy cannot be subjected to impossible requirements of the green course. We have to slow down,"" the party's campaign mentions.

JKP also promises to demand transparency in the use of EU's finances, as well as request lowering the parliament's costs.

3. National Alliance ""All for Latvia - For Fatherland and Freedom/LNNK""

The popularity of the National Alliance reached 11% in May, ensuring a stable position of leadership. The motto of the party for European Parliament elections is: ""Protector of national interests - the voice of reason in Europe"". The campaign mentions: ""We are the only Latvian political force that has been able to prove its influence in the European Parliament in all terms since Latvia joined the European Union (EU). Let us continue to defend Latvia's interests in the EU, not the EU's interests in Latvia.""

NA promises to continue working in the European Conservatives and Reformists Group. Security is mentioned as the party's main priority, stressing that ""NATO remains Europe's safety guarantee"". NA promises to support EU initiatives aimed at expanding military mobility, response and cooperation, and stresses: ""Every effort must be made to support Ukraine in the fight against Russian occupation forces and to help Ukraine become a member of the EU and NATO.""

NA also promises to insist on ""widening sanctions against Russia while preventing possible deviations from existing ones"".

As for domestic security, NA mentions the need to strongly defend EU's external borders from the uncontrolled influx of illegal migrants, ""because there will always be migrants impossible to integrate into Europe's culture space, which could create potential threats."" NA also notes that the party does not agree with this year's changes to Europe's migration policy, which makes it mandatory for member states to relocate migrants or pay to not take them in. NA promises to overturn this principle. The National Association also advocates the sensible introduction of the Green Deal, stating: ""The direction of the Green Course is right, but it must be introduced at a price we can afford, while maintaining the EU's security, economic and social priorities.""

4. Latvia in First Place

This party can expect support from 5.8% of voters in Latvia. This party's declarative slogan is: ""Vote for a change of power in Latvia and Europe!""; ""Vote for a return of reason in Latvia and Europe that is based on the interests of every resident and stability!""; ""Vote for traditional values, for families composed of a father and mother - a man and woman, for families with children!"", etc.

The party's campaign states that ""the ruling politicians who have so far represented our country in Europe and spoken on behalf of the people have not defended the interests of the Latvian people - neither in Latvia nor in Europe! On the contrary - politicians elected from Latvia have usually tried to impose the opinion of European bureaucrats on Latvia!"" As a solution to all these challenges, the party offers to promote long-term investments of many billions in infrastructure and significant real estate development projects, pointing out that investment security in Latvia will thus become a common, international concern, but ""an abandoned and empty Latvia is a threat to our security and to the security of Europe as a whole.""

The party also promises to ensure full use of European funds to complete Rail Baltica project. They also support the allocation of significant European financing towards the reinforcement of Europe's border.

The party also stands in favour of a clean environment and nature protection as long as there are no exaggerations in the climate policy, because ""we don't need an even greener policy that risks causing Latvia's competitiveness to go down, economic stagnation or poverty"".

Latvia in First Place stresses the need to compose a general European policy to protect pensioners, people with special needs and lonely parents, ensure cooperation between European countries and mobility in the field of education and science. The party also wants to ensure social support for families with children so that ""our families would feel equal in the family of other European families - in terms of welfare, upbringing and providing educational opportunities!""

5. For Latvia's Development

This party can expect support from 4.2% of voters in Latvia. The party's campaign sits on three whales: ""for the European Union to become a true Security and Defence Union""; ""in order for EU funds to ensure the rapid development of the Latvian economy""; ""for Ukraine defeat Russia and join the European Union"". The tasks the party plans to work on in the European Parliament include: at least tripling the capacity of the European defence industry and five times the share of the EU budget allocated to defence, strengthening the Eastern border of Europe, agreeing on investments in external security of at least 3% of GDP by all EU countries, ensuring strict compliance with the sanctions imposed by the EU in all Member States.

The topic of EU funds is also a priority for this party. The party promises to take charge when it comes to the use of European funds in the interests of Latvia's development - starting with the national development strategy to the monitoring of the implementation of the most important projects. ""Because currently the opportunities provided by European funds are not being used to the fullest."" The party also notes that ""Latvian businessmen require more creative freedom and less self-directed EU regulation"".

6. Centre party

In May 2024 this party would receive support from 1.7% of voters. This party's campaign lists its main priorities: ""The Centre party's members will continue the work commenced by LKS member Tatyana Zhdanok to defend the rights of national minorities and non-citizens, fight against the rising neo-Nazism, adopt unified wage standards, balance work and private life, as well as ensure investments to equalise the development of European countries and regions.""

7. Association Jaunlatvieši

According to SKDS, this party would receive support from 1.3% of voters in May. This party wants to ""to voice loudly from the European Parliament's podium all the reasons why we have become one of the poorest countries in the European Union""; is about preserving the circulation of cash to ensure against the EU's plans to introduce central bank digital money in the Member States""; advocates ""family values, not manifestations of the Istanbul Convention that has not been adopted in society"" and categorically condemns ""the ongoing destruction of books in libraries of Latvia, which is implemented in accordance with the EU recommendations and guidelines on digitization"".

""We want to protect the market of local manufacturers and service providers, as other EU countries do in a smarter (including hidden) way. The absence of such a policy in Latvia has almost completely destroyed domestic farmers and producers and has widely opened the door to the entry of foreign products and chain stores, which politicians, misleading the public, call investments,"" the party states.

8. Combined List - Latvian Green Party, Latvian Association of Regions, Liepaja Party

In May 2024, the Combined List would receive support from 5.7% of voters. This party still puts emphasis on three-level defence: economic, civil and military. The economic section of the party's campaign mentions ""Decisions on greater strategic autonomy of the EU in the production of products such as microchips and the development of digital and artificial intelligence technologies will provide greater opportunities for Latvian companies"", as well as ""changes in banking policy in favor of the military industry, new requirements for banks, as favorable conditions as for environmental and climate goal projects"". But in agriculture, according to the party's campaign, each participant has his or her own role - ""large producers ensure the security of supply and strategic stocks, small and medium-sized - the viability of rural areas, the preservation and diversity of the national cultural heritage, the ability to provide for themselves and their family.""

The Combined List also stresses that a civil society is one of the pillars of security. ""An empty border and people who feel forgotten are a security threat.""

Regarding military security, the program emphasizes that ""the EU's border with aggressor countries should become military infrastructure, close, closed hybrid warfare and provocation efforts.""

9. Progressives

5.9% of Latvian residents with voting rights would vote for this party in May. The motto of this party is: ""Belonging in Europe. Protected in Latvia.""

The party believes that ""Latvia should take charge to make sure Europe is unified in its security both in the physical and virtual space, and so that we have military, cyber security and team skills."" The party also stresses that the EU needs to provide Ukraine with all the necessary political, military and humanitarian aid; rapidly move towards Ukraine's accession to the EU and ""support Moldova and Western Balkans on their path to joining the EU. We also need to support the democratisation of Belarus.""

Progressives promise to lower the use of fossil fuels, cease imports of gas from Russia, introduce a single formula for calculating a dignified minimum wage and pension, to introduce a single EU unemployment benefit, as well as to extend the EU's responsibilities in medicine by transferring the licensing and procurement of medicines to a central institution.

The party's campaign also includes advocacy for marriage equality across the EU, a desire to strengthen EU requirements for tackling the gender pay gap, as well as the inclusion of people with disabilities in the labour market, the creation of group housing, support for families and independent living.

10. People Power

This political party has support from only 0.6% of voters in Latvia. The party's campaign starts off with a rhetorical question: ""Has Latvia's voice been heard at least once and its sovereignty strengthened? Are the national needs of Latvia taken into account? No. Only poor gifts instead of social security. Instead of economic development and jobs we see only foreign decisions and foreign goods."" The party declares: ""The People's Power enters EP elections with confidence that Latvia needs to maintain its national interests policy. We support free, safe, independent and developed Latvian state in the EU!""

11. Movement ""For!""

The party, according to SKDS, had the support of 0.8% of voters in Latvia in May 2024. The motto of this party in the upcoming EP elections is: ""Safe Latvia. Free Ukraine. United Europe.""

The party stresses: ""Our vision is a safe Latvia and a free Ukraine in a united Europe. To achieve this, Russian aggression must be stopped. Our long-term security requires the integration of a reformed Ukraine into a transformed European Union within the next decade.""

The political party claims there are clear principles the EU and Ukraine have to change in order to implement the grand strategy - security through expansion.

12. Sovereign Power

2.8% of voters would cast their votes for this party in May. The party mentions in its campaign that traditional families have to be a priority group above the interests of any other group. The foundation of a traditional family is the union between a man and a woman. The Party also promises to raise the issue of the withdrawal of the European Union Member States from the Council of Europe convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence because of the ideology of this Convention. The party stresses the need to stop wasting resources on various gender equality programmes and climate neutrality ideas.

This political party's programme also mentions that Green Course with its humiliation of farmers is a path that leads to food crisis not just in Europe. The party is ready to ""defend our country's food providers at European level: farmers, livestock farmers, poultry farmers, fishermen,"" as well as advocate for full-cycle production processes in Latvia, supporting entrepreneurs with motivating tax policies.

13. People. Land. Statehood

According to results of the survey, 0.4% of voters in Latvia would support this party.

This party believes Latvia's security can be guaranteed only through strong trans-Atlantic cooperation as part of NATO. Defence expenditure for us as a small country ""must be focused on the development of the defence technology sector: drone and high-tech air defence systems - robots, artificial intelligence - as well as the development of military logistics in the coastal ports of Kurzeme"".

The political party also notes that ""we have to stop hosting economic refugees and invest European Union funds in refugee centers in regions with refugee-related civilizations and climatic conditions similar to the country of residence.""

In turn, the main prerequisite for Latvia's development is an increase in the R&D budget to at least 3.5% of GDP, reaching the level of the Nordic countries, as this would allow Latvian universities from the best universities in the EU and the world to attract the most outstanding scientists.

The party also points out that, in general, the practice of centrally deciding on issues should be reduced, leaving more issues to the competence of the member states. It is necessary to review the impact of the already adopted regulations on the Latvian economy.

14. Union of Greens and Farmers

The example of ZZS confidently demonstrates that there is far from an equal sign between the choice of voters in the elections to the European Parliament and the Saeima. In the survey on support for various political parties conducted by SKDS on behalf of the LTV in April this year, ZZS with 7.6% support came in second place. In turn, in the survey on the European Parliament elections, which was conducted by SKDS on behalf of the LTV in the period between the 10th and 15th of May, ZZS received only 2.9% of voters' support.

The party's promotion campaign for EP elections lists: it is necessary to return to the founding ideals of the EU, emphasising human needs rather than bureaucratic demands. At the heart of European legislation there must be a logical approach. ""European regulation must take into account the specifics of each member state, confirming that Europe is united in its diversity and recognises the uniqueness of each member state, the party states.

As its main priority, ZZS mentions the security of Latvia and Europe. To accomplish this, the party says it is necessary to focus on the reinforcement of external borders, which requires tighter cooperation between the various member states. ""When developing a common European policy on Russia's economic embargo, it is necessary to clearly define the position on the import and transit of goods, including food, from aggressor countries,"" the party states. When it comes to energy independence, Latvia must use EU funds to prevent the shortage of electricity generation capacity, which would allow to reduce electricity costs.

The second cornerstone of the ZZS programme is the representation of the interests of farmers. The political force insists on the need to complete the alignment of area payments, to strengthen the short food supply chains of local producers, to increase EU support for the development of organic farming in Latvia. ZZS also promises to encourage a review of the requirements for granting support to meet the specifics and realities of Latvia.

As for the economy, ZZZ points out that ""economic justice in Europe should be universal, not shared between the old and the new member states"". In turn, Europe's high internal standards should be extended to imports from third countries.

15. New Unity

While at the beginning of the year no one had any doubts about New Unity as the leader of EP elections in Latvia, the various scandals that had surfaced over the past several months have severely impacted this party's popularity. Despite this, however, 8.1% of voters in Latvia would still vote for them, putting the party in 2nd place popularity-wise.

Members elected from the political force in the current parliamentary term are members of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats). For these EP elections, the motto of the ""New Unity"" programme is: ""Safe Latvia in a united Europe"". The political force emphasizes that ""at a time when Russia continues its brutal war against Ukraine, the unity of the EU is more important than ever"". The party association ""consistently and strongly advocates the provision of all types of support -- political, economic, financial and military -- to Ukraine, as well as strong sanctions against the aggressor state called Russia,"" the programme states.

Freedom, democracy and the rule of law are seen by the New Unity as the main cornerstones of the values on which the entire EU is based. The political force also expresses its support for the enlargement of the EU to include new members.

The party believes it is necessary to develop a European economic security strategy - assessing and addressing the risks posed by investment in Europe by companies from unfriendly countries; combating malicious information manipulation by third countries by providing EU funding to promote civic resilience; develop a common policy on AI threat reduction and legal regulation; put into practice a common migration and asylum system that works quickly, fairly separates refugees from economic migrants.

When it comes to economic issues, New Unity promises to work hard ""in order to have an adequate amount of funding available to Latvia in the next EU multi-annual budget, also for the implementation of cohesion policy, the completion of the European railway line ""Rail Baltica"", the implementation of the green and digital transformation of the economy, as well as the development of our regions and rural areas.""

16. For Stability!

3.7% of voters would be ready to cast their votes for ""Stability!"" if elections were held in May. The motto of this party's programme is ""Political and economic independence in Europe"". ""For stability!"" believes: ""The policies implemented by the European Union today, which have a direct impact on Latvia, are practically incompatible with the development of the country and a prosperous future."" According to the Party, the future of the country is threatened by ""total economic poverty, bankruptcy of entrepreneurs, immigration policy, the absence of a children's program, artificially inflated taxes and prices on energy resources"". Therefore, the party also assumes responsibility ""to talk about"" prohibited"" issues and ""closed"" topics"".

The programme of this party has separate sections devoted to electricity, gas, banking, and sanctions issues. Here are some of the party's offers: reviewing and lowering the electricity price algorithm to the actual cost price; initiating the issue of exiting the European Nord Pool Group exchange; stopping the purchase of gas through intermediaries at artificially higher prices.

In the ""Sanctions"" section of this party's campaign, the party (albeit in a rather veiled form) invites to buy cheap energy without intermediaries from Russia, because the goals of the sanctions have not been achieved and ""Russia continues its development, operates successfully in international markets and European markets in an open manner with the help of intermediaries"".",bnn-news.com,news,"Baltic News Network - News from Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia",,0.4039215686274509,453904373,13,https://bnn-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/ImportedPhoto.737889904.942534-2-696x465-1.png,

The 600 MW figure, meanwhile, corresponds to a pipeline of several projects at different stages of planning, which are expected to enter the 'ready-to-build' phase between 2024 and 2026.

Nordic countries are increasingly committed to PV as a complement to their existing, largely wind-driven energy systems. The Nordic region offers a vast amount of available land, coupled with unique solar irradiation conditions: more daylight hours on summer days, greater intensity of solar irradiation and the reflective properties of snow as a multiplying factor for this irradiation. Furthermore, the efficiency of PV solar cells improves in cold environments. Finland is also particularly attractive as a pioneer in clean energy, as its electricity generation is already mostly fossil-free.

As part of its dedication to leading the global transition to a more sustainable energy future, FRV has accelerated its growth strategy in recent years with the construction of more than 50 renewable energy production plants across Spain, Australia, Mexico, Italy, the UK, Armenia, and Jordan.

Agreement marks first entry to the Nordic market for FRV. FRV and Will & Must will develop a pipeline of several photovoltaic projects that are expected to enter the ""ready to build"" phase within three years.

Finland: Fotowatio Renewable Ventures (FRV), a leading developer of sustainable energy solutions and part of Jameel Energy, has announced its entry into the Finnish market with local operator Will & Must.

Together, FRV and Will & Must will develop a pipeline of several photovoltaic projects which will have a total capacity of 600 MW. These projects are expected to enter the ""ready to build"" phase over a period of three years, between 2024 and 2026.

FRV's expansion to Finland marks its first entry to the Nordic countries and highlights its commitment to building a more sustainable future by partnering with industry experts, such as Will & Must, to introduce innovative renewable projects that support the clean energy transition. It follows FRV's expansion to the German market last year, where it aims to provide 800,000 homes with solar energy.

Andrea Fontana, Managing Director of FRV Europe said: ""We are delighted to offer our international experience and expertise in promising new markets, such as Finland. This is one of the most promising markets for renewable energy and we are convinced that our offerings will be in high demand.""

Matti Parpala, Mikke Vepsäläinen and Anssi Voipio, the founding team of Will & Must commented: ""We are excitedly looking forward to cutting Finland's emissions and rapidly boosting the overall green transition together with FRV, which brings to the emerging Finnish photovoltaic market an unparalleled amount of experience in large-scale projects. This way, we hope to demonstrate the benefits to local landowners and communities, which in turn should ensure social acceptance so that the projects can be efficiently constructed.""

But change is coming.

We now face a rapidly deepening commitment to the nuclear industry, through nuclear submarines (bipartisan support) or nuclear reactors (Coalition support).

The Albanese government was quick to accept the Coalition's AUKUS deal, which looks likely to bring the first nuclear-powered submarine to our ports in about eight years.

Nuclear subs offer strong military deterrence. But they come with a hard problem: how to manage the especially nasty radioactive waste at the end of a submarine's life.

Last night, Opposition Leader Peter Dutton pulled both together in his budget reply speech, asking:

Why is the technology which is safe for our submariners unsafe for our citizens?

The Coalition is giving us clear indications it will take a plan to build nuclear power stations to next year's election, though it is coy on where.

That would face a string of hurdles, not just changing Commonwealth and state laws currently banning nuclear power, but also needing to find communities willing to have a nuclear reactor. Like it or not, nuclear is appearing in Australia's future for the first time.

How did we get here?

Nuclear power has never been cost-effective in Australia. When the industry was starting in the US and UK in the 1950s, each Australian state had its own power grid, each too small scale for nuclear reactors.

The short-lived Gorton government proposed one on Commonwealth land at Jervis Bay, but the tenders for the project showed it was uneconomic.

Worldwide, the disastrous nuclear accidents at Chernobyl in 1986 and Fukushima in 2011 have led to understandable resistance from communities slated for a reactor.

Then there's the almost intractable problem of radioactive waste.

In Australia, successive governments have failed to find permanent storage for our low-level waste from nuclear medicine and research, much of it from the Lucas Heights research reactor. The most recent plan to store waste at Kimba, in South Australia, failed last year.

If this waste is buried under a few metres of earth, the radiation levels at the surface are not significantly above the background levels we all live with.

Even so, no community has yet been willing to have that waste buried in their area.

First Nations groups on remote Country are well aware of the damage done to people and natural areas by British nuclear weapons tests at Emu Fields and Maralinga in South Australia in the 1960s, so they are very reluctant to accept even low-level waste.

What's the issue with nuclear submarine waste?

Last year, Defence Minister Richard Marles said a waste dump would be located on current or future defence land. This might avoid some community pushback but is unlikely to quell fears.

This week, a Labor-chaired parliamentary committee called for the government to rule out accepting high-level waste from the submarines - specifically, the reactors and spent fuel from decommissioned submarines.

After fifty years of using this technology, many countries are still struggling with what to do with the resulting waste. Finland will soon open the world's first deep geological nuclear waste storage, a facility meant to last a million years. But countries such as the United States cannot find an acceptable location.

Because the submarine reactors use highly enriched, weapons-grade nuclear fuel, the waste is much nastier even than the ""high-level waste"" from nuclear power stations, with high levels of radioactive isotopes of cobalt and nickel.

Neither the US nor the United Kingdom have a long-term solution for dealing with their own nuclear sub waste.

Those countries could, under the wording of the draft AUKUS laws, argue for their waste to be stored in Australia, too.

This would be unpopular. When the 2016 South Australian Royal Commission proposed storing high-level waste from overseas nuclear power stations as a new source of revenue, a citizens' jury rejected the plan, concluding the risks were unacceptable.

Realistically, our government will do what US and UK governments have done for decades: store the waste temporarily and kick the can down the road.

What about nuclear power?

Since losing office in 2022, the Coalition has become pro-nuclear power. Political analysts see this positioning as a way for the Liberal and National parties to slow the renewable build, prolong coal power for the decades needed to build nuclear power, and attack Labor.

But while the politics are clear, the Coalition's position on nuclear is opaque.

For a few months late last year, the Coalition was in favour of ""small modular reactors"" rather than the expensive and slow-to-build large reactors built in the northern hemisphere. That plan ran into two problems. First, these reactors are still a gleam in the eyes of nuclear technologists. They do not yet exist. The American design promoted by the Coalition was cancelled due to cost blowouts.

The second problem is there really are economies of scale with nuclear reactors. France and the UK have concentrated on large reactors because doubling the size of reactors does not double the cost of generating electricity.

Even so, large reactors are now struggling to be economically competitive, even in countries such as France with significant cross-subsidies from nuclear weapons programs.

Old nuclear reactors which have written off the cost of construction are being closed because the operating and maintenance costs make their power more expensive than can be obtained from solar farms and wind turbines.

This year, the Coalition has switched back to old-fashioned large reactors.

Electricity from nuclear reactors costs three to four times as much as what can be provided by solar farms or wind turbines. Even adding storage to firm renewables leads to a price tag less than half that of nuclear. Reactors often take decades to build.

It is difficult to see the electoral appeal of a platform promising extra risks, more expensive energy and a slow build.

Where does that leave us? It's very unlikely Australia will ever have nuclear power. But it is very likely we will have to grapple with the spectre of high-level nuclear waste for the first time.",econotimes.com,news,EconoTimes,,0.1843137254901961,453892667,5,https://f1.econotimes.com/2024/05/0scxaw13tr_th_1024x0.jpg,eng-9584248

Previously I worked at Oxford, Cambridge, University College London, Alto University in Finland, on various energy, economics and policy-related subjects.

I'd like to clarify that the perspectives I express are my own as a researcher, and do not necessarily represent or reflect the official or unofficial stances or views of OFGEM, or the UK civil service.

Goal number 9 is about building a resilient infrastructure and promoting sustainable industrialization and fostering innovation.

So it has kind of three pillars: ifrastructure, industrialization and innovation.

For the infrastructure in SDG number nine, the three main themes are to provide transportation, information and communication infrastructures.

So these are the enablers for a sustainable development in industrialization and innovation.

You know, without transport, without information, and without communication, we can't enable economic activity, industry and innovation.

So these are the main pillars picked up by the SDG number 9.

I'm originally from Turkey. When I was a little child, Isaac Newton was my hero. That is why I was quite interested in physics. That was my favourite topic in the school.

And when I started university in Ankara, in the Middle East Technical University, I wanted to study electrical engineering, just to continue all this. Faraday's works, Maxwell's work, you know, I started being more and more interested in this electricity and energy fields.

At the age of 14, I gave a seminar on the the importance and future of nuclear energy to the city representatives in my city in Turkey.

So I was quite interested in energy related subjects. That's why I studied electrical engineering in Turkey.

Then, I wanted to do research and get into academia. That is why I moved to Finland to do my Masters and PhD, again in electrical engineering.

But when I finished my PhD, I said: ""Okay, this is a time for a bigger challenge to see, you know, to be exposed to the outer world.""

Because Finland is more of a reserved place. You know, well, it's a happy country. Yeah, everyone, let's say in my university, Aalto University, we were all electrical engineers.

Imagine a corridor. Forty people, they're all electrical engineers, and they look at the world from the same perspective, from the same window.

So I wanted to change that, to expose myself for differences and different, you know, problems, peoples, backgrounds.

That's why I moved to UK. And in Cambridge, I found exactly that sort of environment. I, for example, from this school of electrical engineering, I moved to business school, in Cambridge.

So in there I worked with business people, finance people, people from sciences, humanities, backgrounds, any backgrounds.

And I started working with companies, industry, the public authorities, the companies from all around the world, and getting questions from them. You know, a company approaches you and says: ""Okay, we have this problem. Can you do research for us?""

I say, ""Okay, yeah, we can do this. And we need these skills and experiences.""

They fund us. They go around our network, find the necessary skills. Altogether truly interdisciplinary research. We come up with answers. And we publish our answers. In a short time period, we can see the real impact in the world. And that is what motivates me the most, to see the impact what I do, what I publish in the end.

After that, I experienced the same thing in Oxford, now with the World Bank, EBRD, OFGEM, the civil service, we do regulations of policymaking, and everything we do, whatever we change, immediately, the next day, there's enough impact in the orders of hundreds of millions, even billions of pounds.

So this is quite, you know, tempting and motivating. And energy is the enabler of everything.

Sinan Küfeoğlu 05:54

The biggest infrastructure challenge, I think, as a power engineer, I can say the access to electricity, the power network.

Because power network, in my opinion, is the biggest engineering achievement of humankind to this date, because it enables other sectors and other economies to continue.

And five, seven years ago, in Cambridge, we published a paper on the future of power distribution in the world, and investigated what parts of the world has access to continuous power, what kind of netoworks they have.

So around 1 billion people in the world right now lack continuous power access.

And the concentration of these people are mainly in the Global South. So there is an equality problem as well, as well as technical problems of accessing electricity.

So in my opinion, this is the biggest challenge to provide electricity to everyone, so that they will have an economy, they can create jobs and businesses and they can sustain their more than social lives.

In addition to electric power, I can say, access to clean water and sanitation is another infrastructure problem.

Because it is necessary to, as I said, sustain daily lives of, you know, dignified human beings. And again, this concentration of lacking access to clean water and sanitation is almost geographically the same with the lack of access to power.

So these two are going you know, side by side, I think, in terms of challenges.

So solving one will naturally solve the other I guess, if the necessary actions are taken. As SDG number 9 reminds me of transportation, it says information and telecommunications.

But transportation wise, I think the world is at okayish levels. So we can connect and travel to all, to even the remotest areas in the world.

It is fine, I think. Information, well it comes to telecommunications and internet. Yes, we should just distribute the Internet to all regions in the world.

Some companies, you know, are doing this, some widespread big projects that are promising that anyone on Earth can access to internet. I hope that will work out.

In terms of telecommunications, 2G network is almost everywhere on Earth. But the adoption of 4G is slower and 5G is much lower. I'm sure those will increase in time as well, as we achieve 2G.

So, you know, information and telecommunications are okayish in terms of when you compare with other problems in the infrastructure.

Sinan Küfeoğlu 09:03

When we talk about infrastructure, everyone thinks of investments. What would happen in the future? What we should do more to add on top of the existing one. But people tend to miss the thing that the existing infrastructure is aging as well.

For example, in the energy network, the usual lifetime of you know, equipment is around like 50-60 years, if you're lucky, 70 depending on the quality of the manufacturing.

So replacing the existing infrastructure, the aging infrastructure, is another big challenge. I remember back in the day, we went to a factory in Turkey. I was in the university there.

And they wanted to change the electricity infrastructure to a new one, to a smarter one, you know, Smart Grid, Smart Energy Systems.

Yep. Popular ones, Let's do that. So that was the year 2010. We went to that factory. And I saw that the equipment for installed back in 1920s.

They were German-made, still working after 90 years, you see. But they had to be replaced maybe after 60 years. So they made it to 90 years. So these are huge costs, you see.

Sinan Küfeoğlu 10:22

In the developed world, while the infrastructure is ageing, and it needs to be replaced, this is the biggest challenge.

And the industry, it's transforming into, you know, more digitalized, more green industries, more sustainable.

Whereas in the developing countries, they still lack businesses infrastructure. So basic infrastructure should go there first.

I remember back in the day, we had a chat with the retired senior officer of one of the biggest oil companies in the world.

I asked him a question said that, you know, he gave a speech about sustainability. Imagine an oil company former CEO talking about sustainability. That's a bit ironic. I said, ""Okay, you say were going to create a sustainable world in the in the future."" And I said, ""In that sustainable world, there is no place for you, you know, oil companies. What are you going to do in terms of business.""

And he laughed at that bit and said, ""I understand your enthusiasm, young man, but about a billion people lack energy right now in the world. And we are the first ones, the oil and gas companies, to reach these people before the electricity goes to them.""

So you know, the industrialization, the needs, they change rapid, vary widely between geographies. I think when we talk about the challenges the solutions, we should we should address what we're talking about and where we're talking about.

Sinan Küfeoğlu 12:00

So, the solution for this industrialization challenge, the practical and sensible solution, would be to provide decentralized and smart systems to the developing countries, and less developed countries.

For example, these solar systems, you know, solar PV systems, together with energy storage assets, and clean water and sanitation assets, they could be deployed, so that these regions will have the sufficient amount of basic infrastructure to run their daily errands.

And these self-sufficient mini and micro infrastructure could be a solution in these underdeveloped regions.

As long as financing mechanisms exist and provided to these regions, that's another problem. We know financing mechanisms. For the developed world the challenge is digitalization and ageing infrastructure.

So in one hand, we are going to incorporate more digital solutions. In the other we are going to green it by decarbonizing it. In the meantime, of course, we will replace the ageing infrastructure with the new ones.

Sinan Küfeoğlu 13:24

We had this kind of a trend, maybe 20 years ago, saying that, ""Okay, let's decentralize everything, our energy systems. Why not go for micro grids, mini grids, self sustaining cities, self sustaining university campuses? Everything should be self sufficient.""

You have self-sufficient homes. These ideas emerged everywhere in the world. So we wanted to decentralize these power systems, for example. But after 20 years, two decades, when we see now that we are creating more bigger, gigantic centralized entities, rather than decentralization.

For example, it happened in the UK 20 years ago, when we're talking about mini grids, micro grids right now, we are creating this future energy system, future system operator.

So it's going to be bigger, heavier in terms of physics, and more, you know, authorities and technical capabilities will be concentrated on the centralized entity.

So everything is going for centralized entities. So that's, that's a kind of a big irony in the developed world. I think. that should be mentioned here.

Sinan Küfeoğlu 14:39

There are various innovation challenges. First, we can mention of this research and development expenditure.

Again, there's this inequality in the developed world. The, you know, a higher percentage of GDP is being spent for research and development.

Whereas in developing countries it is almost half of that, or maybe lower than half of that.

Similarly, the number of researchers and academic activities in the developed world is much, much, much higher than the developing countries.

So that means that the gap in between is going to get larger, bigger, when time passes. So, when we, you know announced these SDGs, back in 2015, the main idea was to support, you know, these developing countries so that there'll be more research and development innovation activities, so that the gap would be smaller.

But the numbers tell us exactly a different opposite way. So, more research and development activities are concentrated in the developed world, less in the developing world.

The other thing, in innovation, I think we should mention something really, really important here is the viability of innovation. Because the countries are, you know, funding the research work. Projects are the projects, and everything.

What I've witnessed in my professional career, I've been quite active in Brussels back in the day, attending, you know, European Commission meetings about funding announcements, all these you know, Horizon projects etc.

In many chats, I realized that they don't run proper return-on-investment analysis, cost-benefit analysis. So in the developed world, I can say that the biggest challenge with innovation is that people tend to use these buzzwords.

What are these buzzwords? Green, stainable, holistic approach, inclusive, circular economy. So as long as you bombard your research proposal, or, you know, innovation proposal with these words, you can easily sell it to people, to the funding authorities.

And those authorities don't measure the impact after that. Imagine, you propose a research project of five years, and you're funded less than 100 million euros.

And after five years, no one is asking how much of value you created. So how much of this money returned back to the society, returned back to the economies?

And I can give you two solid examples about this innovation challenge. The first one could be blockchain.

Five years ago, it was the biggest hype in the world, especially in the energy world. Everyone said, ""Oh, it's gonna decarbonize the whole world.""

We will say it. Blockchain is the hero. And many countries, primarily Germany, invested a huge amount of money in this in the sphere, funded projects, companies, startups.

But after five years, now we can see that most of those companies failed. They perished from the business world.

They couldn't create any real value. They couldn't create revenue streams. And what happened to those fundings? They are just gone, you see. Right now the similar thing is happening with hydrogen, similar big hype, it's going to decarbonize everything.

You're going to achieve net zero through hydrogen, and billions of euros are being spent everywhere, in North America, in Europe, even in Britain. But no one is actually, you know, asking the question: ""How much of this money is going to return back to the economies also societies as real real value?""

So I think in terms of innovation, when we talk about innovation, we should really highlight and underscore the term viability.

The SDGs are not solid or binding targets. Rather, these are accumulation of numerous recommendations and roadmaps. And so we don't have to achieve any solid targets by 2030.

They're not binding, or legally binding. So these are recommendations. But when we asked the questions, ""Will we achieve SDG number nine by 2030? The answer is yes and no. Both.""

Because some parts of the world you know, we already talked about the inequalities, you know the geographical differences, they're going to achieve it maybe some pas have already achieved this, you know, SDG number nine target sub targets, there are various sub targets in there, but some other parts of the world may be they will never achieve it.

What I can say from my kind of professional experience, the ship has already set sail. These SDG ships in particular as SDG number nine, yep, it's traveling now.

And it has a direction and ultimate kind of target It's going there. But the main question is who is traveling in the first class, and who is traveling below the deck below the engines, below the sea level.

So some peoples are traveling first class, some people just below the engine rooms. So that is the problem because after all, I'm an engineer, and I believe in science and engineering and I really, really believe in the potential in mankind.

I definitely think that that we are going to achieve these climate goals, the sustainable development goals one way or another, maybe in 2030, maybe in 2050.

But eventually, we will achieve these, but it's not going to be an equal journey for everybody.

Join us again next time when we look at Sustainable Development Goal number 10: to reduce inequality in and among countries. See you then",nature.com,news,Nature,,0.2784313725490195,453889966,33,https://media.nature.com/lw1200/magazine-assets/d41586-024-01462-1/d41586-024-01462-1_26652902.gif,

That is why a group of Finnish scientists set to work to create an alternative sand battery to solve their energy problems.

Finland's dependence on Russian gas has grown significantly in recent times, however, many are beginning to doubt that the supply will be stable for much longer, especially considering the intense war that broke out in Ukraine over its energy.

On the other hand, the aforementioned nation has recently experienced the cut-off of gas and electricity supplies by Moscow. This itself has been in abrupt response to Finland's request to join NATO.

These complex situations have generated great concern among politicians and Finnish citizens alike, who fear the possibility of running out of basic supplies such as electricity and water. Especially if this happens during the country's long and harsh winters.

Out of this dedicated problem, a small idea has emerged in western Finland that could have big results for the population at the energy level. A small power plant has been working on a never-before-seen solution that could alleviate these concerns among the people of Finland.

To solve these major problems facing the nation it could be very easy to install large photovoltaic plants and giant wind farms to generate power, however, there are major disadvantages associated with these well-known renewable energy sources.

The instability of these renewables can be a serious problem when it comes to implementation in a situation as delicate as the one faced by Finland. Let us remember that the aforementioned renewable energy sources depend entirely on a daily supply of sunlight and wind to function properly and provide basic services, something that cannot be guaranteed.

Well, in this technology there is a surprising element: approximately 100 tons of common sand, similar to that often used in the construction area, stored in a silo. These rough grains became a simple and inexpensive way to store energy.

In this project, instead of storing the energy obtained in normal batteries, they store it by heating sand to a very high temperature and using cheap electricity, i.e. electricity obtained from sources such as photovoltaic and wind fields. In this way they will eliminate once and for all the polluting and expensive lithium batteries by using a sand battery, providing a stable energy supply for several months.

The sand acts as a kind of heat reserve that can be maintained for a long time. When that energy is needed, the battery releases hot air to heat water, which is then used to heat homes, offices and even a local swimming pool. It's like storing heat in the sand and then using it when needed.

In short, the idea of using a construction sand battery to store thermal energy in Finland is like finding an ingenious and reliable solution to ensure that people's homes stay warm even in the coldest winters. It is a reminder of how ingenious inventions can be a great answer to challenges that may arise.",ecoticias.com,news,ECOticias.com,,0.1450980392156862,453816225,41,https://www.ecoticias.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/thermal-energy-sand-battery-polarnightenergy.com_.jpg,

From the mid-1960s through 2016, Colombia was torn by conflict between the government, leftist guerrilla movements and right-wing paramilitary groups. Now the government and rebels are working to carry out a sweeping accord that addresses many critical sectors, including environmental damages and restoration.

University of Notre Dame researchers Richard Marcantonio and Josefina Echavarria Alvarez study peace and conflict issues, including their effects on the environment. They currently are advising negotiations between the Colombian government and several rebel factions over wartime damage to soil, water and other natural resources. They explain that while Colombia's transition from war to peace has been difficult, the accord offers a model for addressing the ravages of war in places such as Gaza and Ukraine.

Is it common for peace settlements to address environmental harm?

Few agreements include environmental provisions, and even fewer see them carried out, even though research shows that many drivers of conflict can be directly or indirectly related to the environment.

We work with a research program at the University of Notre Dame called the Peace Accords Matrix, which monitors the implementation of comprehensive peace accords in 34 countries worldwide. Only 10 of the accords have natural resource management provisions agreements, and these typically have not triggered major steps to protect the environment.

Colombia's is seen as the most comprehensive peace accord that has been signed to date. It considers issues ranging from security to social justice and political participation, in great detail.

The accord acknowledges that a peaceful postwar society requires not only respect for human rights but also ""protection of the environment, respect for nature and its renewable and nonrenewable resources and biodiversity."" More than 20% of the commitments in the agreement have an environmental connection.

- Protecting environmental health through measures such as access to clean water

- Process issues, such as ensuring that communities can participate in decisions about rural programs and resource management

There also are gaps. For example, many protected areas have been deforested for ranching and coca production in the postaccord period. And there are no provisions addressing toxic pollution, an issue other agreements also neglect.

Often there are power vacuums during transitions between war and peace, when government agencies are working to reestablish their operations. Natural resources and environmental health need protection during these phases.

In Sierra Leone, for example, resource extraction by foreign companies drastically ramped up immediately after the Lome Peace Agreement eventually ended that nation's civil war in 2002. Companies exploited a lack of governance and support in the rural areas and often mined metals illegally or hazardously without any regulatory oversight. Today these areas still struggle with mining impacts, including contaminated drinking water and fish, the primary protein source in the area.

The damage is vast: There's air, water and soil contamination, deforestation and enormous quantities of waste, including ruined buildings, burned-out cars and thousands of tons of destroyed military equipment. Russia's destruction of the Kakhovka Dam flooded villages, destroyed crops and wrecked irrigation systems.

The cost estimates are staggering. A joint commission of the World Bank, the government of Ukraine and other institutions currently estimate direct damages at roughly US$152 billion.

In addition, cleaning up sites, rebuilding infrastructure and other repairs could cost more than $486 billion over the next decade, as of late 2023. That figure rises every day that the war continues.

There's broad interest in a green and sustainable reconstruction that would include steps like using sustainable building materials and powering the electricity grid with renewable energy. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been adamant that Russia must pay for the damage it has caused. It's still unclear how this would work, although some U.S. and European lawmakers support seizing frozen Russian assets held in Western banks to help cover the cost.

There is a legal basis for holding Russia accountable. In 2022, the U.N. General Assembly adopted a set of principles for protecting the environment during armed conflicts. Among other existing statutes, they draw on a protocol to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 that prohibits using ""methods or means of warfare which are intended, or may be expected, to cause widespread, long-term and severe damage to the natural environment.""

There has been only modest discussion so far of how to integrate these principles into a formal peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia. But a working group that included Ukrainian and European Union officials and former leaders from Sweden, Finland, Ireland and Brazil has recommended a framework for addressing environmental damage and holding perpetrators accountable.

What environmental impacts are known or asserted in Gaza?

Environmental damage in Gaza also is devastating. The U.N. estimated in early 2024 that over 100,000 cubic meters (26 million gallons) of untreated sewage and wastewater were flowing daily onto land or into the Mediterranean Sea.

Gaza's drinking water system was insufficient before the war and has been further weakened by military strikes. On average, Gazans now have access to about 3 liters of water per person per day - less than 1 gallon.

Thousands of buildings have been destroyed, spreading hazardous materials such as asbestos. Every bomb that's dropped disperses toxic materials that will persist in the soil unless it's remediated. Simultaneous environmental and infrastructure impacts, such as water and power shortages, are contributing to larger crises, such as the collapse of Gaza's health care system, that will have long-lasting human costs.

How can future peace accords address these impacts?

Integrating the environment into peace accords isn't easy. Resources such as energy, clean soil and water are vital for life, which is precisely why military forces may seek to control or destroy them. This is happening in both Ukraineand Gaza.

Peace negotiators tend to focus on social, political and economic issues, rather than environmental reparations. But leaving environmental damage unresolved until after a peace accord is signed keeps people who have been displaced and marginalized by conflict in precarious positions.

It may even cause fighting to resume. According to the U.N. Environment Program, at least 40% of all wars within states in the past 60 years have had a link to natural resources. In those cases, fighting was twice as likely to resume within five years after conflict ended.

First, it's important for accords to recognize environmental harm as one of war's main consequences and to acknowledge that a healthy environment is essential for sustainable livelihoods and peace.

Second, connecting environmental provisions with other issues, such as rural reform and political participation, can create better, more sustainable and equal conditions for reestablishing democracy. The Colombia accords are an example.

Third, it is important to clearly define goals, such as what infrastructure and institutions need to be rebuilt, who is in charge of getting those tasks done, and the timetable for doing it. This can help ensure that environmental restoration doesn't become a secondary goal.

Fourth, the international community has an important role to play in monitoring and verifying environmental restoration and providing financial and technical support. Foreign donors have already pledged $66 billion for rebuilding Ukraine and have said that they will require grantees to follow strict environmental standards in order to receive financing.

Reconstructing nations and simultaneously regenerating communities and ecosystems after wars is a daunting mission, but it's also an opportunity to build something better. We see Ukraine and Gaza as potential test cases for addressing war's toll on the environment and creating a more sustainable future.

European hydrogen production can be set up very well in the southern countries of Europe, especially in countries like Spain and Portugal, due to very good solar resources. But it can also be established in the North Sea area and in the Scandinavian countries, where wind conditions are good.

This study takes the results of the previous study ""Specification of a European Offshore Hydrogen Backbone"" and deepens them for the Baltic Sea region. In the previous study, the aspect of determining the production potential for the Baltic Sea region was not the focus of the investigation - this gap is closed with this study. This analysis focuses therefore on the potential for hydrogen production in the Baltic Sea region, especially in Sweden and Finland.

These Scandinavian countries could potentially offer good conditions in this context. Both countries only have a small share of fossil electricity generation and are already generating electricity primarily from low carbon sources such as hydropower, renewables (mainly wind) and nuclear energy. In addition, the large and sparsely populated areas in both countries provide a significant potential for additional on- and offshore generation from wind energy sources. Hydrogen production from renewable energies could therefore potentially be less in conflict with the use of electricity generation for electricity demand, although this will depend on national renewable energy plans.

Being part of the EU and, in the case of Finland, NATO, these countries are also ideal cooperation partners. Lastly Scandinavia has, next to its wind resources, the advantage that it is not affected by droughts like the southern countries, so that water is more easily available as a starting point for electrolysis",energycentral.com,news,Energy Central,,0.2549019607843137,453797824,17,https://energycentral.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_meta/public/ece/node_main/2024/5/bhob.jpg?itok=O6yUDq39,

Ralph Cassar believes the strongest message voters disillusioned by politics can give is to ""vote green"" because not voting does not worry the big parties.

""Not voting is not a message to the Labour and Nationalist parties; it does not worry them because the choice will still be made,"" he says. ""The strongest message is to vote green because we have shown consistency and done politics seriously for years.""

This is the message Cassar delivers at the tail end of a 30-minute interview in which he defends green politics and addresses the perception that it is socially and economically detrimental to ordinary people.

Cassar insists climate change is a reality that will not go away and its impacts are being felt everywhere by ordinary people. Transitioning to a more sustainable green economy is a must, he argues but insists it has to be socially just.

He cites as an example the blanket subsidies on fuel and electricity, which ADPD has opposed. Cassar says the blanket provision simply ""encourages waste"" and benefits most those who use most.

""Of course, there should be subsidies on the amount of energy needed to live comfortably, but should someone who lives in a small apartment who has only one airconditioned room subsidise someone who has 10 rooms all with ACs running 24 hours a day? This is squandering of tax money,"" he tells me.

The the millions spent on subsidies should have been spent on alternative modes of public transport, support for those with mobility issues and investment for a quicker transition towards more domestic renewable energy sources, he says.

When I ask him about the pushback towards green policies across the EU, Cassar blames this on the European People's Party that abandoned the Green Deal when it saw the popular mood on the continent shift.

""Instead of trying to strengthen the European social fund to support the transition, they [EPP] simply changed course because they do not have strong [green] principles... In Malta, the PN was proposing in parliament a motion to declare a climatic emergency but in the European Parliament the EPP was doing otherwise,"" he says.

The following is an excerpt from the interview.

Watch the full interview on maltatoday.com.mt, Facebook and Spotify

It has not been a good year for the European Greens both on national level in different member states and in Europe with a pushback against several environmental regulations the party was supporting. What caused this?

The environment refers to our quality of life. It is something that impacts us in our daily lives... five years ago, because the wind was blowing in that direction, the biggest political party in the European Parliament, the European People's Party (EPP), and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen had embraced the Green Deal. Instigated by the climatic crisis, this led to several initiatives being taken that improved everyone's lives across Europe. We then had the disruption caused by the pandemic and when the CDU (Christian democratic party) in Germany started seeing that there was growing resistance to some measures, instead of trying to strengthen the European social fund to support the transition, they simply changed course because they do not have strong [green] principles. It is the EPP, the political family to which the Nationalist Party belongs, that changed its position according to how the wind was blowing. In Malta, the PN was proposing in parliament a motion to declare a climatic emergency but in the European Parliament the EPP was doing otherwise.

But the climatic emergency did not go away and we continued seeing rivers drying up or overflowing... nonetheless why did ordinary people push back against the Green Deal? Somewhere, something went wrong.

These are short term considerations. First there was the crisis caused by the pandemic and on top of it the changes that needed to happen. The EU is still too much focussed on market spending suffice to say that 38% of its budget is spent on so-called farming, which is nothing more than financing of large multinational companies that produce pesticides, and there is not enough focus on the social aspect of policies...

Farmers were among those protesting against the Green Deal, including in Malta.

Maltese farmers are right to protest but some of the European farming lobbies represent the agroindustry and are not real farmers. These industries want the status quo. They want us to continue destroying the land with pesticides; they want us to have very cheap food in terms of production while farmers take nothing [from the profits they make]... It is the EPP that supports the agroindustry; we support genuine farmers...

Ordinary people often view the transition to a green economy as being a burden on them because of higher taxes... just look at the higher cost to import goods in Malta by ship as a result of the new emissions tax on shipping introduced in January.

[The emissions trading scheme] has been discussed at least since 2010, so when the Maltese government gives the impression this happened overnight [it is wrong]; we could have prepared for this change for the past 15 years... The Maltese government could have negotiated a transition. I agree with an emissions trading scheme because it benefits us; it benefits the people of Birżebbuġa. This is pollution that is not visible to the naked eye but which is killing people. Around Europe, some 300,000 people die every year because of pollution. As for the price increases, every container carries around 20,000kg, so even the price increases divided by the weight works out at less than a mil per kg. It is not the emissions trading scheme that is causing price hikes in food imports but the savage market that also speculates on food...

Over the past two years, government has been subsidising electricity and water bills and fuels. ADPD came out against the subsidy on fuels; isn't this another case where ordinary people will be made to shoulder a heftier burden if the subsidy is removed?

The biggest beneficiaries from the fuel subsidy are those who burn and waste a lot of fuel. If we want to reduce pollution, the subsidy on fuels could have been invested on alternative transport systems; it could have been spent on the creation of a bus rapid transit system. It could have been spent on those who having mobility issues and require specific transport to get around. We are against blanket subsidies that benefit everyone irrespective of how wasteful they are in the use of fuel. The same can be said for electricity prices. Of course, there should be subsidies on the amount of energy needed to live comfortably, but should someone who lives in a small apartment who has only one airconditioned room subsidise someone who has 10 rooms all with ACs running 24 hours a day? This is squandering of tax money... Subsidies could have been spent on a quicker transition towards renewable energy produced locally...

Do you agree with a one-size-fits-all Europe?

No, I do not agree with a one-size-fits-all Europe but we must not use this as an excuse not to change or to justify what is bad and low standards.

What are Europe's biggest challenges in the next five years?

It depends on which part of the continent you live. For us who live on the southern periphery of the continent, the challenge will depend on what happens in north African countries like Libya. Somebody living in Finland does not experience the challenges that may arise by what happens in Libya. Likewise, we do not feel the same panic that others living in countries bordering Ukraine and Russia are feeling... I cannot fault them for having this sense of fear and unfortunately this will shift the focus on arms spending. The fear risks opening the doors to more militarisation but I am not in a position to tell these people not to worry.

How do you find a balance in these circumstances because the issue of defence and security has surfaced in this electoral campaign, even in Malta?

It is a difficult discussion to have. But sometimes in Malta we do forget things. Despite our neutrality, we had for many years an Italian military mission based here that offered technical assistance; Malta's guarantors for neutrality were Libya and Algeria on one side and Italy and France on the other side. Being neutral does not mean not taking care of your own defence needs... on a European level Malta should be included in defence discussions; we should be involved and then it is up to us to decide to what level our contribution should be...

Why should people choose ADPD on 8 June?

People should choose green because it is the colour of progressives and environmentalists in this election.

Or follow us on Google News!

Let's start with some brief history on the transition to EV sales, and then get to the big topic: transitioning the ICEV (internal combustion engine vehicle) fleet to electricity.

EVs were only a small fraction of total vehicle sales back then and had little part in this phenomenon. It was quite the surprising development when, within a growing world population and a growing world economy, world vehicle sales started to go down.

I won't delve here into the intricacies of ""Peak Car,"" and the debate of whether this downturn will be permanent or not. Personally, I think it won't, but I wouldn't be confident enough to bet on it. No, what matters here is that because this happened during a technological transition, it meant that if the time ever comes when vehicle sales once again rise, they will most certainly not be ICEVs, but instead BEVs (and, to a lesser degree, PHEVs). Which brings us back to the subheading above. It is a given that by now we've surpassed peak ICEV sales.

The path to peak ICEV fleet is a different matter. We may be close to it, but the path may yet be longer than expected. Nobody can see the future, but the current trends provide some insights to make reasonable guesses, and that's what this article will try to do.

Oh, and I will consider traditional hybrids, mild hybrids, and non-plug-in EREVs as ICEVs. If it doesn't have a plug, then I'm not counting it as an EV. I will also exclude two- and three-wheelers to keep at least a semblance of simplicity.

It is one thing to analyze a local -- or even regional -- market: to do so, one may look at things like economic development, generational and demographic trends, and urbanism. But to analyze all 190+ of them in one sitting requires a different approach. One must go to the basics.

And, in its most basic form, to calculate the moment when we will reach peak ICEV fleet is quite simple: one must simply add new cars into the fleet, then subtract the ones being scraped. As the latter number may be hard to calculate, one could indirectly calculate the approximate number of scrapped vehicles in any given year by the average time a vehicle lasts.

It stands to reason that the lower the average life of an ICEV, the faster that we will reach peak ICEV Fleet. However, to calculate this average life is hard, as various sources present numbers that go from 11 years in some countries (Belgium) to 23 years in others (Australia, Finland). As new vehicles have increased in price and sales have stalled, average lifespans have also increased in many -- probably most -- markets around the world. Regardless, the first thing to do is to look to ICEV sales during the last 25 years. Information was not available for every year, so in years prior to 2005, vehicle production was used instead, which should be a close approximation to total sales.

It is important to point out that a large part of the growth seen above had to do with one specific market: China, which went from ~5 million vehicles a year in 2005 to 25 million in 2019 and 30 million in 2023. Other large developing markets such as India (~1.5 million in 2005, ~5 million in 2023) and Indonesia (~500,000 in 2005, ~ 1 million in 2023) have not grown at similar rates nor present similar potential, except perhaps for India.

Looking at the data, it's evident that the post-pandemic recovery in the vehicle market has been almost exclusively led by plug-ins, and that ICEVs have been stagnant since 2020. Furthermore, if we trace a line from 2023's level, then we can see that it roughly intersects with 2011's sales number:

This means that the same number of gasoline and diesel vehicles were sold in 2023 as were sold in 2011. In this case, if our average lifespan for a vehicle was 12 years, this would mean that in 2023, no additional ICEVs entered the fleet, because the ones scrapped roughly matched the ones being purchased. Under these conditions, should ICEV sales maintain, the ICEV fleet would reduce continually for the next 8 years, stabilizing somewhere around 2032.

But if you're here at CleanTechnica, you probably know already that ICEV sales are not going to sustain current levels. Just in 2024, estimates point to an increase of 2-3 million in the total vehicle market, whereas the EV market should increase by 3-6 million. This means that in the best of scenarios for ICEVs, they barely maintain their current sales numbers; most likely, they will lose at least 2 million sales this year.

And it will only get worse, which means we're very close to peak ICEV fleet.

Our very own José Pontes recently published on LinkedIn that as far as light vehicles go, we've already passed peak ICEV fleet. Bloomberg also published that it already happened in 2023 ... but that is not including hybrids (also booming in sales) as ICEVs. The Rocky Mountains Institute meanwhile estimates 2025 will be the year.

What these estimates point to is that the average lifespan of vehicles around the world is closer to that of Belgium than to that of Australia. Regardless, we can play a bit with math and create different scenarios to calculate the possible outcomes. At its most basic, two variables define this problem: the number of vehicle sales in the future (EVs and ICEVs), and the average lifespan of ICEVs.

For the average lifespan, we can have two scenarios based upon the averages in different countries:

For the number of EVs and ICEVs sold worldwide, we will present four scenarios roughly in line with EV growth rates during the last few years and two different possibilities for total vehicle sales:

Under these assumptions, ICEV sales during this decade will look as shown below:

All scenarios show ICEV sales falling, but in Scenario A they still amount to 69 million in 2030, whereas in Scenario D they're below 30 million that year.

Scenario 1: average lifespan of 18 years

This is our ""pessimistic"" scenario. If ICEVs last longer, this means the fleet (and therefore fuel consumption) will last longer. In this case, we will be comparing our forecasts to sales 18 years earlier to find out the moment that fewer ICEVs were sold than 18 years ago, which would be the moment more of them were scrapped than entered the fleet.

In two of the four scenarios (B, C), this happens in 2028 (which, in this case, means the number of ICEV sales sits below the numbers from 2010). Meanwhile, in our most optimistic scenario D, this is reached as early as 2025 (when ICEV sales fall below the numbers from 2007). As for the most pessimistic scenario A, it takes until 2029.

Now, 18 years average lifespan for a vehicle may seem excessive, so let's move towards our most optimistic scenario:

Scenario 2: average lifespan of 15 years

This is our ""optimistic"" scenario because it means that ICEVs will be scrapped sooner. In this case, two of the four scenarios (B, D) get to this point in 2025 (which means fewer cars sold that year than in 2010). Scenario C is not far behind and reaches this point in 2026. Scenario A, once again the most pessimistic of the four, takes until 2027 to get to this point.

This analysis isn't too complex: it departs from the fundamentals and makes some basic assumptions I'd guess most of us agree on. Personally, given the rate of advancement batteries have had, I'd find it very unlikely for EV sales to be below 50% in 2030, but I chose 40% to present a more ""pessimistic"" perspective. However, if you find that I have a mistake or an invalid assumption, please do comment below to read your point.

What I find here aligns with what other institutions are saying and points to a stagnation of the ICEV fleet worldwide in the immediate term, and a quick reduction starting as early as this year, but more likely in 2025 or 2026. Of course, the ICEV vehicle fleet doesn't perfectly predict road fuel consumption, but it undoubtedly serves as a proxy for it, so we can conclude that demand for gasoline and diesel is very likely to start going down in the short term.

I don't believe developing economies will come to the rescue of ICEVs. India is the only big one growing fast enough to remotely compete with the China of the early 2000's, and even that's a stretch. Many developing economies have stagnant or even decreasing vehicle markets: Latin America, for example, reached its own peak car sales in the middle of the past decade, as the commodities cycle ended. Colombia's vehicle market now sits 45% below its peak in 2014, Brazil's has fallen 38% from its peak in 2012, and even Mexico, with an economy based upon industry and not commodities, presents vehicle sales 15% below their peak in 2016. And this is not including the rapid electrification we're seeing in several of these markets.

Worse even, many rapidly growing economies in Asia and Africa lack oil reserves and depend on costly imports to sustain their fleets (this includes India). These countries have strong incentives to promote EV use, and, so long as price parity is reached between EVs and ICEVs, they have all the incentives to restrict or outright ban ICEV imports. Some of them are already jumping the gun, as our colleague Remeredzai recently reported.

All in all, these are interesting times we're living in, and I'm pretty curious as to what 2024 will bring. I did want to make at least a rough calculation on when and how this change will come to be (there's also the incentive that, if I end up being right, I can pull this article up in a few years for bragging rights).

Dear EarthTalk: Could plain-ol' beach sand be the next frontier in renewable energy?

-- Paul C., Baltimore, MD

In our ongoing quest for sustainable energy solutions, innovative technologies are necessary to complement renewable sources like solar and wind power. One such potential breakthrough revolves around an unexpected but abundant resource: beach sand.

Sand batteries represent an emerging approach to energy storage, particularly effective in harnessing and retaining energy from intermittent sources like solar and wind. The physical properties of sand, such as its ability to store heat at high temperatures, make it an excellent medium for energy retention. This capacity is being leveraged by innovative technologies to create a more stable and reliable energy supply, as sand can efficiently accumulate and release heat as required.

The science behind sand batteries involves heating sand to high temperatures using surplus energy generated from renewable sources. This stored heat can then be converted back into energy when needed. This system capitalizes on the thermal properties of sand to create a natural battery that can offer both heating solutions and electricity generation. As National Renewable Energy Laboratory's (NREL) Patrick Davenport notes, ""Sand and concrete silos with refractory insulation are very inexpensive materials that can lead to low-cost energy storage."" A few key players currently pioneering this technology include Polar Night Energy in Finland, which has implemented a sand battery for residential and commercial heating, and EnergyNest in Norway, which specializes in thermal energy storage using similar principles.

Using sand for energy storage offers multiple benefits: it is abundant, low-cost, eco-friendly, and can store heat for long periods. This makes sand an attractive option for enhancing the stability of renewable energy systems, and providing a reliable energy supply even during times of low sunlight or wind.

Sand battery technology is currently being tested and used in various projects worldwide, not only demonstrating the viability of sand as an energy storage solution but highlighting its potential scalability and integration into existing energy infrastructures.

Despite the potential, challenges that include technical, economic and logistical hurdles that be addressed. Developing and deploying sand battery technology on a large scale requires significant research and development efforts. Additionally, the role of government and private investment is crucial in overcoming barriers and driving forward the innovation needed for widespread adoption.

Sand batteries are a promising solution for renewable energy storage, potentially revolutionizing how we store and utilize energy from renewable sources. Their ability to provide a stable, reliable energy supply could be a game-changer for the renewable sector.",goodmenproject.com,news,The Good Men Project,,0.5529411764705883,453688765,1,https://goodmenproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/keith-hardy-PP8Escz15d8-unsplash.jpg,

Trucks carrying badly needed aid for the Gaza Strip rolled across a newly built US pier and into the besieged enclave for the first time on Friday, as Israeli restrictions on border crossings and heavy fighting hindered the delivery of food and other supplies.

The shipment is the first in an operation that American military officials anticipate could scale up to 150 truckloads a day, all while Israel presses in on the southern city of Rafah.

But the US and aid groups warn that the floating pier project is not a substitute for land deliveries that could bring in all the food, water and fuel needed in Gaza.

Before the war, more than 500 truckloads entered the territory on an average day.

The operation's success also remains tenuous because of the risk of militant attacks, logistical hurdles and a growing shortage of fuel for the trucks to run due to Israel's blockade of Gaza since Hamas's October 7 attack.

Aid agencies say they are running out of food in southern Gaza and fuel is dwindling, while the US Agency for International Development and the World Food Program say famine has already taken hold in Gaza's north.

Troops finished installing the floating pier on Thursday, and the US military's Central Command said the first aid crossed into Gaza at 9am Friday.

It said no American troops went ashore in the operation.

""This is an ongoing, multinational effort to deliver additional aid to Palestinian civilians in Gaza via a maritime corridor that is entirely humanitarian in nature, and will involve aid commodities donated by a number of countries and humanitarian organisations,"" the command said.

""I do hope the whole medical team will continue to present its services to the injured people, to the critically ill patients, to the people who have chronic diseases.""

Most of it has seemed to miss the point. The Government blames a lack of oil and gas supply and Labour's banning of more licences for its exploration.

All of which have also ignored the fact that it is clear that burning oil and gas is a major contributor to global warming and all the ills that has brought us recently with billions of dollars cost to our economy with events such as Cyclone Gabrielle.

What is amazing is the fickle finger of blame has failed to point at one of the more pertinent causes of this problem: a maximising of profit-taking and lack of investment by the privatised energy companies.

Successive governments are not devoid of blame for this either, with them still holding 50 per cent shareholding in most of the privatised energy companies.

But where has been their leadership on the boards of directors in demanding to curb high-dividend payments and demanding decent investment in renewables?

Certainly the suggestion by feature writer Fran O'Sullivan (Weekend Herald, May 11) that we should move to a Singapore-style sovereign wealth fund such as Temasek would only exacerbate that malaise with control of government shareholding decisions put even further out of reach.

One cannot say that Prime Minister Christopher Luxon isn't enthusiastic about everything he believes in.

What is a problem though, as a former salesman, is does his being eager to please demeanour not leave him in a weaker negotiating position?

As for him reading up on world leaders, as quoted in the Audrey Young interview (Weekend Herald, May 11), that would make an interesting list along with what he gained from each one.

I can think of a few who were not the type I would not like to see emulated here. As for Ronald Reagan, he was very good at reading the scripts that were handed to him and was noted for taking afternoon naps.

To be fair the incumbent, Joe Biden, who Luxon wants this country to become pals with again, is more than likely to do the same. Perhaps Luxon should just work out his own version of that ""vision thing"" for we Kiwis that has more to offer than just tax cuts, locking up children, and generally punishing people for being poor.

Looking at the Government's recent poll results, we would do well to remember the Labour/Greens record.

Auckland was subjected to a four-month Covid lockdown, at the cost of $1 billion a week in lost productivity, to help contain a disease with a two-week incubation period, Many NZ citizens were unable to return to NZ under a poorly thought-out and resourced Covid quarantine protocol,

Government expenditure was nearly $80b over budget (most of it reactionary, not strategic), leading to the inflationary spike and current interest rate climate. Despite that, the amount of public housing actually delivered was a small per cent of that promised and numbers of homeless increased.

The approach to gangs was mostly carrot and hardly any stick, leading them to become emboldened, with retail and violent crime increasing.

NZ children's educational achievement levels in numeracy and literacy declined, while waiting lists in the public healthcare system increased. Concurrently, numbers of non-productive bureaucrats and public service contractors swelled at the expense of more teachers, nurses and police.

Chris Hipkins is right, we do deserve to be a first-world country. His coalition Government had six years to address the big issues and in most measurable metrics, made things worse.

We should, at the very least, give the current Government more than six months to address these issues before judging their performance.

Whilst I agree with most of what correspondent Andrew McCosh writes about the current voting process (Weekend Herald, May 11), I believe two very important considerations have been left out.

The first is compulsory voting with penalties applicable for those who don't, because under the current system it only takes a minority to decide how our country is run for the following three years.

Also, I believe that voting should be restricted to those who live in Aotearoa/NZ permanently. There are many ex-pat Kiwis living overseas with no intention of heading home, so why should they still be eligible to help dictate how our Government is formed? They are citizens in name only.

The only exceptions acceptable for people out of the country on polling day should be for those abroad on holiday or for work-related reasons. Measures could be taken to allow early voting for those so engaged.

These both, if entered into legislation, will give a more realistic assessment of the will of the nation. That's how democracy works best.

Perhaps a technical/financial perspective would be helpful. Our electricity system has a built-in bias toward brinkmanship.

Nobody wants to build power generation which is used for just a few weeks in a year. With increasing wind and solar generation this becomes even more pronounced, and throttling demand will get us only so far.

In the end we will have to pay not only for electricity, but also for a sufficient idle backup plant. This capacity charge is like an insurance premium, and part of a zero-carbon economy.

This is putting the cart before the horse; before having an electric car, we need spare electricity, 24/7, something that we seem not to have.

The Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority is busy recommending that we drop gas and use more electricity; while we remain critically short of electricity, this doesn't sound very logical.

I thought that the main idea of EVs was to lessen CO2 emissions, so why are we installing diesel-powered charging stations? To further compound all this madness it needs to be noticed that if we embrace the dream of zero greenhouse gas emissions, it will go unnoticed in the global scheme of things.

We need to accept that as a nation, we are inconsequential.

""Celtic Tiger"" is a term referring to the economy of Ireland in the mid-1990s until it fell into recession in 2008. ""Irish Celtic Tiger"" became an economic example of ""how not to do"" things and, when compared to other small Euro-zone countries, such as Finland and Belgium, the latter two far exceeded the physical wealth of Ireland because of their vastly superior transport infrastructure, telecommunications network and public services. ""Irish Celtic Tiger"" became an ""Irish Dodo"".

Now, Ireland's generous corporate tax regime has made it a hub for multi-national tech and pharmaceutical companies. These firms generate much of their income in Ireland, inflating its GDP, but they funnel that money to their headquarters (or shell companies) abroad.

It would appear to me that it has become a game of make a quick decision, wait for the firestorm and then apologise if it all backfires, which is certainly the case with respect to CBD parking. As in a similar way of using consultants, no one person is then responsible, or will take responsibility for the decision. But after it all dies down, rest assured, Auckland Transport will again in the near future come back again and reinstate the same parking policy, albeit in a slightly modified manner. I think that ratepayers have had enough of its CEO, who seems not to care at all about the citizens of this city. Time for him to find greener pastures perhaps.

June Sinclair (Weekend Herald, May 11) suggests that Christopher Luxon could instruct his accountant not to claim the rebate on the money donated from his salary increase. Many donors I know of claim the rebate and then redistribute it and it would be of far greater benefit to struggling charities if the PM did the same. Any food bank would be more than grateful.

Gavin Baker, Glendowie.

All I can say to you: do as we did eight years ago move out of Auckland and come down to Horowhenua Levin/Foxton. Easy living here and a great place to live. If you would like to talk about our area I would love to talk to you so make the move south now you won't regret it.

Gary Stewart, Foxton Beach.

Many people say that others should take more responsibility for themselves. If all the people asking for someone else to invest in more electricity generation to address a peak that occurs, on average, for one hour a year, invested in a solar generation with battery system that is typically self-funding, then the risk of such outages would be virtually eliminated and the country's energy resilience would be improved.

Jon Eriksen, Parnell.

Chris Hipkins slams the decision to reduce the cost of school lunches. No one is disputing that the Labour lunch system wasn't a good idea. But David Seymour copping criticism from Hipkins for trying to save money (or get better value for money) is ironic given Labour had not allowed any future funding for this.

Ian MacGregor, Greenhithe.

Shaun Johnson was injured during last Sunday's NRL match by a Sydney Rooster player who subjected him to a brutal ""tackle"" known as a chicken-wing, which is an illegal manoeuvre according to the NRL judiciary code. Why was that rooster not immediately removed from the game? If the roles were reversed we all know what would have happened, don't we?

Renton Brown, Pukekohe.

Perhaps Auckland Transport and Watercare should be renamed CoCos - Council Out of Control Organisations?

Bruce Tubb, Devonport.

There seem to be many people driving around Auckland with only their parking lights on at night and (even worse) at dusk. Do they not realise this is illegal? These lights are so dim as to be almost invisible and are designed to be used in dark streets with no street lighting to prevent your car from being struck.

Initially the outage was supposed to end on 8 April. Owner operator Teollisuuden Voima Oyj (TVO) said it was anticipated that the service outage after the first operating cycle ""would be very laborious"". OL3 is the largest nuclear power plant unit in Europe, and the amount of equipment and components is extremely high. All in all, about 7,500 work phases were carried out during the outage.

""In addition to refuelling, the most important activities carried out at OL3 during the annual outage included preventive maintenance on the protection system, washing of steam generators, generator maintenance, pressure equipment inspections, leak-tightness tests on containment isolation valves, and servicing of pressuriser safety relief valves,"" TVO said.

The annual outage was meant to take 37 days, but in the end lasted for about 74 days and 9 hours. ""Additional days were required due to the shutdown process and the preparations for refuelling taking longer than expected and as a result of technical problems identified during maintenance activities. Indications of a risk of foreign material in the fuel elements were also detected during the outage, and the inspections of the elements were therefore significantly more time-consuming than expected.""

Marjo Mustonen, Senior Vice President, Electricity Production, said many valuable lessons were learned during the service outage. ""The first annual outage at OL3 provided valuable knowledge about the duration of the various maintenance activities. We also gained a significant amount of data and maintenance experience which will benefit us in both the planning and the execution of future service outages. Cooperation with equipment manufacturers was another field where we gained experience.""

She added: ""Although the pressures were high, this has also proven how well our organization was able to respond to unexpected situations. All planned works were completed, and most importantly, safely. The main objective in every annual outage is its safe execution.""

OL3 produces about 14% of all electricity produced in Finland. Two of the three units in Olkiluoto have now undergone their annual outage. In addition to OL3, the refuelling outage at OL2 was also completed and the annual outage of OL1 has now begun and is expected to take about 15 days.",neimagazine.com,news,Nuclear Engineering International,,0.05098039215686279,453650018,9,,eng-9576567

The EU's gross domestic product (GDP) remained stable, registering just a small increase (0.2% in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared with the same quarter of 2022).

This information comes from data on quarterly estimates for greenhouse gas emissions by economic activity published by Eurostat today. Quarterly estimates of greenhouse gas emissions complement quarterly socio-economic data, such as GDP or employment. This article presents a handful of findings from the more detailed Statistics Explained article on quarterly greenhouse gas emissions.

In the fourth quarter of 2023, the economic sectors responsible for the largest reductions compared with the fourth quarter of 2022 were electricity and gas supply (- 17.2%) and manufacturing (-3.1%). Emissions by households remained almost stable.

Greenhouse gas emissions down in 22 EU countries

In the fourth quarter of 2023, greenhouse gas emissions are estimated to have decreased in 22 EU countries, when compared with the same quarter of 2022.

The largest reductions in greenhouse gases are estimated for Estonia (-23.0%), Bulgaria (-17.0%) and Finland (-9.0%).

Out of the 22 EU members that are estimated to have decreased their emissions, 10 also recorded a decline in their GDP (Estonia, Finland, Sweden, Germany, Austria, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, The Netherlands and Luxembourg). Hungary maintained the GDP at the same level while decreasing emissions. The other 11 EU countries (Bulgaria, Belgium, Czechia, Denmark, Italy, Spain, France, Poland, Portugal, Romania and Croatia) are estimated to have managed to decrease emissions while growing their GDP.

All countries belonging to the Group of Seven (G7) major democracies, apart from the United States, signed the letter, along with Australia, South Korea, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden and Finland.

The five-page letter comes as Israeli forces bear down on the southern Gaza city of Rafah as part of its drive to eradicate Hamas, despite warnings this could result in mass casualties in an area where displaced civilians have found shelter.

""In exerting its right to defend itself, Israel must fully comply with international law, including international humanitarian law,"" the letter said, reiterating ""outrage"" for the Oct. 7 Hamas raid into Israel which triggered the conflict.

Israel denies blocking humanitarian aid and says it needs to eliminate Hamas for its own protection.

The Western nations said they were opposed to ""a full-scale military operation in Rafah"" and called on Israel to let humanitarian aid reach the population ""through all relevant crossing points, including the one in Rafah.""

""According to UN estimates, an intensified military offensive would affect approximately 1.4 million people,"" the letter said, underscoring the need ""for specific, concrete and measurable steps"" to significantly boost the flow of aid.

The letter recognizes Israel made progress in addressing a number of issues, including letting more aid trucks into the Gaza Strip, the reopening of the Erez crossing into northern Gaza and the temporary use of Ashdod port in southern Israel.

But it called on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government to do more, including working toward a ""sustainable ceasefire,"" facilitating further evacuations and resuming ""electricity, water and telecommunication services.""

A consortium including US construction group Bechtel and US nuclear company Westinghouse has already proposed building a new plant on the Wylfa site using Westinghouse's AP1000 reactor technology. Wylfa's future would depend on a decision by GB Nuclear, the government quango which now owns the site, according to the FT. The Telegraph worries that the whole cost of the station could be added to the national debt if the government is the ultimate guarantor of the project.

The government has asked potential Sizewell investors to submit final bids before the summer as ministers want to reach a final investment decision (FID) by July. One industry figure said that while there had been conversations about announcing the FID by then, he was not sure that would be feasible.

An opinion piece on the City AM website says ""When fish can delay a nuclear power station, our animal obsession has gone too far."" Aside from the fact that decisions about the Acoustic Fish Deterrent haven't caused any delays, the story claims the AFD would only save 18 to 46 tonnes of fish per year -less than the annual catch of a single small fishing vessel. This is a serious underestimate of the numbers of fish affected - it is more likely to be thousands of tonnes a year. Even the Environment Agency says we are currently unable to agree with the calculated level of harm from removing the acoustic fish deterrent (AFD). So, you could say, when our obsession with building pointless nuclear power starts causing such huge damage to nature, that obsession has gone too far.

Despite the fact that Trawsfynydd has been ruled out of plans for new nuclear power stations, by Great British Nuclear (GBN), at least for now, Cwmni Egino, says there is still hope and it will continue to facilitate the future development of Trawsfynydd.

The UK Government is drawing up plans for a new nuclear power station in Scotland on the assumption that the SNP will lose the next Holyrood election in 2026. Although energy policy is reserved to Westminster, SNP ministers have made clear since they took power in 2007 that they would use their planning controls to block the construction of any nuclear plants. But Alister Jack, the Tory Scottish Secretary, told peers that he had asked the UK Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) to prepare for a nuclear plant to be constructed in Scotland after the 2026 election. The Scotsman published a letter from our editor, after their own rather silly editorial claiming opposition to nuclear is a stance that can longer be maintained.

Rishi Sunak's U-turns over net zero have delayed progress on vital infrastructure that is needed for economic growth, according to Sir John Armitt, the chair of the National Infrastructure Commission (NIC). He criticised failures to improve building energy efficiency, promote low-carbon heating and make the changes to energy infrastructure needed to enable the net-zero transition.

A Nuclear Waste Services Blog explains how nuclear waste is being spread around all over the country rather than being concentrated and contained. Treatment and disposal methods which lower costs are employed rather than placing the low-level waste in the Low Level Waste Repository near Drigg. Landfill, incineration, super-compaction, and metal reuse and recycling are some of the methods used.

The Government has now published its response to the ""Managing radioactive substances and nuclear decommissioning policy consultation"". The finalised document which replaces Command Paper 2919 and subsequent amendments and additions is also available now. The Telegraph explains that the plan now is to bury 5m tonnes of intermediate nuclear waste in a 650ft pit sometime this decade, but there is no site yet for such a facility. I could be a mine on a pre-existing nuclear site to minimise planning objections. The facility will be separate from the much deeper geological disposal site that will hold the UK's most dangerous waste. Ministers want to brand nuclear energy as a ""green"" and ""sustainable"" fuel, but the Committee on Radioactive Waste Management, have said such terms are misleading if there is no safe place to store radioactive waste. While a geological disposal facility is not expected to be ready until the 2050s, a shallower disposal facility - which is up to 200m below ground - could be available within 10 years.""

This includes investment into the creation of a regeneration power plant in Acone, said Gren Group business manager in Latvia Andris Vanags at a press-conference.

The planned regeneration volume in Acone is 150 000 to 200 000 tonnes annually. This can potentially generate electricity for 40 000 households.

Vanags explained the heat output of the power plant will be 50 to 70 MW, and the electric output will be 15 to 20 MW. Sorted waste and waste not eligible to recycling will be used as fuel. This fuel will be sourced locally - in Latvia.

When asked about the choice of area for the construction of the power plant, Vanags said the chosen territory has connections to infrastructure.

Vanags said the project's planning commenced this year. Soon it is planned to commence environmental impact assessment procedure. After that there will be a public discussion. Once all that is done, development, construction and commissioning of the new power plant will follow, concluding with start of operations in 2029.

The regeneration power plant will be constructed to make sure no smell escapes from it. The flue-gas cleaning system will be used to purify the flue-gases produced during the production process, ensuring significantly lower emissions than allowed by the applicable laws and regulations.

At the same time, the regeneration power plant will be fitted with a constant emission monitoring system to ensure constant control and accessibility of transparent operational indexes for society and controlling institutions.

One benefit of having a regeneration power plant in the area, according to Vanags, is ensuring competitive heating energy prices, new jobs, sustainable use of local resources, and provision of further development of the energy industrial zone.

Vanags also stressed the importance of strengthening energy security and independence, significant reduction of waste in landfills, cleaner environment, reduced greenhouse gas emissions and reduced need for more landfills.

Vanags also said Gren's regeneration power plant in Acone is the first private investment project does not require additional state or municipal financing.

Vanags explained the heating energy will likely be injected to the network of Rīgas siltums, because the demand for heating energy is high enough on the right bank of Riga to generate each MW of energy efficiently.

Gren Group business manager in Latvia explained that landfills in Latvia continue growing, but their capacity is limited. It can also be seen that the environmental system policy is moving towards a faster reduction of waste going to landfills.

Currently 45-50% or 300 000 to 400 000 tonnes of waste generated by households every year is stored in landfills.

""The volume of energy that remains idle, stored in Latvian landfills is equal to 1 TWh, which is worth approximately EUR 20 million,"" said Vanags.

Ilkka Niiranen, Managing Director of Green Group, explains that there are approximately 500 waste regeneration power plants in Europe. They help reduce the volume of waste in landfills.

Niiranen stressed regeneration is a major opportunity for Latvia, because it is one of the last countries in the EU in which waste regeneration is not used.

Gren Group wants to perform investments that would benefit society. The company believes the planned investments will help improve Latvia's energy security and reduce the use of fossil fuels, said Niiranen.

Gren develops and offers energy solutions for sustainable district heating and cooling, renewable and industrial energy services.

ROME (Reuters) - Israel must comply with international law in Gaza and address the devastating humanitarian crisis in the Palestinian enclave, a group of Western nations wrote in a letter to the Israeli government seen by Reuters on Friday.

All countries belonging to the Group of Seven (G7) major democracies, apart from the United States, signed the letter, along with Australia, South Korea, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden and Finland.

The five-page letter comes as Israeli forces bear down on the southern Gaza city of Rafah as part of its drive to eradicate Hamas, despite warnings this could result in mass casualties in an area where displaced civilians have found shelter.

""In exerting its right to defend itself, Israel must fully comply with international law, including international humanitarian law,"" the letter said, reiterating ""outrage"" for the Oct. 7 Hamas raid into Israel which triggered the conflict.

Israel denies blocking humanitarian aid and says it needs to eliminate Hamas for its own protection.

The Western nations said they were opposed to ""a full-scale military operation in Rafah"" and called on Israel to let humanitarian aid reach the population ""through all relevant crossing points, including the one in Rafah"".

""According to U.N. estimates, an intensified military offensive would affect approximately 1.4 million people,"" the letter said, underscoring the need ""for specific, concrete and measurable steps"" to significantly boost the flow of aid.

The letter recognises Israel made progress in addressing a number of issues, including letting more aid trucks into the Gaza Strip, the reopening of the Erez crossing into northern Gaza and the temporary use of Ashdod port in southern Israel.

But it called on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government to do more, including working towards a ""sustainable ceasefire"", facilitating further evacuations and resuming ""electricity, water and telecommunication services"".

Since Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, Israel's Gaza offensive has killed more than 35,000 Palestinians, local health officials say. Hamas-led gunmen killed some 1,200 people and abducted 253 in their attack to Israel, according to Israeli tallies.

""According to U.N. estimates, an intensified military offensive would affect approximately 1.4 million people,"" the letter said, underscoring the need ""for specific, concrete and measurable steps"" to significantly boost the flow of aid.

The letter recognises Israel made progress in addressing a number of issues, including letting more aid trucks into the Gaza Strip, the reopening of the Erez crossing into northern Gaza and the temporary use of Ashdod port in southern Israel.

But it called on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government to do more, including working towards a ""sustainable ceasefire"", facilitating further evacuations and resuming ""electricity, water and telecommunication services"".

Since Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, Israel's Gaza offensive has killed more than 35,000 Palestinians, local health officials say. Hamas-led gunmen killed some 1,200 people and abducted 253 in their attack to Israel, according to Israeli tallies.

(Scotsman Editorial 16th May 2024). It is perfectly feasible to supply 100 per cent of Scotland's energy (not just electricity) from renewable sources. In fact, a recent study by renowned energy modelling academics at the LUT University in Finland, showed that not only is a 100 per cent renewable energy mix feasible for the whole UK but it would save well over £100 billion in achieving net zero by 2050, compared to the UK Government's current strategy. It's true that renewable energy output is variable, and there are times when wind and solar are producing almost nothing. But there are also times when they produce too much power, and we have to pay wind to turn off. The UK could waste more than £3.5bn per year by 2030 this way. The answer is flexibility, not ""always on"" nuclear power stations which will just end up wasting more power when renewables are plentiful. Firstly, we need to: reduce overall demand (helping tackle fuel poverty in the process); introduce more flexibility with new smart technologies (for instance making use of demand-response aggregators like Edinburgh-based company Flexitricity), and vehicle to grid technology; build more energy storage - not just batteries, but pumped hydro storage (with several schemes in Scotland awaiting approval), gravity storage (developed in Edinburgh), compressed air storage; and thermal storage (developed in East Lothian). These are just some of the ways we can make better use of the renewable resources we already have. Nuclear power is too slow and too inflexible and too expensive to play a role in cutting carbon emissions.

Plans are being drawn up to build Scotland's first new nuclear power station in decades if the SNP is ousted from government at the next Holyrood election. Although energy policy is reserved to Westminster, SNP ministers have made clear since they took power in 2007 that they would use their planning controls to block the construction of any nuclear plants. But Alister Jack, the Tory Scottish Secretary, told peers that he had asked the UK Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) to prepare for a nuclear plant to be constructed in Scotland after the 2026 election.

Scotland, know your place. Our exalted Viceroy General Alister Jack - He Who Must Be Obeyed - has said that the UK Government is considering plans to build a nuclear reactor in Scotland, despite fierce opposition from the Scottish Government and even though planning is a devolved matter. Any new nuclear power stations which the UK Government builds in Scotland will not be built because Scotland needs them, they will be built in order to meet the energy needs of the rest of the UK, but these needs could also be met by greater investment in and development of Scotland's renewable energy potential. Moreover, given the years long timescale that is required from the commissioning of a new nuclear power plant, any new nuclear reactor that the UK commissions in Scotland would not be on stream until 2033 at the very earliest. New renewable projects can be brought in stream and contributing power to the grid much quicker. The First Minister replied: said: ""I'm often lectured in this parliament about the importance of good intergovernmental relations. The Secretary of State for Scotland has made no mention of this proposal to the Scottish Government. ""This is utterly and completely incompatible with good intergovernmental working and is illustrative of the damaging behaviour, the menacing behaviour, of the Secretary of State for Scotland. The Scottish Government will not support new nuclear power stations in Scotland."" He added that ""supporting the announcements of formidable investments in the renewable energy potential of Scotland"" was ""the policy agenda of this government, and we have nothing to do with nuclear power"".

Swinney condemns Jack's 'menacing' idea for nuclear plant in Scotland. The First Minister was clear that the Scottish Government will not back the construction of such a facility north of the border. Jack told a Lords committee on Wednesday he believes there will be a ""unionist regime again in Holyrood"" in 2026, and with the SNP out of power it will be possible to ""move forward"" with the construction plan. Speaking about the prospect of a small nuclear reactor, Jack said he has asked the UK energy minister to ""plan for one in Scotland"".

Greens in new science denial storm as they rage at Scottish nuclear power plant plans. The SNP's former government partners were unhappy that Alister Jack has started drawing up plans for a facility in Scotland despite the apparent environmental benefits. The Scottish Greens have been told to ""check the science"" after the party reacted angrily to suggestions a nuclear power plant could be built in Scotland. Scottish Secretary Alister Jack revealed on Wednesday plans were being drawn up for a facility north of the border. The Greens and SNP are opposed to such stations, despite the potential environmental benefits they provide. The Nats' former government partners released a statement saying there was ""nothing safe, secure or green about nuclear energy"". But the comment has been blasted by the Nuclear Industry Association who suggested it was an example of ignorance. The group's chief executive, and former Rutherglen and Hamilton West Labour MP Tom Greatrex, said: ""The Scottish Green Party needs to check its science: nuclear has the lowest carbon, lowest land use and the least impact on the ecosystem of all the clean energy technologies. ""Every country has concluded that nuclear is clean and green, except Germany, which burns more coal than anybody in Europe. Scotland has consistently generated the most nuclear power of any part of the UK, thus avoiding more carbon dioxide emissions than any other power source in Scottish history.""

Four kids stand in a 2×2 grid with one kid yelling out rules on how they can hit the ball -- with their hands, feet, only while grunting, etc. If you fail to pass on the ball, you're out and some other kid takes your spot.

That's in my head as I work on a new journal article on the question of ""What Comes After the Polycrisis?"" Much of the focus is on interventions we could take now that fit inside that four square approach. Some approaches will help with making the global polycrisis period less bad (i.e. less human and non-human suffering). Some will help make the post-polycrisis period (PPP) less bad. Some will do both, some neither.

Remember this from your childhood? (Image of kids playing four square by Stephen Coles via Flickr)

That can be seen in a 2×2 matrix (yes, which looks like a four square court). Some interventions, like carbon capture and storage (CCS) will neither help soften the polycrisis, nor the PPP. In fact, CCS will in all likelihood make the polycrisis worse, redirecting limited resources away from true societal transitions and extending oil companies' licenses to operate (which are leading proponents and investors in CCS).

Some efforts, like mega-scale renewables, could help us through the polycrisis (assuming this truly helps societies shift away from fossil fuels and doesn't just expand energy demands -- admittedly a huge assumption). But these projects will not help PPP peoples, who in all likelihood will neither have the dense energy sources, know-how, or ability to maintain giant fields of PV panels, mirrors, or wind turbines (particularly those in the ocean). When those fail, they'll just be eerie remnants of a fallen empire -- like Easter Island Heads or maybe Mt. Rushmore?

Other interventions might help in the PPP but less so as we weather global disruptions. Two examples: permanently securing nuclear waste, and protecting the deep sea. The first is intensely labor and resource intensive. In the U.S. alone there are 80 nuclear waste sites and 93 active nuclear reactors (which will become future radioactive waste when shut down). It would take hundreds of billions of dollars to clean all this up and place it in secure geological storage facilities, but doing so will prevent future peoples from settling in radioactive areas or foraging radioactive materials to build their tools and homes. The avoided suffering to humans and wildlife could be significant. While hard to imagine successfully citing a location for a facility in the U.S., Finland offers a potent case study in successfully doing this (though you can see how materially and financially intensive storage is).

A far easier intervention is to prevent any mining of the deep seas. Some see this as a new source of critical minerals to power the energy transition. But the deep sea is critical for sustaining ocean health and possibly the future evolutionary potential of Gaia. Keeping this relatively untouched zone healthy is paramount for the long-term wellbeing of humans and Gaia, even if there is a financial case to be made for its liquidation. (Fortunately, the case is pretty weak: one recent study found that investing in mining the deep seas would actually lead to a $500 billion dollar loss, when factoring in ecological damages. But even just factoring in the economic realm, it's still a money loser -- costing the mining industry a projected $30-132 billion -- due to the expensive equipment and difficulty accessing these minerals.)

The last quadrant is the sweet spot -- those interventions that will help reduce suffering in the polycrisis upon us as well as the post-polycrisis period. Two examples, both of which I've discussed many times: reducing nuclear arsenals and degrowth (of both the economy as well as the total number of humans and their dependent species). Reducing nuclear arsenals will mean less potential for a world-ending conflict or even a limited nuclear exchange that could cause billions to suffer through the trigger of a global famine. It could also prevent the instability in the PPP of many small states (assuming empires like the United States break apart) from having nuclear weapons and local warlords using them to either hold power or spark regional conflicts.

By reducing human numbers and economic activity, we'll take immediate pressure off Earth's systems, reducing the severity of the polycrisis. Further, by having fewer people, by definition there will be less suffering. And while that can be reduced to absurdity (i.e. why not get rid of all humans?), ten billion people trying to survive in the polycrisis will look very different than seven billion. And by reducing population and the resultant conversion of ecological capital into stuff during our consumer era (to fulfill both real and artificially stimulated needs), the PPP will also be better, as more of Earth's systems will be intact (at least relatively) to grow food, provide ecosystem services like water purification and climate stability, and sustain the web of life that humans depend on and are woven into.

Of course, I'd also add cultivating a deeper respect for our dependence on Gaia in this quadrant as well. Not necessarily through the Gaian Way, but if religions, which have lasted for centuries (and some for millennia) embed an ecocentric perspective, they could prove powerful and enduring institutions that help get humanity through the polycrisis and build in ways that sustain Earth and prevents another future polycrisis triggered by humans once again forgetting their dependence on Gaia and growing beyond the planet's carrying capacity. If not, they probably deserve to be knocked out of the Four Square to let another take their place!

New rule: if you don't integrate deep ecological understanding and deference, you're out! (Image by Michelle TeGrootenhuis via Flickr)

1) What's the polycrisis? In short, a converging set of crises that lead to global societal disruptions. For a deeper introduction, I invite you to read these two Gaian Reflections: Plunging into the Polycrisis and From Polycrisis to Permacrisis.

2) Just announced this week: another direct air capture facility came online in Iceland. Once fully operational, it will capture 36,000 tons of CO2 a year. Sure, that sounds good, but why not use the electricity for something useful that'll displace energy used elsewhere. Even mining cryptocurrency might be a better use (if it shifts it away from coal-based energy)! But somebody invested in this facility as a worthwhile investment (driven by the monetization of carbon and most likely state subsidies).

3) The odds of investing in this, even in the pre-polycrisis period, are low, which is why training nuclear guardians to keep sharing awareness of taboo zones will be deeply valuable.",resilience.org,news,Resilience,,-0.04313725490196074,453632774,1,https://www.resilience.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/7984192534_f6cacd2e0a_o.jpg,

To meet the increasing demand and expanding its offer in the sector, NYAB will integrate the operations of group company Power Forze into NYAB Sweden's operations from June 1, 2024.

Power Forze, which has operated under its own brand since NYAB's acquisition in 2022, offers services in power installations for industry and wind power as well as services for electricity distribution from 20 kV to 400 kV, mainly in northern Sweden. Within the NYAB group, Power Forze has contributed to several successes, including the assurance of the Aurora Line project, where NYAB is building a 400 kV transmission line for a 90 km distance of the main grid connection between Sweden and Finland on order from the main grid company Svenska kraftnät.

The integration of Power Forze's operations into NYAB Sweden gives NYAB a competitive overall offer in power and electricity distribution by bringing together the group's broad expertise in the service portfolio. The delivery capacity will also strengthen through harmonisation of project methodology.

""We are thrilled that the expertise and competence found in Power Forze is now joining NYAB Sweden. The accumulated expertise opens attractive business opportunities linked to the investments planned to secure the electricity supply of the future. Together, we can offer a full-service offer and a broad service portfolio to both the market and our employees. We will also be able to collaborate across national borders more seamlessly, which provides synergies and new opportunities,"" says Johan Larsson, NYAB's CEO.

Power Forze was founded in 2020 and has been operating mainly in northern Sweden, but after the integration it is expected that Power Forze's services and expertise can also be offered in other parts of Sweden and Finland.

""We look forward to continuing our work within the NYAB Group and deliver high-quality services to our customers. As part of NYAB, we get the opportunity to further expand the business through increased competence, a sharper overall offer and a clearly improved internal support structure when it comes the IT, staff matters and training"", says Stefan Helmvall, Energy Work Manager at NYAB, previously CEO at Power Forze.

Power Forze's existing customers, partners and suppliers will not be affected by the change as entered contracts and agreements will continue within the original company, which will remain in place until further notice, while new operations are transferred to NYAB.

Strong growth due to Dollarstore, fixed costs had a negative impact on earnings

In the first quarter of 2024, Tokmanni Group's revenue grew by 42.4% to EUR 339.2 million. This significant growth is due to the acquisition that took place in August last year. Like-for-like revenue increased by 1.7% (2.7%). Growth in sales of grocery products of 4.7% boosted like-for-like sales. Customers' purchasing power and confidence in their own finances remained low, and our customers were increasingly attracted by low prices and interesting promotions.

The Tokmanni and Dollarstore integration is progressing according to plan. The main focus is on the consolidation of purchases at Group level. Our target is to achieve annual synergies of more than EUR 15 million by the end of 2025. The synergies achieved by the end of March are already 6.7 million euros on an annual basis.

Tokmanni segment's revenue grew by 4.2% to EUR 248.1 in the first quarter. Like-for-like revenue grew by 1.7%. Comparable customer visits increased slightly on the previous year, while the comparable average basket size increased by 1.2%. The good sales development was driven by the timing of Easter, which was at the end of March this year, whereas in the comparison period it was in early April. Comparable gross margin was 32.8% (31.7%). Comparable EBIT was EUR -1.7 million (-1.9).

Dollarstore segment's revenue was EUR 91.1 million in the first quarter. Like-for-like revenue increased by 1.8% in local currencies. Comparable customer visits decreased slightly from the previous year, while the comparable average basket size increased by 3.4%. Comparable gross margin was 37.4%. Comparable EBIT was EUR -2.8 million.

The first quarter is the weakest quarter of the year in terms of sales and profitability for both Tokmanni and Dollarstore. However, both segments performed reasonably well in the current market environment.

The start of the second quarter has been affected by events in the Red Sea and political strikes, among other things. At Tokmanni, this was reflected as clear shortages in shelf availability and additional costs. The spring season, which is Tokmanni's second most important sales period, only started properly at the beginning of May in southern Finland.

Key figures (Dollarstore included in from 1 August 2023 onwards)

* Rolling 12 months comparable EBITDA

Dollarstore financials have been included in Tokmanni Group financials starting from 1 August 2023. Dollarstore consists of the Dollarstore and Big Dollar stores. Tokmanni consists of the Tokmanni, Miny, Click Shoes and Shoe House stores, as well as the Tokmanni and Click Shoes online stores. Based on refined preliminary calculations the impact of Dollarstore purchase price allocation on Tokmanni Group figures is the following: The preliminary fair valuation of Dollarstore immaterial rights and owned assets will add EUR 47.0 million to the balance sheet, which will be depreciated and amortised in accordance with Tokmanni Group's accounting principles over periods varying from 15 to 20 years. The annual impact of these amortisations and depreciations is around EUR 2,5 million per year on Tokmanni Group's EBIT. The impact of inventory fair valuation will be reported in items affecting comparability and will not impact comparable EBIT but will impact EBIT and earnings per share. The fair valuation is EUR 3.2 million and it was recorded as an expense over six months starting from August 2023.

Tokmanni Group reports EBITDA and EBIT as its key performance indicators and makes adjustments to improve comparability and provide a better view of Tokmanni Group's operational performance. EBITDA is not a key indicator according to IFRS accounting standards and it represents operating profit before depreciation and amortisation. Comparable EBITDA and EBIT represent the same indicators excluding items that Tokmanni Group's management considers to be exceptional and non-recurring. The items include changes in the fair value of electricity and currency derivatives, which are adjusted by Tokmanni Group as they are unrealised gains or losses related to Tokmanni Group's open cash flow hedge positions, and hence not related to Tokmanni Group's operational performance during the review periods. In addition, other non-recurring costs related to acquired businesses and companies are included in the items affecting comparability.

Tokmanni Group's management uses the comparable EBITDA margin and comparable EBIT margin as key performance indicators when evaluating Tokmanni Group's and its segments' underlying operational performance.

Adjustments affecting comparability

According to the statistics of the Finnish Grocery Trade Association FGTA (www.pty.fi), the total sales of department store and hypermarket chains increased by 4.5% in the first quarter of 2024. Grocery sales increased, while non-grocery sales decreased. It is important to note that the statistics compiled by the FGTA only cover part of the market relevant for Tokmanni segment.

According to the statistics of the Swedish Food Retailers' Federation (https://www.svenskdagligvaruhandel.se/), the Food Retail Index increased by 6.4% in the first quarter of 2024. Sales of brick-and-mortar stores increased by 6.5% and online sales by 4.8%. The Food Retail Index measures sales growth in the grocery trade and does not include specialised food stores or service trade. It is important to note that the statistics compiled by the Swedish Food Retailers Federation only cover part of the market relevant for Dollarstore segment.

At the end of March 2024, Tokmanni Group had a total of 372 stores (31 December 2023: 372). In Finland Tokmanni Group had 201 Tokmanni, 28 Click Shoes, 2 Shoe House and 6 Miny stores. In Sweden Tokmanni Group had 131 Dollarstore stores and in Denmark 4 Big Dollar stores.

More information about Tokmanni Group's store network is available on the Group's website at https://ir.tokmanni.fi/en.

Reporting structure

Tokmanni Group consists of Tokmanni and Dollarstore segments as well as Group functions and eliminations. Tokmanni segment consists of the Tokmanni stores, Miny stores, Click Shoes stores and Shoe House stores, as well as the Tokmanni and Click Shoes online stores. Click Shoes' and Shoe House's financials have been included in Tokmanni Group financials starting from 1 March 2023. Dollarstore segment consists of the Dollarstore and Big Dollar stores. Dollarstore financials have been included in Tokmanni Group financials starting from 1 August 2023. Due to Dollarstore's unusual accounting period and lack of IFRS financial statement reporting, Tokmanni Group does not publish figures for Dollarstore's comparison period, with the exception of revenue growth and certain operational figures.

Seasonality

Tokmanni Group's business is subject to seasonality, which has a significant effect on its revenue, profitability, and cash flow. In general, Tokmanni Group's revenue, profitability and cash flow are lowest in the first quarter and highest in the fourth quarter due to Christmas sales.

Revenue

* Dollarstore financials have been included in Tokmanni Group financials starting from 1 August 2023.

January-March 2024

In the first quarter Tokmanni Group's revenue grew by 42.4% (4.7%) to EUR 339.2 million (238.2). Sales of Tokmanni Group's grocery products grew by 4.7% compared to the corresponding period of the previous year. The proportion of grocery sales was 56.9% (56.3%) of total sales. The grocery figures include Dollarstore sales from the comparison period.

Tokmanni Group's like-for-like revenue grew by 1.7% (2.7%). The like-for-like change in percentage is calculated in local currencies, and the comparison period includes Dollarstore's figures.

Tokmanni Group's like-for-like customer visits decreased by 0.2% (+2.9%), and the total number of customers grew by 1.5% (4.9%) compared to the corresponding period of the previous year. The like-for-like average basket size increased by 1.9% to EUR 18.81 (18.46).

Profitability

* Dollarstore financials have been included in Tokmanni Group financials starting from 1 August 2023.

January-March 2024

In the first quarter of 2024, Tokmanni Group's gross profit amounted to EUR 115.4 million (76.0), and the gross margin was 34.0% (31.9%). Comparable gross profit was EUR 115.4 million (75.5), corresponding to a comparable gross margin of 34.0% (31.7%). The Group's gross profit in the first quarter was boosted above all by Dollarstore's gross profit, but Tokmanni segment's improved gross profit also supported the overall growth.

Tokmanni Group's operating expenses in the first quarter were EUR 89.4 million (59.4), or 26.4% (24.9%) of revenue. The increase in operating expenses resulted mainly from the integration of Dollarstore's operating expenses into Tokmanni Group's consolidated figures. Expenses were also increased by higher property costs and personnel expenses. Personnel expenses represented EUR 53.1 million (33.5), or 15.7% of revenue (14.1%). Comparable operating expenses were EUR 89.4 million (59.2), or 26.4% of revenue (24.9%).

The Group's EBITDA in the first quarter totalled EUR 26.9 million (17.4), corresponding to an EBITDA margin of 7.9% (7.3%). Comparable EBITDA totalled EUR 26.8 million (17.2), and the comparable EBITDA margin was 7.9% (7.2%).

Tokmanni Group's depreciation amounted to EUR 31.9 million (19.5). The growth mainly reflected the impact of IFRS 16 due to the growth of the store network. Depreciation excluding preliminary depreciation of tangible and intangible assets (PPA) arising from the acquisitions amounted to EUR 31.1 million. EUR 0.7 million was recognised for preliminary depreciation of tangible and intangible assets (PPA) arising in the acquisitions.

The Group's EBIT in the first quarter totalled EUR -5.0 million (-2.0), corresponding to an EBIT margin of -1.5% (-0.8%). Comparable EBIT was EUR -5.1 million (-2.2), and the comparable EBIT margin was -1.5% (-0.9%). The increase in operating expenses reduced the EBIT.

Tokmanni Group's net financial items totalled EUR -9.1 million (3.3). The result before taxes was EUR -14.1 million (-5.3). Taxes for the period amounted to EUR 2.1 million (1.0). The net result was EUR -12.1 million (-4.3). The main reasons for the weaker result compared with the previous year were the increase in operating expenses, the increase in depreciation and higher finance costs.

At the end of March 2024, Tokmanni Group's inventories amounted to EUR 370.8 million (300.7). At the end of the review period, Tokmanni segment's inventories amounted to EUR 271.6 million (300.7) and Dollarstore segment's inventories amounted to EUR 99.1 million.

Consolidated cash flow from operating activities amounted to EUR -40.0 million (-12.9) in the first quarter of 2024. The development in the cash flow from operating activities was affected especially by the change in the value of inventories year-on-year. The company had a total of EUR 211.0 million (139.6) in credit facilities, consisting of loan agreements with financial institutions and a commercial paper programme. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to EUR 18.8 million (4.2), and the Group's financial position is solid.

At the end of March 2024, Tokmanni Group's interest-bearing debt totalled EUR 826.3 million (441.2), including EUR 220.0 million (100.4) in non-current loans from financial institutions and EUR 35.0 million (51.4) in current loans from financial institutions and a commercial paper programme. The remainder of the liabilities mainly consist of lease agreement liabilities reported under IFRS 16. The Group's net debt without lease liabilities was EUR 235.3 million (147.1). The figure increased mainly due to acquisitions and investments in store sites.

Tokmanni Group's ratio of net debt to comparable EBITDA excluding the impact of IFRS 16 was 2.3 at the end of March 2024 (1.6). Tokmanni Group's target is to maintain an efficient capital structure. The long-term goal is to keep the ratio of net debt to comparable EBITDA, excluding the impact of IFRS 16, below 2.25 at year-end.

Tokmanni Group's equity ratio was 18.6% (26.9%) at the end of March 2024.

Capital expenditure

Tokmanni Group's capital expenditure in the first quarter of 2024 totalled EUR 5.9 million (18.3). Capital expenditure was related to the expansion, development and maintenance of the store network and the development of digital services. The figures for the comparison period include, in addition to the costs related to the construction of the Moreeni logistics centre and the road connection, the acquisition of the business operations of Jyskän Varastomyymälä Oy and the acquisition of the entire share capital of the Finnish shoe retail chains Click Shoes Oy and Shoe House Oy.

The significant clearance sales for winter apparel in the clothing segment reduced the gross margin in the comparison period.

Tokmanni segment's operating expenses in the first quarter totalled EUR 63.4 million (59.1), or 25.6% of revenue (24.8%). Comparable operating expenses were EUR 63.4 million (58.9), or 25.6% of revenue (24.7%). The increase in expenses was driven in particular by the rise in property costs and marketing and personnel expenses. Personnel expenses represented EUR 35.9 million (33.3) of total operating expenses, or 14.5% of revenue (14.0%).

Tokmanni segment's EBITDA in the first quarter totalled EUR 19.3 million (17.7), which corresponds to an EBITDA margin of 7.8% (7.4%). Comparable EBITDA totalled EUR 18.7 million (17.5), and the comparable EBITDA margin was 7.5% (7.4%).

This Business Review has been prepared using the same accounting policies and methods of computation as in the Financial Statements for 2023. AII figures in the accounts have been rounded. Consequently, the sum of individual figures can deviate from the presented sum figure. The figures in the financial statement release are presented in millions of euros.

Seasonality

Tokmanni Group's business is subject to seasonality, which has a significant effect on its revenue, profitability, and cash flow. In general, Tokmanni Group's revenue, profitability and cash flow are lowest in the first quarter and highest in the fourth quarter due to Christmas sales.

The preparation of the Business Review in accordance with IFRS requires the management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amount assets and liabilities on the balance sheet, the reporting of contingent assets and liabilities, and the amounts income and expenses. Although the estimates are based on the management's best knowledge of current events and actions, the actual results may differ from the estimates.",news.cision.com,news,News Powered by Cision,,0.2392156862745098,453618473,17,,eng-9567158

Metso's Lokotrack® EC range brings a new diesel-electric power line to the aggregates market. All the process functions of the range are electric, significantly reducing the use of hydraulic oil needed in the crushing operations. All Lokotrack EC range units can be powered with external electricity.

In its Lokolaunch event in Tampere, Finland, Metso launched the first two products of the new EC range. Lokotrack LT400J is a 68-ton mobile jaw crusher designed for the primary crushing of hard rock and recycled aggregates. Lokotrack LT350C is a 50-ton mobile cone crusher for secondary and tertiary crushing. To reach high capacity, LT350C is equipped with the new Nordberg® HP350e cone crusher, while LT400J counts on the proven Nordberg® C120 jaw crusher. Both units can be seamlessly combined with each other as well as with the Lokotrack mobile screens to produce high quality aggregates.

""When external electricity is available, the new electric power transmission provides high capacity with minimized operational cost and CO2 emissions. When not available, the onboard diesel gensets allow maximum independent operation time. Also, auxiliary units, such as mobile screens and stackers, can be powered from the same gensets, which will further reduce the needed power to run the complete plant,"" says Jarmo Vuorenpää, Director, New Lokotrack Offering at Metso.

Lokotrack EC range has been developed using new, modular architecture, which reduces the number of components and provides scalable solutions that can be adapted for different applications and capacities. ""The new way to do product development enables a faster and more agile way to meet the changing customer needs. Furthermore, it enables more efficient support for the machines with less parts needed and easier upgrades of new features,"" says Renaud Lapointe, Senior Vice President of Metso Products business line in the Aggregates business area.

All the components of the new EC range are designed and tested to perform in demanding conditions to reach maximum uptime for the customers. Safety and usability have been given special attention. The design of the LT400J and LT350C fulfills the latest safety standard while being easier to use than ever. With new digital tools, the units can be operated safely from the excavator and be quickly set from transport to operation.

Now the Coalition wants reactors, too. We're not ready for it","Source: The Conversation (Au and NZ) - By Ian Lowe, Emeritus Professor, School of Environment and Science, Griffith University

For decades, Australia has exported uranium - but not used it, other than in the Lucas Heights research reactor. But change is coming.

We now face a rapidly deepening commitment to the nuclear industry, through nuclear submarines (bipartisan support) or nuclear reactors (Coalition support).

The Albanese government was quick to accept the Coalition's AUKUS deal, which looks likely to bring the first nuclear-powered submarine to our ports in about eight years.

Nuclear subs offer strong military deterrence. But they come with a hard problem: how to manage the especially nasty radioactive waste at the end of a submarine's life.

Last night, Opposition Leader Peter Dutton pulled both together in his budget reply speech, asking:

Why is the technology which is safe for our submariners unsafe for our citizens?

The Coalition is giving us clear indications it will take a plan to build nuclear power stations to next year's election, though it is coy on where.

That would face a string of hurdles, not just changing Commonwealth and state laws currently banning nuclear power, but also needing to find communities willing to have a nuclear reactor. Like it or not, nuclear is appearing in Australia's future for the first time.

How did we get here?

Nuclear power has never been cost-effective in Australia. When the industry was starting in the US and UK in the 1950s, each Australian state had its own power grid, each too small scale for nuclear reactors.

The short-lived Gorton government proposed one on Commonwealth land at Jervis Bay, but the tenders for the project showed it was uneconomic.

Worldwide, the disastrous nuclear accidents at Chernobyl in 1986 and Fukushima in 2011 have led to understandable resistance from communities slated for a reactor.

Then there's the almost intractable problem of radioactive waste.

In Australia, successive governments have failed to find permanent storage for our low-level waste from nuclear medicine and research, much of it from the Lucas Heights research reactor. The most recent plan to store waste at Kimba, in South Australia, failed last year.

If this waste is buried under a few metres of earth, the radiation levels at the surface are not significantly above the background levels we all live with.

Even so, no community has yet been willing to have that waste buried in their area.

First Nations groups on remote Country are well aware of the damage done to people and natural areas by British nuclear weapons tests at Emu Fields and Maralinga in South Australia in the 1960s, so they are very reluctant to accept even low-level waste.

What's the issue with nuclear submarine waste?

Last year, Defence Minister Richard Marles said a waste dump would be located on current or future defence land. This might avoid some community pushback but is unlikely to quell fears.

This week, a Labor-chaired parliamentary committee called for the government to rule out accepting high-level waste from the submarines - specifically, the reactors and spent fuel from decommissioned submarines.

After fifty years of using this technology, many countries are still struggling with what to do with the resulting waste. Finland will soon open the world's first deep geological nuclear waste storage, a facility meant to last a million years. But countries such as the United States cannot find an acceptable location.

Because the submarine reactors use highly enriched, weapons-grade nuclear fuel, the waste is much nastier even than the ""high-level waste"" from nuclear power stations, with high levels of radioactive isotopes of cobalt and nickel.

Neither the US nor the United Kingdom have a long-term solution for dealing with their own nuclear sub waste.

Those countries could, under the wording of the draft AUKUS laws, argue for their waste to be stored in Australia, too.

This would be unpopular. When the 2016 South Australian Royal Commission proposed storing high-level waste from overseas nuclear power stations as a new source of revenue, a citizens' jury rejected the plan, concluding the risks were unacceptable.

Realistically, our government will do what US and UK governments have done for decades: store the waste temporarily and kick the can down the road.

What about nuclear power?

Since losing office in 2022, the Coalition has become pro-nuclear power. Political analysts see this positioning as a way for the Liberal and National parties to slow the renewable build, prolong coal power for the decades needed to build nuclear power, and attack Labor.

But while the politics are clear, the Coalition's position on nuclear is opaque.

For a few months late last year, the Coalition was in favour of ""small modular reactors"" rather than the expensive and slow-to-build large reactors built in the northern hemisphere. That plan ran into two problems. First, these reactors are still a gleam in the eyes of nuclear technologists. They do not yet exist. The American design promoted by the Coalition was cancelled due to cost blowouts.

The second problem is there really are economies of scale with nuclear reactors. France and the UK have concentrated on large reactors because doubling the size of reactors does not double the cost of generating electricity.

Even so, large reactors are now struggling to be economically competitive, even in countries such as France with significant cross-subsidies from nuclear weapons programs.

Old nuclear reactors which have written off the cost of construction are being closed because the operating and maintenance costs make their power more expensive than can be obtained from solar farms and wind turbines.

This year, the Coalition has switched back to old-fashioned large reactors.

Electricity from nuclear reactors costs three to four times as much as what can be provided by solar farms or wind turbines. Even adding storage to firm renewables leads to a price tag less than half that of nuclear. Reactors often take decades to build.

It is difficult to see the electoral appeal of a platform promising extra risks, more expensive energy and a slow build.

Where does that leave us? It's very unlikely Australia will ever have nuclear power. But it is very likely we will have to grapple with the spectre of high-level nuclear waste for the first time.

Harrison Williams - Morgan Stanley

Christoph Husmann

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. A warm welcome to our Q1 Analyst Call. We released our figures of Q1 2024 already via netTALK announcement on May 3rd. Because our figures are fairly below previous year's level, although, we are convinced that none of you will be surprised by that, that the negative deviation was there because with the guidance already, we announced that the 2024 figures will be, many of them, fairly below 2023, having in mind the big impact of high power prices of previous years, which fortunately cannot be repeated this year. But these figures are approximately on target. Therefore, we are still positive regarding our guidance.

Today, I'm here with together with my colleague, Mario Schirru, CIO and COO of Encavis. We will guide you through the figures and then afterwards, we'll be available for your questions.

Ladies and gentlemen, one of the highlights, certainly in Q1 2024 was that KKR launched a voluntary public takeover offer. The process is progressing and we have already now the investment agreement signed, which was released on the 14th March. KKR launched the public takeover on April 24th with a cash consideration of EUR17.50 per share for every shareholder. And, the first offer period will end in two weeks from now.

The management board and the supervisory board of Encavis AG recommended that, offer in a joint recent statement, which was published on May 2nd. But at the same time, we are not only working on the progress of that process, but we are building up the business of our company at the same time.

In the meantime, we started the construction of a 114 megawatt solar park in Holstein in Mecklenburg, Fort Pomerania, as well as we did some expected refinancing of two parks in Spain, Talayuela and La Cabrera, which is in a total amount of EUR203 million setting up better financial positioning of these two parks. We signed for Encavis Asset Management, a power purchase agreement for 80% of the electricity of our 216 megawatt solar park Bartow in Germany.

Ladies and gentlemen, next page, please. Ladies and gentlemen, if we have a look into our figures, then we see that, the energy production of our existing portfolio has decreased by 59 megawatt hours by 8% to 694 gigawatt hours, sorry, gigawatt hours.

Two-third of that deviation of 59 gigawatt hours is due to meteorological conditions. One-third of it is due to two wind farms, which we sold at the end of last year before they were pretty much at the end of their feed in tariff and were up for repowering. Certainly, that last effect was recognized in our guidance.

The total energy production decreased by minus 2% or 12 gigawatt hours. Obviously, we, acquired 47 gigawatt hours of additional power production in last year, which we are now producing, which were wind farms in Germany and Finland. These minus 2% of the reduced energy production in total boil down to 12% negative deviation in revenues or minus EUR12.2 million.

These are predominantly firstly, it is EUR8.1 million special effect, which we announced Q1 2023, which was the cash in onto the accounting for a performance imbalanced factor in the Netherlands and the Dutch, SD plus system, which we received last year and, certainly, which we could not repeat this year. This was planned for as well.

We have approximately EUR5.3 million negative revenue effect out of lower prices. Maybe you recall that Q1 2023 was impacted by pretty high price levels still and that was could not be repeated this year and was certainly, reflected in our guidance as well.

And lastly, it is [indiscernible] sale of two wind farms, which I already stated. This is minus EUR1.5 million, which was reflected in the guidance as well. Therefore, we were not surprised by the negative deviation of the revenues by minus EUR12.2 million.

This reflected in the EBITDA development by minus EUR15.8 million where, first of all, these revenues are missing. And secondly, we have additional cost for the growth of the company for personnel as well as cost for the new projects, the two wind farms in Germany and Finland. And that is then further reflected in the EBIT as well where we have additional depreciation.

At the end of this table, you see that, we have an operating negative EPS of minus EUR0.04. This is not unusual for solar companies since we have fixed cost in every quarter, but low radiation and therefore, low revenues in the first quarter. That is in some periods as we will see on the one of the later charts, overcompensated by unusual high prices last like last two first quarters of 2023 and 2022 for high wind performance.

Ladies and gentlemen, if we go into the segmentation report, then we see that, we have a decline of revenues in three out of four segments. Only the PV services is growing. We see here the impacts of the specific issues, which are already raised. In solar, we have negative meteorological effect and price effect. In the wind farms, we have the sale of the two wind farms, Sohland and Greußen.

In asset management, we just have a shift of business to the second and third quarter. PV services growing. But, overall, all of them developing in a way as expected on our side and in line with guidance.

If we go to the specifics, first of all, we see a decline of revenues in the solar segment by EUR10 million. This is, firstly, EUR8.1 million of the performance imbalance factor of the Netherlands, then EUR1.7 million of price effect, and only EUR600,000 of lower production than previous year.

We see that in the overall portfolio, we have a decline of power production by 9%, but that only leads to the EUR600,000 of lower revenues due to the fact that most of it or almost 50% of it is from Spain, where in average, the remuneration per kilowatt hour is one of the lowest within the Group. So the input back from the bad weather situation in Spain is not so much reflected in the revenues.

As you see here very well that, we have a fixed cost system because the EUR10 million gap in revenues is exactly can be seen within the gap of the EBITDA and in the EBIT. If we have a look into the Wind segment, then we see a decline of revenues by EUR3 million. Here, we have two compensating effects.

One is we have minus EUR5.1 million revenues in the existing portfolio, which is partially due to the sale of Goizn and [Zolan] wind farms of EUR1.5 million and meteorological effect of minus EUR3.6 million and a positive effect of EUR2.6 million from new assets, the wind farms in Finland and in Germany.

If we have a look into the PV services, here we see a growth of the business. Half of it, internal growth, half of it, external growth. You see that here because the net revenues grow by EUR1.2 million and total the revenues by EUR2.5 million. So half of it is consolidated because it's internal. With that growth of the business, the margin is coming back, is improving. That's positive and should be seen during the course of the year in a further positive way.

Next page, in the asset management, we have a decline of revenues. The issue is that last year, we suffered somewhat from high interest rates because some of the investors were reluctant to invest into such funds because, firstly, they want to see that, the returns are coming back. This could be shown now, but now the business is always starting. There's more committed equity. And so, we see that the business, which shifts more to the second and third quarter and honestly as said, in the first quarter is always pretty weak in the asset management.

If we have a look into consolidation and headquarters, it is in the first line, the revenues is just the consolidation of the internal works of Stern. The operating EBITDA is increasing from minus EUR2.7 million to minus EUR3.4 million. These are increased cost of the team for the growth of the company.

Ladies and gentlemen, if we then go to the guidance. Here, we have to have a look on the relation of the first quarter results compared to the guidance. As you might see here, the Q1 2024 figures are not unusual. You have seen that in Q1 2021 as in 2018 in Q1 and Q1 2016 as well. Here, we have seen negative results, but you might argue that, they are increasing. Well, just only for simple rule of thumb. The more solar you have, the more fixed cost you have. But the radiation in first quarter is always bad.

You make your profits in second and third quarter. The bigger your solar portfolio is, the bigger the losses in first quarter should be. But in some of the quarters, that trend is overcompensated. Specifically, in Q1 2022 and in Q1 2023, due to the war in Ukraine and the high power prices in combination with high volumes, we had a positive effect. But that was quite unusual.

In Q1, 2019, and Q1, 2020 we had good wind. And therefore, this negative was overcompensated. But wherever you look, whether there is in the first quarter, a profit, a loss or a zero result, it is always the case that the guidance was reached, was fulfilled and was on the level above previous year.

Ladies and gentlemen, therefore, it is that and now I would like to go to Page 16. We stick to our guidance and emphasize that, we are heading to revenues of more than EUR460 million of EBITDA of more than EUR300 million, EBIT of more than EUR175 million and a point in cash flow of more than EUR260 million.

Let's talk, lastly, on the carbon footprint on Page 19. In the year 2023, and you might have seen that because we released our ESG progress report and our ESG plus report, recently, you have seen that that we could reduce the Scope 3 emissions.

The Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions are not of that importance to us. They are pretty small. Anyhow, yes, there is an increase here. Unfortunately, it is, first of all, that the direct carbon emissions, for instance, the fuel consumption of the company vehicles are increasing. This will, as you might recall, be abolished that Scope 1 because we are currently changing all company cars to full electrified cars. But this with the existing lease contracts will last some time.

The Scope 2 emissions, which is mainly our purchased power with the bigger parks and more parks we have, there is an increase. This cannot be prevented, but we are, as you might recall, switch that to full green electricity.

Let's focus more on the Scope 3 emissions. Scope 3 emissions could again be decreased by 13% compared to 2022. 98% of our emissions are in Scope 3. But this quarter we will be stable because the other ones will be abolished, but was in total over the last three years decreased by almost 50%. Here, we were pretty active in by increasing the use of recycled materials as well as increase of use of low emission means of transport with the construction of our parks. We are heading here as well, and we are on plan here as well.

Ladies and gentlemen, that was a brief introduction into our figures of Q1 2024. Now, we are available for your questions. Thank you very much for your audience.

[Operator Instructions] The first question is from Teresa Schinwald from Raiffeisen Bank International.

Teresa Schinwald

Hi. Good morning. Thank you for the presentation. I'll ask my almost usual, can you give us an update on the investment cost for a new project on the development here? What's going on with the wind and solar panels?

Christoph Husmann

Yes. That's, I think, pretty easy. The price have been quite stable over the last month. Last time, I think we mentioned figures around EUR0.11, EUR0.12 for about peak. I don't see significant decrease in this figures. Things seem seems to be stable. Actually, same holds for the other, capital expenditures when constructing new plans.

[Operator Instructions] The next question is from Harrison Williams from Morgan Stanley.

Harrison Williams

Hi there. Good morning. I was hoping you could maybe provide a little bit more color on what you're seeing in the European PPA markets in terms of latest demand trends, given we have seen power prices fall quite significantly this year. Any overall color you can provide and anything specific you can say by geography would be particularly useful.

Christoph Husmann

Yes. Happy to elaborate a little bit on that. We see still strong demand. When we reach out to off takers to sell the power from our plants, there is a lot of interest. There is, of course, people are careful in terms of pricing because everyone has seen this huge decrease in prices. Actually, none of them were expecting it to be that significant. We also were a little bit surprised. Over the last weeks, we've seen a slight recovery.

There are different factors that are now being a role in general. I think it is -- the toughest thing is we do agree on pricing. For us, it's important to find and to look for off takers that are currently more looking for or basing their decisions on a strategic on strategic rationales, rather than on sort of optimizing their own energy costs because this is, again, I feel like there is a little bit of an uncorrelation between sort of the price that we see on the market on the spot and what is expected to happen on the long-term. This is the challenge.

Again, volumes have been still high, so there are a lot of contracts being signed. Again, we see that the price finding, discussions are a little bit more difficult than in the past. Let's wait and see.

Harrison Williams

Thanks. And maybe if I can ask one follow-up to that. Are you seeing any change in the structure of these PPAs and the demand off takers? I mean, that both in terms of the length of the PPA and also in terms of the sophistication, I mean, are off takers still happy with payers produced PPAs? Or, is there a shift towards more base load as the preferred option?

Christoph Husmann

Yes. This is sort of a discussion which I think will stay with us for the next years, because ultimately, yes, there are a lot of buyers who wish to buy base load but there are a lot of sellers introduced like in Canvas who know that, producing base load from single assets is nearly impossible and can be very, very dangerous.

I think that, as soon as everyone will start looking at portfolios, meaning off takers and producers, there might be sort of discussions going in that direction as long as everyone's still looking at the single assets, I think that that is taking it will take max. I don't know even if it's will ever happen that, significant amount of Basement PPA on our side.

Long story short, we still see, enough interest from layers to buy on a base payers produce basis, which is, of course, our preferred, sort of structure and this seems to still work well on the market. Again, everyone is talking. A lot of players are sort of pretending like that's the only thing that they are willing to sign. But in the end, there are a lot of base produced, PPAs being signed. So nothing to worry about in this regards from us.

Harrison Williams

That's very useful. And any color on the lengths of these PPAs? Is there any change there?

Christoph Husmann

No. No. The length I mean, again, it's a little bit about the price. We have seen a couple of months ago that there was significant spread between the five and 10 year contract. On the five year, people were people were willing to pay unfortunately more compared to the 10 years. This is not as acute as a couple of weeks of months ago. In general, we still see sort of strong demand also for longer terms, PPA. Again, I wouldn't say, nothing really fundamentally changing at the moment.

[Operator Instructions]. There are no more questions at this time. I'm sorry, sir. We have a last minute registration from [Anis] Zakia from Auto PHF.

Yes. Good morning, gentlemen. I have two questions, if I may. Two follow-up question. On PPA, could you please give us an idea on the level of current PPA prices in main geographies? I mean, in Germany, Italy, Nordics and balance. And do you still see tech companies and data centers as main off takers in the market?

Christoph Husmann

In terms of prices, I would say that, they are quite stable. Of course, they are going down compared to one year ago. Just to give you a couple of figures, in Spain, again, we always talk about 10 year pays produce. We see prices between EUR30 and EUR35.

In Germany, we see something around EUR60, EUR65, which is the same maybe around EUR60 in Italy, still a little bit higher, can be around EUR60, EUR65 on the upper end. These are sort of the more the countries where we are currently being more active in terms of sourcing. Again, maybe slight decrease but marginal compared to the last quarter. This was the first one.

The second one was on off takers. Yes, tech companies are still keen to source green power. I think that the evolution around AI is sort of putting pressure on them. It seems like, AI is going to significantly require more energy than sort of the traditional business. This is definitely a good thing for us.

But to be honest, and as I mentioned before, we are more looking for players, who are a little bit less price sensitive maybe than the big corporates, who actually reach out with their power and can negotiate, sort of, hard. We see SMEs. We see sort of a lot of industrial players, again, not the biggest ones, but I would say the medium as well as medium enterprises who still want to procure the power to stabilize their cost positions and want to also have a good visibility on the cost in long-term.

These guys, these companies are sort of are somehow easier to deal with, because, again, they are not putting the price sort of on the list of their top priority when negotiating. They are more interested in sort of having the right party and sizing the PPA in appropriate way. This is what we're currently seeing and we're focusing more on industrial players, I would say, than in the past to sell our power.

That was the last question. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Dr. Christoph Husmann for any closing remarks.

Christoph Husmann

Yes. Thank you very much for dialing in. Thank you very much for the interest in our company.

We now face a rapidly deepening commitment to the nuclear industry, through nuclear submarines (bipartisan support) or nuclear reactors (Coalition support).

The Albanese government was quick to accept the Coalition's AUKUS deal, which looks likely to bring the first nuclear-powered submarine to our ports in about eight years.

Nuclear subs offer strong military deterrence. But they come with a hard problem: how to manage the especially nasty radioactive waste at the end of a submarine's life.

Last night, Opposition Leader Peter Dutton pulled both together in his budget reply speech, asking:

Why is the technology which is safe for our submariners unsafe for our citizens?

The Coalition is giving us clear indications it will take a plan to build nuclear power stations to next year's election, though it is coy on where.

That would face a string of hurdles, not just changing Commonwealth and state laws currently banning nuclear power, but also needing to find communities willing to have a nuclear reactor. Like it or not, nuclear is appearing in Australia's future for the first time.

How did we get here?

Nuclear power has never been cost-effective in Australia. When the industry was starting in the US and UK in the 1950s, each Australian state had its own power grid, each too small scale for nuclear reactors.

The short-lived Gorton government proposed one on Commonwealth land at Jervis Bay, but the tenders for the project showed it was uneconomic.

Worldwide, the disastrous nuclear accidents at Chernobyl in 1986 and Fukushima in 2011 have led to understandable resistance from communities slated for a reactor.

Then there's the almost intractable problem of radioactive waste.

In Australia, successive governments have failed to find permanent storage for our low-level waste from nuclear medicine and research, much of it from the Lucas Heights research reactor. The most recent plan to store waste at Kimba, in South Australia, failed last year.

If this waste is buried under a few metres of earth, the radiation levels at the surface are not significantly above the background levels we all live with.

Even so, no community has yet been willing to have that waste buried in their area.

First Nations groups on remote Country are well aware of the damage done to people and natural areas by British nuclear weapons tests at Emu Fields and Maralinga in South Australia in the 1960s, so they are very reluctant to accept even low-level waste.

What's the issue with nuclear submarine waste?

Last year, Defence Minister Richard Marles said a waste dump would be located on current or future defence land. This might avoid some community pushback but is unlikely to quell fears.

This week, a Labor-chaired parliamentary committee called for the government to rule out accepting high-level waste from the submarines - specifically, the reactors and spent fuel from decommissioned submarines.

After fifty years of using this technology, many countries are still struggling with what to do with the resulting waste. Finland will soon open the world's first deep geological nuclear waste storage, a facility meant to last a million years. But countries such as the United States cannot find an acceptable location.

Because the submarine reactors use highly enriched, weapons-grade nuclear fuel, the waste is much nastier even than the ""high-level waste"" from nuclear power stations, with high levels of radioactive isotopes of cobalt and nickel.

Neither the US nor the United Kingdom have a long-term solution for dealing with their own nuclear sub waste.

Those countries could, under the wording of the draft AUKUS laws, argue for their waste to be stored in Australia, too.

This would be unpopular. When the 2016 South Australian Royal Commission proposed storing high-level waste from overseas nuclear power stations as a new source of revenue, a citizens' jury rejected the plan, concluding the risks were unacceptable.

Realistically, our government will do what US and UK governments have done for decades: store the waste temporarily and kick the can down the road.

What about nuclear power?

Since losing office in 2022, the Coalition has become pro-nuclear power. Political analysts see this positioning as a way for the Liberal and National parties to slow the renewable build, prolong coal power for the decades needed to build nuclear power, and attack Labor.

But while the politics are clear, the Coalition's position on nuclear is opaque.

For a few months late last year, the Coalition was in favour of ""small modular reactors"" rather than the expensive and slow-to-build large reactors built in the northern hemisphere. That plan ran into two problems. First, these reactors are still a gleam in the eyes of nuclear technologists. They do not yet exist. The American design promoted by the Coalition was cancelled due to cost blowouts.

The second problem is there really are economies of scale with nuclear reactors. France and the UK have concentrated on large reactors because doubling the size of reactors does not double the cost of generating electricity.

Even so, large reactors are now struggling to be economically competitive, even in countries such as France with significant cross-subsidies from nuclear weapons programs.

Old nuclear reactors which have written off the cost of construction are being closed because the operating and maintenance costs make their power more expensive than can be obtained from solar farms and wind turbines.

This year, the Coalition has switched back to old-fashioned large reactors.

Electricity from nuclear reactors costs three to four times as much as what can be provided by solar farms or wind turbines. Even adding storage to firm renewables leads to a price tag less than half that of nuclear. Reactors often take decades to build.

It is difficult to see the electoral appeal of a platform promising extra risks, more expensive energy and a slow build.

Where does that leave us? It's very unlikely Australia will ever have nuclear power. But it is very likely we will have to grapple with the spectre of high-level nuclear waste for the first time.

By 2050, estimated hydrogen production will require more than half of total electricity demand - so shouldn't we prioritize its most economic and efficient use?

Achieving net zero will require a focus on improving energy efficiency, direct electrification and energy storage, as well as decarbonizing hard-to-abate areas like heavy industry. In the last few years, hydrogen has been hyped as a 'silver bullet' - a solution to multiple challenges, from integrating green hydrogen production into existing energy infrastructure, including heat networks, and improving the efficiency of production.

Many governments focused on hydrogen as a pathway to net zero, despite the fact that today 99% of hydrogen is made from fossil fuels. Figures from the International Energy Agency suggest that green hydrogen amounts to less than 0.1% of hydrogen production (less than 0.08 million tonnes). Michael Liebreich, managing partner of Ecopragma Capital estimates that by 2035, managing the emissions from the 100 million tonnes per year of hydrogen currently being manufactured would require $2 trillion - ten times current global hydrogen subsidies.

There have been concerns about the potential deployment of green hydrogen being hyped and in 2023, a study from the Corporate Europe Observatory warned that 'Big Hydrogen' spends over €75.75 million a year on lobbying the EU, including leading fossil fuel companies, trade associations and think tanks.

It's clearly been effective. By 2021, according to KPMG research, ten countries had hydrogen strategies in place including Australia, Chile, Finland, Germany, Norway, Portugal and Spain, plus the European Union (EU). The UK published its hydrogen strategy in 2021, with then Business and Energy Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng saying that: ""By 2030 hydrogen could play an important role in decarbonising polluting, energy-intensive industries like chemicals, oil refineries, power and heavy transport like shipping, HGV lorries and trains."" The strategy set an ambition of 5GW of low carbon hydrogen production capacity by 2030 - the equivalent of replacing natural gas in powering around 3 million UK homes each year.

One of the most important elements for the scale up of green hydrogen is the expectation that it will rapidly fall in price, in the same way that wind and solar fell in price by 70-90% in a decade. Batteries are following suit but Michael Liebreich, managing partner of Ecopragma Capital says that hydrogen is unlikely to follow the same pathway because it's unlikely to follow the same cost curve, traditionally driven by scale-up and learning by doing.

The production cost of hydrogen is not specifically related to the technology, but rather the cost of electricity, the cost of compressors, tanks, civil works, power supplies etc which, Liebreich says, ""none of which are about to drop by a factor of ten."" Researchers at the Argonne National Laboratory in 2019 said that hydrogen production costs account for just 15% of its costs. Hydrogen's transportation and distribution costs are driven by its physics, which is complicated to address - and there is usually a cheaper alternative. At the same time there are other risks to consider. Large scale green hydrogen production is going to require vast amounts of land, water, and renewable energy.

In an insight paper by Kristian Høeg Madsen. co-head of hydrogen and James Samworth, co-head of energy transition at UK asset manager Schroders said: ""Many of hydrogen's uses are already being met by other fuels or technologies"" warning that hydrogen is ""not a panacea.""

All this means is that hydrogen is not necessarily the most economic or efficient solution for many decarbonization problems. Liebreich has warned that ""the biggest challenge facing low-emission hydrogen is that it is expensive to produce, expensive to transport, expensive to store, expensive to distribute and expensive to use.""

That has become more important as inflation and the energy and cost of living crises has changed the economic environment has changed. In fact, hydrogen-dedicated renewable energy capacity is now expected to grow by 45GW between 2022 and 2028, some 35% lower than forecast a year ago due to slow progress on real-world implementation, according to the IEA's latest Renewables report.

Liebreich is well known for his creation of the hydrogen ladder, an in-depth use case analysis which integrates the many variables that can affect hydrogen and its economic use. He believes that we should focus on areas where there are few options for decarbonisation, where electrification isn't possible, from heavy industry, steel production, cement production or ammonium production etc.

That means that the central question should be how best to deploy green hydrogen. Rapid upscaling for hard to abate sectors like heavy industry and long-distance transport make sense. However it is in hydrogen's potential as an energy storage option, whether for seasonal storage or for grid balancing, that it is perhaps most exciting. It could be used to improve network efficiencies and cut overall network costs dramatically.

The International Energy Agency has made clear that electrification and renewable energy are central to the net zero transition. Yet curtailment, where renewable energy production is deliberately reduced because it's generating more power than the grid can absorb or store, not only wastes renewable generation but increases system costs. Addressing this could also have an impact on consumer power prices, as according to Carbon Tracker research, unresolved grid bottlenecks in the UK risk adding £200 to annual household bills by 2030.

The latest Impact Paper from Danish manufacturing giant Danfoss, Green Hydrogen: A Critical Balancing Act, highlights that from January 2021 to April 2023, £1.5 billion has been spent in the UK to curtail more than 6.5 TWh of wind power. But these costs could be slashed by producing green hydrogen during periods of high production of renewables, as a means of supporting demand side flexibility, by making use of otherwise discarded renewable energy generation.

Of course it's not just a question of ensuring the use of renewables generation - hydrogen production costs fall with efficiency. While current conversion processes incur an energy loss of approximately 30%, existing technology can minimize this loss. For instance, efficient converters converting alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC) for electrolyzers can increase overall production efficiency by roughly 1%. Though seemingly small, a saving of 1% of the electricity demand in 2050 would be enough to power London for almost four years.

Another way to increase efficiency would be to ensure the use, not only of the hydrogen, but other by-products of the electrolysis process. The conversion of electricity to hydrogen today creates an energy loss of roughly 30%, but there are technologies available to reduce this loss and reuse by-products like oxygen and excess heat.

The oxygen generated through electrolysis can be released into the atmosphere, or it can be put to use. Through strategic planning and sector integration the oxygen can be repurposed in e.g. wastewater treatment, for medical purposes and to boost energy efficiency in furnaces.

Hydrogen production also creates huge amounts of excess heat. In the EU alone, about 114 TWh can be theoretically recovered already by 2030, enough to cover Germany's current domestic heating more than twice. In many cases the excess heat to can be used for space and water heating, or for low-temperature industrial processes such as drying, processing hot water, district or domestic heating and product pre-heating etc. In the US such processes constitute around 35% of industrial demand and fulfilling this would maximise use lowering production costs.

Mika Kulju, president of Danfoss Power Electronics and Drives said that the economic and efficient use of hydrogen requires system level thinking - ensuring effective network management. It's a government level challenge, to look at all the options and design an effective low carbon system. Regulations and incentives need to be aligned and says Kulju: ""It's about balancing supply and demand in a new energy system.""

He says: ""The potential of hydrogen as a clean energy carrier is immense. But it must be produced efficiently to minimize costs, and we need to deploy it judiciously.

""It was anticipated that the service outage after the first operating cycle would be very laborious,"" TVO said in a statement. ""As OL3 is the largest nuclear power plant unit in Europe, the amount of equipment and components is extremely high. All in all, about 7,500 work phases were carried out during the OL3 outage.""

In addition to refuelling, the most important activities carried out during the annual outage included preventive maintenance on the protection system, washing of steam generators, generator maintenance, pressure equipment inspections, leak-tightness tests on containment isolation valves and servicing of pressuriser safety relief valves.

The plant also underwent a significant number of different periodic tests and maintenance activities during the outage.

Olkiluoto-3, the first EPR plant in Europe, began commercial operation in May 2023. TVO said Olkiluoto-3 is by far the most efficient electricity production plant in Finland and produces about 14% of the country's electricity.

Finland has five commercial nuclear reactors - two at Loviisa, owned and operated by Fortum, and three at Olkiluoto.

The Generation III EPR was designed in France, where an EPR is nearing operation at Flamanville-3, a project that has seen delays and cost overruns.

Two other EPR units in China have begun commercial operation. Taishan-1 in China was the first EPR unit to begin commercial operation, in December 2018. A second EPR at Taishan began commercial operation in September 2019.

Europe's largest nuclear reactor, Olkiluoto 3 (OL3) began generating electricity again early Thursday after scheduled annual maintenance dragged on more than a month longer than expected, pushing electricity prices up in Finland.

The unit was plugged back into the main grid at 1.15am Thursday after 74 days of maintenance.

OL3 began full commercial production just over a year ago, some 14 years behind schedule. The project was first launched in 2005.

The schedule for its first annual maintenance was changed several times and eventually extended by more than a month. The maintenance, which started at the beginning of March, was originally supposed to be completed on 8 April.

In a press release on Thursday, plant owner Teollisuuden Voima (TVO) blamed the delays on issues such as a longer-than-expected time required to shut down the unit and the technical problems detected during the maintenance.

According to TVO, valuable lessons were learned regarding the planning and implementation of future maintenance.

Despite the delays, electricity production director Marjo Mustonen expressed satisfaction with the end result.

""The planned work was carried out safely. The main goal of annual maintenance is always safe implementation. The pressure was intense, but our organisation was able to react well to unexpected situations,"" she said in a press release on Thursday.

Olkiluoto 3 accounts for about 14 percent of Finland's electricity production.

Lisa Doughten, Director of the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs' Financing and Partnerships Division, speaking on behalf of Martin Griffiths, Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, said that her Office recorded over 700 civilian casualties across Ukraine in April, including 129 deaths, a significant increase from March. Since 22 March, there have been five waves of attacks on the country's energy infrastructure, particularly in Kharkiv and Dnipro regions, causing rolling power outages and affecting millions nationwide. Moreover, attacks on ports are threatening their ability to export grain at a time of rising food insecurity.

Despite the spike in hostilities and the related risks, ""the UN and its humanitarian partners are doing everything we can to reach people in need of support"", she said. From the beginning of January until the end of March, 3.6 million people across the country received some form of assistance, and so far this year, 12 inter-agency convoys have delivered vital supplies to 20,000 people in front-line areas. Yet reaching civilians in areas of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia -- currently under Moscow's occupation -- remains a challenge, she observed, urging all parties to facilitate rapid, unimpeded humanitarian relief to the 1.5 million people who require life-saving assistance.

Caitlin Howarth, Director of the Conflict Observatory at the Yale Humanitarian Research Lab, said that 223 damage events across 23 of Ukraine's 24 oblasts were identified between 1 October 2022 and 30 April 2023. ""That's a rate of over 7 damage events identified per week, with peak impact timed for the height of winter,"" she stated, noting that these ""strikes of retribution"" -- as described by Russian Federation politicians -- mean extended periods without water, productivity lost, education fragmented and ""blackouts that last longer than the emergency batteries on life-saving health-care equipment"".

Against this backdrop, she asserted: ""As Russia's officials have comprehensively planned and executed their destruction of Ukraine's critical infrastructure, so should the international community systematically counteract this devastation."" She called on it to ""target the missiles"" through enforced sanctions; ""prepare for emergency"" by mobilizing resources today to ensure civilian survival this winter; and ""let Russia pay"" by releasing Russian Federation assets seized under global sanctions to fund these emergency preparations. ""Above all else, do not underestimate the scale of this threat,"" she stressed.

In the ensuing discussion, many delegates condemned Moscow's massive attacks on Ukraine's civilian population and infrastructure, noting that the worrying developments in Kharkiv Oblast demonstrate the humanitarian impact of the intensified hostilities. Several -- among them the representative of Denmark, also speaking for Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden -- expressed support for the upcoming first peace summit on Ukraine, which will take place in Switzerland on 15-16 June.

The representative of France observed that Moscow's attacks on civilian populations and infrastructure may constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity for which no impunity must be allowed. He welcomed the International Criminal Court's arrest warrants issued on 5 March 2024 against senior officials of the Russian Air Force and the Russian Black Sea Fleet for the campaign of missile strikes against Ukrainian civilian energy infrastructure.

Guyana's speaker expressed particular concern about the continuing attacks on the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, stating: ""This cannot and must not continue"".

Calling for an immediate halt to ""this destructive campaign against Ukraine's energy infrastructure,"" the United Kingdom's representative said that Moscow aims to terrorize civilians, obstruct livelihoods and businesses, and ultimately break down Ukraine's resolve. However, ""Ukrainians will not allow Russia to do that"", she said. She reiterated London's commitment of $55 million to the Energy Community's Ukraine Energy Support Fund, and over $214 million in overall support to the country's energy sector.

Echoing her sentiment, the United States' delegate recalled that his country recently announced $1 billion in new assistance for Ukraine, which includes urgently needed air-defence equipment. And since February 2022, Washington, D.C., has provided nearly $2.9 billion in aid to Ukraine and its neighbours -- including life-saving support for the 3.4 million people that remain internally displaced and the nearly 6.5 million refugees. The speaker for Sierra Leone called for fully funding the 2024 humanitarian response plan for Ukraine, while the representative of the European Union, in its capacity as observer, pledged that ""the EU will continue to support Ukraine for as long as it takes.""

The speaker for Poland said that the purpose of Moscow's barbaric actions is clear: to destroy the lives of Ukrainian people and make large parts of Ukraine uninhabitable. In this context, he voiced particular concern over the ongoing deportations and transfers of Ukrainian children and their forced ""Russification"". Slovenia's delegate noted the death rate of children jumped nearly 40 per cent in the first quarter of 2024, compared to the same period last year.

For his part, the Russian Federation's representative pointed to Western countries' failure to condemn the latest terrorist attack on 12 May, when the peaceful Russian city of Belgorod once again was targeted by a large-scale missile strike, killing 15 civilians. Western countries continue to provide long-range weapons to the Kyiv junta in ""the illusory hope of inflicting a strategic defeat upon the Russian Federation"". However, this will only prolong the Kyiv regime and cost the lives of tens -- if not hundreds -- of thousands of ordinary Ukrainians.

Ukraine's delegate said that Moscow launched a new offensive on 10 May, targeting the northern Kharkiv region with the immediate aim of taking the city of Vovchansk. While Ukrainian forces are holding the line to prevent Russian troops from advancing to Kharkiv -- the second-largest Ukrainian city -- he said that heavy defensive battles are under way, and the situation remains extremely dangerous for local civilians. Noting that Ukraine is now ""the only country in the world being attacked by ballistic and cruise missiles almost daily,"" he stated: ""The more active the world is now in restoring a comprehensive, just and lasting peace for Ukraine, the more likely it is that others in the world will not become the victims of similar aggression.""

LISA DOUGHTEN, Director, Financing and Partnerships Division, Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, speaking on behalf of Martin Griffiths, Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, said that her Office recorded over 700 civilian casualties across Ukraine in April, including 129 deaths. While 90 per cent of the casualties occurred in Ukrainian-controlled territory, strikes have also been reported inside the Russian Federation, including on Sunday in the Belgorod region, reportedly causing several deaths and damage to residential homes. Attacks on civilian infrastructure across Ukraine have intensified. ""Since 22 March 2024, the UN and its partners have seen five waves of attacks directed against the Ukraine's energy infrastructure,"" she said. Kharkiv and Dnipro regions are particularly affected. The country's Energy Ministry reported that up to 250,000 residents have experienced rolling power outages in Kharkiv and ongoing restrictions in Dnipro since March.

Noting ""the stark impact of these power cuts on the most vulnerable"", she said that they have temporarily left millions of households across the country with no power, water or gas needed for cooking, heating and hygiene. ""Children who rely on online schooling are not able to learn. Older persons with mobility impairments, persons with disabilities who use wheelchairs or other assistive devices, and mothers with small children are unable to leave multi-story apartment buildings to access food and medical support,"" she said. She cited a new pattern of attacks on railway infrastructure in the east and south -- with OHCHR recording 10 such attacks in Government-controlled territory in April alone. Also concerning are attacks on factories and production plants, limiting the availability of locally procured humanitarian goods, and on port infrastructure, threatening their ability to export grain and other agricultural commodities at a time of rising food insecurity.

Reported attacks damaging energy infrastructure and oil refineries in the Russian Federation ""risk enflaming the war further and worsening its humanitarian impacts"", she said. ""The intensification in hostilities is making the delivery of humanitarian assistance all the more dangerous. Nevertheless, the UN and its humanitarian partners are doing everything we can to reach people in need of support, despite the enormous risks,"" she said. From the beginning of January until the end of March, 3.6 million people across the country received some form of humanitarian assistance, and so far this year 12 inter-agency convoys have delivered vital supplies to 20,000 people in front-line areas. Assistance has also included the delivery of health-care services to nearly 860,000 people, and emergency water supplies for over 1.2 million people. Humanitarian protection activities have been expanded, including gender-based violence support for people newly displaced by hostilities.

Commending Ukraine's Government for the extra support it has announced for survivors of conflict-related sexual violence -- in the form of financial reparations and medical and psychological assistance -- she said donors have so far given $669 million, 22 per cent, of the $3.1 billion needed under the Ukraine Humanitarian Needs and Response Plan. ""Another challenge remains reaching civilians in areas of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia that are currently under the occupation of the Russian Federation,"" she observed, voicing concern over the estimated 1.5 million people requiring life-saving assistance there and urging all parties to allow and facilitate the rapid, unimpeded humanitarian relief. This war has caused the death and injury of tens of thousands of people in Ukraine, displaced millions, caused immense suffering and left more than 14 million people -- 40 per cent of the population -- in need of humanitarian assistance, she said, calling on the Council ""to seek an end to it"".

CAITLIN HOWARTH, Director of the Conflict Observatory at the Yale Humanitarian Research Lab, recalling recent missile strikes on three thermal plants and two hydroelectric power plants in Ukraine, noted that -- by some counts -- ""near every single power plant"" has been targeted. Citing a report released by her Lab on 29 February 2024 documenting verified damage to Ukraine's power-generation-and-transmission infrastructure that occurred between 1 October 2022 and 30 April 2023, she said that 223 damage events across 23 of Ukraine's 24 oblasts were identified. She noted: ""That's a rate of over 7 damage events identified per week, with peak impact timed for the height of winter."" On 8 May 2024, almost 12 Ukrainian power facilities were reportedly struck in a single day and, since March 2024, successful targeting of power-generation facilities has further slashed Ukraine's capacity. ""Each hit compounds the problem,"" she observed.

She went on to point out that Russian Federation officials have clearly stated their objectives for targeting Ukraine's energy infrastructure: first, to advance Moscow's military objectives; second, to retaliate for Ukraine's purported actions; and third, to inflict harm on civilians to compel Kyiv to submit to negotiations favourable to Moscow. She stressed that, while the first justification ""may"" be lawful under the law of war, the other two likely violate international humanitarian law. Further, while the Lab did not assess the degree of dual-use afforded by the energy infrastructure documented in its report, the law of armed conflict prohibits attacks on both civilian and military targets if the attack causes excessive civilian casualties, damage to civilian objects or a combination of these relative to any concrete or direct military advantage anticipated. Recalling a definition of Moscow's campaign by a State Duma member -- that it is aimed against Ukraine's ""whole energy infrastructure"" -- she emphasized: ""A comprehensive campaign, by its own definition, defies proportionality.""

She noted further comments by Russian Federation politicians that ""strikes of retribution"" on Ukraine's power infrastructure will make Ukrainians ""sit there without gas and without electricity and without everything"". Asking and answering what this means, she said it means extended periods without water, productivity lost, education fragmented and ""blackouts that last longer than the emergency batteries on life-saving health-care equipment"". Against that backdrop, she urged: ""As Russia's officials have comprehensively planned and executed their destruction of Ukraine's critical infrastructure, so should the international community systematically counteract this devastation."" To this end, she called on the international community to ""target the missiles"" through enforced sanctions; ""prepare for emergency"" by mobilizing resources today to ensure civilian survival this winter; and ""let Russia pay"" by releasing Russian Federation assets seized under global sanctions to fund these emergency preparations. ""Above all else, do not underestimate the scale of this threat,"" she underscored.

Statements

The representative of France said that the Russian Federation has shown no concern about its obligation to minimize injury to civilians and damage to civilian objects. These practices may constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity for which no impunity must be allowed. The International Criminal Court's arrest warrants issued on 5 March 2024 against senior officials of the Russian Air Force and the Russian Black Sea Fleet for the campaign of missile strikes against Ukrainian civilian energy infrastructure are a decisive step. He also welcomed the renewal of the mandate of the Human Rights Council's Independent Commission of Inquiry, which documents indiscriminate attacks against Ukraine's populations and critical infrastructure. He noted that mitigating the humanitarian consequences of this war by strengthening the resilience of strategic infrastructure will be a key topic at the peace conference hosted by Switzerland in June.

The representative of Ecuador expressed concern over the continued suffering in Ukraine and risk to regional and global instability. ""The statistics are alarming,"" he said, citing increased intensity and frequency of attacks against essential infrastructure, the destruction of hospitals and schools, and attacks disabling several energy facilities this month, affecting millions of people's access to electricity and clean water. The impact of attacks in the Kharkiv region has been equally devastating, with numerous civilian casualties and a significant increase in internal displacement. Condemning these attacks, he declared: ""International humanitarian law is explicit in its prohibition of attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure."" The warring parties must adhere strictly to the principles of proportionality, distinction and precaution to avoid escalating this cycle of suffering.

The representative of Guyana sounded alarm over the unrelenting attacks on residential buildings, schools, medical and energy facilities and grain ports since the start of the war. ""These attacks were often unrelated to frontline engagement and appeared to have little regard for the requirement of proportionality and military necessity,"" she observed. She noted the international community continues to witness large-scale coordinated attacks on civilian infrastructure, including dozens of energy facilities, resulting in disrupted access to electricity and water supply for millions of people in multiple locations. They are not only causing incidental civilian harm through the disruption of access to critical services but also resulting in loss of civilian lives and injury to those in near-to-target sites. There have also been attacks on the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, despite the many calls to end the attacks on or near the site, she cautioned, stating: ""This cannot and must not continue"".

The representative of Japan expressed regret that the Council heard another briefing ""about the many civilian casualties caused by the clear violation of the UN Charter by a permanent member of the Security Council"". Underscoring that attacks against civilian populations and infrastructure are ""clearly prohibited"" under international law, he also condemned Pyongyang's export and Moscow's procurement of ballistic missiles -- as well as the latter's use of these missiles against Ukraine. This transfer -- a clear violation of relevant Council resolutions -- supports Moscow's war of aggression and increases the suffering of the Ukrainian people, he stressed, adding: ""We continue to monitor closely what North Korea gains in return."" He also detailed his country's support of Ukraine's energy infrastructure, which includes the provision of two large autotransformers, six mobile-power-supply vehicles and five advanced gas turbines. ""Japan remains committed to supporting the Ukrainian people through bolstering the electricity and heating supplies in Ukraine,"" he said.

The representative of Algeria expressed grave concern about the destruction of civilian infrastructure, including energy and power plants. In addition, the worsening tensions and pursuit of hostilities have had dangerous repercussions on the international arena. He reiterated an appeal for diplomatic efforts to avoid a further humanitarian crisis and address human suffering without distinction. Civilians must be protected in line with the UN Charter and international law, including international humanitarian law. He called on all parties to set aside the mindset of confrontation and find what is needed to restore comprehensive and constructive dialogue.

The representative of the United Kingdom observed that this spring, the Russian Federation has targeted power plants, electricity sub-stations and gas storage facilities across Ukraine. Calling for an immediate halt to ""this destructive campaign against Ukraine's energy infrastructure,"" she said that millions of people already face disruption to power, heating and water supply. ""These attacks are making an appalling humanitarian situation even worse,"" she said, noting that this is especially the case for frontline communities, as the attacks and lack of power hamper humanitarian partners' communications and movements. This pattern of aggression continues in an attempt to terrorize civilians, obstruct livelihoods and businesses, and ultimately break down Ukraine's resolve; however, she stated, ""Ukrainians will not allow Russia to do that"". London has committed $55 million to the Energy Community's Ukraine Energy Support Fund and over $214 million in overall support to the energy sector in Ukraine, she added.

The representative of the United States said that the Russian Federation's large-scale attacks on Ukrainian cities and infrastructure are a ""clear escalation"" that threaten critical services. ""Next week, this Council will be subjected to yet another meeting where Russia will claim that Western arms are to blame for prolonging the war it started,"" he noted, urging that Moscow ""need only look in the mirror"" to understand why more than 50 countries provided support to Ukraine's forces. In April 2024, the United States announced $1 billion in new assistance for Ukraine, which includes urgently needed air-defence equipment. Further, since February 2022, the United States has provided nearly $2.9 billion in humanitarian assistance to Ukraine and its neighbours -- including life-saving support for the 3.4 million that remain internally displaced and the nearly 6.5 million refugees. He added that newly approved supplemental funding will help maintain the humanitarian response amidst ""unabated"" attacks on civilian populations and infrastructure.

The representative of the Russian Federation said that if Western colleagues were striving to convey to the international community at least ""an iota of the truth"" about what's happening in Ukraine, then they would not be sweeping it under the rug. Rather, they would condemn the latest terrorist attack on 12 May, when the peaceful Russian city of Belgorod once again was targeted by a large-scale missile strike. A residential building was partially destroyed by a missile launched from Ukrainian-controlled territory, killing 15 civilians. He also highlighted the culpability of Western countries that continue to provide long-range weapons to the Kyiv junta in ""the illusory hope of inflicting a strategic defeat upon the Russian Federation.""

On 20 May, the Council will discuss these destructive actions of North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) countries. In early May, the United Kingdom's Foreign Minister, David Cameron, made a revelatory statement that the weapons provided by London could be used to carry out strikes against Russian territories, including areas beyond the special military operations' confines. The formulas or plans advanced by the Ukrainian henchman and his Western sponsors are so divorced from reality. Any discussion on them will become a pure loss of time, and ""you will become complicit"" in prolonging the Kyiv regime, with the cost of this being tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of the lives of ordinary Ukrainians.

The representative of Slovenia noted that, since early April, over 1,000 drone and missile attacks were recorded across Ukraine, forcing thousands to flee as their homes are being destroyed. She noted a reported 140 educational facilities were destroyed or damaged in attacks across the country in 2024 alone. And according to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the death rate of children jumped nearly 40 per cent in the first quarter of 2024, compared to the same period last year. She further condemned Moscow's use of cluster munitions in its bombardment of Odessa in late April, stressing that ""using such weapons in a densely populated area is against all rules of international humanitarian law"". ""These attacks seek to impair Ukraine's economy and are obviously not directed against military targets. This is a clear violation of international humanitarian law and it needs to stop now,"" she said, adding: ""Ukrainian civilians have suffered too long. We call on Russia to stop with its subversive actions and give peace a chance.""

The representative of Sierra Leone expressed concern that attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure have resulted in major disruptions of essential services, such as electricity, water and gas to medical facilities, manufacturing industries and places of work for ""a significant portion of the population"". This slows production and reduces economic activity, and he also expressed alarm over the impact on health-care facilities -- including those with incubators and other life-saving devices. On that, he noted that such facilities ""in some cases had to resort to the use of batteries that ran out before the re-establishment of power -- putting the lives of many at risk"". Given the devastating impact of the conflict on the civilian population, he called on the parties involved to adhere to their obligations under international law to protect civilian populations and infrastructure -- including energy facilities. He also called for the full funding of the 2024 humanitarian response plan for Ukraine.

The representative of Malta noted the Russian Federation's aerial assaults against Ukrainian power generation and transmission facilities in several regions last week. This deadly trend encompasses daily drone, missile, rocket and artillery attacks in Kharkiv, Odesa, Kherson, Dnipropetrovsk and Donetsk regions -- ""yet another example of Russia's disregard for human life."" As of today, more than 800 heat supply facilities have been destroyed or damaged and the attacks have caused more than $1 billion worth of damage to the energy sector, she said, expressing full support for the important work undertaken by the Register of Damage Caused by the Aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine.

The representative of Switzerland condemned the massive attacks on the civilian population and infrastructure across Ukraine, which have killed and injured civilians in populated areas. Last week alone, several children were injured, and schools and a hospital were damaged, she observed, stating: ""As Ukraine fights for its future, all those who can build it -- including children -- must be protected."" Noting an increase in attacks on critical energy infrastructures, she said that, in total, nine regions across Ukraine -- including those far from the front lines -- have experienced disruptions to their electricity supply in the past week. In addition, the situation around the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant remains worrying. Determined to do everything in its power to contribute to a just and lasting peace in Ukraine, Switzerland will host the first High-Level Summit for Peace in Ukraine on 15 and 16 June, she said, stressing the need ""to define together a road map on how to involve both sides in a future peace process"".

The representative of the Republic of Korea underscored that Moscow's attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure are unacceptable, as targeting such infrastructure violates international humanitarian law. He further stressed that, today, critical energy infrastructure ""holds far more significance in people's daily lives than decades ago"" when such law was created. In addition to hindering millions of Ukrainians' access to electricity in the short-term, the destruction of energy infrastructure has long-enduring impacts on the humanitarian situation in that country. A recent report by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) highlights a domino effect where such destruction leads to the disruption of other basic services such as water and sanitation. Noting that the lack of such services can impair the operation of hospitals and the viability of food production -- leading to the spread of disease, death and displacement -- he underscored that the Russian Federation's illegal invasion ""must end now to save lives and restore humanity"".

The representative of China said that his country is neither the creator of the Ukraine crisis nor a party to it. It has long campaigned for peace and a political settlement. The sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries should be respected. At the same time, the legitimate security concerns of all countries should be taken seriously. In his recent visits to France, Serbia and Hungary, President Xi Jinping had an in-depth exchange of views with European leaders on the Ukraine crisis. China and Europe should work together to oppose the spillover and escalation of the fighting, create conditions for peace talks, and safeguard international energy, food security and the stability of the global supply chain. His country and France also agreed to seize the Paris Olympics as an opportunity to advocate a worldwide ceasefire.

The representative of Mozambique, Council President for May, spoke in his national capacity to highlight the devastating implications of the war in Ukraine for the humanitarian situation in the country. Noting that ""the prospects for a mutually accepted solution remain elusive,"" mainly due to the conflicting parties' firm belief in the primacy of military and zero-sum game logic at the expense of a cooperative approach, he underscored that the Council's consistent calls for the immediate cessation of hostilities ""can no longer be ignored"". Against this backdrop, he stressed the need to ensure the protection of civilians and to facilitate full, safe, rapid and unhindered access for humanitarian personnel.

The representative of Ukraine reported that the Russian Federation launched a new offensive on 10 May, targeting the northern Kharkiv region with the immediate aim of taking the city of Vovchansk. While Ukrainian forces are holding the line to prevent Moscow's troops from advancing to Kharkiv - the second-largest Ukrainian city -- he said that heavy defensive battles are under way and the situation remains extremely dangerous for local civilians. He added: ""Russian forces persist in razing Ukrainian towns to the ground without regard for the local population's suffering, with Vovchansk becoming the latest victim -- akin to Bakhmut or Maryinka."" Detailing numerous attacks committed by ""a country that called itself a friend of the UN Charter"", he noted that Ukraine is now ""the only country in the world being attacked by ballistic and cruise missiles almost daily"". Major cities have borne the brunt of these assaults, with devastating consequences.

""All the above crimes cannot be committed perpetually,"" he stressed, noting that a summit on peace in Ukraine will take place in Switzerland on 15-16 June. While stating that ""we have invited all peace-loving nations, and each nation can really bring peace closer"", he said that -- meanwhile -- Moscow intensifies its lies about ""a so-called peace deal that Ukraine and Russia were allegedly close to in spring 2022"". However, it is the Russian Federation President who has been ruining peace in Ukraine for more than a decade -- by occupying Crimea and parts of the Donbas in 2014, by obstructing the Minsk and Normandy peace processes, by launching a full-scale war of aggression and then by refusing to end it. Urging nations to attend the peace summit, he said: ""The more active the world is now in restoring a comprehensive, just and lasting peace for Ukraine, the more likely it is that others in the world will not become the victims of similar aggression.""

The representative of Germany said that the Russian Federation is attacking the foundation of the United Nations and global peace and security. As a nuclear State, it is invading its neighbour that has renounced nuclear weapons. By employing arms imported from Iran and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, it defies Security Council resolutions. To shield its illegal activities, it is dismantling instruments of this Council, such as the Panel of Experts for sanctions against Pyongyang. His country supports Ukraine with political, humanitarian and military means. Air defence systems supplied by Germany are actively helping to protect Ukrainian cities. Berlin has also invested in humanitarian relief efforts. The upcoming peace summit in Switzerland offers a unique platform. However, a just and lasting way out is only possible if Moscow renounces its objective of conquest and annexation, he stressed.

The representative of Estonia, also speaking on behalf of Latvia and Lithuania, said that every month, the Russian Federation uses over 130 types of missiles -- including those provided by Pyongyang -- over 320 Shahed drones and around 900 guided aerial bombs against Ukraine. As of late, chemical weapons can also be added to that list. ""These weapons are systematically used to kill and maim Ukrainian civilians, destroy homes, schools, hospitals and places of cultural heritage, attack food storage facilities and wipe out Ukrainian energy infrastructure,"" he stated. In total, Moscow's bombs have destroyed over 80 per cent of Ukrainian thermal power plants and 50 per cent of hydroelectric power plants.

He also highlighted that country's pattern of ""double-tap"" attacks targeting civilians and the rescue workers helping them -- ""the trademarks of Russia's aggression"". Accordingly, he underlined the need to ensure the delivery of humanitarian aid and the restoration of the energy infrastructure across Ukraine, noting that Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have altogether contributed over $100 million worth of humanitarian aid to the people of Ukraine and ""will continue to support Ukraine until the aggressor is defeated.""

The representative of the European Union, in its capacity as observer, underscored that ""every discussion on Ukraine must start by restating one unequivocal fact -- Russia's illegal, unprovoked and unjustified war of aggression constitutes a manifest violation of international law"". This is why that country must cease its attacks on Ukraine's civilian infrastructure now, why its leadership must be held fully accountable and why all nations must come together in support of a just, lasting and comprehensive peace in Ukraine. Stressing that Moscow's indiscriminate attacks further exacerbate a dire humanitarian situation in Ukraine where over 14 million people require assistance -- ""you have heard so much about this here today"" -- he reported that the European Union has stepped up its provision of aid, including power generators and transformers.

The Russian Federation, however, has an obligation to allow such aid to reach all those in need, he said, also recalling the March 2022 legally binding order from the International Court of Justice for Moscow to immediately suspend its military operations in Ukraine. He also stated that third parties must immediately cease providing material support to the Russian Federation's war of aggression -- ""or other kinds of cuddling"". Reiterating support for peace in Ukraine, he welcomed Switzerland's initiative to host a peace summit in June and called on all States to participate. ""The EU will continue to support Ukraine for as long as it takes,"" he added and, to Moscow, he said: ""Stop your illegal war, and the illegal and inhumane means you are using to pursue it.""

The representative of Poland said that the Russian Federation is seeking to degrade the Ukrainian economy and society, making large parts of Ukraine uninhabitable. The purpose of these barbaric actions is clear: to destroy the lives of Ukrainian people and intimidate Ukraine and those who support it. In this context, he was particularly appalled by the ongoing deportations and transfers of Ukrainian children and their forced ""Russification"". Welcoming Switzerland's initiative to host a peace summit for Ukraine in June, he voiced support for President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's peace formula as a plan for a just, comprehensive and lasting peace in Ukraine and for the enduring security on the European continent.

The representative of Denmark, speaking also for Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden, condemned Moscow's systematic and detrimental attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure. Noting that since 22 March 2024 there have been five massive attacks damaging over 80 per cent of Ukraine's non-nuclear power plants, she pointed out that this has included dangerous attacks on hydroelectric infrastructure which increase the risk of environmental disaster. She extended the Nordic countries' full support to the upcoming first peace summit on Ukraine in Switzerland, expressing hope that many countries will join. The Russian Federation's aggression and its detrimental global consequences ""demand united efforts"" firmly based on international law, including the UN Charter, and in line with Ukraine's peace formula.",globalsecurity.org,news,GlobalSecurity.org,John Pike,-0.2941176470588235,453549670,37,,eng-9568376

While celebrating May Day this year, many people may have missed what could turn out to be a major piece of news for Finland's future.

It was the announcement of a 45-million-euro grant in aid by the EU's European Hydrogen Bank to the Finnish company Nordic Ren-Gas, which aims to build a production plant for renewable fuels in Lahti.

The company was judged to be the most competitive of the hundreds of applicants for funding by the bank.

Janne Peljo, Chief Policy Adviser on Climate and Biodiversity at the Confederation of Finnish Industries (EK), lists the advantages of the Lahti project, which in principle are the advantages of all Finnish hydrogen projects:

Of these, the affordability of electricity in particular may sound surprising to the general public when they look at their home utilities bill.

But, for industry it can be described as cheap. ""In fact, the price of electricity in Finland was the cheapest in Europe last year,"" says Petteri Laaksonen, Research Director of the School of Energy Systems Department at LUT University.

The price of electricity plays a key role in the production of hydrogen. The production of green hydrogen, in turn, requires energy produced from renewable resources. More and more renewable electricity generating capacity is being built in Finland all the time.

LUT University has calculated that electricity production in Finland could be increased tenfold.

This has been modelled in the LUT-led Hydrogen and Carbon Value Chains in Green Electrification project, which is just being completed.

""Even with tight constraints, we can produce more than 1,000 terawatt-hours of electricity per year, compared with something like 80 terawatt-hours last year,"" says Laaksonen.

Finland's competitiveness in hydrogen production is based on the fact that the raw material is cheap and will become cheaper as production increases.

In early May, the Geological Survey of Finland (GTK) published a map showing high concentrations of naturally occurring hydrogen in Finland. ""Ready-made"" natural hydrogen is much more efficient for energy production than when produced artificially through means such as electrolysis.

""Hydrogen is used to make fuels, plastics, glues and solvents, among other things. However, the needs of the chemical industry are a bigger part than fuels,"" notes Laaksonen.

According to Laaksonen, in the future, electricity will be a raw material for not just for hydrogen production, but for ""almost everything"".

""Huge amounts of electricity will be needed. In that respect, we have an incredibly competitive advantage. In summer there is a lot of sunshine and in winter there are good winds,"" Laaksonen points out.

The main competition for the hydrogen industry in Finland and the Nordic countries is found in the Iberian Peninsula, which is able to compete in electricity generation with its focus on solar power.

However, Laaksonen does not consider the competition as particularly fierce.

""Electricity demand will grow on average three to four times over from today's level to feed the needs of the large chemical industry. We need regions capable of producing it. For us, as well as Spain, Portugal and the Nordic countries, this is a tall order,"" says Laaksonen.

""Green hydrogen production will be seen all over Europe, but Spain, Portugal and the Nordic countries will be particularly competitive. The competition will be mainly between these two big regions,"" adds Peljo.

According to the Confederation of Finnish Industries (EK), there are currently more than 14 billion euros worth of hydrogen projects in the works in Finland. These projects are at different stages, and not all of them will necessarily ever come to fruition.

The hydrogen cluster that they form estimates that, if implemented, they could create as many as 100,000 jobs in Finland by 2035.

The most conservative estimate by LUT University researchers is that tens of thousands of new industrial jobs will be created in the sector.

""We will certainly have to accept work-based immigration. The change over the coming decades will be so great that if the opportunity is taken to the full, we'll start running out of Finnish workers,"" Laaksonen explains.

""Although Finland may have joined the hydrogen investment race a few years behind our neighbours or competitors, Finland is catching up very well at the moment,"" says Peljo.

Before the hydrogen industry can fully kick off, there is an issue to be resolved which relates to the downstream processing of hydrogen into fuels such as methanol, and that is the need for a supply of biomass-based carbon dioxide.

According to Laaksonen, the forest industry has been exploring the possibility of producing methanol from biomass-based dioxide, ""In practice, biomass-based carbon dioxide comes from pulp mills, and the pulp producers have not yet made a commitment on this issue.""

Methanol plays a major role as a basic raw material for chemicals. In Finland, biomass-based carbon dioxide would be widely available. In fact, Finland is probably the second largest producer of biomass-based carbon dioxide in Europe.

Laaksonen calls for an industrial strategy that would enable the hydrogen sector to grow dramatically.

""We are in the same situation as Norway in the 1970s when they discovered oil. When the potential of hydrogen is fully exploited, we will no longer have any worries about the national debt or care for the elderly, or anything else,"" he argues.",yle.fi,news,Yle.fi,,0.3019607843137255,453548153,92,"https://images.cdn.yle.fi/image/upload/c_crop,x_0,y_0,w_7032,h_3955/w_1200,ar_1.91,c_fill/q_auto:eco,f_auto,fl_lossy/v1684236834/39-111467464636920ddbbc",

May 16 (Interfax) - Ukraine has recently received 42 shipments of energy equipment weighing over 600 tonnes as humanitarian assistance, Ukrainian media said, citing the Energy Ministry.

""In particular, the aid has been provided by Germany, Latvia, Norway, the United Arab Emirates, Ireland, Poland, Finland, Sweden, and the Netherlands,"" the ministry said.

The cargo includes over 230 generators, a powerful high-voltage transformer, 880 drums of transformer oil, over 25 kilometers of wires and cables, gas pipes, and various electrical equipment.

Twenty years after Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania joined the EU, their electricity grids remain synchronised with Russian and Belarusian grids, which means that electricity in all the countries has the matching frequency and can readily flow across borders.

The Baltic states have long planned to instead synchronise their power systems with the EU's grid, but Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 made this an even more pressing issue.

""Grids are the heart of our energy system, and have big geopolitical and strategic importance. This has been underlined by Russia's devastating attacks against Ukraine's energy sector,"" the Estonian EU Energy Commissioner Kadri Simson told Euractiv.

Simson also said that ""Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania will become fully integrated into the EU's internal electricity market and gain full control of their electricity networks. This will increase the energy security of the whole region"".

The three Baltic countries agreed to set ""early 2025"" as the deadline for synchronisation with Europe's continental grid.

The European Union has invested more than €1.2 billion in subsidies for the project.

""Synchronisation is the most monumental energy independence project in the Baltic States and it is in its final phase,"" the Latvian electricity transmission system operator, JSC 'Augstsprieguma tīkls' (AST) told Euractiv.

The Estonian, Latvian, and Lithuanian electricity systems were integrated into the IPS/UPS transmission network during the Soviet occupation. This network, which is largely managed by Moscow, supplies 280 million customers with electricity, mainly in the former USSR countries and Central Asia.

In 2007, the then prime ministers of the three Baltic states agreed a strategic objective of joining the European continental grid. On 20 June 2019, these three countries and the European Commission signed a political roadmap to achieve synchronisation.

Riga, Tallinn, and Vilnius have put an end to their electrical isolation by building new interconnecting transmission wires with Finland, Poland, and Sweden. However, their electricity networks remain synchronised with the Russian and Belarusian systems (commonly known as the 'BRELL ring').

In contrast, the EU countries of Central and Eastern Europe - Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Slovakia, which had all also been part of the Soviet bloc until 1991 - already synchronised their systems with the continental European grid (CEN) between 1995 and 2004.

Synchronisation with the EU grid is planned via the existing transmission line between Lithuania and Poland (LitPol Link) and a future submarine cable between the two countries. Technical equipment must also be deployed, to guarantee the overall stability and security of the electricity system.

Latvian electricity transmission network operator AST told Euractiv the project is 'in the final phase of work', with the installation this month of three 'synchronous condensers' in each of the Baltic countries and the reconstruction by June of the two interconnections between Latvia and Estonia.

In July 2022 Lithuania's Vice-Minister of Energy Albinas Zananavičius announced the country's intention to speed up the transition process and leave the BRELL transmission system before 2025.

Vilnius successfully conducted an isolated operation test of the country's electricity system in April 2023, proving they are capable of joining the synchronous network of continental Europe (UCTE) as early as this year.

However, Estonia and Latvia require more time, and Lithuanian authorities have agreed to wait until all three countries are ready before achieving full synchronisation with the European grid.

In March 2022, the Ukrainian and Moldovan grids were synchronised with the European power system. While the 'emergency synchronisation' could be completed rapidly after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the move was based on preparatory technical work which began in 2017.",euractiv.com,news,EurActiv.com,,0.1215686274509804,453528107,45,https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/shutterstock_1434482111-1-800x450.jpg,eng-9576905

The resumption of power generation at the plant, however, delayed by several times due to glitches.

The plant was synchronized to the national grid on Thursday and the plant unit will be technically ready for a power increase.

About 7,500 work phases were carried out during the outage of OL3, the largest nuclear power plant in Europe.

In addition to refuelling, the most important activities carried out at OL3 during the annual outage included preventive maintenance on the protection system, washing of steam generators, generator maintenance, pressure equipment inspections, leak-tightness tests on containment isolation valves, and servicing of pressuriser safety relief valves.

The first EPR plant in Europe also underwent a significant number of different periodic tests and maintenance activities during the service outage.

The annual outage at OL3 took longer than originally planned. The outage was meant to take 37 days, but in the end lasted for about 74 days and 9 hours.

Additional days were required due to the shutdown process and the preparations for refuelling taking longer than expected and as a result of technical problems identified during maintenance activities.

Indications of a risk of foreign material in the fuel elements were also detected during the outage, and the inspections of the elements were therefore significantly more time-consuming than expected.

""The first annual outage at OL3 provided valuable knowledge about the duration of the various maintenance activities. We also gained a significant amount of data and maintenance experience which will benefit us in both the planning and the execution of future service outages. Cooperation with equipment manufacturers was another field where we gained experience,"" said Marjo Mustonen, Senior Vice President, Electricity Production.

Olkiluoto 3 is by far the most efficient electricity production plant in Finland. It produces about 14 per cent of all electricity produced in Finland.

Two of the three nuclear power plant units in Olkiluoto have now undergone their annual outage.

In addition to OL3, the refuelling outage at OL2 was also completed on May 9 .

The annual outage of OL1 started on May 12. The duration of the OL1 outage is about 15 days.",dailyfinland.fi,news,clickittefaq,,0.04313725490196085,453515440,17,https://www.dailyfinland.fi/assets/news_photos/2024/05/16/image-37733-1715819004.jpg,eng-9576567

The plant was synchronized to the national grid on Thursday, May 16th, at 1:15 PM. After this, the plant unit will be technically ready for a power increase. The power increase will be carried out according to the production plan.

It was anticipated that the service outage after the first operating cycle would be very laborious. As OL3 is the largest nuclear power plant unit in Europe, the amount of equipment and components is extremely high. All in all, about 7,500 work phases were carried out during the OL3 outage.

In addition to refuelling, the most important activities carried out at OL3 during the annual outage included preventive maintenance on the protection system, washing of steam generators, generator maintenance, pressure equipment inspections, leak-tightness tests on containment isolation valves, and servicing of pressuriser safety relief valves.

Indications of a risk of foreign material in the fuel elements were also detected during the outage, and the inspections of the elements were therefore significantly more time-consuming than expected.

According to Marjo Mustonen, Senior Vice President, Electricity Production, many valuable lessons were learned for the future from the service outage that has now been completed.

-The first annual outage at OL3 provided valuable knowledge about the duration of the various maintenance activities. We also gained a significant amount of data and maintenance experience which will benefit us in both the planning and the execution of future service outages. Cooperation with equipment manufacturers was another field where we gained experience, Mustonen sums up.

Despite the extension of the estimated duration, Marjo Mustonen says she is pleased with the outcome.

- Although the pressures were high, this has also proven how well our organization was able to respond to unexpected situations. All planned works were completed, and most importantly, safely. The main objective in every annual outage is its safe execution, Mustonen says.

Olkiluoto 3 is by far the most efficient electricity production plant in Finland. It produces about 14 per cent of all electricity produced in Finland.

Two of the three nuclear power plant units in Olkiluoto have now undergone their annual outage. In addition to OL3, the refuelling outage at OL2 was also completed on 9 May. There is still one more plant unit to go. The annual outage of OL1 started on Friday, 12 May. The duration of the OL1 outage is about 15 days.

This report explores and analyzes Bitcoin's ecosystem and the BTC price developments last month.

Bitcoin (BTC) is a decentralized cryptocurrency created to function as a digital currency and means of payment that operates independently of any single individual, organization, or authority, eliminating the need for third-party intermediaries in financial transactions.

It is allocated to blockchain miners to validate transactions and can be purchased through various exchanges.Unveiled to the public in 2009 by an enigmatic developer or group known as Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin has become the most widely recognized cryptocurrency in the world. Its success has spurred the creation of numerous other cryptocurrencies.

While widely anticipated, Bitcoin's fourth halving on April 20 followed the historical trend of short-term volatility. Bitcoin fell nearly 21% in April alone, dropping below $60,000 on April 19 as investors cashed out of a robust rally that had previously pushed prices above $72,500 (on April 8). Between April 30 and May 1, the Bitcoin price crashed below $57,000, its lowest level since late February.

Interestingly, past halving events also exhibited similar patterns. According to Glassnode data, while the first halving saw an immediate 11% gain, the subsequent two halving events saw price stagnation after two weeks. The 60-day period following halvings often shows choppy sideways movement, and price drops between -5% and -15%.

According to 10x Research CEO and senior analyst Markus Thielen, Bitcoin could further fall to $52,000. The analyst predicts a drop to $52,000, citing a slowdown in the main driver of the rally - inflows into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which dropped in April.

Fidelity Digital Assets downgraded Bitcoin's outlook to ""neutral"" after Q1. Its Q1 2024 Signals Report suggests that Bitcoin is no longer ""cheap"" and undervalued. The analysts also see potential selling pressure from long-term holders and high overall profitability. According to VanEck, 94% of Bitcoin addresses remain in profit despite a slight decline of 4% over the month.

Analysts at Bitfinex, on the other hand, are more positive and predict Bitcoin will consolidate for 1-2 months after the halving. The experts expect Bitcoin to remain the market leader and believe the economic situation is more stable than in past halvings. This could lead to sideways trading with swings of $10,000, with any price increase from the halving happening later.

Bitcoin's price dipped after the halving, but network activity boomed. Daily transactions increased by 135% after the halving, reaching 927k on April 23. However, this recovery was short-lived, and the number of daily transactions dropped again by the end of the month, reaching 403k transactions on April 30.

Bitcoin's daily active addresses saw a rollercoaster ride in April. Starting at 605k on April 1, the number climbed to 640k by April 4. However, it then took a sharp dip to 269k on April 20, the day after the halving. Activity recovered somewhat, reaching 483k by the end of the month.

Average daily transaction fees on Bitcoin surged to a record $25.8 million on April 24 before falling back to $6,15 million on April 30. The average fee in April was $16.77. Similarly, average individual transaction fees on Bitcoin spiked to $40 on April 24 and dropped to $11,92 on April 30.

Bitcoin managed to attract more capital in April and reached $1.4 billion in total value locked (TVL), an increase of 94% compared to TVL on April 2 ($724 million).

The 2024 halving block has become the most expensive block ever mined in Bitcoin's history, with users scrambling to inscribe rare assets via the Runes protocol. Users spent a whopping 37.7 Bitcoin (over $2.4 million) to secure a spot, according to data from Bitcoin block explorer Mempool.space.

High fees on the Bitcoin halving block were fueled by a surge in demand for rare digital inscriptions and new token creation. This frenzy was driven by the launch of Casey Rodarmor's Runes protocol, which allows users to create tokens directly on the Bitcoin network, coinciding with the halving event.

Runes offers an alternative to existing methods like the BRC-20 token standard - an Ordinals-based method for creating Bitcoin-based tokens. Both leverage Bitcoin's network, but Runes utilizes a more efficient Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) model, unlike the ""inscription"" method of BRC-20s.

Amid increasing Bitcoin use for day-to-day purchases, the Bitcoin network recorded the highest number - 1.63 million - of confirmed payments on April 23.

This massive spike was also driven by the launch of the Runes protocol. According to Dune Analytics data, Runes accounted for a whopping 81.3% of all Bitcoin transactions that day. However, Bitcoin is making a comeback, reclaiming 82,6% of transactions by April 30. Other protocols like Ordinals (2,6%) and BRC-20 (0,7%) comprise a smaller portion of the network activity.

April 2024 was a whirlwind for spot Bitcoin ETFs. After a period of immense enthusiasm and record inflows in Q1 2024 -- attracting $1.5 billion, $6 billion, and $4.6 billion in January, February, and March, respectively -- April saw a significant shift in sentiment, with outflows surpassing inflows for the first time since the Bitcoin ETFs launched in January.

In April, spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $343.5 million withdrawn from the funds, ending their three-month inflow streak. The initial inflows surge slowed significantly after peaking at $1.05 billion daily in mid-March. This coincided with a drop in Bitcoin's price, which fell 18% from its all-time high by the end of April.

Grayscale's GBTC fund saw the most significant outflows at $2.5 billion. ARK Invest's ARKB and Valkyrie's BRRR also experienced minor outflows.BlackRock's IBIT initially attracted the most inflows in April ($1.5 billion), followed by Fidelity's FBTC and Bitwise's BITB. However, IBIT's impressive 71-day inflow streak ended on April 23 and has seen zero flows for five consecutive days since. The trend continued on April 30. ARKB was the only ETF with inflows ($3.6 million), while outflows from GBTC, FBTC and BITB resulted in a net outflow of $161.6 million for the day.

Bitcoin ETFs' trading activity also slowed significantly during the last month. After hitting a record daily volume of $9.9 billion on March 5 (coinciding with Bitcoin surpassing its previous cycle high), trading volume fell to $2.9 billion on April 30.

On April 5, BlackRock, a leading asset manager, updated their Bitcoin ETF prospectus, adding five new authorized participants: ABN AMRO Clearing, Citadel Securities, Citigroup Global Markets, Goldman Sachs, and UBS Securities. This move adds to the existing roster of authorized participants, including JPMorgan, Jane Street Capital, Macquarie Capital, and Virtu Americas. By incorporating these big Wall Street players, BlackRock could increase liquidity and attract more institutional interest in their Bitcoin ETFs.

While US spot Bitcoin ETFs have dominated headlines recently, April marked a significant shift. The Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEX) debuted three new spot Bitcoin ETFs on April 30, offering investors exposure to these leading cryptocurrency-based products. These include Bosera HashKey Bitcoin ETF (3008.HK), ChinaAMC Bitcoin ETF (3042.HK), and Harvest Bitcoin Spot ETF (3439.HK). This launch positions Hong Kong as a potential hub for Asian cryptocurrency investment.

However, the inflows from the launched spot Bitcoin ETFs in Hong Kong were not enough to cover the outflows from the 11 US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs.

On April 26, the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC), a key player in financial settlements, dealt a blow to Bitcoin ETFs. DTCC announced it will not consider Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies as collateral for loans or credit facilities. This change takes effect in late April, meaning these ETFs will have zero collateral value within the DTCC system.

This decision could limit the attractiveness of Bitcoin ETFs for some institutional investors who rely on collateral for borrowing and managing risk. However, in an X post, cryptocurrency enthusiast K.O. Kryptowaluty clarified that this would only apply to inter-entity settlement within the line of credit system. The use of cryptocurrency ETFs for lending and as collateral in brokerage activities will continue unaffected, depending on the risk tolerance of individual brokers.

Financial giants Morgan Stanley and UBS, boasting a combined $2.36 trillion in assets under management, are reportedly gearing up to offer spot Bitcoin ETFs on their platforms. This move could be a major tipping point for institutional adoption of Bitcoin, bringing mainstream legitimacy and potentially driving broader investor interest.

Australia's leading stock exchange, the ASX, is expected to list its first spot Bitcoin ETFs by the end of 2024. Bloomberg quoted sources familiar with the matter saying several companies have already filed applications for these ETFs. These include established players like VanEck and local Australian firms BetaShares and DigitalX. With a domestic market capitalization of $2.7 trillion as of March 2024, the ASX is a major player in Australian finance, and the arrival of Bitcoin ETFs could further diversify investment options on the platform.

Bitcoin miners feel the pinch after the halving cut their earnings (from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC). According to data from Hashrate Index, the hash price fell below $45 per PH/s per day on May 2, despite a brief pop in revenue for miners post-halving amid the Runes frenzy transaction fee windfall (172 per PH/s on April 20).

According to crypto analytics firm CryptoQuant, the hash price for miners dropped from nearly $0.12 in early April to $0.07 post-halving, following a $0.19 peak on halving day.

Despite the reduction in rewards, miners are still hashing, suggesting that BTC mining is still profitable at Bitcoin's current prices. According to Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, there's no sign of miners dumping their Bitcoin capitulation - for now. But, if Bitcoin prices keep dropping, large miners may be forced to sell some Bitcoin liquidate to stay afloat.

While Bitcoin's mining network appears stable in the short term, the long-term effects of halving the hash rate (processing power) and overall miner activity remain unclear. Historically, periods following halving events have witnessed some miners exiting the market due to increased operational costs. The future of Bitcoin mining will likely depend on factors like Bitcoin price fluctuations and changes in electricity costs.

There are also some new April updates related to Bitcoin mining:

Payments company Block, formerly known as Square, announced the development of a new Bitcoin mining system. This follows the completion of a 3-nanometer application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) chip designed specifically for Bitcoin mining. Block plans to offer both standalone mining chips and complete mining systems.

Finland is exploring utilizing waste heat from Bitcoin mining for residential heating. A new project by Hashlabs Mining integrates heat generation from specialized Bitcoin mining equipment (WhatsMiner M63S) with the existing district heating system. This system transfers heat from a central source (in this case, Bitcoin mining) through insulated pipes to multiple buildings. This initiative could provide a sustainable heating solution for Finnish households, particularly during cold winters.

In April, Norway enacted new legislation requiring all data centers to formally register with the government. This registration process will involve disclosing ownership, leadership, and the types of digital services offered. Terje Aasland, Norway's Minister of Energy, stated that the government hopes this increased transparency will allow local authorities to make more informed decisions regarding data center operations, particularly their potential impact on Bitcoin mining activities.

April saw some important developments in the Bitcoin ecosystem, showing how companies innovate on multiple fronts.

MicroStrategy, known for its massive Bitcoin holdings, is venturing beyond simple investment. At their ""Bitcoin For Corporations"" conference on May 1, the company announced ""MicroStrategy Orange,"" a decentralized identity solution built on the Bitcoin network. This system will leverage Ordinal inscriptions to store data directly on the Bitcoin blockchain. This could revolutionize online identity management by offering a secure, tamper-proof and user-controlled alternative to traditional systems.

Moreover, in April, MicroStrategy purchased $7.8 million worth of Bitcoin, bringing its total holdings to 214,400 BTC.

Starting May 1, Ankr, an infrastructure provider for decentralized blockchains, brought Bitcoin liquidity to Talus, a blockchain-focused on artificial intelligence (AI). This collaboration unlocks new possibilities for Talus' smart agents and AI assistants, allowing Talus users to leverage the security and value of Bitcoin while participating in DeFi activities on the Talus network.

Coinbase is now offering users more flexibility when sending Bitcoin. The cryptocurrency exchange integrated the Lightning Network, a Layer 2 technology that enables quicker and cheaper transactions compared to the traditional Bitcoin blockchain. To use the Lightning Network, the intended recipient sends an invoice consisting of a lengthy string of characters that Coinbase recognizes as the transfer amount.

For this integration, Coinbase chose Lightspark, a provider of Lightning payments solutions, as its partner.

Hong Kong-based game software company Animoca Brands announced its foray into the Bitcoin industry on April 30. The firm aims to become the ""largest Web3 ecosystem"" for gaming, education and culture built on Bitcoin. This move involves backing the Opal Foundation, a new protocol within the Bitcoin ecosystem. The foundation will focus on the Opal Protocol and its associated token, BLIF (potentially referring to ""Opal Protocol Runes""). BLIF is initiated by collaborating with Animoca Brands and the metaverse technology platform Darewise.

The emergence of Ordinals has reinvigorated the Bitcoin decentralized application (DApp) ecosystem by demonstrating the potential for novel protocols on the network. One such protocol is the Runes protocol, launched on April 20.

Runes is a new standard for creating tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain. It allows users to represent real-world assets such as real estate, stocks, commodities or even other cryptocurrencies (including stablecoins) using tokens on the Bitcoin network.

The growing interest in Runes could drive more activity to Layer 2 networks and increase the adoption of Bitcoin-native DApps, as we can see from recent developments.

Data from Bitcoin data provider Signal 21 showed that Stacks, a Layer 2 network for Bitcoin, reached a new all-time high of 122,497 active accounts in April. Active accounts are defined as addresses with at least one transaction.

Bitcoin decentralized exchange (DEX) Orders Exchange announced its 2024 roadmap on April 29. Plans include integrating with major Web3 wallets and building a Bitcoin nonfungible token (NFT) marketplace.

Previously, Orders Exchange integrated with the Runes protocol to enable fungible token issuance and built a bridge with sidechain MicroVisionChain for BRC-20 token swaps.

Launched in March 2024, BEVM, a Layer 2 scaling solution for Bitcoin, attracted over 700,000 user addresses and 30+ ecosystem projects during April 2024. Built on Taproot consensus, BEVM utilizes BTC for gas fees and boasts a current valuation of $200 million.

BEVM also announced an investment from Bitmain, the world's leading manufacturer of cryptocurrency mining servers. The exact amount of the investment was not disclosed.

The Bitcoin Ordinals market has reached a valuation of $2.3 billion at publication, even amid a broader market downturn. Ordinals are the first iteration of NFTs on Bitcoin. Ordinals live solely on the Bitcoin blockchain, unlike most of today's popular NFT collections that host their metadata on centralized servers, creating additional points of vulnerability.

According to data from Dune Analytics, the network has over 66,3 million inscriptions to date and generated over $267 million in transaction fees.

It's no surprise that asset manager Franklin Templeton recognized Bitcoin Ordinals as a driving force behind the ""renaissance"" of activity on the Bitcoin network. Similarly, OKX Ventures, the investment arm of crypto exchange OKX, highlighted in its ""2024 Bitcoin Outlook"" report that Bitcoin Ordinals will play a ""pivotal role"" this year.

However, the significant increase in NFT transactions has periodically congested the Bitcoin network since its inception, resulting in increased fees and slower processing times due to increased on-chain transaction validation. This circumstance may have influenced Binance's decision on April 4 to discontinue support for Bitcoin Ordinals. As a result, users are no longer allowed to buy, sell or deposit Bitcoin Ordinals on the Binance NFT marketplace.

Among the 24 blockchain networks minting NFTs, Bitcoin emerged as the leader in April, with sales reaching $594 million.

According to CryptoSlam data, the sales volume of Bitcoin-based NFTs reached 602 million in April (only 3% less than in March and 93% more than in February). The data further revealed that the Bitcoin network attracted around 113k buyers and 98k sellers of NFTs during April. The number of NFT transactions on Bitcoin Ordinals reached more than 340k.

Uncategorized Ordinals, NFTs not associated with specific collections, led sales with $316.9 million in volume from 219k transactions. NodeMonkes came in second in sales volume, reaching $32.7 million in April.

Runestone ($RUNE) NFT collection gained significant popularity during the month, attracting $798.4k in April (10836% more than in March). $PUPs, another NFT collection on Bitcoin using BRC-20 protocol, reached a trading volume of $72.7 million (up 2087% from last month).

Notable NFT launches in April:

The April 2024 halving triggered the expected short-term volatility in the Bitcoin market. Despite a price drop of nearly 21%, the network experienced a surge in activity, with record-breaking daily transactions and a significant rise in fees. This activity spike was partly fueled by the launch of the Runes protocol.

Looking ahead, several factors will shape Bitcoin's future trajectory:

While the post-halving period witnessed a price correction, the Bitcoin market continues to buzz with innovation. The influx of institutional interest, ongoing advancements in mining technology and the burgeoning DeFi space all point toward a dynamic future for Bitcoin. How these factors will interplay and ultimately shape Bitcoin's trajectory remains to be seen.",cryptorank.io,news,CryptoRank,,0.1607843137254903,453472219,1,https://cimg.co/p/assets/empty-cryptonews.jpg,

This report explores and analyzes Bitcoin's ecosystem and the BTC price developments last month.

Bitcoin (BTC) is a decentralized cryptocurrency created to function as a digital currency and means of payment that operates independently of any single individual, organization, or authority, eliminating the need for third-party intermediaries in financial transactions.

It is allocated to blockchain miners to validate transactions and can be purchased through various exchanges.Unveiled to the public in 2009 by an enigmatic developer or group known as Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin has become the most widely recognized cryptocurrency in the world. Its success has spurred the creation of numerous other cryptocurrencies.

While widely anticipated, Bitcoin's fourth halving on April 20 followed the historical trend of short-term volatility. Bitcoin fell nearly 21% in April alone, dropping below $60,000 on April 19 as investors cashed out of a robust rally that had previously pushed prices above $72,500 (on April 8). Between April 30 and May 1, the Bitcoin price crashed below $57,000, its lowest level since late February.

Interestingly, past halving events also exhibited similar patterns. According to Glassnode data, while the first halving saw an immediate 11% gain, the subsequent two halving events saw price stagnation after two weeks. The 60-day period following halvings often shows choppy sideways movement, and price drops between -5% and -15%.

According to 10x Research CEO and senior analyst Markus Thielen, Bitcoin could further fall to $52,000. The analyst predicts a drop to $52,000, citing a slowdown in the main driver of the rally - inflows into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which dropped in April.

Fidelity Digital Assets downgraded Bitcoin's outlook to ""neutral"" after Q1. Its Q1 2024 Signals Report suggests that Bitcoin is no longer ""cheap"" and undervalued. The analysts also see potential selling pressure from long-term holders and high overall profitability. According to VanEck, 94% of Bitcoin addresses remain in profit despite a slight decline of 4% over the month.

Analysts at Bitfinex, on the other hand, are more positive and predict Bitcoin will consolidate for 1-2 months after the halving. The experts expect Bitcoin to remain the market leader and believe the economic situation is more stable than in past halvings. This could lead to sideways trading with swings of $10,000, with any price increase from the halving happening later.

Bitcoin's price dipped after the halving, but network activity boomed. Daily transactions increased by 135% after the halving, reaching 927k on April 23. However, this recovery was short-lived, and the number of daily transactions dropped again by the end of the month, reaching 403k transactions on April 30.

Bitcoin's daily active addresses saw a rollercoaster ride in April. Starting at 605k on April 1, the number climbed to 640k by April 4. However, it then took a sharp dip to 269k on April 20, the day after the halving. Activity recovered somewhat, reaching 483k by the end of the month.

Average daily transaction fees on Bitcoin surged to a record $25.8 million on April 24 before falling back to $6,15 million on April 30. The average fee in April was $16.77. Similarly, average individual transaction fees on Bitcoin spiked to $40 on April 24 and dropped to $11,92 on April 30.

Bitcoin managed to attract more capital in April and reached $1.4 billion in total value locked (TVL), an increase of 94% compared to TVL on April 2 ($724 million).

The 2024 halving block has become the most expensive block ever mined in Bitcoin's history, with users scrambling to inscribe rare assets via the Runes protocol. Users spent a whopping 37.7 Bitcoin (over $2.4 million) to secure a spot, according to data from Bitcoin block explorer Mempool.space.

High fees on the Bitcoin halving block were fueled by a surge in demand for rare digital inscriptions and new token creation. This frenzy was driven by the launch of Casey Rodarmor's Runes protocol, which allows users to create tokens directly on the Bitcoin network, coinciding with the halving event.

Runes offers an alternative to existing methods like the BRC-20 token standard - an Ordinals-based method for creating Bitcoin-based tokens. Both leverage Bitcoin's network, but Runes utilizes a more efficient Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) model, unlike the ""inscription"" method of BRC-20s.

Amid increasing Bitcoin use for day-to-day purchases, the Bitcoin network recorded the highest number - 1.63 million - of confirmed payments on April 23.

This massive spike was also driven by the launch of the Runes protocol. According to Dune Analytics data, Runes accounted for a whopping 81.3% of all Bitcoin transactions that day. However, Bitcoin is making a comeback, reclaiming 82,6% of transactions by April 30. Other protocols like Ordinals (2,6%) and BRC-20 (0,7%) comprise a smaller portion of the network activity.

April 2024 was a whirlwind for spot Bitcoin ETFs. After a period of immense enthusiasm and record inflows in Q1 2024 -- attracting $1.5 billion, $6 billion, and $4.6 billion in January, February, and March, respectively -- April saw a significant shift in sentiment, with outflows surpassing inflows for the first time since the Bitcoin ETFs launched in January.

In April, spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $343.5 million withdrawn from the funds, ending their three-month inflow streak. The initial inflows surge slowed significantly after peaking at $1.05 billion daily in mid-March. This coincided with a drop in Bitcoin's price, which fell 18% from its all-time high by the end of April.

Grayscale's GBTC fund saw the most significant outflows at $2.5 billion. ARK Invest's ARKB and Valkyrie's BRRR also experienced minor outflows.BlackRock's IBIT initially attracted the most inflows in April ($1.5 billion), followed by Fidelity's FBTC and Bitwise's BITB. However, IBIT's impressive 71-day inflow streak ended on April 23 and has seen zero flows for five consecutive days since. The trend continued on April 30. ARKB was the only ETF with inflows ($3.6 million), while outflows from GBTC, FBTC and BITB resulted in a net outflow of $161.6 million for the day.

Bitcoin ETFs' trading activity also slowed significantly during the last month. After hitting a record daily volume of $9.9 billion on March 5 (coinciding with Bitcoin surpassing its previous cycle high), trading volume fell to $2.9 billion on April 30.

On April 5, BlackRock, a leading asset manager, updated their Bitcoin ETF prospectus, adding five new authorized participants: ABN AMRO Clearing, Citadel Securities, Citigroup Global Markets, Goldman Sachs, and UBS Securities. This move adds to the existing roster of authorized participants, including JPMorgan, Jane Street Capital, Macquarie Capital, and Virtu Americas. By incorporating these big Wall Street players, BlackRock could increase liquidity and attract more institutional interest in their Bitcoin ETFs.

While US spot Bitcoin ETFs have dominated headlines recently, April marked a significant shift. The Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEX) debuted three new spot Bitcoin ETFs on April 30, offering investors exposure to these leading cryptocurrency-based products. These include Bosera HashKey Bitcoin ETF (3008.HK), ChinaAMC Bitcoin ETF (3042.HK), and Harvest Bitcoin Spot ETF (3439.HK). This launch positions Hong Kong as a potential hub for Asian cryptocurrency investment.

However, the inflows from the launched spot Bitcoin ETFs in Hong Kong were not enough to cover the outflows from the 11 US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs.

On April 26, the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC), a key player in financial settlements, dealt a blow to Bitcoin ETFs. DTCC announced it will not consider Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies as collateral for loans or credit facilities. This change takes effect in late April, meaning these ETFs will have zero collateral value within the DTCC system.

This decision could limit the attractiveness of Bitcoin ETFs for some institutional investors who rely on collateral for borrowing and managing risk. However, in an X post, cryptocurrency enthusiast K.O. Kryptowaluty clarified that this would only apply to inter-entity settlement within the line of credit system. The use of cryptocurrency ETFs for lending and as collateral in brokerage activities will continue unaffected, depending on the risk tolerance of individual brokers.

Financial giants Morgan Stanley and UBS, boasting a combined $2.36 trillion in assets under management, are reportedly gearing up to offer spot Bitcoin ETFs on their platforms. This move could be a major tipping point for institutional adoption of Bitcoin, bringing mainstream legitimacy and potentially driving broader investor interest.

Australia's leading stock exchange, the ASX, is expected to list its first spot Bitcoin ETFs by the end of 2024. Bloomberg quoted sources familiar with the matter saying several companies have already filed applications for these ETFs.

Bitcoin miners feel the pinch after the halving cut their earnings (from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC). According to data from Hashrate Index, the hash price fell below $45 per PH/s per day on May 2, despite a brief pop in revenue for miners post-halving amid the Runes frenzy transaction fee windfall (172 per PH/s on April 20).

This time around, participants debated issues relating to the competitiveness of the EU economy, energy, and the green transition.

Overall, the perspectives from the politicians taking part underlined something of a consensus on the need for reform within the EU, the slashing of bureaucracy and over-regulation, while also maintaining important existing protections and creating a fairer competitive environment.

The panelists virtually all suggested a focus on making the EU more business-friendly too, without compromising on essential standards and rights.

Appearing on the panel were: Yoko Alender (Reform), Annela Anger-Kraavi (Parempoolsed), Rain Epler (EKRE), Lauri Laats (Center), Rasmus Lahtvee (Greens) Liisa-Ly Pakosta (Eesti 200), Jüri Ratas (Isamaa) and Riina Sikkut (SDE), while the show hosts were Liisu Lass and Andres Kuusk.

On being asked about supporting the rapid implementation of the green transition, Jüri Ratas recalled his time in government, Ratas was prime minister late 2016 to early 2021, when the 2050 climate neutrality goals were approved.

""However, we must first meet our targets set for 2030, which is ambitious, but Estonia can manage,"" Ratas said.

""The most important point is the renovation of housing stock. The green transition cannot constitute a planned economy,"" he added.

""Changes will definitely occur, but it is crucial for Estonia that our business competitiveness is not lost. We must protect our firms via the European Innovation Fund. The concept behind the green deal is that we can play our strengths; Estonia needs to expand its energy portfolio,"" Ratas stressed.

The Isamaa European candidate, formerly Center Party leader, also noted that in addition to the existing Estlink undersea electricity connections, an additional, similar links needs to be installed.

Annela Anger-Kraavi meanwhile expressed concerns over the green transition, stressing that it should not compromise public welfare or be implemented via command economy tactics, either.

She said: ""Estonia did not stand up for itself in the European Council regarding the green deal, yet now smaller targets are being set for Estonia in the direction of a climate-resilient economy. That same minister has agreed to various treaties.""

Anger-Kraavi argued that Estonia struggles to advocate for itself within the EU and criticized what she called a lack of trust in landowners when it comes to biodiversity conservation, noting that species searches are being conducted on private lands without their owners' being made aware.

Rain Epler criticized the green transition as ideological extremism, aimed at reaping funds from a large proportion of the population and of businesses, to benefit a narrow interest group. ""This is harmful to the economy. For example, German industry has been relocating and downsizing.""

""There are also U.S. states which have switched to renewable energy, yet it's not sustainable,"" Epler went on, highlighting what he saw as the economic and practical challenges of transitioning to green energy.

Riina Sikkut contra-wise argued for the necessity of the green transition to prevent further environmental degradation.

Sikkut said: ""The green transition states that we cannot produce more pollution than we currently do. We need innovation to preserve biodiversity, though the transition should not come at the expense of lower-income individuals. This means they need to be compensated for it.""

""Leadership is needed to drive the Green Deal forward, but, fortunately, EU member states have agreed on climate neutrality,"" Sikkut added, highlighting the collective commitment within the EU.

Yoko Alender highlighted the green transition as representing not only a new opportunity but also one which is inter-connected with security concerns. ""We have so far been dependent on Russian fossil fuels, but the green transition will ensure our energy independence.""

""Dependence on China is also a significant issue, yet we also have rare earth metals, in Sillamäe,"" Alender went on.

Rasmus Lahtvee of the Greens stressed the inclusive nature of the green deal, stating: ""The Greens are talking about a green deal where no one gets left behind, neither people nor businesses.""

Lahtvee lamented the irony of criticisms directed at the Greens, given that it is other parties which have been making the decisions which have led to economic decline.

""It's almost funny to hear accusations aimed at the Greens. In Estonia, the Greens are blamed for almost everything, yet It is the other parties who have been making the decisions so far,"" Lahtvee said.

Lauri Laats also voiced concerns over the burdens of the green deal on Estonian people and businesses. ""If we make a giant leap in the use of electric cars, then we become dependent on China, as a battery manufacturer.""

""People needing to replace their home gas boilers -- this directly affects them. Switching from gas boilers requires funds, but these have not even been allocated from the EU; it's still under discussion,"" Laats continued.

Liisa-Ly Pakosta argued for necessary changes without sacrificing equality. ""If we don't want to burn up our planet, changes are needed, but they must be just,"" Pakosta said.

""Europe has already done much to break free from dependence upon Russian natural gas; only 5 percent of the EU's gas purchases currently come from Russia, and even that will soon disappear thanks to a new round of sanctions. People are not going to be forced to disconnect their gas boilers, and there will be no coercion in terms of home renovation. The EU provides funding, for those that choose this,"" she went on.

Lahtvee advocated for a smarter energy grid, citing the inefficiency of Estonia's current reliance on oil shale-generated electricity.

""Euro for euro earned, Denmark's spending is one seventh of Estonia's, primarily because we are using oil shale energy.""

""We need to eliminate support not just for oil shale but for all fossil fuels, to then grasp the real price we have to pay,"" Lahtvee argued.

He stressed that investments should be made into network security to ensure security of electricity supply in more outlying areas of the country, and that following the green deal in developing energy systems would facilitate this.

Liisa-Ly Pakosta outlined the EU's stance on oil shale, noting that while it hasn't been banned, it has been set at price levels which would discourage its long-term use. ""Natural gas hasn't been banned either; biogas can be used, for instance.""

At the same time: ""We need to accelerate our efforts to meet the renewable energy targets we promised to the EU 15 years ago,"" Pakosta added.

Pakosta also expressed concerns about accepting draft legislation from officials which may impose excessive obligations on Estonia.

On nuclear energy, Pakosta noted that: ""the EU has agreed that nuclear energy is clean, and should at least be considered as an option in Estonia.""

Epler argued that energy security in Estonia and in Europe could be ensured through oil shale, nuclear energy, and coal too.

""We have our own oil shale, and the scientific capability to utilize it. Wind and solar power are environmentally harmful methods of energy production, but France successfully built nuclear power stations in the 1970s and is now reaping the rewards,"" Epler said.

He also suggested that support should be eliminated. ""Once the subsidies are gone, wind and solar energy [prices] will skyrocket, because they have developed solely on the back of these subsidies.""

Sikkut questioned the long-term viability of mining oil shale and other fossil fuels, and suggested biogas usage alongside other renewable energies as a solution.

""During windless periods, we can utilize biogas. It's also important to manage consumption. There is potential to control things when we use energy,"" said Sikkut said, stressing the importance of energy efficiency and alternative sources.

Sikkut however argued against the need for a nuclear power plant in Estonia, asserting that the state can achieve energy security via other means. She highlighted the importance of domestic consensus as well, and a firm stance in order to strengthen Estonia's position during EU negotiations.

""Estonia has proved itself an excellent negotiator at the EU, but the problem lies more domestically, where we can't agree on what is necessary and beneficial for Estonia,"" she said.

""Ratas says there is a market for oil shale, while Anger-Kraavi says we need oil shale plants to produce shale gas. But we need to agree at home on phasing out oil shale, to achieve better results during EU negotiations,"" Sikkut concluded.

Laats said Estonia needs oil shale to maintain controllable energy capacities. ""This sector provides jobs. Why does Estonia want to be at the forefront of the EU in resolving all its issues?""

He highlighted the potential economic impact of transitioning away from traditional energy sources, suggesting that the energy deriving from the green transition in Estonia would be considerably more expensive even than current rates in the Scandinavian countries. ""Including all charges, the electricity price in Estonia would be 16-17 cents per KW,"" Laats said.

Yoko Alender argued that it is in Europe's interest for European countries to develop together.

""Europe can help, by financially aiding the construction of connections between countries,"" she said. Alender also outlined Estonia's ambitious 2030 goal of generating all its energy needs from renewable sources.

""This is not an insurmountable obligation. There is a clear link between well-being and electricity consumption: We need new clean industries. Renewable energy, coupled with storage and possibly small nuclear reactors, will ensure Estonia's energy security of supply,"" she elaborated.

Ratas commented on the idea of constructing a nuclear power plant in Estonia, suggesting that while research is the right direction, one must not be naïve about the challenges which this would bring.

""While back in 2000 Finland thought that it would be able quickly to build a nuclear power plant, it only recently connected to the grid. Estonia can produce biogas, plus the Paldiski pumped storage plant needs to be finished,"" Ratas said.

Anger-Kraavi stressed the paramount importance of energy security. ""Oil shale is not harmful to the climate if it is not burned, but we lack alternatives.""

For Parempoolsed, contesting its first European elections and only its second election overall, it is crucial that the market determine what energy type is worth using, not subsidies for certain types of technology,"" she argued.

Anger-Kraavi also referenced the apparent renaissance of nuclear energy, noting the availability of next generation small reactors, which she said could potentially offer a viable alternative energy source for Estonia.

During the course of the broadcast, all the panelists also responded to questions from voters, mainly on whether boosting the competitiveness of the European economy is a realistic goal.

Lauri Laats acknowledged the challenges, noting that both the U.S. and China have far outpaced Europe in recent years. He pointed out that the bureaucracy has been a significant impediment to business. ""Europe has been lagging behind, mainly because of the layers of bureaucracy, which stifles business initiative,"" Laats said.

Ratas concurred that bureaucracy is a barrier, and suggested that cutting it would foster economic growth and help the EU progress.

He also said that Estonia should advocate for more significant investments in the transport sector. ""Cutting down bureaucratic hurdles can significantly contribute to economic growth, and make the EU more dynamic and competitive,"" Ratas said.

Alender, too, identified bureaucracy as a hindrance and proposed that with the introduction of each new regulation, previous ones should be reviewed to ensure they are still necessary and effective.

""There needs to be a balance between regulation and freedom for businesses to operate efficiently. By revisiting old regulations, we can streamline processes and foster innovation,"" Alender argued.

Sikkut emphasized the importance of government intervention and support for businesses needing to be consistent across countries.

She added that innovation is difficult for a single country to achieve alone, and stressed the need for increased cooperation between nations. ""It's vital for countries within the EU to work together more effectively to foster innovation and support entrepreneurs,"" Sikkut said.

Epler highlighted that bureaucracy has become a significant problem, illustrating his point by referencing Elon Musk's approach at one of his companies, where he dismissed a team, only to rehire individually the workers it was felt were truly needed. This example underscores the efficiency gained by streamlining operations and reducing excesses, Epler claimed.

Anger-Kraavi commented on the issue of over-regulation in Europe, stating that the internal market has all but disappeared.

Her comment reflects a concern in some quarters that excessive regulation may be hindering the free movement of goods, services, and capital within the EU, undermining is a fundamental principle of the union in the first place.

Pakosta spoke about the disparity in support larger countries can offer their business sectors compared with smaller nations like Estonia. She advocated for reducing national support within the union, to create a fair internal market.

This position underscores the need for a level playing field that allows smaller nations' businesses to compete more effectively.

Sikkut agreed with Pakosta, adding that competitive advantages often come at the expense of human rights. She argued that regulation is not inherently bad if it ensures protection, such as in data security, highlighting the importance of balancing business interests with individual rights.

Lahtvee discussed the concept of a sustainable economic model, emphasizing the need to stop wasting resources and reduce bureaucracy. He pointed out the challenges faced by Estonian entrepreneurs who must undergo time-consuming certification processes in each country they operate in, which can stifle innovation and efficiency, he said.

Overall, the responses highlighted a shared concern among the politicians about the impact of excessive bureaucracy on economic competitiveness, and suggest a common interest in fostering a more business-friendly environment within an EU context.",news.err.ee,news,ERR,,0.2549019607843137,453469520,17,https://s.err.ee/photo/crop/2024/05/14/2396844h81det24.jpg,

Eaton, the intelligent power management company, has opened a new state-of-the-art campus in Helsinki to boost its capacity to manufacture and supply uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems, including its latest product, the Eaton 9395X.

Now in production, the Eaton 9395X UPS occupies a footprint up to 30 percent smaller than similar UPS models and delivers superior energy efficiency, thanks to its silicon carbide converters. This requires less electricity in a data center setting, making it easier to reduce carbon emissions.

With a maximum power rating currently up to 1700 kVA (to be extended in the coming year) and exceptional power density, the Eaton 9395X is designed for outstanding resilience, building on the already robust capabilities of Eaton's Power Xpert 9395P UPS.

The system is also an Eaton EnergyAware UPS with grid-interactive capability, meaning data center operators can reduce the total cost of ownership of the Eaton 9395X by earning revenue through energy market participation - they can sell the demand response services that help balance a high-renewable grid.

Joel Kärkkäinen, product manager of large 3phase UPS, Critical Power Solutions at Eaton, said: ""We designed silicon carbide-based converters into the Eaton 9395X, so that it brings to market an efficiency of 97.5 percent in double-conversion mode.""

""The fact that it needs up to 30 percent less cooling, and up to 30 percent less floor space than similar UPS models, means that this UPS leaves more room for revenue-generating IT equipment. It has top exhaust, with no rear clearance required, which means a further saving on space and lower installation costs.""

The Eaton 9395X is easy to deploy thanks to its thoughtful design, featuring ready-built sub-assemblies and simplified installation with an inter-cabinet busbar and self-configuring power modules.

Large systems can be configured with one click, and built-in self-monitoring reduces the need for scheduled maintenance, further adding to cost savings.

HotSync-patented load-sharing technology enhances reliability by eliminating single points of failure and synchronizing parallel power modules and UPSs without communication links or synchronization signals.

The Eaton 9395X UPS is supplied with a full lifecycle analysis and eco passport to demonstrate its environmental impact through the supply chain, in manufacturing, and in use, all the way to its end-of-life. This makes it easy to include in facility-level carbon emission calculations, and helps Eaton's customers to achieve their sustainability targets.

Pjelax, located in the Närpiö and Kristiinankaupunki areas, is set to produce more than 1 terawatt hour (TWh) of wind power annually - 5% of Finland's total wind power production.

The 56 turbine wind farm is a joint venture between Helen, which owns 40%, and Fortum, which owns 60%.

Helen has agreed to purchase 50% of the wind farm's electricity output for its entire operational lifespan.

Fortum president and CEO Markus Rauramo stated: ""With 380MW, Pjelax will double the wind power capacity operated by Fortum. Wind power plays an important role alongside the rest of our emission-free power generation.

""In line with our strategy, we provide clean electricity in the Nordic countries and help in electrifying industry to reduce its emissions. Pjelax is a prime example of how Fortum helps its customers reduce their carbon dioxide emissions.""

Helen CEO Olli Sirkka stated: ""The Pjelax wind farm is a significant joint effort by Helen and Fortum to increase renewable electricity production. Wind power generation creates a competitive advantage for Finland.

""Increasing the supply lowers customers' electricity prices and enables investments based on the consumption of clean electricity.""

Construction of the wind farm began in January 2022, following an order placed with Nordex, a German wind turbine manufacturer.

The project was completed on time, with Suvic Oy and Simons Infra Oy responsible for the infrastructure construction work and earthworks.

The turbines were transported to the site through the port of Kaskinen via 728 special transport operations.

The wind farm's regional economic impact will be significant, with municipal land rental income and property tax revenue expected to generate millions of euros annually.

As The Sofia Globe previously reported, Bulgaria had the largest drop in greenhouse gas emissions in the EU in the first quarter of 2023, again had the largest drop in the second quarter of 2023, and the second-largest drop in the third quarter of 2023, all on an annual basis.

In the fourth quarter of 2023, greenhouse gas emissions are estimated to have decreased in 22 EU countries, when compared with the same quarter of 2022, Eurostat said.

The largest reductions in greenhouse gases are estimated for Estonia (-23 per cent), Bulgaria (-17 per cent) and Finland (-9 per cent).

Out of the 22 EU members that are estimated to have decreased their emissions, 10 also recorded a decline in their GDP (Estonia, Finland, Sweden, Germany, Austria, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, The Netherlands and Luxembourg).

Hungary maintained the GDP at the same level while decreasing emissions.

The other 11 EU countries (Bulgaria, Belgium, Czechia, Denmark, Italy, Spain, France, Poland, Portugal, Romania and Croatia) are estimated to have managed to decrease emissions while growing their GDP, Eurostat said.

In the fourth quarter of 2023, EU economy greenhouse gas emissions were estimated at 897 million tons of CO2-equivalents (CO2-eq), a 4.0 per cent decrease compared with the same quarter of 2022 (935 million tons of CO2-eq). The EU's gross domestic product (GDP) remained stable, registering just a small increase (0.2 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared with the same quarter of 2022).

In the fourth quarter of 2023, the economic sectors responsible for the largest reductions compared with the fourth quarter of 2022 were electricity and gas supply (- 17.2 per cent) and manufacturing (-3.1 per cent). Emissions by households remained almost stable, Eurostat said.

The EU's gross domestic product (GDP) remained stable, registering just a small increase (0.2% in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared with the same quarter of 2022).

This information comes from data on quarterly estimates for greenhouse gas emissions by economic activity published by Eurostat today. Quarterly estimates of greenhouse gas emissions complement quarterly socio-economic data, such as GDP or employment. This article presents a handful of findings from the more detailed Statistics Explained article on quarterly greenhouse gas emissions.

In the fourth quarter of 2023, the economic sectors responsible for the largest reductions compared with the fourth quarter of 2022 were electricity and gas supply (- 17.2%) and manufacturing (-3.1%). Emissions by households remained almost stable.

In the fourth quarter of 2023, greenhouse gas emissions are estimated to have decreased in 22 EU countries, when compared with the same quarter of 2022.

The largest reductions in greenhouse gases are estimated for Estonia (-23.0%), Bulgaria (-17.0%) and Finland (-9.0%).

Out of the 22 EU members that are estimated to have decreased their emissions, 10 also recorded a decline in their GDP (Estonia, Finland, Sweden, Germany, Austria, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, The Netherlands and Luxembourg). Hungary maintained the GDP at the same level while decreasing emissions. The other 11 EU countries (Bulgaria, Belgium, Czechia, Denmark, Italy, Spain, France, Poland, Portugal, Romania and Croatia) are estimated to have managed to decrease emissions while growing their GDP.

Increases in emissions are estimated for Malta (+7.7%), Slovenia (+5.6%), Cyprus (+2.3%), Slovakia (1.7%) and Greece (+0.3%).

From the mid-1960s through 2016, Colombia was torn by conflict between the government, leftist guerrilla movements and right-wing paramilitary groups. Now the government and rebels are working to carry out a sweeping accord that addresses many critical sectors, including environmental damages and restoration.

Notre Dame University researchers Richard Marcantonio and Josefina Echavarria Alvarez study peace and conflict issues, including their effects on the environment. They currently are advising negotiations between the Colombian government and several rebel factions over wartime damage to soil, water and other natural resources. They explain that while Colombia's transition from war to peace has been difficult, the accord offers a model for addressing the ravages of war in places such as Gaza and Ukraine.

Few agreements include environmental provisions, and even fewer see them carried out, even though research shows that many drivers of conflict can be directly or indirectly related to the environment.

We work with a research program at the University of Notre Dame called the Peace Accords Matrix, which monitors the implementation of comprehensive peace accords in 34 countries worldwide. Only 10 of the accords have natural resource management provisions agreements, and these typically have not triggered major steps to protect the environment.

Colombia's is seen as the most comprehensive peace accord that has been signed to date. It considers issues ranging from security to social justice and political participation, in great detail.

The accord acknowledges that a peaceful postwar society requires not only respect for human rights but also ""protection of the environment, respect for nature and its renewable and nonrenewable resources and biodiversity."" More than 20% of the commitments in the agreement have an environmental connection.

- Protecting environmental health through measures such as access to clean water

- Process issues, such as ensuring that communities can participate in decisions about rural programs and resource management

There also are gaps. For example, many protected areas have been deforested for ranching and coca production in the postaccord period. And there are no provisions addressing toxic pollution, an issue other agreements also neglect.

Often there are power vacuums during transitions between war and peace, when government agencies are working to reestablish their operations. Natural resources and environmental health need protection during these phases.

In Sierra Leone, for example, resource extraction by foreign companies drastically ramped up immediately after the Lome Peace Agreement eventually ended that nation's civil war in 2002. Companies exploited a lack of governance and support in the rural areas and often mined metals illegally or hazardously without any regulatory oversight. Today these areas still struggle with mining impacts, including contaminated drinking water and fish, the primary protein source in the area.

The damage is vast: There's air, water and soil contamination, deforestation and enormous quantities of waste, including ruined buildings, burned-out cars and thousands of tons of destroyed military equipment. Russia's destruction of the Kakhovka Dam flooded villages, destroyed crops and wrecked irrigation systems.

The cost estimates are staggering. A joint commission of the World Bank, the government of Ukraine and other institutions currently estimate direct damages at roughly US$152 billion.

In addition, cleaning up sites, rebuilding infrastructure and other repairs could cost more than $486 billion over the next decade, as of late 2023. That figure rises every day that the war continues.

There's broad interest in a green and sustainable reconstruction that would include steps like using sustainable building materials and powering the electricity grid with renewable energy. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been adamant that Russia must pay for the damage it has caused. It's still unclear how this would work, although some U.S. and European lawmakers support seizing frozen Russian assets held in Western banks to help cover the cost.

There is a legal basis for holding Russia accountable. In 2022, the U.N. General Assembly adopted a set of principles for protecting the environment during armed conflicts. Among other existing statutes, they draw on a protocol to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 that prohibits using ""methods or means of warfare which are intended, or may be expected, to cause widespread, long-term and severe damage to the natural environment.""

There has been only modest discussion so far of how to integrate these principles into a formal peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia. But a working group that included Ukrainian and European Union officials and former leaders from Sweden, Finland, Ireland and Brazil has recommended a framework for addressing environmental damage and holding perpetrators accountable.

Environmental damage in Gaza also is devastating. The U.N. estimated in early 2024 that over 100,000 cubic meters (26 million gallons) of untreated sewage and wastewater were flowing daily onto land or into the Mediterranean Sea.

Gaza's drinking water system was insufficient before the war and has been further weakened by military strikes. On average, Gazans now have access to about 3 liters of water per person per day - less than 1 gallon.

Thousands of buildings have been destroyed, spreading hazardous materials such as asbestos. Every bomb that's dropped disperses toxic materials that will persist in the soil unless it's remediated. Simultaneous environmental and infrastructure impacts, such as water and power shortages, are contributing to larger crises, such as the collapse of Gaza's health care system, that will have long-lasting human costs.

Integrating the environment into peace accords isn't easy. Resources such as energy, clean soil and water are vital for life, which is precisely why military forces may seek to control or destroy them. This is happening in both Ukraine and Gaza.

Peace negotiators tend to focus on social, political and economic issues, rather than environmental reparations. But leaving environmental damage unresolved until after a peace accord is signed keeps people who have been displaced and marginalized by conflict in precarious positions.

It may even cause fighting to resume. According to the U.N. Environment Program, at least 40% of all wars within states in the past 60 years have had a link to natural resources. In those cases, fighting was twice as likely to resume within five years after conflict ended.

We see some lessons for future negotiations.

First, it's important for accords to recognize environmental harm as one of war's main consequences and to acknowledge that a healthy environment is essential for sustainable livelihoods and peace.

Second, connecting environmental provisions with other issues, such as rural reform and political participation, can create better, more sustainable and equal conditions for reestablishing democracy. The Colombia accords are an example.

Third, it is important to clearly define goals, such as what infrastructure and institutions need to be rebuilt, who is in charge of getting those tasks done, and the timetable for doing it. This can help ensure that environmental restoration doesn't become a secondary goal.

Fourth, the international community has an important role to play in monitoring and verifying environmental restoration and providing financial and technical support. Foreign donors have already pledged $66 billion for rebuilding Ukraine and have said that they will require grantees to follow strict environmental standards in order to receive financing.

Reconstructing nations and simultaneously regenerating communities and ecosystems after wars is a daunting mission, but it's also an opportunity to build something better. We see Ukraine and Gaza as potential test cases for addressing war's toll on the environment and creating a more sustainable future.",industriesnews.net,news,industriesnews.net,,-0.2549019607843137,453457173,1,https://cdn.bignewsnetwork.com/NGVkOGFjMmMtZTI.jpg,

War is raging in the Middle East, causing enormous human suffering. The EU is united on many aspects. We condemn Hamas's heinous terrorist attacks of 7 October in which at least 1 200 people were killed and more than 220 were kidnapped. Not since the Holocaust have so many Jews been murdered on a single day.

Sweden and the EU support Israel and its clear right to defend itself in accordance with international law. At the same time, the EU emphasises that humanitarian access to Gaza - with essential supplies such as water, food and medicine - is absolutely necessary. Sweden's humanitarian assistance must be allowed to help the civilian population of Gaza. Civilian lives must be protected as far as possible.

In Sweden and in Europe, people may have differing views on the conflict in the Middle East. That is part of our democracy. But it is entirely unacceptable when actions and demonstrations against the war there develop into hate and threats against Jews here. The Swedish Government unequivocally supports our Jewish minority.

The Europe that once swore that Jews would never again need to fear for their safety is once again unsafe for Jewish families. This is a disgrace. Or to quote French President Emmanuel Macron: We must put antisemitism back where it belongs: in court and behind bars. No tolerance for the intolerable.

***

Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine is the European tragedy of our time. And yet there are voices that question whether freedom is worth defending. As though appeasing dictatorship would be in the interests of democracy. If Ukraine loses, Europe loses, and then Sweden loses.

The war in Ukraine demonstrates the EU's significance to security policy. The EU Military Assistance Mission has already trained 30 000 Ukrainian soldiers. Under the Swedish Presidency of the Council of the EU, we agreed to provide Ukraine with one million artillery shells.

EU membership is Ukraine's goal. The Swedish Government shares that goal, and pursued the matter during the Swedish Presidency.

It is no longer a question of whether the EU should grow, but when and how. Spreading stability, democracy and respect for the rule of law is in our common interest.

But EU membership is not handed out willy-nilly: it is based on merit, and progress on domestic reforms. The EU has requirements and conditions that must be met. There are no shortcuts. And the rule of law must be defended and apply to new and old members alike.

At the same time, the EU must be ready to admit new members when they are ready. And the EU needs to be reformed to continue to function effectively with more Member States. This applies in particular to agricultural policy and cohesion policy. The EU's budget and decision-making procedures will also need to be reviewed.

***

Seventy per cent of the criminal networks in the EU are active in at least three countries. The Government is now conducting a historic offensive against Swedish criminal gangs. We are strengthening the judicial system and giving police necessary tools and powers. We are removing secrecy restrictions so that government agencies can fight the organised economic crime that feeds gangs.

The same kind of offensive is needed in the EU. When the EU's heads of state and government decide next summer on the political priorities for the years to come, the fight against cross-border crime must be a priority issue.

The Government is working intensively on proposals to hone EU cooperation. More can be done to give the authorities better access to encrypted communications. More can also be done to cut off financial flows and to coordinate criminal investigations of cross-border offences.

Europol must be strengthened to be able to come down harder on organised crime, and more cooperation is needed to stop drugs being brought in via European ports.

The EU must take control of the external border. This is important for the EU, but it is also absolutely crucial for Sweden.

The Government and the Sweden Democrats are now implementing a paradigm shift in migration policy. This has already had an effect. Migration to many EU countries is increasing dramatically, but in Sweden the number of asylum seekers has decreased by 25 per cent compared with last year.

More than 200 000 migrants have crossed the Mediterranean this year alone - 52 per cent more than in the corresponding period last year. These people are grossly exploited, and this human smuggling is a significant source of income for organised crime.

Under the Swedish Presidency, the EU took a major step towards a new responsible and restrictive asylum and migration policy. This was a significant success. The aim is to reinforce the EU's external border and introduce a fast track in the reception process to differentiate between economic migrants and refugees. This will relieve pressure on the EU and Sweden.

But returns must increase. We need more cooperation and exchange of information between all relevant authorities within the EU to enforce expulsion orders. Clearer readmission agreements with countries of origin are also needed.

Cooperation with countries of origin and transit must be dramatically expanded. This is the only way to prevent the underlying causes of migration and stop large numbers of people attempting to enter Europe via lethal routes over land and sea.

The green transition is a core Swedish interest. Swedish businesses and industries are at the forefront of technologies that are in demand around the world - such as fossil-free steel, batteries, electric vehicles and forest-based innovations.

Sweden has already come a long way towards becoming fossil-free by phasing out oil boilers and coal power. Alongside Portugal, Sweden has the lowest per capita emissions in the entire EU. But more is needed. Climate change and environmental degradation are cross-border problems that demand cross-border solutions.

Sweden's climate policy must be built on European foundations. The EU adopted one of the world's most ambitious climate packages - Fit for 55 - under the Swedish Presidency. Now the EU has a common cause with common goals, and all of the Member States are taking their share of the responsibility. When 450 million Europeans make the transition, it will make a global difference.

Sustainable Swedish forestry is important for the transition not only in Sweden but throughout Europe. The Government is working together with Finland to create greater understanding of the importance of forests. Forests not only act as carbon sinks and are a prerequisite for biodiversity - they are also crucial in replacing fossil materials and reducing our emissions.

Nuclear energy also has a crucial role in fossil-free electricity production in the EU. The Government is working hard to ensure that both conventional nuclear energy and small modular reactors can be used as renewable energy on equal terms in the EU. We are working closely with other EU countries that are part of the 'nuclear alliance'.

Sweden and Europe need higher growth and the internal market is crucial to strengthening our economy. The EU is the very core of the internationalisation of Swedish industry.

But the EU's share of the global economy is shrinking and its competitiveness is waning. Increasingly, new technologies are emerging from the west coast of the United States and the east coast of China.

Europe should be a continent that is involved in developing new technologies rather than mostly importing them. This applies in equal measure to complex matters such as artificial intelligence, where the EU can take the lead in constructive regulation that promotes innovation while also tackling issues such as ethical risks.

Overall EU investment in research and development as a percentage of GDP is considerably lower than that of the United States and China, but also lower than that of Japan and South Korea. It is high time that more Member States lived up to the EU target of investing at least three per cent of GDP in research and development.

At the EU Summit in June, following considerable Swedish legwork, a new growth agenda was launched.

But growth and innovation do not spring from state-managed economies, but from knowledge-based market economies with competitive businesses. These cut red tape and pave the way for lower energy prices, quicker permit processes and better access to capital and skills.

European businesses need regulations and conditions that withstand competition. At Sweden's initiative, the decision has been made to reduce reporting requirements for businesses by 25 per cent.

Simpler and fewer rules will be a main theme for Sweden when it is time to decide on the direction for Europe's competitiveness. EU legislation must take greater account of the conditions for businesses.

Free competition in the internal market and free trade with countries outside the EU have made Europe's economy strong. But free trade agreements are also important for geopolitical reasons.

If the EU is not present in the world's growth regions, others will be. The EU's strength has long been its openness to the world. But that openness must be consistent with our interests, values and security considerations.

In my first Statement of Government Policy, I said that Sweden would be an active, engaged and proactive member of the EU - before, during and now after our Presidency. EU affairs are not a luxury, to be considered by the Government when time allows.

EU policy is Swedish domestic policy. Many Swedish national interests can only be safeguarded through the EU.

But Sweden is often worse than other countries at identifying and formulating its national interests. Sometimes we lack the desire to take a clear stance. Sometimes we have not sought out likeminded partners. Sometimes we have simply engaged with issues at too late a stage.

We are now changing this. The Government will institute new forms of consultation and cooperation with the business sector, the social partners and other important stakeholders who represent strategic Swedish interests. This is good for Sweden and for the EU.

I have outlined the Government's view of the problems and opportunities facing the EU in these turbulent times. The EU is our main forum for international cooperation, and an important platform for a small, internationally oriented country such as ours.

Let us now use that platform. To combat crime and reduce immigration by securing Europe's external borders. To succeed in the climate transition. To safeguard our Swedish export companies.

But also to protect the fundamental values of freedom, peace, democracy and the rule of law that we believe in. Sweden's history is intimately intertwined with Europe's - but so too is Sweden's future.",foreignaffairs.co.nz,news,foreignaffairs.co.nz,Mil-Osi Publisher,-0.0980392156862745,453453140,1,,eng-9569612

Located in the areas of Närpiö and Kristiinankaupunki in western Finland, the wind farm will produce more than 1 TWh of wind power annually, around 5% of Finland's total wind power production. Fortum owns 60% of the wind farm, while Helen owns 40%. Helen will purchase around 50% of the wind farm's electricity production until the end of its life cycle.

""With 380 MW, Pjelax will double the wind power capacity operated by Fortum. Wind power plays an important role alongside the rest of our emission-free power generation. In line with our strategy, we provide clean electricity in the Nordic countries and help in electrifying industry to reduce its emissions. Pjelax is a prime example of how Fortum helps its customers reduce their carbon dioxide emissions,"" says Markus Rauramo, President and CEO of Fortum.

""The Pjelax wind farm is a significant joint effort by Helen and Fortum to increase renewable electricity production. Wind power generation creates a competitive advantage for Finland. Increasing the supply lowers customers' electricity prices and enables investments based on the consumption of clean electricity,"" says Olli Sirkka, CEO, Helen.

Suvic Oy and Närpiö-based Simons Infra Oy were responsible for the extensive infrastructure construction work and earthworks at the wind farm. The special transport of the massive wind turbines took place through the port of Kaskinen, including a total of 728 special transport operations, or 13 transport operations per wind turbine. The regional economic impacts will be reflected in municipal land rental income and property tax revenue, totalling millions of euros annually.

The construction of the Pjelax wind farm began in January 2022 and was completed on schedule in good cooperation with more than 400 landowners and several local business owners, organisations and officials. Finland's transmission system operator Fingrid and turbine supplier Nordex also made a significant contribution to ensuring that the project ran smoothly. At the opening ceremony of the wind farm, local residents celebrated the joint achievement and appreciated the promotion of the transition to clean energy in Finland.

After a day of meetings with senior officials, civil society figures and university students during which he exhorted them against being discouraged, Blinken took to the stage at a Kyiv bar to play rhythm guitar with a local band on Neil Young's 1989 hit Rockin' in the Free World.

Earlier on his unannounced visit to Kyiv, Blinken told Ukrainian leaders that despite a months-long delay in US assistance that left them vulnerable to renewed Russian military strikes, more weaponry is coming and some has already arrived.

He made the case even as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy appealed to him personally for more air defence systems to protect civilians under intense Russian fire in the northeast. Blinken also lambasted Russian President Vladimir Putin for underestimating Ukraine's determination to fight back.

""We meet at a critical moment,"" he told students at the Kyiv Polytechnic Institute. ""The coming weeks and months will demand a great deal of Ukrainians, who have already sacrificed so much. I've come to Ukraine with a message: You are not alone.""

""We sometimes hear that time is on Putin's side,"" Blinken said. ""That Russia's bigger population, Putin's willingness to throw more Russians into the meat grinder of his making, and sink more of Russia's resources into trying to subjugate Ukraine means that Russia can't lose.""

""In fact, Russia's been losing the battle to control Ukraine's destiny for 20 years. And Putin has it wrong -- time is on Ukraine's side,"" he said. ""As the war goes on, Russia is going back in time. Ukraine is moving forward.""

And yet, in increasingly intense attacks along the northeastern border in recent days, Moscow's troops have captured about 100-125sq km in the northeast Kharkiv region that includes at least seven villages, according to open-source monitoring analysts. Though most of those villages were already depopulated, thousands of civilians in the area have fled the fighting.

The Kremlin's forces have also been making a concerted push in the east, seeking to drive deeper into the partly occupied Donetsk region. The main focus of Russian attacks on Tuesday was Pokrovsk, just inside the Ukrainian border in Donetsk, where the Kremlin's forces launched 24 assaults, the Ukrainian general staff said in a report.

Analysts have called this moment one of the most dangerous for Ukraine since Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022.

""We know this is a challenging time,"" Blinken told Zelenskyy in his first meeting of the day after arriving in Kyiv on an overnight train from Poland. But, he said, American military aid is ""going to make a real difference against the ongoing Russian aggression on the battlefield"".

The visit comes less than a month after Congress approved a long-delayed foreign assistance package that sets aside US$60 billion ($99.3b) in aid for Ukraine, much of which will go towards replenishing badly depleted artillery and air defence systems.

Moscow's renewed offensive in Kharkiv is the most significant border incursion since the early days of the war, and comes after months when the roughly 1000km front line barely budged.

More than 7500 civilians had been evacuated from the area, authorities said. At the same time, the Kremlin's forces are expanding their push to the northern border regions of Sumy and Chernihiv, Ukrainian officials say, and Kyiv's outgunned and outnumbered soldiers are struggling to hold them back.

Troops fought street to street on the outskirts of Vovchansk, among the largest towns in the Kharkiv area, regional Governor Oleh Syniehubov said on national television. Two civilians were killed in Russian shelling on Tuesday, he said.

The UN human rights office said the battles were taking a heavy toll.

""We are deeply concerned at the plight of civilians in Ukraine,"" Liz Throssell, spokeswoman for the office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, said in Geneva. ""In the Kharkiv region, the situation is dire.""

Russia in recent weeks also has launched wide attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure. The operator of the national high-voltage electricity grid, Ukrenergo, said on Tuesday it was starting ""controlled emergency shutdowns"" for industries and households because of ""a significant shortage of electricity in the system due to Russian shelling and an increase in consumption due to the cold weather.""

Zelenskyy thanked Blinken for the US aid, but said more was necessary, including two Patriot air defence systems urgently needed to protect Kharkiv.

""The people are under attack: civilians, warriors, everybody. They're under Russian missiles,"" he said.

Artillery, air defence interceptors and long-range ballistic missiles have already been delivered, some of them to the front lines, said a senior US official travelling with Blinken.

Before the trip, US officials noted that since President Joe Biden signed the aid package last month, the administration has already announced US$1.4 billion in short-term military assistance and US$6 billion in longer-term support.

Blinken, on his fourth trip to Kyiv since Russian troops rolled over the border, told Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal the US intends to support Kyiv beyond the war's end.

""The United States is determined, determined to help Ukraine succeed, succeed both in the battlefield victory but also succeed, as we would say, in winning the peace and building the strongest possible Ukraine,"" Blinken said.

But delays in US assistance, particularly since the Israel-Hamas war began and has preoccupied top administration officials, have triggered deep concerns in Kyiv and Europe. Blinken, for example, has visited the Middle East seven times since the war in Gaza began in October. His last trip to Kyiv was in September.

Blinken went with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba for lunch at a Kyiv pizza restaurant founded by Ukrainian veterans, pronouncing it ""superb"". On Blinken's last visit, the pair ate at a recently reopened McDonald's restaurant.

Blinken's speech to students extolling Ukraine's ""strategic successes"" in the war was billed as a complement to one he gave last year in Helsinki, Finland, deriding Putin for Moscow's ""strategic failures"" in launching the war.

Since the Helsinki speech, however, Russia has intensified its attacks, most noticeably as the US House of Representatives sat on the aid package for months without action, forcing a suspension in the provision of most US assistance. Those attacks have increased in recent weeks as Russia has sought to take advantage of Ukrainian shortages in manpower and weapons while the new assistance is in transit.

Meanwhile, Putin plans to make a two-day state visit to China this week, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said. Beijing has backed Moscow politically in the war and has sent machine tools, electronics and other items seen as contributing to the Russian war effort, without exporting weaponry.

After a day of meetings with senior officials, civil society figures and university students during which he exhorted them against being discouraged, Blinken took to the stage at a Kyiv bar to play rhythm guitar with a local band on Neil Young's 1989 hit ""Rockin' in the Free World.""

Earlier on his unannounced visit to Kyiv, Blinken told Ukrainian leaders that despite a monthslong delay in U.S. assistance that left them vulnerable to renewed Russian military strikes more weaponry is coming and some has already arrived.

He made the case even as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy appealed to him personally for more air defense systems to protect civilians under intense Russian fire in the northeast. Blinken also lambasted Russian President Vladimir Putin for underestimating Ukraine's determination to fight back.

""We meet at a critical moment,"" he told students at the Kyiv Polytechnic Institute. ""The coming weeks and months will demand a great deal of Ukrainians, who have already sacrificed so much. I've come to Ukraine with a message: You are not alone.""

""We sometimes hear that time is on Putin's side,"" Blinken said. ""That Russia's bigger population, Putin's willingness to throw more Russians into the meat grinder of his making, and sink more of Russia's resources into trying to subjugate Ukraine means that Russia can't lose.""

""In fact, Russia's been losing the battle to control Ukraine's destiny for 20 years. And Putin has it wrong - time is on Ukraine's side,"" he said. ""As the war goes on, Russia is going back in time. Ukraine is moving forward.""

And yet, in increasingly intense attacks along the northeastern border in recent days, Moscow's troops have captured around 100 to 125 square kilometers (40 to 50 square miles) in the northeast Kharkiv region that includes at least seven villages, according to open-source monitoring analysts. Though most of those villages were already depopulated, thousands of civilians in the area have fled the fighting.

The Kremlin's forces have also been making a concerted push in the east, seeking to drive deeper into the partly occupied Donetsk region. The main focus of Russian attacks Tuesday was Pokrovsk, just inside the Ukrainian border in Donetsk, where the Kremlin's forces launched 24 assaults, the Ukrainian general staff said in a report.

Analysts have called this moment one of the most dangerous for Ukraine since Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022.

""We know this is a challenging time,"" Blinken told Zelenskyy in his first meeting of the day after arriving in Kyiv on an overnight train from Poland. But, he added that American military aid is ""going to make a real difference against the ongoing Russian aggression on the battlefield.""

The visit comes less than a month after Congress approved a long-delayed foreign assistance package that sets aside $60 billion in aid for Ukraine, much of which will go toward replenishing badly depleted artillery and air defense systems.

Moscow's renewed offensive in Kharkiv is the most significant border incursion since the early days of the war -- and comes after months when the roughly 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) front line barely budged.

More than 7,500 civilians have been evacuated from the area, according to authorities. At the same time, the Kremlin's forces are expanding their push to the northern border regions of Sumy and Chernihiv, Ukrainian officials say, and Kyiv's outgunned and outnumbered soldiers are struggling to hold them back.

Troops fought street to street on the outskirts of Vovchansk, among the largest towns in the Kharkiv area, regional Gov. Oleh Syniehubov said on national television. Two civilians were killed in Russian shelling Tuesday, he said.

The U.N. human rights office said the battles are taking a heavy toll.

""We are deeply concerned at the plight of civilians in Ukraine,"" Liz Throssell, spokeswoman for the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, said in Geneva. ""In the Kharkiv region, the situation is dire.""

Russia in recent weeks also has launched wide attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure. The operator of the national high-voltage electricity grid, Ukrenergo, said late Tuesday that it was starting ""controlled emergency shutdowns"" for industries and households because of ""a significant shortage of electricity in the system due to Russian shelling and an increase in consumption due to the cold weather.""

Zelenskyy thanked Blinken for the U.S. aid -- but added that more is necessary, including two Patriot air defense systems urgently needed to protect Kharkiv.

""The people are under attack: civilians, warriors, everybody. They're under Russian missiles,"" he said.

Artillery, air defense interceptors and long-range ballistic missiles have already been delivered, some of them already to the front lines, said a senior U.S. official traveling with the secretary who spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity ahead of Blinken's meetings.

Ahead of the trip, U.S. officials noted that since President Joe Biden signed the aid package late last month, the administration has already announced $1.4 billion in short-term military assistance and $6 billion in longer-term support.

Blinken, on his fourth trip to Kyiv since Russian troops rolled over the border, told Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal that the U.S. intends to support Kyiv beyond the war's end.

""The United States is determined, determined to help Ukraine succeed, succeed both in the battlefield victory but also succeed, as we would say, in winning the peace and building the strongest possible Ukraine,"" Blinken said.

But delays in U.S. assistance, particularly since the Israel-Hamas war began and has preoccupied top administration officials, have triggered deep concerns in Kyiv and Europe. Blinken, for example, has visited the Middle East seven times since the war in Gaza began in October. His last trip to Kyiv was in September.

Blinken went with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba for lunch at a Kyiv pizza restaurant founded by Ukrainian veterans, pronouncing it ""superb."" On Blinken's last visit, the pair ate at a recently reopened McDonald's restaurant.

Blinken's speech to students extolling Ukraine's ""strategic successes"" in the war was billed as a complement to one he gave last year in Helsinki, Finland, deriding Putin for Moscow's ""strategic failures"" in launching the war.

Since the Helsinki speech, however, Russia has intensified its attacks, most noticeably as the U.S. House of Representatives sat on the aid package for months without action, forcing a suspension in the provision of most U.S. assistance. Those attacks have increased in recent weeks as Russia has sought to take advantage of Ukrainian shortages in manpower and weapons while the new assistance is in transit.

Meanwhile, Putin plans to make a two-day state visit to China this week, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said. Beijing has backed Moscow politically in the war and has sent machine tools, electronics and other items seen as contributing to the Russian war effort, without actually exporting weaponry.

Blinken and other U.S. officials said despite some recent setbacks, Ukraine could still claim significant victories. Those include reclaiming some 50% of the territory Russian forces took in the early months of the war, boosting its economic standing and improving transportation and trade links, not least through military successes in the Black Sea.

Moscow's renewed offensive in Kharkiv is the most significant border incursion since the early days of the war - and comes after months when the roughly 620-mile front line barely budged.

More than 7,500 civilians have been evacuated from the area, according to authorities. At the same time, the Kremlin's forces are expanding their push to the northern border regions of Sumy and Chernihiv, Ukrainian officials say, and Kyiv's outgunned and outnumbered soldiers are struggling to hold them back.

Troops fought street to street on the outskirts of Vovchansk, among the largest towns in the Kharkiv area, regional Gov. Oleh Syniehubov said on national television. Two civilians were killed in Russian shelling Tuesday, he said.

The U.N. human rights office said the battles are taking a heavy toll.

""We are deeply concerned at the plight of civilians in Ukraine,"" Liz Throssell, spokeswoman for the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, said in Geneva. ""In the Kharkiv region, the situation is dire.""

Russia in recent weeks also has launched wide attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure. The operator of the national high-voltage electricity grid, Ukrenergo, said late Tuesday that it was starting ""controlled emergency shutdowns"" for industries and households because of ""a significant shortage of electricity in the system due to Russian shelling and an increase in consumption due to the cold weather.""

Zelensky thanked Blinken for the U.S. aid - but added that more is necessary, including two Patriot air defense systems urgently needed to protect Kharkiv.

""The people are under attack: civilians, warriors, everybody. They're under Russian missiles,"" he said.

Artillery, air defense interceptors and long-range ballistic missiles have already been delivered, some of them already to the front lines, said a senior U.S. official traveling with the secretary who spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity ahead of Blinken's meetings.

Ahead of the trip, U.S. officials noted that since President Biden signed the aid package late last month, the administration has already announced $1.4 billion in short-term military assistance and $6 billion in longer-term support.

Blinken, on his fourth trip to Kyiv since Russian troops rolled over the border, told Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal that the U.S. intends to support Kyiv beyond the war's end.

""The United States is determined, determined to help Ukraine succeed, succeed both in the battlefield victory but also succeed, as we would say, in winning the peace and building the strongest possible Ukraine,"" Blinken said.

But delays in U.S. assistance, particularly since the Israel-Hamas war began and has preoccupied top administration officials, have triggered deep concerns in Kyiv and Europe. Blinken, for example, has visited the Middle East seven times since the war in Gaza began in October. His last trip to Kyiv was in September.

Blinken went with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba for lunch at a Kyiv pizza restaurant founded by Ukrainian veterans, pronouncing it ""superb."" On Blinken's last visit, the pair ate at a recently reopened McDonald's restaurant.

Blinken's speech to students extolling Ukraine's ""strategic successes"" in the war was billed as a complement to one he gave last year in Helsinki, Finland, deriding Putin for Moscow's ""strategic failures"" in launching the war.

Since the Helsinki speech, however, Russia has intensified its attacks, most noticeably as the U.S. House of Representatives sat on the aid package for months without action, forcing a suspension in the provision of most U.S. assistance. Those attacks have increased in recent weeks as Russia has sought to take advantage of Ukrainian shortages in manpower and weapons while the new assistance is in transit.

Meanwhile, Putin plans to make a two-day state visit to China this week, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said. Beijing has backed Moscow politically in the war and has sent machine tools, electronics and other items seen as contributing to the Russian war effort, without actually exporting weaponry.

Blinken and other U.S. officials said despite some recent setbacks, Ukraine could still claim significant victories. Those include reclaiming some 50% of the territory Russian forces took in the early months of the war, boosting its economic standing and improving transportation and trade links, not least through military successes in the Black Sea.

After a day of meetings with senior officials, civil society figures and university students during which he exhorted them against being discouraged, Blinken took to the stage at a Kyiv bar to play rhythm guitar with a local band on Neil Young's 1989 hit ""Rockin' in the Free World.""

Earlier on his unannounced visit to Kyiv, Blinken told Ukrainian leaders that despite a monthslong delay in U.S. assistance that left them vulnerable to renewed Russian military strikes more weaponry is coming and some has already arrived.

He made the case even as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy appealed to him personally for more air defense systems to protect civilians under intense Russian fire in the northeast. Blinken also lambasted Russian President Vladimir Putin for underestimating Ukraine's determination to fight back.

""We meet at a critical moment,"" he told students at the Kyiv Polytechnic Institute. ""The coming weeks and months will demand a great deal of Ukrainians, who have already sacrificed so much. I've come to Ukraine with a message: You are not alone.""

""We sometimes hear that time is on Putin's side,"" Blinken said. ""That Russia's bigger population, Putin's willingness to throw more Russians into the meat grinder of his making, and sink more of Russia's resources into trying to subjugate Ukraine means that Russia can't lose.""

""In fact, Russia's been losing the battle to control Ukraine's destiny for 20 years. And Putin has it wrong - time is on Ukraine's side,"" he said. ""As the war goes on, Russia is going back in time. Ukraine is moving forward.""

And yet, in increasingly intense attacks along the northeastern border in recent days, Moscow's troops have captured around 100 to 125 square kilometers (40 to 50 square miles) in the northeast Kharkiv region that includes at least seven villages, according to open-source monitoring analysts. Though most of those villages were already depopulated, thousands of civilians in the area have fled the fighting.

The Kremlin's forces have also been making a concerted push in the east, seeking to drive deeper into the partly occupied Donetsk region. The main focus of Russian attacks Tuesday was Pokrovsk, just inside the Ukrainian border in Donetsk, where the Kremlin's forces launched 24 assaults, the Ukrainian general staff said in a report.

Analysts have called this moment one of the most dangerous for Ukraine since Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022.

""We know this is a challenging time,"" Blinken told Zelenskyy in his first meeting of the day after arriving in Kyiv on an overnight train from Poland. But, he added that American military aid is ""going to make a real difference against the ongoing Russian aggression on the battlefield.""

The visit comes less than a month after Congress approved a long-delayed foreign assistance package that sets aside $60 billion in aid for Ukraine, much of which will go toward replenishing badly depleted artillery and air defense systems.

The main focus of Russian attacks Tuesday was Pokrovsk, just inside the Ukrainian border in Donetsk, where the Kremlin's forces launched 24 assaults, the Ukrainian general staff said in a report.

Analysts have called this moment one of the most dangerous for Ukraine since Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022.

""We know this is a challenging time,"" Blinken told Zelenskyy in his first meeting of the day after arriving in Kyiv on an overnight train from Poland. But, he added that American military aid is ""going to make a real difference against the ongoing Russian aggression on the battlefield.""

The visit comes less than a month after Congress approved a long-delayed foreign assistance package that sets aside $60 billion in aid for Ukraine, much of which will go toward replenishing badly depleted artillery and air defense systems.

Moscow's renewed offensive in Kharkiv is the most significant border incursion since the early days of the war -- and comes after months when the roughly 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) front line barely budged.

More than 7,500 civilians have been evacuated from the area, according to authorities. At the same time, the Kremlin's forces are expanding their push to the northern border regions of Sumy and Chernihiv, Ukrainian officials say, and Kyiv's outgunned and outnumbered soldiers are struggling to hold them back.

Troops fought street to street on the outskirts of Vovchansk, among the largest towns in the Kharkiv area, regional Gov. Oleh Syniehubov said on national television. Two civilians were killed in Russian shelling Tuesday, he said.

The U.N. human rights office said the battles are taking a heavy toll.

""We are deeply concerned at the plight of civilians in Ukraine,"" Liz Throssell, spokeswoman for the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, said in Geneva. ""In the Kharkiv region, the situation is dire.""

Russia in recent weeks also has launched wide attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure. The operator of the national high-voltage electricity grid, Ukrenergo, said late Tuesday that it was starting ""controlled emergency shutdowns"" for industries and households because of ""a significant shortage of electricity in the system due to Russian shelling and an increase in consumption due to the cold weather.""

Zelenskyy thanked Blinken for the U.S. aid -- but added that more is necessary, including two Patriot air defense systems urgently needed to protect Kharkiv.

""The people are under attack: civilians, warriors, everybody. They're under Russian missiles,"" he said.

Artillery, air defense interceptors and long-range ballistic missiles have already been delivered, some of them already to the front lines, said a senior U.S. official traveling with the secretary who spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity ahead of Blinken's meetings.

Ahead of the trip, U.S. officials noted that since President Joe Biden signed the aid package late last month, the administration has already announced $1.4 billion in short-term military assistance and $6 billion in longer-term support.

Blinken, on his fourth trip to Kyiv since Russian troops rolled over the border, told Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal that the U.S. intends to support Kyiv beyond the war's end.

""The United States is determined, determined to help Ukraine succeed, succeed both in the battlefield victory but also succeed, as we would say, in winning the peace and building the strongest possible Ukraine,"" Blinken said.

But delays in U.S. assistance, particularly since the Israel-Hamas war began and has preoccupied top administration officials, have triggered deep concerns in Kyiv and Europe. Blinken, for example, has visited the Middle East seven times since the war in Gaza began in October. His last trip to Kyiv was in September.

Blinken went with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba for lunch at a Kyiv pizza restaurant founded by Ukrainian veterans, pronouncing it ""superb."" On Blinken's last visit, the pair ate at a recently reopened McDonald's restaurant.

Blinken's speech to students extolling Ukraine's ""strategic successes"" in the war was billed as a complement to one he gave last year in Helsinki, Finland, deriding Putin for Moscow's ""strategic failures"" in launching the war.

Since the Helsinki speech, however, Russia has intensified its attacks, most noticeably as the U.S. House of Representatives sat on the aid package for months without action, forcing a suspension in the provision of most U.S. assistance. Those attacks have increased in recent weeks as Russia has sought to take advantage of Ukrainian shortages in manpower and weapons while the new assistance is in transit.

Meanwhile, Putin plans to make a two-day state visit to China this week, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said. Beijing has backed Moscow politically in the war and has sent machine tools, electronics and other items seen as contributing to the Russian war effort, without actually exporting weaponry.

Blinken and other U.S. officials said despite some recent setbacks, Ukraine could still claim significant victories. Those include reclaiming some 50% of the territory Russian forces took in the early months of the war, boosting its economic standing and improving transportation and trade links, not least through military successes in the Black Sea.

Blinken arrived in Kyiv on Tuesday in an unannounced diplomatic mission to reassure Ukraine that it has American support as it struggles to defend against increasingly intense Russian attacks.

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) -- U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken sought Tuesday to rally the spirits of glum Ukrainians facing a fierce new Russian offensive, assuring them that they are not alone and that billions of dollars in American military aid on its way to the country would make a ""real difference"" on the battlefield.

After a day of meetings with senior officials, civil society figures and university students during which he exhorted them against being discouraged, Blinken took to the stage at a Kyiv bar to play rhythm guitar with a local band on Neil Young's 1989 hit ""Rockin' in the Free World.""

Earlier on his unannounced visit to Kyiv, Blinken told Ukrainian leaders that despite a monthslong delay in U.S. assistance that left them vulnerable to renewed Russian military strikes more weaponry is coming and some has already arrived.

He made the case even as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy appealed to him personally for more air defense systems to protect civilians under intense Russian fire in the northeast. Blinken also lambasted Russian President Vladimir Putin for underestimating Ukraine's determination to fight back.

""We meet at a critical moment,"" he told students at the Kyiv Polytechnic Institute. ""The coming weeks and months will demand a great deal of Ukrainians, who have already sacrificed so much. I've come to Ukraine with a message: You are not alone.""

""We sometimes hear that time is on Putin's side,"" Blinken said. ""That Russia's bigger population, Putin's willingness to throw more Russians into the meat grinder of his making, and sink more of Russia's resources into trying to subjugate Ukraine means that Russia can't lose.""

""In fact, Russia's been losing the battle to control Ukraine's destiny for 20 years. And Putin has it wrong - time is on Ukraine's side,"" he said. ""As the war goes on, Russia is going back in time. Ukraine is moving forward.""

And yet, in increasingly intense attacks along the northeastern border in recent days, Moscow's troops have captured around 100 to 125 square kilometers (40 to 50 square miles) in the northeast Kharkiv region that includes at least seven villages, according to open-source monitoring analysts. Though most of those villages were already depopulated, thousands of civilians in the area have fled the fighting.

The Kremlin's forces have also been making a concerted push in the east, seeking to drive deeper into the partly occupied Donetsk region. The main focus of Russian attacks Tuesday was Pokrovsk, just inside the Ukrainian border in Donetsk, where the Kremlin's forces launched 24 assaults, the Ukrainian general staff said in a report.

""In fact, Russia's been losing the battle to control Ukraine's destiny for 20 years. And Putin has it wrong - time is on Ukraine's side,"" he said. ""As the war goes on, Russia is going back in time. Ukraine is moving forward.""

And yet, in increasingly intense attacks along the northeastern border in recent days, Moscow's troops have captured around 100 to 125 square kilometers (40 to 50 square miles) in the northeast Kharkiv region that includes at least seven villages, according to open-source monitoring analysts. Though most of those villages were already depopulated, thousands of civilians in the area have fled the fighting.

The Kremlin's forces have also been making a concerted push in the east, seeking to drive deeper into the partly occupied Donetsk region. The main focus of Russian attacks Tuesday was Pokrovsk, just inside the Ukrainian border in Donetsk, where the Kremlin's forces launched 24 assaults, the Ukrainian general staff said in a report.

Analysts have called this moment one of the most dangerous for Ukraine since Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022.

""We know this is a challenging time,"" Blinken told Zelenskyy in his first meeting of the day after arriving in Kyiv on an overnight train from Poland. But, he added that American military aid is ""going to make a real difference against the ongoing Russian aggression on the battlefield.""

The visit comes less than a month after Congress approved a long-delayed foreign assistance package that sets aside $60 billion in aid for Ukraine, much of which will go toward replenishing badly depleted artillery and air defense systems.

Moscow's renewed offensive in Kharkiv is the most significant border incursion since the early days of the war -- and comes after months when the roughly 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) front line barely budged.

More than 7,500 civilians have been evacuated from the area, according to authorities. At the same time, the Kremlin's forces are expanding their push to the northern border regions of Sumy and Chernihiv, Ukrainian officials say, and Kyiv's outgunned and outnumbered soldiers are struggling to hold them back.

Troops fought street to street on the outskirts of Vovchansk, among the largest towns in the Kharkiv area, regional Gov. Oleh Syniehubov said on national television. Two civilians were killed in Russian shelling Tuesday, he said.

The U.N. human rights office said the battles are taking a heavy toll.

""We are deeply concerned at the plight of civilians in Ukraine,"" Liz Throssell, spokeswoman for the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, said in Geneva. ""In the Kharkiv region, the situation is dire.""

Russia in recent weeks also has launched wide attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure. The operator of the national high-voltage electricity grid, Ukrenergo, said late Tuesday that it was starting ""controlled emergency shutdowns"" for industries and households because of ""a significant shortage of electricity in the system due to Russian shelling and an increase in consumption due to the cold weather.""

Zelenskyy thanked Blinken for the U.S. aid -- but added that more is necessary, including two Patriot air defense systems urgently needed to protect Kharkiv.

""The people are under attack: civilians, warriors, everybody. They're under Russian missiles,"" he said.

Artillery, air defense interceptors and long-range ballistic missiles have already been delivered, some of them already to the front lines, said a senior U.S. official traveling with the secretary who spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity ahead of Blinken's meetings.

Ahead of the trip, U.S. officials noted that since President Joe Biden signed the aid package late last month, the administration has already announced $1.4 billion in short-term military assistance and $6 billion in longer-term support.

Blinken, on his fourth trip to Kyiv since Russian troops rolled over the border, told Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal that the U.S. intends to support Kyiv beyond the war's end.

""The United States is determined, determined to help Ukraine succeed, succeed both in the battlefield victory but also succeed, as we would say, in winning the peace and building the strongest possible Ukraine,"" Blinken said.

But delays in U.S. assistance, particularly since the Israel-Hamas war began and has preoccupied top administration officials, have triggered deep concerns in Kyiv and Europe. Blinken, for example, has visited the Middle East seven times since the war in Gaza began in October. His last trip to Kyiv was in September.

Blinken went with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba for lunch at a Kyiv pizza restaurant founded by Ukrainian veterans, pronouncing it ""superb."" On Blinken's last visit, the pair ate at a recently reopened McDonald's restaurant.

Blinken's speech to students extolling Ukraine's ""strategic successes"" in the war was billed as a complement to one he gave last year in Helsinki, Finland, deriding Putin for Moscow's ""strategic failures"" in launching the war.

Since the Helsinki speech, however, Russia has intensified its attacks, most noticeably as the U.S. House of Representatives sat on the aid package for months without action, forcing a suspension in the provision of most U.S. assistance. Those attacks have increased in recent weeks as Russia has sought to take advantage of Ukrainian shortages in manpower and weapons while the new assistance is in transit.

Meanwhile, Putin plans to make a two-day state visit to China this week, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said. Beijing has backed Moscow politically in the war and has sent machine tools, electronics and other items seen as contributing to the Russian war effort, without actually exporting weaponry.

Blinken and other U.S. officials said despite some recent setbacks, Ukraine could still claim significant victories. Those include reclaiming some 50% of the territory Russian forces took in the early months of the war, boosting its economic standing and improving transportation and trade links, not least through military successes in the Black Sea.

After a day of meetings with senior officials, civil society figures and university students during which he exhorted them against being discouraged, Blinken took to the stage at a Kyiv bar to play rhythm guitar with a local band on Neil Young's 1989 hit ""Rockin' in the Free World.""

Earlier on his unannounced visit to Kyiv, Blinken told Ukrainian leaders that despite a monthslong delay in U.S. assistance that left them vulnerable to renewed Russian military strikes more weaponry is coming and some has already arrived.

He made the case even as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy appealed to him personally for more air defense systems to protect civilians under intense Russian fire in the northeast. Blinken also lambasted Russian President Vladimir Putin for underestimating Ukraine's determination to fight back.

""We sometimes hear that time is on Putin's side,"" Blinken said. ""That Russia's bigger population, Putin's willingness to throw more Russians into the meat grinder of his making, and sink more of Russia's resources into trying to subjugate Ukraine means that Russia can't lose.""

""In fact, Russia's been losing the battle to control Ukraine's destiny for 20 years. And Putin has it wrong - time is on Ukraine's side,"" he said. ""As the war goes on, Russia is going back in time. Ukraine is moving forward.""

And yet, in increasingly intense attacks along the northeastern border in recent days, Moscow's troops have captured around 100 to 125 square kilometers (40 to 50 square miles) in the northeast Kharkiv region that includes at least seven villages, according to open-source monitoring analysts. Though most of those villages were already depopulated, thousands of civilians in the area have fled the fighting.

The Kremlin's forces have also been making a concerted push in the east, seeking to drive deeper into the partly occupied Donetsk region. The main focus of Russian attacks Tuesday was Pokrovsk, just inside the Ukrainian border in Donetsk, where the Kremlin's forces launched 24 assaults, the Ukrainian general staff said in a report.

Analysts have called this moment one of the most dangerous for Ukraine since Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022.

""We know this is a challenging time,"" Blinken told Zelenskyy in his first meeting of the day after arriving in Kyiv on an overnight train from Poland. But, he added that American military aid is ""going to make a real difference against the ongoing Russian aggression on the battlefield.""

The visit comes less than a month after Congress approved a long-delayed foreign assistance package that sets aside $60 billion in aid for Ukraine, much of which will go toward replenishing badly depleted artillery and air defense systems.

Moscow's renewed offensive in Kharkiv is the most significant border incursion since the early days of the war -- and comes after months when the roughly 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) front line barely budged.

More than 7,500 civilians have been evacuated from the area, according to authorities. At the same time, the Kremlin's forces are expanding their push to the northern border regions of Sumy and Chernihiv, Ukrainian officials say, and Kyiv's outgunned and outnumbered soldiers are struggling to hold them back.

Troops fought street to street on the outskirts of Vovchansk, among the largest towns in the Kharkiv area, regional Gov. Oleh Syniehubov said on national television. Two civilians were killed in Russian shelling Tuesday, he said.

The U.N. human rights office said the battles are taking a heavy toll.

""We are deeply concerned at the plight of civilians in Ukraine,"" Liz Throssell, spokeswoman for the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, said in Geneva. ""In the Kharkiv region, the situation is dire.""

Russia in recent weeks also has launched wide attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure. The operator of the national high-voltage electricity grid, Ukrenergo, said late Tuesday that it was starting ""controlled emergency shutdowns"" for industries and households because of ""a significant shortage of electricity in the system due to Russian shelling and an increase in consumption due to the cold weather.""

Zelenskyy thanked Blinken for the U.S. aid -- but added that more is necessary, including two Patriot air defense systems urgently needed to protect Kharkiv.

""The people are under attack: civilians, warriors, everybody. They're under Russian missiles,"" he said.

Artillery, air defense interceptors and long-range ballistic missiles have already been delivered, some of them already to the front lines, said a senior U.S. official traveling with the secretary who spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity ahead of Blinken's meetings.

Ahead of the trip, U.S. officials noted that since President Joe Biden signed the aid package late last month, the administration has already announced $1.4 billion in short-term military assistance and $6 billion in longer-term support.

Blinken, on his fourth trip to Kyiv since Russian troops rolled over the border, told Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal that the U.S. intends to support Kyiv beyond the war's end.

""The United States is determined, determined to help Ukraine succeed, succeed both in the battlefield victory but also succeed, as we would say, in winning the peace and building the strongest possible Ukraine,"" Blinken said.

But delays in U.S. assistance, particularly since the Israel-Hamas war began and has preoccupied top administration officials, have triggered deep concerns in Kyiv and Europe. Blinken, for example, has visited the Middle East seven times since the war in Gaza began in October. His last trip to Kyiv was in September.

Blinken went with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba for lunch at a Kyiv pizza restaurant founded by Ukrainian veterans, pronouncing it ""superb."" On Blinken's last visit, the pair ate at a recently reopened McDonald's restaurant.

Blinken's speech to students extolling Ukraine's ""strategic successes"" in the war was billed as a complement to one he gave last year in Helsinki, Finland, deriding Putin for Moscow's ""strategic failures"" in launching the war.

Since the Helsinki speech, however, Russia has intensified its attacks, most noticeably as the U.S. House of Representatives sat on the aid package for months without action, forcing a suspension in the provision of most U.S. assistance. Those attacks have increased in recent weeks as Russia has sought to take advantage of Ukrainian shortages in manpower and weapons while the new assistance is in transit.

Meanwhile, Putin plans to make a two-day state visit to China this week, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said. Beijing has backed Moscow politically in the war and has sent machine tools, electronics and other items seen as contributing to the Russian war effort, without actually exporting weaponry.

Blinken and other U.S. officials said despite some recent setbacks, Ukraine could still claim significant victories. Those include reclaiming some 50% of the territory Russian forces took in the early months of the war, boosting its economic standing and improving transportation and trade links, not least through military successes in the Black Sea.

After a day of meetings with senior officials, civil society figures and university students during which he exhorted them against being discouraged, Blinken took to the stage at a Kyiv bar to play rhythm guitar with a local band on Neil Young's 1989 hit ""Rockin' in the Free World.""

Blinken also lambasted Russian President Vladimir Putin for underestimating Ukraine's determination to fight back.

""We meet at a critical moment,"" he told students at the Kyiv Polytechnic Institute. ""The coming weeks and months will demand a great deal of Ukrainians, who have already sacrificed so much. I've come to Ukraine with a message: You are not alone.""

""We sometimes hear that time is on Putin's side,"" Blinken said. ""That Russia's bigger population, Putin's willingness to throw more Russians into the meat grinder of his making, and sink more of Russia's resources into trying to subjugate Ukraine means that Russia can't lose.""

""In fact, Russia's been losing the battle to control Ukraine's destiny for 20 years. And Putin has it wrong - time is on Ukraine's side,"" he said. ""As the war goes on, Russia is going back in time. Ukraine is moving forward.""

And yet, in increasingly intense attacks along the northeastern border in recent days, Moscow's troops have captured around 100 to 125 square kilometers (40 to 50 square miles) in the northeast Kharkiv region that includes at least seven villages, according to open-source monitoring analysts. Though most of those villages were already depopulated, thousands of civilians in the area have fled the fighting.

The Kremlin's forces have also been making a concerted push in the east, seeking to drive deeper into the partly occupied Donetsk region. The main focus of Russian attacks Tuesday was Pokrovsk, just inside the Ukrainian border in Donetsk, where the Kremlin's forces launched 24 assaults, the Ukrainian general staff said in a report.

Analysts have called this moment one of the most dangerous for Ukraine since Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022.

""We know this is a challenging time,"" Blinken told Zelenskyy in his first meeting of the day after arriving in Kyiv on an overnight train from Poland. But, he added that American military aid is ""going to make a real difference against the ongoing Russian aggression on the battlefield.""

The visit comes less than a month after Congress approved a long-delayed foreign assistance package that sets aside $60 billion in aid for Ukraine, much of which will go toward replenishing badly depleted artillery and air defense systems.

Moscow's renewed offensive in Kharkiv is the most significant border incursion since the early days of the war -- and comes after months when the roughly 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) front line barely budged.

More than 7,500 civilians have been evacuated from the area, according to authorities. At the same time, the Kremlin's forces are expanding their push to the northern border regions of Sumy and Chernihiv, Ukrainian officials say, and Kyiv's outgunned and outnumbered soldiers are struggling to hold them back.

Troops fought street to street on the outskirts of Vovchansk, among the largest towns in the Kharkiv area, regional Gov. Oleh Syniehubov said on national television. Two civilians were killed in Russian shelling Tuesday, he said.

The U.N. human rights office said the battles are taking a heavy toll.

""We are deeply concerned at the plight of civilians in Ukraine,"" Liz Throssell, spokeswoman for the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, said in Geneva. ""In the Kharkiv region, the situation is dire.""

Russia in recent weeks also has launched wide attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure. The operator of the national high-voltage electricity grid, Ukrenergo, said late Tuesday that it was starting ""controlled emergency shutdowns"" for industries and households because of ""a significant shortage of electricity in the system due to Russian shelling and an increase in consumption due to the cold weather.""

Zelenskyy thanked Blinken for the U.S. aid -- but added that more is necessary, including two Patriot air defense systems urgently needed to protect Kharkiv.

""The people are under attack: civilians, warriors, everybody. They're under Russian missiles,"" he said.

Artillery, air defense interceptors and long-range ballistic missiles have already been delivered, some of them already to the front lines, said a senior U.S. official traveling with the secretary who spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity ahead of Blinken's meetings.

Ahead of the trip, U.S. officials noted that since President Joe Biden signed the aid package late last month, the administration has already announced $1.4 billion in short-term military assistance and $6 billion in longer-term support.

Blinken, on his fourth trip to Kyiv since Russian troops rolled over the border, told Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal that the U.S. intends to support Kyiv beyond the war's end.

""The United States is determined, determined to help Ukraine succeed, succeed both in the battlefield victory but also succeed, as we would say, in winning the peace and building the strongest possible Ukraine,"" Blinken said.

But delays in U.S. assistance, particularly since the Israel-Hamas war began and has preoccupied top administration officials, have triggered deep concerns in Kyiv and Europe. Blinken, for example, has visited the Middle East seven times since the war in Gaza began in October. His last trip to Kyiv was in September.

Blinken went with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba for lunch at a Kyiv pizza restaurant founded by Ukrainian veterans, pronouncing it ""superb."" On Blinken's last visit, the pair ate at a recently reopened McDonald's restaurant.

Blinken's speech to students extolling Ukraine's ""strategic successes"" in the war was billed as a complement to one he gave last year in Helsinki, Finland, deriding Putin for Moscow's ""strategic failures"" in launching the war.

Since the Helsinki speech, however, Russia has intensified its attacks, most noticeably as the U.S. House of Representatives sat on the aid package for months without action, forcing a suspension in the provision of most U.S. assistance. Those attacks have increased in recent weeks as Russia has sought to take advantage of Ukrainian shortages in manpower and weapons while the new assistance is in transit.

Meanwhile, Putin plans to make a two-day state visit to China this week, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said. Beijing has backed Moscow politically in the war and has sent machine tools, electronics and other items seen as contributing to the Russian war effort, without actually exporting weaponry.

Blinken and other U.S. officials said despite some recent setbacks, Ukraine could still claim significant victories. Those include reclaiming some 50% of the territory Russian forces took in the early months of the war, boosting its economic standing and improving transportation and trade links, not least through military successes in the Black Sea.

Blinken arrived in Kyiv on Tuesday in an unannounced diplomatic mission to reassure Ukraine that it has American support as it struggles to defend against increasingly intense Russian attacks.

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) -- U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken sought Tuesday to rally the spirits of glum Ukrainians facing a fierce new Russian offensive, assuring them that they are not alone and that billions of dollars in American military aid on its way to the country would make a ""real difference"" on the battlefield.

After a day of meetings with senior officials, civil society figures and university students during which he exhorted them against being discouraged, Blinken took to the stage at a Kyiv bar to play rhythm guitar with a local band on Neil Young's 1989 hit ""Rockin' in the Free World.""

Earlier on his unannounced visit to Kyiv, Blinken told Ukrainian leaders that despite a monthslong delay in U.S. assistance that left them vulnerable to renewed Russian military strikes more weaponry is coming and some has already arrived.

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) -- U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken sought Tuesday to rally the spirits of glum Ukrainians facing a fierce new Russian offensive, assuring them that they are not alone and that billions of dollars in American military aid on its way to the country would make a ""real difference"" on the battlefield.

After a day of meetings with senior officials, civil society figures and university students during which he exhorted them against being discouraged, Blinken took to the stage at a Kyiv bar to play rhythm guitar with a local band on Neil Young's 1989 hit ""Rockin' in the Free World.""

Earlier on his unannounced visit to Kyiv, Blinken told Ukrainian leaders that despite a monthslong delay in U.S. assistance that left them vulnerable to renewed Russian military strikes more weaponry is coming and some has already arrived.

He made the case even as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy appealed to him personally for more air defense systems to protect civilians under intense Russian fire in the northeast. Blinken also lambasted Russian President Vladimir Putin for underestimating Ukraine's determination to fight back.

""We meet at a critical moment,"" he told students at the Kyiv Polytechnic Institute. ""The coming weeks and months will demand a great deal of Ukrainians, who have already sacrificed so much. I've come to Ukraine with a message: You are not alone.""

""We sometimes hear that time is on Putin's side,"" Blinken said. ""That Russia's bigger population, Putin's willingness to throw more Russians into the meat grinder of his making, and sink more of Russia's resources into trying to subjugate Ukraine means that Russia can't lose.""

""In fact, Russia's been losing the battle to control Ukraine's destiny for 20 years. And Putin has it wrong - time is on Ukraine's side,"" he said. ""As the war goes on, Russia is going back in time. Ukraine is moving forward.""

And yet, in increasingly intense attacks along the northeastern border in recent days, Moscow's troops have captured around 100 to 125 square kilometers (40 to 50 square miles) in the northeast Kharkiv region that includes at least seven villages, according to open-source monitoring analysts. Though most of those villages were already depopulated, thousands of civilians in the area have fled the fighting.

The Kremlin's forces have also been making a concerted push in the east, seeking to drive deeper into the partly occupied Donetsk region. The main focus of Russian attacks Tuesday was Pokrovsk, just inside the Ukrainian border in Donetsk, where the Kremlin's forces launched 24 assaults, the Ukrainian general staff said in a report.

Analysts have called this moment one of the most dangerous for Ukraine since Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022.

""We know this is a challenging time,"" Blinken told Zelenskyy in his first meeting of the day after arriving in Kyiv on an overnight train from Poland. But, he added that American military aid is ""going to make a real difference against the ongoing Russian aggression on the battlefield.""

The visit comes less than a month after Congress approved a long-delayed foreign assistance package that sets aside $60 billion in aid for Ukraine, much of which will go toward replenishing badly depleted artillery and air defense systems.

Moscow's renewed offensive in Kharkiv is the most significant border incursion since the early days of the war -- and comes after months when the roughly 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) front line barely budged.

More than 7,500 civilians have been evacuated from the area, according to authorities. At the same time, the Kremlin's forces are expanding their push to the northern border regions of Sumy and Chernihiv, Ukrainian officials say, and Kyiv's outgunned and outnumbered soldiers are struggling to hold them back.

Troops fought street to street on the outskirts of Vovchansk, among the largest towns in the Kharkiv area, regional Gov. Oleh Syniehubov said on national television. Two civilians were killed in Russian shelling Tuesday, he said.

The U.N. human rights office said the battles are taking a heavy toll.

""We are deeply concerned at the plight of civilians in Ukraine,"" Liz Throssell, spokeswoman for the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, said in Geneva. ""In the Kharkiv region, the situation is dire.""

Russia in recent weeks also has launched wide attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure. The operator of the national high-voltage electricity grid, Ukrenergo, said late Tuesday that it was starting ""controlled emergency shutdowns"" for industries and households because of ""a significant shortage of electricity in the system due to Russian shelling and an increase in consumption due to the cold weather.""

Zelenskyy thanked Blinken for the U.S. aid -- but added that more is necessary, including two Patriot air defense systems urgently needed to protect Kharkiv.

""The people are under attack: civilians, warriors, everybody. They're under Russian missiles,"" he said.

Artillery, air defense interceptors and long-range ballistic missiles have already been delivered, some of them already to the front lines, said a senior U.S. official traveling with the secretary who spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity ahead of Blinken's meetings.

Ahead of the trip, U.S. officials noted that since President Joe Biden signed the aid package late last month, the administration has already announced $1.4 billion in short-term military assistance and $6 billion in longer-term support.

Blinken, on his fourth trip to Kyiv since Russian troops rolled over the border, told Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal that the U.S. intends to support Kyiv beyond the war's end.

""The United States is determined, determined to help Ukraine succeed, succeed both in the battlefield victory but also succeed, as we would say, in winning the peace and building the strongest possible Ukraine,"" Blinken said.

But delays in U.S. assistance, particularly since the Israel-Hamas war began and has preoccupied top administration officials, have triggered deep concerns in Kyiv and Europe. Blinken, for example, has visited the Middle East seven times since the war in Gaza began in October. His last trip to Kyiv was in September.

Blinken went with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba for lunch at a Kyiv pizza restaurant founded by Ukrainian veterans, pronouncing it ""superb."" On Blinken's last visit, the pair ate at a recently reopened McDonald's restaurant.

Blinken's speech to students extolling Ukraine's ""strategic successes"" in the war was billed as a complement to one he gave last year in Helsinki, Finland, deriding Putin for Moscow's ""strategic failures"" in launching the war.

Since the Helsinki speech, however, Russia has intensified its attacks, most noticeably as the U.S. House of Representatives sat on the aid package for months without action, forcing a suspension in the provision of most U.S. assistance. Those attacks have increased in recent weeks as Russia has sought to take advantage of Ukrainian shortages in manpower and weapons while the new assistance is in transit.

Meanwhile, Putin plans to make a two-day state visit to China this week, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said. Beijing has backed Moscow politically in the war and has sent machine tools, electronics and other items seen as contributing to the Russian war effort, without actually exporting weaponry.

Blinken and other U.S. officials said despite some recent setbacks, Ukraine could still claim significant victories. Those include reclaiming some 50% of the territory Russian forces took in the early months of the war, boosting its economic standing and improving transportation and trade links, not least through military successes in the Black Sea.

Since the Helsinki speech, however, Russia has intensified its attacks, most noticeably as the U.S. House of Representatives sat on the aid package for months without action, forcing a suspension in the provision of most U.S. assistance. Those attacks have increased in recent weeks as Russia has sought to take advantage of Ukrainian shortages in manpower and weapons while the new assistance is in transit.

Meanwhile, Putin plans to make a two-day state visit to China this week, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said. Beijing has backed Moscow politically in the war and has sent machine tools, electronics and other items seen as contributing to the Russian war effort, without actually exporting weaponry.

Blinken and other U.S. officials said despite some recent setbacks, Ukraine could still claim significant victories. Those include reclaiming some 50% of the territory Russian forces took in the early months of the war, boosting its economic standing and improving transportation and trade links, not least through military successes in the Black Sea.

These efforts aim to complement and support the essential work performed by the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) in providing urgent care. Since the beginning of hostilities, PRCS staff and volunteers have continued to courageously provide emergency medical services to communities in Gaza, amidst unacceptably high levels of loss. Seventeen PRCS colleagues have been killed while on duty, and crucial facilities have been damaged. This includes Al-Amal and Al Quds hospitals and several Emergency Medical Service (EMS) centers, as well as emergency vehicles, with 25 ambulances knocked out of service. PRCS colleagues have been detained, with concerning reports emerging of their treatment, and the whereabouts of many still unknown.

Despite these challenges, PRCS continues to do vital work to respond to the medical needs of communities in Gaza, including by running three advanced medical posts, six medical points, and three clinics, in addition to its emergency response. The PRCS are a valued partner in the Red Cross Red Crescent Movement, and the ICRC and participating National Societies welcome the opportunity to support their essential work as they recover from the terrible losses in this conflict.

The 60-bed field hospital is meant to complement and support PRCS work as the medical and humanitarian community attempts to meet vast health needs in Gaza. The field hospital will provide, emergency surgical care; obstetric/gynecological, maternal, and newborn care; pediatric care; and outpatient department. Mass casualty management and triage capacities are included.

The ICRC field hospital, implemented in coordination with the PRCS and supported by Red Cross Societies of Australia, Austria, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Hong Kong, Iceland, Japan, Norway, and Switzerland, will be able to provide medical care for roughly 200 people a day.

Attacks on medical facilities and personnel have inflicted a devastating blow on the healthcare system. According to the World Health Organization, only 33% of Gaza's 36 hospitals and 30% of primary health care centers are functional in some capacity, and those that are still operational are overwhelmed with patients, the severity of their health needs, a shortage of supplies and resources to treat them, as well as displaced people looking for safe shelter.

Medical staff are faced with people arriving with severe injuries, increasing communicable diseases which could lead to potential outbreaks, and complication related to chronic diseases untreated that should have been treated days earlier. Amputations are common, as well as acute respiratory infection, gastrointestinal illnesses and skin diseases which are spreading rapidly through displaced communities due to a lack of clean water, sanitation, and access to food. Chronic and serious illnesses, such as diabetes, heart disease, pneumonia, infectious and non-communicable diseases, to name a few, are not receiving the attention they deserve because the priority is to treat the critically wounded.

With health needs growing by the day in Gaza, the ICRC reiterates its call for the protection of medical facilities under international humanitarian law. No patient should be killed while lying in a hospital bed. No doctors, nurses, or any medical professionals should ever die while working to save lives. Hospitals are sanctuaries to treat and preserve human life - international humanitarian law states that all parties to the conflict must respect and protect the medical mission, including infrastructure.

The field hospital is a continuation of more than 15 years of ICRC healthcare support in Gaza. ICRC teams have been providing surgical services at the European Gaza Hospital, and supporting other hospitals through medical donations where they´ve supported thousands of patients since the escalation of the conflict.

The field hospital team will be comprised of around 30 humanitarian experts from the various contributing National Societies, resident staff, and the ICRC which will include surgeons, doctors, anesthesiologists, nurses, technicians, engineers, logisticians, and administrators.

At the moment, the National Societies are contributing the following:

The Australian Red Cross is deploying staff.The Austrian Red Cross is contributing a reverse osmosis water purification system.The Canadian Red Cross is contributing surgical equipment, medical consumables, disinfection equipment and supplies, and pharmaceuticals, as well as deploying staff.The Danish Red Cross is contributing accommodations for staff sleeping quarters and a reverse osmosis water purification system, as well as deploying staff.The Finnish Red Cross is contributing X-ray equipment, water tanks, and sinks, as well as deploying staff.The German Red Cross is contributing nursing equipment, laboratory equipment, staff accommodation materials, an electricity toolkit, water tanks, and sinks, as well as deploying staff.The Hong Kong Red Cross is deploying staff.The Icelandic Red Cross is deploying staff.The Japanese Red Cross is contributing nursing physiotherapy and an operating theater/anesthesia module.The Norwegian Red Cross, which is taking a coordinating role in the project, is contributing medical equipment, a water purification system, office equipment, tents, lighting, latrine kits, kitchen kits, and pharmaceutical drugs, as well as deploying staff.The Swiss Red Cross is deploying staff.The ICRC will maintain the medical supply throughout the functioning of the field hospital.

Video and photos of the field hospital will be available on 14 May at: www.icrcnewsroom.org

From the mid-1960s through 2016, Colombia was torn by conflict between the government, leftist guerrilla movements and right-wing paramilitary groups. Now the government and rebels are working to carry out a sweeping accord that addresses many critical sectors, including environmental damages and restoration.

Notre Dame University researchers Richard Marcantonio and Josefina Echavarria Alvarez study peace and conflict issues, including their effects on the environment. They currently are advising negotiations between the Colombian government and several rebel factions over wartime damage to soil, water and other natural resources. They explain that while Colombia's transition from war to peace has been difficult, the accord offers a model for addressing the ravages of war in places such as Gaza and Ukraine.

Few agreements include environmental provisions, and even fewer see them carried out, even though research shows that many drivers of conflict can be directly or indirectly related to the environment.

We work with a research program at the University of Notre Dame called the Peace Accords Matrix, which monitors the implementation of comprehensive peace accords in 34 countries worldwide. Only 10 of the accords have natural resource management provisions agreements, and these typically have not triggered major steps to protect the environment.

Colombia's is seen as the most comprehensive peace accord that has been signed to date. It considers issues ranging from security to social justice and political participation, in great detail.

The accord acknowledges that a peaceful postwar society requires not only respect for human rights but also ""protection of the environment, respect for nature and its renewable and nonrenewable resources and biodiversity."" More than 20% of the commitments in the agreement have an environmental connection.

- Protecting environmental health through measures such as access to clean water

- Process issues, such as ensuring that communities can participate in decisions about rural programs and resource management

There also are gaps. For example, many protected areas have been deforested for ranching and coca production in the postaccord period. And there are no provisions addressing toxic pollution, an issue other agreements also neglect.

Often there are power vacuums during transitions between war and peace, when government agencies are working to reestablish their operations. Natural resources and environmental health need protection during these phases.

In Sierra Leone, for example, resource extraction by foreign companies drastically ramped up immediately after the Lome Peace Agreement eventually ended that nation's civil war in 2002. Companies exploited a lack of governance and support in the rural areas and often mined metals illegally or hazardously without any regulatory oversight. Today these areas still struggle with mining impacts, including contaminated drinking water and fish, the primary protein source in the area.

The damage is vast: There's air, water and soil contamination, deforestation and enormous quantities of waste, including ruined buildings, burned-out cars and thousands of tons of destroyed military equipment. Russia's destruction of the Kakhovka Dam flooded villages, destroyed crops and wrecked irrigation systems.

The cost estimates are staggering. A joint commission of the World Bank, the government of Ukraine and other institutions currently estimate direct damages at roughly US$152 billion.

In addition, cleaning up sites, rebuilding infrastructure and other repairs could cost more than $486 billion over the next decade, as of late 2023. That figure rises every day that the war continues.

There's broad interest in a green and sustainable reconstruction that would include steps like using sustainable building materials and powering the electricity grid with renewable energy. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been adamant that Russia must pay for the damage it has caused. It's still unclear how this would work, although some U.S. and European lawmakers support seizing frozen Russian assets held in Western banks to help cover the cost.

There is a legal basis for holding Russia accountable. In 2022, the U.N. General Assembly adopted a set of principles for protecting the environment during armed conflicts. Among other existing statutes, they draw on a protocol to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 that prohibits using ""methods or means of warfare which are intended, or may be expected, to cause widespread, long-term and severe damage to the natural environment.""

There has been only modest discussion so far of how to integrate these principles into a formal peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia. But a working group that included Ukrainian and European Union officials and former leaders from Sweden, Finland, Ireland and Brazil has recommended a framework for addressing environmental damage and holding perpetrators accountable.

Environmental damage in Gaza also is devastating. The U.N. estimated in early 2024 that over 100,000 cubic meters (26 million gallons) of untreated sewage and wastewater were flowing daily onto land or into the Mediterranean Sea.

Gaza's drinking water system was insufficient before the war and has been further weakened by military strikes. On average, Gazans now have access to about 3 liters of water per person per day - less than 1 gallon.

Thousands of buildings have been destroyed, spreading hazardous materials such as asbestos. Every bomb that's dropped disperses toxic materials that will persist in the soil unless it's remediated. Simultaneous environmental and infrastructure impacts, such as water and power shortages, are contributing to larger crises, such as the collapse of Gaza's health care system, that will have long-lasting human costs.

Integrating the environment into peace accords isn't easy. Resources such as energy, clean soil and water are vital for life, which is precisely why military forces may seek to control or destroy them. This is happening in both Ukraine and Gaza.

Peace negotiators tend to focus on social, political and economic issues, rather than environmental reparations. But leaving environmental damage unresolved until after a peace accord is signed keeps people who have been displaced and marginalized by conflict in precarious positions.

It may even cause fighting to resume. According to the U.N. Environment Program, at least 40% of all wars within states in the past 60 years have had a link to natural resources. In those cases, fighting was twice as likely to resume within five years after conflict ended.

We see some lessons for future negotiations.

First, it's important for accords to recognize environmental harm as one of war's main consequences and to acknowledge that a healthy environment is essential for sustainable livelihoods and peace.

Second, connecting environmental provisions with other issues, such as rural reform and political participation, can create better, more sustainable and equal conditions for reestablishing democracy. The Colombia accords are an example.

Third, it is important to clearly define goals, such as what infrastructure and institutions need to be rebuilt, who is in charge of getting those tasks done, and the timetable for doing it. This can help ensure that environmental restoration doesn't become a secondary goal.

Fourth, the international community has an important role to play in monitoring and verifying environmental restoration and providing financial and technical support. Foreign donors have already pledged $66 billion for rebuilding Ukraine and have said that they will require grantees to follow strict environmental standards in order to receive financing.

Reconstructing nations and simultaneously regenerating communities and ecosystems after wars is a daunting mission, but it's also an opportunity to build something better. We see Ukraine and Gaza as potential test cases for addressing war's toll on the environment and creating a more sustainable future.",europesun.com,news,europesun.com,,-0.2549019607843137,453400083,1,https://cdn.bignewsnetwork.com/NGVkOGFjMmMtZTI.jpg,eng-9571797

Fortum owns 60% of the wind farm, while Helen owns 40%. Helen will purchase around 50% of the wind farm's electricity production until the end of its life cycle.

""With 380 MW, Pjelax will double the wind power capacity operated by Fortum. Wind power plays an important role alongside the rest of our emission-free power generation. In line with our strategy, we provide clean electricity in the Nordic countries and help in electrifying industry to reduce its emissions. Pjelax is a prime example of how Fortum helps its customers reduce their carbon dioxide emissions,"" says Markus Rauramo, President and CEO of Fortum.

""The Pjelax wind farm is a significant joint effort by Helen and Fortum to increase renewable electricity production. Wind power generation creates a competitive advantage for Finland. Increasing the supply lowers customers' electricity prices and enables investments based on the consumption of clean electricity,"" says Olli Sirkka, CEO, Helen.

Suvic Oy and Närpiö-based Simons Infra Oy were responsible for the extensive infrastructure construction work and earthworks at the wind farm. The special transport of the massive wind turbines took place through the port of Kaskinen, including a total of 728 special transport operations, or 13 transport operations per wind turbine. The regional economic impacts will be reflected in municipal land rental income and property tax revenue, totalling millions of euros annually.

The construction of the Pjelax wind farm began in January 2022 and was completed on schedule in good cooperation with more than 400 landowners and several local business owners, organisations and officials. Finland's transmission system operator Fingrid and turbine supplier Nordex also made a significant contribution to ensuring that the project ran smoothly.

According to Gravitricity, its energy storage system, called GraviStore, uses heavy weights - totalling up to 12,000 tonnes - suspended in a deep shaft by cables attached to winches. When there is excess electricity, for example on a windy day, the weight is winched to the top of the shaft ready to generate power.

This weight can then be released when required - in less than a second - and the winches become generators, producing either a large burst of electricity quickly, or releasing it more slowly depending on what is needed.

""The system offers many of the best characteristics of pumped storage hydro and lithium-ion batteries - but unlike batteries, the Gravitricity system can operate for decades without any reduction in performance,"" the firm said in a media statement.

Among the company's clients are the Velenje coal mine in northeastern Slovenia, which is owned and operated by government-owned Premogovnik Velenje; First Quantum Mineral's Pyhäsalmi mine - Europe's deepest zinc and copper mine - in central Finland; the former Darkov mine in the Czech Republic, which is being decommissioned by DIAMO, the Czech state enterprise in charge of mitigating the consequences of uranium ore and coal mining; and the Geiger Group's Grube Teutschenthal mine near Halle, central Germany.

""Gravity energy storage offers a powerful green opportunity to mine operators looking to extend a mine's life beyond the extraction of materials. As well as being a genuine alternative to decommissioning, new underground energy storage schemes can provide economic and employment opportunities in communities where traditional jobs are in decline,"" Gravitricity founder and executive chairman, Martin Wright, said. ""Our work with mine operators is underlining the interest in our technology, and we are in dialogue with both mine owners and public sector organizations to turn these studies into operational plans.""

Wright pointed out that Gravitricity has already demonstrated its GraviStore technology with an above-ground 250kW demonstrator, where the company successfully raised and lowered two 25-tonne weights to generate full power and verify the system's speed of response.

The £1-million, 12-metre-high test rig proved the system can go from zero to full power in less than a second - which can be extremely valuable in the frequency response and backup power markets -, while it also has the ability to vary power output dependent on demand.",mining.com,news,MINING.COM,,0.223529411764706,453387892,5,https://www.mining.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Pyhasalmi-mine-3.jpg,

Notre Dame University researchers Richard Marcantonio and Josefina Echavarria Alvarez study peace and conflict issues, including their effects on the environment. They currently are advising negotiations between the Colombian government and several rebel factions over wartime damage to soil, water and other natural resources. They explain that while Colombia's transition from war to peace has been difficult, the accord offers a model for addressing the ravages of war in places such as Gaza and Ukraine.

Is it common for peace settlements to address environmental harm?

Few agreements include environmental provisions, and even fewer see them carried out, even though research shows that many drivers of conflict can be directly or indirectly related to the environment.

We work with a research program at the University of Notre Dame called the Peace Accords Matrix, which monitors the implementation of comprehensive peace accords in 34 countries worldwide. Only 10 of the accords have natural resource management provisions agreements, and these typically have not triggered major steps to protect the environment.

How is the Colombia accord different?

Colombia's is seen as the most comprehensive peace accord that has been signed to date. It considers issues ranging from security to social justice and political participation, in great detail.

The accord acknowledges that a peaceful postwar society requires not only respect for human rights but also ""protection of the environment, respect for nature and its renewable and nonrenewable resources and biodiversity."" More than 20% of the commitments in the agreement have an environmental connection.

They fall into four main categories:

- Adapting and responding to climate change

- Preserving natural resources and habitats

- Protecting environmental health through measures such as access to clean water

- Process issues, such as ensuring that communities can participate in decisions about rural programs and resource management

There also are gaps. For example, many protected areas have been deforested for ranching and coca production in the postaccord period. And there are no provisions addressing toxic pollution, an issue other agreements also neglect.

Often there are power vacuums during transitions between war and peace, when government agencies are working to reestablish their operations. Natural resources and environmental health need protection during these phases.

In Sierra Leone, for example, resource extraction by foreign companies drastically ramped up immediately after the Lome Peace Agreement eventually ended that nation's civil war in 2002. Companies exploited a lack of governance and support in the rural areas and often mined metals illegally or hazardously without any regulatory oversight. Today these areas still struggle with mining impacts, including contaminated drinking water and fish, the primary protein source in the area.

What is the environmental toll of war in Ukraine?

The damage is vast: There's air, water and soil contamination, deforestation and enormous quantities of waste, including ruined buildings, burned-out cars and thousands of tons of destroyed military equipment. Russia's destruction of the Kakhovka Dam flooded villages, destroyed crops and wrecked irrigation systems.

The cost estimates are staggering. A joint commission of the World Bank, the government of Ukraine and other institutions currently estimate direct damages at roughly US$152 billion.

In addition, cleaning up sites, rebuilding infrastructure and other repairs could cost more than $486 billion over the next decade, as of late 2023. That figure rises every day that the war continues.

There's broad interest in a green and sustainable reconstruction that would include steps like using sustainable building materials and powering the electricity grid with renewable energy. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been adamant that Russia must pay for the damage it has caused. It's still unclear how this would work, although some U.S. and European lawmakers support seizing frozen Russian assets held in Western banks to help cover the cost.

There is a legal basis for holding Russia accountable. In 2022, the U.N. General Assembly adopted a set of principles for protecting the environment during armed conflicts. Among other existing statutes, they draw on a protocol to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 that prohibits using ""methods or means of warfare which are intended, or may be expected, to cause widespread, long-term and severe damage to the natural environment.""

There has been only modest discussion so far of how to integrate these principles into a formal peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia. But a working group that included Ukrainian and European Union officials and former leaders from Sweden, Finland, Ireland and Brazil has recommended a framework for addressing environmental damage and holding perpetrators accountable.

What environmental impacts are known or asserted in Gaza?

Environmental damage in Gaza also is devastating. The U.N. estimated in early 2024 that over 100,000 cubic meters (26 million gallons) of untreated sewage and wastewater were flowing daily onto land or into the Mediterranean Sea.

Gaza's drinking water system was insufficient before the war and has been further weakened by military strikes. On average, Gazans now have access to about 3 liters of water per person per day - less than 1 gallon.

Thousands of buildings have been destroyed, spreading hazardous materials such as asbestos. Every bomb that's dropped disperses toxic materials that will persist in the soil unless it's remediated. Simultaneous environmental and infrastructure impacts, such as water and power shortages, are contributing to larger crises, such as the collapse of Gaza's health care system, that will have long-lasting human costs.

How can future peace accords address these impacts?

Integrating the environment into peace accords isn't easy. Resources such as energy, clean soil and water are vital for life, which is precisely why military forces may seek to control or destroy them. This is happening in both Ukraine and Gaza.

Peace negotiators tend to focus on social, political and economic issues, rather than environmental reparations. But leaving environmental damage unresolved until after a peace accord is signed keeps people who have been displaced and marginalized by conflict in precarious positions.

It may even cause fighting to resume. According to the U.N. Environment Program, at least 40% of all wars within states in the past 60 years have had a link to natural resources. In those cases, fighting was twice as likely to resume within five years after conflict ended.

We see some lessons for future negotiations.

First, it's important for accords to recognize environmental harm as one of war's main consequences and to acknowledge that a healthy environment is essential for sustainable livelihoods and peace.

Second, connecting environmental provisions with other issues, such as rural reform and political participation, can create better, more sustainable and equal conditions for reestablishing democracy. The Colombia accords are an example.

Third, it is important to clearly define goals, such as what infrastructure and institutions need to be rebuilt, who is in charge of getting those tasks done, and the timetable for doing it. This can help ensure that environmental restoration doesn't become a secondary goal.

Fourth, the international community has an important role to play in monitoring and verifying environmental restoration and providing financial and technical support. Foreign donors have already pledged $66 billion for rebuilding Ukraine and have said that they will require grantees to follow strict environmental standards in order to receive financing.

Reconstructing nations and simultaneously regenerating communities and ecosystems after wars is a daunting mission, but it's also an opportunity to build something better. We see Ukraine and Gaza as potential test cases for addressing war's toll on the environment and creating a more sustainable future.",theconversation.com,news,The Conversation,,-0.1058823529411764,453385468,1,https://images.theconversation.com/files/593249/original/file-20240509-22-oqld4m.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=30%2C0%2C6679%2C3339&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,eng-9571797

Hydrogen associations from central Europe have told pv magazine that their hydrogen import projects are proceeding at full speed. In contrast, the green hydrogen production projects in the central part of the continent are lagging behind in terms of development, primarily because of high electricity costs. Some analysts also noted issues with regulation and hydrogen demand in Europe.

Two sources, who asked to remain unnamed, said that some parts of Europe are better at dealing with production projects - namely, the Nordics and the Iberian Peninsula. As an example, they noted the results of the European Hydrogen Bank's first auction, whose winners were projects in Finland, Norway, Spain and Portugal. Scandinavia and Iberia are indeed the two European regions with the lowest electricity prices.

""Norway has been a leader of CCS technology for over 30 years. Hydrogen is a tool in our toolbox for the energy transition,"" said Hilde Gillebo, senior adviser for Norway's Ministry of Energy, adding that many Norwegian companies are active in the field, covering both blue and green hydrogen.

Henrik Andersen, Equinor's director hydrogen NWE, said that blue hydrogen is essential to scale up the market.

""We have to embrace blue hydrogen now. We will then gradually switch to green hydrogen,"" said Bjørgulf Haukelidsæter Eidesen, CO-CEO for Horisont Energi, rejecting doubts about blue hydrogen's environmental sustainability.

The uncertainties resulting from the business case of Europe are pushing technology companies, from electrolysis developers to process engineering specialists, to team up. This way, they can drive costs down, increase efficiency, and diversify risks. This approach is particularly relevant to kick off innovative projects, but also to scale up the production of existing technologies, while creating demand for products.

""Relationships are essential,"" said Lorenzo Fernández de Villavicencio, strategy manager at Linde, during a joint presentation with Keshni Srirathan, senior associate at OCI Global.

In February 2023, OCI selected Linde to supply clean hydrogen and nitrogen to OCI's new blue ammonia facility under development in Texas. The project is expected to start production in 2025.

German energy company Uniper, meanwhile, said that Europe needs to expand its storage facilities. In April 2024, Gas Infrastructure Europe (GIE) wrote that there is an ""urgent need for targeted policy intervention to fulfill European underground hydrogen storage requirements.""

These were the main messages on the first day of the ongoing hydrogen conference in Rotterdam, where hydrogen exporting countries are participating in great numbers. Canada and Australia are the two countries with the two largest stands and the most robust representation on the stages.

""Europe has a vibrant and advanced hydrogen economy, and we've seen here at the World Hydrogen Summit 2024 increasing momentum from both offtakers and developers,"" Fortescue Energy CEO Mark Hutchinson told pv magazine. ""The EU has done a lot to create goof regulation and bridge the cost gap, now what we need is for member states to translate that to country level regulations as well.""

Japan is also in the mix, with several companies speaking about how they transported hydrogen - either liquefied or through hydrogen carriers like methylcyclohexane (MCH).

In addition, several engineering and technical companies were present on the first day, mostly from Germany. There were few solar companies, but big oil and gas companies were well represented, from bp to Shell to Equinor.",pv-magazine.com,news,pv magazine International,Sergio Matalucci,0.08235294117647052,453384873,5,https://www.pv-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_2083-280x280.jpg,eng-9561767

SRV and the City of Helsinki have signed an agreement to implement a multipurpose building under a lifecycle model in Suutarila, Helsinki. The total value of the agreement for SRV, including lifecycle services, is approximately EUR 56 million.The order for the construction is recognised in the order backlog in May. The project will be carried out in a lifecycle-wise manner, with a significant focus on sustainable construction through, for example, the reuse of materials, the selection of low-carbon materials and renewable energy solutions.

This multipurpose building in Suutarila, Helsinki will have premises for 900 children. It will feature a primary school, daycare centre, youth facilities and library. The new building will replace the current multipurpose building. The project also includes the demolition of this old multipurpose building. The total area of the new building will be approximately 11,000 square metres (gross).

Project planning will start immediately and construction will commence with demolition work at the beginning of 2025. The Suutarila multipurpose building will be completed in early 2027, and the new facilities will open to students in the 2027 autumn semester.

""We are pleased to start the implementation of the new school building with the City of Helsinki by utilising a lifecycle approach. The lifecycle model enables the City of Helsinki to provide services and high-quality teaching to city residents when the construction and maintenance of the property is carried out by a single operator. Ecology, sustainability and recycling are important values that will be emphasised in the construction of the Suutarila multipurpose building. This building supports the goals of the City of Helsinki and SRV for a carbon-neutral future,"" says Jani Kuivamäki, who heads up lifecycle projects at SRV.

""The design and implementation of Suutarila's new multi-purpose building are guided by the life cycle goals set for the project, which aim for energy-efficient, life-cycle-sustainable, nature-friendly and resource-wise construction. In the project, with the solutions brought by SRV, it is possible to take into account the perspective of sustainable development, for example by reusing materials from the demolished building"", says Ari Hulkkonen, project director of the City of Helsinki.

""""SRV's solution has taken city-specific goals well into account; freely dividing the large building mass into parts with different functions adapts the building to the small-scale living milieu of the surrounding environment. The building forms pleasant and location-appropriate outdoor spaces for a kindergarten, school, library and youth facilities. The daycare yard was wanted in the most sheltered part of the plot, on the other hand, the youth facilities and the library fit well on the Suutarilantie side due to their public nature. The placement of the different functions of the building in different parts of the building creates smooth interior spaces, where optimal conditions have been created for the activities of the building's users. The interior of the building is easy to navigate, so cooperation between different user groups becomes easier. The central lobby spaces with the study stairs and dining areas connect the different wings of the building. During parties, you can also watch the performances on the stage from the lobby and stairs,"" Hulkkonen continues.

The Helsinki City Council approved the project plan for the new building that will replace the existing Suutarila multipurpose building on 28 February 2024. The technical director of the Urban Environment Division of the City of Helsinki approved the procurement plan for the Suutarila multipurpose building and selected SRV to implement the lifecycle project, that is, as the service provider, on 7 March 2024.

Sustainable and responsible solutions in the lifecycle project

The project has a strong focus on sustainable development. The selection of materials will favour low-carbon construction materials. Materials from the demolished building will be reused. For example, metal canopies will be repurposed for use in playgrounds and study spaces in the yard. Green structures supporting biodiversity will be built in the schoolyards.

The carbon footprint of the building will be 30 per cent lower than average. Property design has decided on renewable energy generation with heat pumps and solar panels. Fifty per cent of the property and lighting electricity requirements will be generated by solar energy. An air and water heat pump will produce 75 per cent of the property heating energy. A four-star emission classification from Rakennustieto will be sought for the building.

The building will be implemented as a lifecycle project, in which SRV is responsible for the design and implementation of the property, and its maintenance and servicing for 20 years after completion. SRV has implemented numerous public-sector projects with this lifecycle model. A new shared campus project has just started in Kirkkonummi, and the construction will be completed in 2027. The Helsinki Upper Secondary School of Languages was completed as a lifecycle project in Myllypuro in the summer of last year, the educational campus of Siuntio in 2022 and the Jokirinne Learning Centre in Kirkkonummi in 2020. The construction of Wintteri, a multipurpose building implemented as a lifecycle project, is currently under way in Uusikaupunki.

This multipurpose building will serve as a common meeting venue for the area

The building has been designed as a complex of blocks dimensioned for their users. Different characteristic colours and façade materials will express their intended uses and create an identity for each of their user groups. The multipurpose building will feature safe and inspiring yard areas. These different areas with their equipment will invite people to play, move, explore and hang out. As a whole, the design solution provides good opportunities for the multipurpose building to become a regional centre that people will visit for recreation, hobbies, learning and meeting each other.

The facilities have been designed together with the school staff, and further planning will also involve the staff and students.

Fortum and Helen Oy have completed a 380MW wind farm in Finland, following more than two years of construction.

The Pjelax wind farm, located in the areas of Narpio and Kristiinankaupunki, in western Finland, hosts 56 turbines.

The construction of the Pjelax wind farm began in January 2022 and was completed on schedule in good cooperation with more than 400 landowners and several local business owners, organisations and officials.

Helen will purchase around 50% of the wind farm's electricity production until the end of its life cycle.

""Pjelax is a prime example of how Fortum helps its customers reduce their carbon dioxide emissions,"" said Markus Rauramo, President and CEO of Fortum.

Olli Sirkka, CEO of Helen, added: ""The Pjelax wind farm is a significant joint effort by Helen and Fortum to increase renewable electricity production.

""Wind power generation creates a competitive advantage for Finland.

""Increasing the supply lowers customers' electricity prices and enables investments based on the consumption of clean electricity.""

Suvic Oy and Närpiö-based Simons Infra Oy were responsible for the extensive infrastructure construction work and earthworks at the wind farm.

The special transport of the massive wind turbines took place through the port of Kaskinen, including a total of 728 special transport operations.

The regional economic impacts will be reflected in municipal land rental income and property tax revenue, totalling millions of euros annually.

Finland's transmission system operator Fingrid and turbine supplier Nordex also made a significant contribution to ensuring that the project ran smoothly.

At a panel discussing the path and pace of progress towards a carbon-neutral future, speakers said the energy transition requires massive investments and that political leaders must understand it is not a partisan issue but a global one, and that everyone has to follow the same course. The two-day conference is organized by Balkan Green Energy News.

WindEurope CEO Giles Dickson noted that 19% of electricity in the European Union comes from wind farms and that investors are now confident they can generate stable income.

He commended Serbia for enabling investors to achieve stable income through contracts for difference (CfD), awarded in wind and solar auctions. The government has set pragmatic prices, Dickson said, noting it would make no sense to set prices too low for the industry to deliver, as then wind farms would not be built.

The wind industry supply chain in Europe employs 300,000 people

According to Dickson, the EU is clear on the need to ensure massive deployment of wind farms. This is the essence of the action plan adopted last October and the basis for the European Wind Charter, signed by 26 member states and more than 300 companies across the entire supply chain, he asserted.

Dickson said the wind industry supply chain in Europe is robust, consisting of 250 factories that produce wind turbines and components and employ 300,000 people, with more manufacturing facilities under construction.

The EU seeks to prevent an increase in dependence on non-European energy sources, he underscored, noting that the bloc was reliant on Russian gas and now wants to avoid replacing that dependence with another.

Strict criteria for the manufacture and use of wind turbines are important for national and data security, Dickson added.

Antoine Guimard, Akuo Energy's COO for Central Europe, said it is apparent that power grids, especially in Southeast Europe, are not yet sufficiently developed and fit for the energy transition. This, according to him, calls for massive investments that must be global and distributed among all countries.

Another challenge is to make political leaders understand that the energy transition and climate change are not a partisan issue, but a global one, in his view. On that journey, which will last until 2050, five or six different governments in each country will have to follow the same course, Guimar warned.

Political leaders must put the energy transition before other issues and internal disputes, he said and pointed out that they are the key actor who can either deliver or put a stop to that process.

Five or six consecutive governments in each country will have to follow the same course of the energy transition

Asked how to accelerate the transition, he opined there is no time to wait for a nuclear program, and that the answer lies in hybridization, as is the case in Portugal.

That would ensure stability in electricity production and make it cheaper, said the representative of Akuo Energy.

WindEurope's CEO also backed hybridization. This can be easily made possible with regulatory changes, which has already been done in Spain and Portugal, he stressed and recommended that Serbia do the same.

Akuo Energy operates in 30 countries around the world, including the Balkans. The French company is in talks with North Macedonia on a strategic partnership to build the Stipion solar power plant, of over 600 MW, and is also working on projects in Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Asked how the Western Balkans could benefit from the transition, Alcazar Energy Managing Director Daniel Calderon highlighted the examples of Turkey, Morocco, and Jordan. The three countries decided to attract investors and make it possible to create sustainable jobs, so they increased the capacity from renewable sources by many gigawatts, he explained.

This, according to Calderon, is also possible in the Western Balkans. He noted that Alcazar develops projects around the world, and that it also focuses on working with local communities, so that jobs remain there. It turns out this way of doing business is profitable, he pointed out.

In the Western Balkans, Alcazar Energy is currently developing wind farm projects with a combined capacity of almost 500 MW. The company has acquired the Bijela wind farm project in Šavnik, Montenegro, with a projected capacity of 118 MW and an estimated investment of USD 200 million.

These countries are already members of the European Union and the NATO, thus they play an important role in the politics and development of the Eastern European region, not only due to their presence on the Baltic Sea, but also because of their territorial proximity to Russia . Current projects such as Rail Baltica and Via Baltica are crucial to improve connectivity and to bring this area closer to the European Union, as well as to help them grow and continue to strengthen their economic resilience.

In a constantly evolving geopolitical scenario of Eastern Europe, the Three Seas Initiative comes as a great opportunity to stimulate projects of innovation and change that can lead to a series of benefits to the Baltic nations (Estonia, Lithuania, and Latvia). Running through the North - South axis of Europe and understanding 13 countries, the Three Seas Initiative aims to boost progress and collaboration in the three main fields of electricity, digitalization, and transport, which would lead to a general economic growth and energy independence of the region. Especially for the Baltic countries, which have historically dealt with infrastructural challenges and geopolitical complexities, the Three Seas Initiative represents a way to support their interests on an international stage and thus shape both their future and the region.

One of the key projects supported by the Three Seas Initiative is the Rail Baltica, a rail transport infrastructure with the goal to integrate the Baltic States with the European rail network. The project includes five EU countries, starting in Finland in the capital city of Helsinki, the railway will provide a continuous rail link from Tallinn (Estonia) to Warsaw (Poland), passing by Riga (Latvia), Kaunas and Vilnius (Lithuania), as well as other major cities for a total of 870 km. 213 km of the railway runs in Estonia, 265 km in Latvia and 392 km in Lithuania. Being the largest Baltic region infrastructural project of the last century, it is also one of the main priorities of the EU that recognizes the need to create the link of the North Sea Baltic Corridor as part of the Trans-European Transport Networks (TEN-T) ) ) ) ). In fact, rail networks in the Baltic States are mainly in Russian gauge, being built in the second half of the 19th century, while they were part of the Russian empire. The difficulties to interconnect the Baltics with the EU via Poland led to a major connection to the West - East axis and so to the most of freight rail traffic being imported from the CIS countries, mainly Russia. With a 10-year construction period, the objective is to conclude the project by 2030. Rail Baltica is also aimed to be environmentally friendly. That is why it will be fully electrified, with attention to the materials and technologies in order to avoid environmentally sensitive protected areas. Moreover, where needed, noise protection barriers and special animal passages will be built. The creation of this project is financed partly by the states of Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania and from the EU. Up to 85% of the total cost is indeed founded by the CEF (Connecting Europe Facility) which is a key EU funding instrument. The total estimated construction cost is around 5.8 billion Euros, and the estimated socio-economic benefits are estimated to be 16.2 billion Euros (according to a study of Ernst & Young). This is an interesting project that will have a paramount impact on the lives of many and will unlock new trails of trade, investment, development, and tourism for the Baltic countries.

Another key project in the ambition of transportation of primary importance is the Via Baltica, which starts from Warsaw in Poland and leads to Tallinn in Estonia. Covering 970 km is one of the most important transit arteries in the Eastern Europe, it is also as a matter of fact the only transport corridor in Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia for the transportation of goods in the North - South axis. At the same time, the existing road infrastructure and the traffic conditions do not guarantee a high traffic level and safety. There are neither pedestrian or bicycle roads and tunnels, nor safe parking spots, animal fences and noise. Therefore, the aim of this project is not only to modernize the road core network, but also to meet safety and environmental standards and targets. The objective is to fulfill the EU's transport policy, road safety and to implement, one day, the Vision Zero concept. Thus, it is comprehensible that Via Baltica is crucial for the economic vitality and strategic resilience of the region, generating trade flows, tourism, and interregional cooperation.

A different project, but not less, in the field of electricity important is ""The integration and synchronization of the Baltic States' electricity system with the European network"" which will guarantee security of electricity supply to the three countries and will integrate them with the European energy market. The Baltic States are connected to the IPS/UPS (Integrated Power System/United Power System), the electricity system with Belarus and Russia, under the so called BRELL agreement, since the end of the Soviet Period. Therefore, it's clear that this put Russia in a position of strength due to its control over the power grid of Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia that might be consequently victims of the use of energy supply as a coercion policy. For this reason, in the previous years the Baltics already ended the Russian gas monopoly. Now they aim to continue to follow a goal of energy independence and synchronization with continental Europe, remove third country impact, ensure security, encourage market integration and realize the vision of a fully integrated European energy market, confirmed by the current geopolitical landscape. The synchronization with European network is planned for February 2025.

To conclude, from a first vision of only some of the projects which the Three Seas Initiative promotes, it is incontestable that the participation in the initiative is positive for the Baltic states, which through appropriate investments in infrastructure and connectivity will experience economic growth. Committing in regional cooperation will benefit their geopolitical position and bring more security, growing along the Three Seas Initiative to achieve progress and resilience for Eastern Europe.

Fingrid has received inquiries regarding connections for up to 95GW of offshore wind power, and significant investments in the grid will be required to ensure sufficient connections.

According to Fingrid, additional investments of approximately EUR 0.6 billion ($0.65 billion) will be needed, over and above the EUR 4 billion ($4.3 billion) investment programme described in Fingrid's main grid development plan in 2023.

These necessary investments would be located in Central Ostrobothnia, Southwest Finland, and Uusimaa, covering approximately 1000 km of new and reinforced 400 kV power lines.

The total installed capacity of offshore wind power is expected to reach 6.5GW by the end of the 2030s, corresponding to slightly over 30 TWh of annual production.

Some 450 kilometres north of Helsinki, in the small town of Terjärv, surrounded by dense forests and located in the region of Ostrobothnia, you'll find the headquarters of Oy Mini-Maid Ab, otherwise known as Mini-Maid - a Finnish producer of paper plates and tableware that boasts a longstanding commitment to quality, sustainability and value for money, all increasingly relevant in these challenging times.

Founded by entrepreneurs Karl-Gustav Grahn and Christian Fredman in 1986, today the company is led by managing director Mikael Grahn, the former's son, and with an output of some one billion units per year, the company has evolved to be one of the biggest producers of paper plates in Europe, guaranteeing reliability, flexibility and short lead times for its network of customers across the continent.

""Traditionally, we're operating in a low-margin business, where you need to be able to produce big quantities to make a profit,"" Grahn tells ESM. ""But today, retailers have very high expectations about the raw materials used, certification, pricing, delivery time - it's a lot more complex. We have dug really deep into these matters and come up with a proposition that retailers can trust.""

Specialising in private label production, Mini-Maid is committed to efficiency and adaptability, as well as ensuring it can strike a balance between producing high-quality, sustainable products and offering competitive prices to customers. It has invested in efficient production processes, including automation and large-scale machinery, to optimise operations and reduce costs.

""Right from the start, we invested in large machines with high output that were capable of running 24 hours a day - that was ahead of its time back then,"" says Grahn. ""Today, it's not enough to be very efficient in terms of production, you also need to be flexible. Retailers may request 6-packs, 10-packs, 20-packs, 25-packs, and you need to be able to meet their demands. We have really good automation solutions here - it's been a long road to get to this point, and we know that we have to continue investing.""

Mini-Maid's commitment to sustainability extends back to the late 1990s, when the company began focusing on reducing fibre usage and incorporating eco-friendly materials into its products.

Situated close to its core source of raw materials - Finland's forests - Mini-Maid has leveraged its location to embed efficiencies into its operations and drive business growth. This proximity allows for streamlined production and shorter lead times, contributing to the company's competitiveness and building trust with customers.

""Today, 90% of Finnish forests are PEFC-certified, and the forest industry is more than 150 years old in this country,"" says Grahn, ""so it wouldn't make good business sense if we didn't take good care of our forests.""

Recent legislation such as the EU's Single-Use Plastics Directive has reinforced the company's commitment to making its products both monomaterial and lightweight. As Grahn explains, ""In the late 1990s, we made paper plates from 280-gram paperboard. Today, we are down to 190-gram board. So we have more or less taken away 30% to 40% of the fibres. Also, we now produce more units per kilowatt hour - twice as much as we did 20 years ago.""

The company refers to Finland's forests as 'Green Gold', referring to the importance of this rich, natural resource, as well as the industry's commitment to utilise every part of the tree, minimising waste and maximising resource efficiency. With this in mind, most of Mini-Maid's plates are made from so-called spillover material, such as bark and twigs, which are not suitable for other wood products but can be utilised for paperboard production. In addition, its products are home compostable, and can be recycled easily.

""You don't cut down trees to make paper plates,"" says Grahn. ""You use the parts of the tree that can't be utilised for building materials or things like that. Production of paper plates is what you would call a 'side stream' project, and is therefore more sustainable. Plus, for every tree that's used, three more are planted.""

While price has always been an important consideration in its negotiations with retailers, Mini-Maid has noted a more pronounced focus on product quality, safety, and compliance with regulations, especially regarding food safety, prompting the business to stay agile and adapt to changing market demands and regulations.

""When you consider the actual quality and specific needs of the product, the biggest question of the past two or three years has undoubtedly revolved around the single-use plastic directive. Do our products contain plastics? Are they compostable? Are they FSC-certified? There are numerous requirements dictating that products must meet certain green standards.

""Additionally, with ongoing discussions taking place regarding chemicals, what does our board contain? We're currently grappling with the discussion around PFAS, to promote the safety of our products in a food context.

""This is why, as I mentioned earlier, it's crucial for us to thoroughly understand how paperboard is manufactured, what chemicals are used and how the process works. We need to be as knowledgeable as the board producers themselves about these aspects.""

In addition, with retailers looking to simplify their supply chains, the fact that Mini-Maid products are sourced, produced and distributed across Europe - complying with European laws and regulations - sets the company apart.

""We are a proud European producer,"" says Grahn. ""We believe it's more sustainable to produce things locally and control distribution locally, than to source products from the other side of the world.""

Looking ahead, Mini-Maid is aiming to further optimise its processes and is considering investments to further reduce labour costs and increase automation.

""We are constantly seeking to build more efficiency into what we're doing,"" says Grahn. ""That includes using less material to produce more products, using less electricity, and being more efficient when it comes to transport and logistics. That's our goal, and I'm confident we are on the right path.""",esmmagazine.com,news,esmmagazine.com,,0.2549019607843137,453373813,5,https://img.resized.co/esmmagazine/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL21lZGlhLm1hZGlzb25wdWJsaWNhdGlvbnMuZXVcXFwvZXNtbWFnYXppbmUtcHJvZFxcXC91cGxvYWRzXFxcLzIwMjRcXFwvMDVcXFwvMDYxMjM4MDVcXFwvTWluaS1NYWlkLWltYWdlLmpwZ1wiLFwid2lkdGhcIjoxMjAwLFwiaGVpZ2h0XCI6NjI3LFwiZGVmYXVsdFwiOlwiaHR0cHM6XFxcL1xcXC9pbWcucmVzaXplZC5jb1xcXC9uby1pbWFnZS5wbmdcIixcIm9wdGlvbnNcIjpbXX0iLCJoYXNoIjoiMzc4NzkzN2M1Y2NhZWYxMzY5ZmM2MmJlYjgxMjZmMzFkYjE3ZmYyZiJ9/mini-maid-pioneering-paper-plates.jpg,

Now in production at the company's new state-of-the-art campus in Helsinki, Finland, the Eaton 9395X UPS occupies a footprint up to 30% smaller than similar UPS models and delivers superior energy efficiency thanks to its silicon carbide converters. In a data centre this makes it easier to reduce carbon emissions because less electricity is needed.

With a maximum power rating currently up to 1700 kVA that will be extended in the coming year, and exceptional power density, the Eaton 9395X is designed for outstanding resilience, building further on the already robust capabilities of the Power Xpert 9395P UPS. It is also an Eaton EnergyAware UPS, with grid interactive capability which means that data centre operators can reduce the total cost of ownership of the Eaton 9395X by earning revenue through energy market participation: they can sell the demand response services that help balance a high-renewable grid.

Qasem Noureddin, Commercial Director, Eaton Middle East, said: ""We designed silicon carbide (SiC) based converters into the Eaton 9395X, so that it brings to market an efficiency of 97.5% in double-conversion mode. The fact that it needs up to 30% less cooling, and up to 30% less floorspace than similar UPS models, means that this UPS leaves more room for revenue-generating IT equipment. It has top exhaust, with no rear clearance required, which means a further saving on space and lower installation costs, too.""

Easy deployment of the Eaton 9395X can be attributed to thoughtful design which includes ready-built sub-assemblies and simplified installation based on an inter-cabinet busbar design and self-configuring power modules. Large systems can be configured with one click, and with reliable self-monitoring systems inbuilt, there is less need for scheduled maintenance checks which adds up to further cost savings. HotSync patented load-sharing technology increases reliability whilst eliminating the risk of single point of failure. It guarantees the safe and reliable operation of the UPS by synchronizing parallel power modules and UPSs without the need for a communication link or synchronization signals.

The Eaton 9395X UPS is supplied with a full life-cycle analysis and eco passport to demonstrate its environmental impact through the supply chain, in manufacturing, and in use, all the way to its end-of-life which makes it easy to include in facility-level carbon emission calculations. This innovative UPS delivers the highest levels of sustainability, safety, and reliability helping Eaton's customers to achieve their sustainability targets.

European production of electric vehicle batteries would dramatically slash carbon emissions compared to manufacturing in China, but the market is set to be remain reliant on Far East imports, according to a new report.

Onshoring the EV supply chain to Europe would cut the emissions of making a battery by 37 per cent compared to a China-controlled supply chain - and as much as 60 per cent when using renewable electricity, says green think tank Transport & Environment.

However, it warns that less than half of EV battery production planned for Europe by 2030 is secure, meaning manufacturers will continue to source parts built primarily in Asia.

A new report claims that European-made EV batteries would dramatically slash carbon emissions compared to China and the Far East. Pictured: inside the VinFast battery factory in Haiphong, Vietnam

By producing Europe's demand for battery cells and components locally would save an estimated 133 metric tonnes of CO2 between 2024 and 2030.

The campaign group said this saving would be equivalent to the total annual emissions of the Czech Republic today.

However, a lack of commitment to the EV transition is said to be extending the period in which car makers are reliant of sourcing components from the Asian market.

That's because only 47 per cent of the lithium-ion battery production plants planned for Europe up to 2030 are secure.

While this is an improvement on a year ago - when it was closer to a third - the remaining 53 per cent of announced cell manufacturing capacity is still at medium or high risk of being delayed, scaled down or cancelled without stronger government action.

Julia Poliscanova, senior director for vehicles and e-mobility supply chains at T&E, said: 'Batteries, and metals that go into them, are the new oil. European leaders will need laser sharp focus and joined-up thinking to reap their climate and industrial benefits.

'Strong sustainability requirements, such as the upcoming battery carbon footprint rules, can reward local clean manufacturing. Crucially, Europe needs better instruments under the European Investment Bank and EU Battery Fund to support gigafactory investments.'

France, Germany and Hungary have made the most progress in securing gigafactory capacity.

In France, ACC started production in Pas-de-Calais last year while plants by Verkor in Dunkirk and Northvolt in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany, are going ahead thanks to generous government subsidies.

The UK is among other European nations including Finland, Norway and Spain where most production capacity at medium or high risk due to question marks over projects.

This is due to the ongoing uncertainty around the West Midlands Gigafactory, despite huge £1billion investment from Nissan and battery partner EV Envision AESC for the construction of two plants close to the Sunderland car factory.

Tata, owners of Jaguar Land Rover, last year also confirmed it will build a huge £4billion electric car battery site in Somerset with financial backing from the Government.

Many European car makers source batteries from overseas markets, notably China, as they await the completion of a number of battery 'gigafactories' on the continent. This includes the £1bn EnvisionAESC-Nissan battery plant in Sunderland (pictured) set to open in 2025

A model of the proposed new electric battery factory JLR's owner, Tata, has confirmed in Somerset. It will cost a massive £4bn and be on stream by 2026, the company says

The report went on to warn that securing other parts of the battery value chain will be even more challenging given China's dominance and the EU's 'nascent expertise'.

For instance, Europe currently only has the potential to manufacture 56 per cent of its demand for cathodes - the battery's most valuable components - by 2030, but only two plants have started commercial operations so far.

By the end of this decade, the region could also fulfil all of its processed lithium needs and secure between 8 and 27 per cent of battery minerals from recycling in Europe.

But T&E said processing and recycling plants need EU and state support to scale quickly.

Poliscanova added: 'The battery race between China, Europe and the US is intensifying.

'While some battery investments that were at risk of being lured away by US subsidies have been saved since last year, close to half of planned production is still up for grabs.'

She went on to add that the European Union's decision last year to allow the sales of combustion engine to continue after 2035 provided they use climate-neutral 'e-fuels' has added uncertainty and says it is fundamental to have clarity on petrol and diesel phase-out to 'set corporate EV targets to assure gigafactory investors that they will have a guaranteed market for their product'.

The identified areas are Ulvila, Närpiö, Vaasa, Raahe, and Raisio.

Additionally, the Inkoo area has been identified as a potential connection area if offshore wind power development becomes feasible in Finland's southern sea areas.

Several gigawatt-scale offshore wind projects are planned for Finland's sea areas.

Fingrid has received inquiries regarding connections for up to 95 gigawatts of offshore wind power.

In the autumn of 2023, Fingrid initiated a study on offshore wind power connection possibilities to its grid in the 2030s.

The study differs from Fingrid's baseline scenario with the assumption that investments in wind power will focus on the offshore at the transition from the 2020s to the 2030s due to factors such as economic viability and acceptability.

It is anticipated that Finland's electricity consumption will about double from current levels by 2035, especially driven by industrial growth. The total installed capacity of offshore wind power is expected to reach 6.5 GW by the end of the 2030s, corresponding to slightly over 30 TWh of annual production.

To implement these gigawatt-scale offshore wind power connections, additional investments of approximately EUR 0.6 billion are needed beyond the EUR 4 billion investment programme described in Fingrid's main grid development plan in 2023.

These necessary investments would be located in Central Ostrobothnia, Southwest Finland, and Uusimaa, covering approximately 1000 km of new and reinforced 400 kV power lines.

If offshore wind power development also becomes viable in Finland's southern sea areas, connecting it to the grid would reduce the need for grid reinforcements instead of causing them.",dailyfinland.fi,news,clickittefaq,,0.06666666666666665,453343515,25,https://www.dailyfinland.fi/assets/news_photos/2024/05/14/image-37696-1715646747.jpg,eng-9564665

Onshoring the EV supply chain to Europe would cut the emissions of producing a battery by 37% compared to a China-controlled supply chain, according to new analysis by Transport & Environment (T&E). This carbon saving rises to over 60% when renewable electricity is used. Producing Europe's demand for battery cells and components locally would save an estimated 133 Mt of CO2 between 2024 and 2030, equivalent to the total annual emissions of Czechia.

But less than half (47%) of the lithium-ion battery production planned for Europe up to 2030 is secure, the report also finds. This is up from one-third a year ago following a raft of measures put in place to respond to the US Inflation Reduction Act. The remaining 53% of announced cell manufacturing capacity is still at medium or high risk of being delayed, scaled down or cancelled without stronger government action.

Finland, the UK, Norway and Spain have the most production capacity at medium or high risk due to question marks over projects by the Finnish Minerals Group, West Midlands Gigafactory, Freyr and InoBat. T&E called on lawmakers to help lock in investments by doubling down on EU electric car policies, enforcing strong battery sustainability requirements that reward local manufacturing, and beefing up EU-level funding.

Staatssecretaris van Financiën (C-585/22). The case concerns the question of whether the Dutch interest deduction limitation rule foreseen by Article 10a of the Dutch Corporate Income Tax Act 1969 (CITA) constitutes a restriction of the freedom of establishment. In the view of the AG, Article 10a CITA is compatible with such freedom. This case involves a Dutch company named X BV, which acquired the shares of another company named F NV from one of its shareholders. The purchase price of the latter company was financed through a loan granted by C NV, a Belgian-based group financing entity held by Company A, the sole shareholder of X BV. As a consequence of such loan, X BV deducted the interest paid in its corporate income tax return for 2007. However, the Dutch tax inspector considered that the interest payments were not deductible on the basis of Article 10a of the CITA. X BV argued that the inspector's refusal restricted its freedom of establishment. The AG first addressed the question of which of the EU fundamental freedoms applies to the case at hand. Citing established case law of the CJ, the AG stated that national rules concerning intra-group relationships primarily affect the freedom of establishment. He then considered that such freedom applies to the Dutch provision, which only covers intra-group loans. Accordingly, he examined the Dutch law at issue solely in the light of Article 49 TFEU. The AG then examined whether Article 10a CITA does indeed entail a restriction to the freedom of establishment, answering this first question in the affirmative. Acknowledging the absence of an express legal distinction between purely domestic and cross-border situations, the AG found that Article 10a CITA may de facto disadvantage cross-border situations. To arrive to such conclusion, he particularly considered that the criteria used by such provision to allow for the deduction of interest are virtually always fulfilled when the internal bank has its seat in the Netherlands and not necessarily when such bank has its seat in another Member State. Therefore, he found that such criteria is liable to affect cross-border situations more than purely internal ones. The AG then proceeded with the question of whether the restriction on the freedom of establishment entailed by Article 10a CITA is: (i) justified by an overriding reason in the public interest, (ii) appropriate to ensuring the attainment of the legitimate objective which it pursues; and (ii) does not go beyond what is necessary in order for it to be attained. In relation to whether the restriction is justified, the AG found that the measure is indeed justified by an overriding reason in the public interest because the Dutch provision aims purely to combat abusive tax avoidance. The AG noted that the Dutch provision targets wholly artificial arrangements intended to erode the Dutch tax base. Concerning whether the restriction is appropriate, the AG replied in the affirmative, because he considered that the case meet the two cumulative criteria required in this regard (i.e., the measure must be suitable for the achievement of the objective pursued and genuinely reflect a concern to it and be implemented in a consistent and systematic manner). 1. Highlights in this edition EU Tax Alert 5 Highlights in this edition Finally, concerning whether the restriction is proportionate, the AG found that the Dutch provision does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve its legitimate objective. This is because its application is limited to 'wholly artificial arrangements' and the consequences resulting from identifying a transaction as such (i.e., the complete denial of interest deduction) are not excessive. In this regard, the AG took the view that intra-group loans, put in place without any valid commercial and/or economic justification for the sole (or main) purpose of creating a deductible debt in the seat of the borrowing company constitute 'wholly artificial arrangements', whether or not they are carried out on an arm's length basis. On such basis, the AG urged the CJ to revisit the approach it took in the judgment in Lexel (C-484/19). AG Ćapeta's Opinion on whether electric vehicle charging transactions constitute a supply of goods for VAT purposes (Digital Charging Solutions GmbH, C 60/23) On 25 March 2024, the Opinion of AG Ćapeta was published in the case Digital Charging Solutions GmbH (C 60/23). Pursuant to the AG's Opinion, the provision of a card and an authentication app with which users can charge their electric vehicles should be considered a supply of goods for VAT purposes in accordance with the commissionaire agent model. Digital Charging Solutions (DCS) is an e-mobility provider based in Germany that provides drivers of electronic vehicles (EV-drivers) in Sweden access to a network of charging points. The charging points are operated by Charge-Point Operators (CPOs). DCS provides the drivers with a charging card and a digital application for authentication to enable them to charge their vehicles at the charging points. When the card or application is used, the charging session is registered with a CPO. The CPO then invoices DCS for that charging session. Based on the invoices received from the CPOs, DCS bills the card/app users: (1) for the quantity of electricity supplied on a monthly basis, and (2) for access to the network and adjacent services. The price for the electricity supplied varies depending on the quantity charged. A fixed fee is charged for access and the service provided regardless of whether the user actually purchased electricity during the relevant period. The EV-driver always initiates the buying process. The EV-driver decides from which charging point to order the electricity and what quantity of electricity to be transferred. Further, the supply of electricity occurs in the EV-driver's vehicle. According to AG Ćapeta, except for the risk of not being paid by the EV-driver, DCS does not take any own entrepreneurial risks in that supply of electricity because the electricity is all already sold and delivered when DCS invoices the user. The Swedish tax authorities argued that DCS was liable for VAT in Sweden for the network access and for the charging sessions. DCS argued that it was only liable for VAT in Sweden in relation to the charging sessions. The AG argued that the supply of the electricity and the supply of network access are distinct and independent transactions for VAT purposes. In our view, the treatment of the supply of network access as a separate service, implies that DCS should not be liable for VAT in Sweden for the network access. One possible way to characterize the relationship between DCS and the card/app user is that of a supply of services governing the granting of credit. This qualification would follow from the Auto Lease Holland (C 185/01) line of case law and would imply that the service of DCS is not subject to VAT in Sweden. However, the AG does not support this line of reasoning. The AG opined that DCS should be considered to act as a commissionaire / undisclosed agent in the electricity supplies and, consequently, deemed to purchase the electricity from the CPO and deemed to on-sell that electricity to the EV-driver. To the extent to conditions for DCS to act as a commissionaire / as undisclosed agent are not fulfilled, the AG concluded that DCS should be considered as an actual purchaser and on-seller of the electricity (i.e., not based on the deemed supplier rules for commissionaires / undisclosed agents). The approach of the AG implies, in our view, that the supply of electricity in Sweden is a supply of goods subject to Swedish VAT. EU Tax Alert 6 Direct Taxation EU Commission launches an open public consultation on the evaluation of the DAC On 7 May 2022, the European Commission's Directorate-General for Taxation and Customs Union (DG TAXUD) launched an open public consultation in relation to the forthcoming evaluation of the Directive on Administrative Cooperation in the Field of Direct Taxation (DAC). The evaluation will focus on the functioning of the DAC in the period 2018-2022, covering only DAC1 to DAC6 (DAC7 and DAC8 are therefore excluded as they were not yet implemented in such period). The evaluation will assess the extent to which the DAC (as amended) is: (i) effective in fulfilling expectations and meeting its objectives; (ii) efficient in terms of cost-effectiveness and proportionality of actual costs to benefits; (iii) relevant to current and emerging needs; (iv) coherent both internally (coherence between different DAC amendments) and externally (coherence between DAC and EU and international legal framework); and (v) has EU added value i.e. produces results beyond what would have been achieved by Member States acting alone. In line with the ongoing Commission's efforts to rationalize and simplify reporting requirements for companies and administrations, a special focus will be given to this aspect to inform potential proposals to reduce the reporting burden for the stakeholders involved. It should be noted that an evaluation of the DAC was included in Annex II to the Commission's Work Programme for 2024 and is required by Article 27(1) of the same Directive. A first evaluation of the DAC was based on a study conducted in 2018 and published in 2019 and the forthcoming evaluation will be the second one. The feedback period to provide input on this evaluation runs from 7 May to 30 July 2024. AG Collins' Opinion on whether Swedish withholding tax on foreign pension funds restricts the free movement of capital (Keva, Landskapet Ålands pensionsfond, Kyrkans Centralfond v Skatteverket, C-39/23) On 21 March 2024, AG Collins delivered his Opinion in the case Keva, Landskapet Ålands pensionsfond, Kyrkans Centralfond v Skatteverket (C-39/23). The case concerns the question of whether the differential tax treatment between Swedish national pension funds and non-Swedish pension funds is compatible with the free movement of capital. This case involves Keva, Landskapet Ålands pensionsfonds and Kyrkans Centralfond (the Finnish pension funds), which received dividend payments from Swedish companies. Sweden has so-called general pension funds (GP), which manage capital to protect the income-based pension system so as to balance any surpluses and deficits between pension contributions and pension payments in a given year, and to contribute to the long-term performance of the Swedish pension system. These GP funds are part of the Swedish government and are, therefore, exempt from taxation in Sweden. However, Sweden levies a withholding tax of 15% on dividends received by analogous foreign pension funds in Finland. Since these foreign pension funds are exempted from tax in Finland, they cannot offset the tax withheld in against any tax liability in Sweden. As a consequence of this situation, the Finnish pension funds requested a refund of the tax withheld in Sweden. They claimed to be analogous to Swedish GP funds and, therefore, that they were also entitled to an exemption from taxation in Sweden. 2. Direct Taxation EU Tax Alert 7 Direct Taxation Finally, concerning the third question, the AG pointed out that Sweden has not put forward any elements or factors other than administrative convenience to support the claim that the different tax treatment is justified by overriding reasons in the public interest. He then noted that administrative convenience is not an overriding reason in the public interest and, thus, it cannot justify a failure to comply with Treaty obligations. Furthermore, the AG found that the differential treatment found in the case at hand can neither be justified by the need to ensure a balanced allocation of the power to tax between States. In light of the above considerations, he concluded that the justifications advanced in the case do not, in principle, appear to constitute overriding reasons of public interest. EU Parliament supports the HOT and TP proposals with amendments On 10 April 2024, the plenary of the European Parliament adopted its opinion on the legislative proposal for a Council Directive establishing a 'Head Office Tax system' for micro, small and medium-sized enterprises and amending Directive 2011/16/EU (DAC) (HOT Proposal) and for a Council Directive on transfer pricing (TP Directive). Regarding the HOT Proposal (for more information, please see the EUTA Highlight 2023), the Parliament supported the initiative, recommended various changes (see below) and suggested better clarifying its rationale. Recommendations include, inter alia, providing a clearer outlining of the benefits that HOT brings for SMEs, addressing financial and administrative hurdles, expanding the proposal's coverage to include companies operating through subsidiaries, reassessing exclusions of international shipping and SMEs covered by the tonnage tax regime, establishing cooperation between tax authorities, conducting a comprehensive information campaign for SMEs, and expediting the proposal's adoption for implementation by Member States by 31 December 2024 (so that the HOT would apply from 1 January 2025, instead of 1 January 2026). In his Opinion, AG Collins addressed the following three questions referred to the Court: (i) Does the fact that dividends paid by domestic companies to foreign public pension institutions are subject to withholding tax, whereas the corresponding dividends are not taxed if they accrue to the [source] State through its general pension funds, constitute such negative differential treatment that it entails a restriction of the free movement of capital prohibited, in principle, by Article 63 TFEU?; (ii) If Question (i) is answered in the affirmative, what are the criteria that should be taken into account when assessing whether a foreign public pension institution is in a situation which is objectively comparable to that of the [source] State and its general pension funds?; and (iii) Is the justification advanced for a potential restriction on the free movement of capital (i.e. administrative convenience of avoiding a circular flow of resources) capable of constituting overriding reasons of public interest? Regarding the first question, AG Collins considered that the fact that dividends paid by domestic companies to foreign public pension institutions are subject to withholding tax, whereas the corresponding dividends are not taxed if they accrue to the source State through its general pension funds, constitutes a negative differential treatment that it entails, in principle, a restriction of the free movement of capital. When it comes to the second question, the AG first clarified that determining whether persons are in objectively comparable circumstances does not require that the circumstances are identical. On such basis, he noted that the assertion that 'non-resident public pension funds do not aim at promoting the financial stability and durability of the Swedish social security system and that they therefore cannot be compared to the GP funds' is unduly restrictive and that such an approach would make it impossible to compare even identical pension funds across frontiers. Thus, he concludes that the criteria to be taken into account when assessing whether a foreign public pension institution is in a situation that is objectively comparable to that of the source State and its general pension funds must include their respective purposes, functions and core tasks, the regulatory frameworks in which they operate and the characteristics of their organizations. EU Tax Alert 8 Direct Taxation EU Commission publishes updated Q&A on the Foreign Subsidies Regulation On April 9 2024, the EU Commission released an updated version of its non-binding Questions and Answers document (Q&A) regarding the EU Regulation on foreign subsidies distorting the internal markets (FSR). Adopted by the Council on 28 November 2022, this Regulation gives the EU Commission powers to investigate financial contributions received in non-EU countries by groups operating in the EU internal market. The updated FAQs released in April, provide guidance on both procedural and jurisdictional issues arising from the application of the Regulation. FASTER proposal and others to be discussed in May ECOFIN meeting The Belgian Presidency of the EU Council has postponed the discussion on the Faster and Safer Relief of Excess Withholding Taxes (FASTER) proposal until the May Ecofin meeting which is scheduled on 14 May 2024. Outstanding issues, include Member States' self-assessments of their withholding tax relief systems, the carveouts in Article 10 and exemptions from Chapter III of the proposal for EU countries with small stock markets and comprehensive relief-at-source systems. In addition to FASTER, the VAT in the digital age (ViDA) package will also be discussed by Member States at the next Ecofin's May meeting with the aim of reaching an agreement on this ambitious proposal. EU Parliament Adopts new EU rules to combat money-laundering On 24 April 2024, the European Parliament adopted a package of laws strengthening the EU's toolkit to fight money-laundering and terrorist financing. The main elements of these new laws is that they will ensure that people with a legitimate interest (e.g. journalists, media professionals, civil society organizations, competent authorities, and supervisory In relation to the TP Directive, the Parliament also supported the proposal and suggested several changes. These include faster implementation by 2025 instead of 2026, alignment with international guidelines such as the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines, the use of standardized documentation across the EU to lower the compliance burden and a reference to the BEFIT proposal. Regarding next steps, the EU Parliament's opinions will be forwarded to the Council for review, after which Member States will decide on the adoption of the final Directives. Consultation on EU rules for resolving cross-border tax disputes On 12 March 2024, the European Commission launched a consultation to gather input from various stakeholders on the effectiveness of Directive (EU) 2017/1852 on tax dispute resolution mechanisms in the EU (DRM). This Directive entered into force on 1 July 2019 and provides a framework to help resolve cross-border tax disputes for businesses and citizens in relation to double taxation. Pursuant to Article 21 of the DRM, the Commission is now reviewing the Directive's early implementation and is compiling a report on its effectiveness. Via this consultation, stakeholders were invited to provide input on whether the DRM improved the double taxation relief procedures in the EU compared to pre-existing mechanisms, as well as on the application of Article 3 of the DRM (Complaint stage) and Article 4 (Mutual Agreement Procedure stage). The deadline for submission to this consultation was 10 May 2024. EU Tax Alert 9 Direct Taxation BEFIT proposal which provide Member States flexibility (e.g., entitlement to add tax base increases, tax deductions or tax incentives to their allocated parts) could come at odds with the Commission objective of reducing the compliance costs weighing on companies; (iv) highlights that, in order to actually simplify and reduce costs, BEFIT should be aligned with the OECD's Pillar Two rules; (v) recommends that any data processing related to the BEFIT framework be carried out in accordance with the GDPR principle of 'data minimization'; and (vi) underlines the importance of carefully assessing compliance costs and administrative burdens on companies interested in the BEFIT proposal. EU officials and stakeholders discuss simplifying and future-proofing EU tax system On 17 April 2024, EU officials, experts, and tax advisers met in Brussels at a conference organized by the European Tax Adviser Federation (ETAF) to discuss simplifying and futureproofing the EU tax system. The event counted with the participation of several speakers and covered various topics. The president of ETAF introduced the organization's manifesto, containing 25 recommendations for the next five years. The first panel, which counted with the participation of Benjamin Angel (Director of Direct Taxation, Tax Coordination, Economic Analysis and Evaluation at the DG TAXUD of the European Commission) among others, discussed future tax policies under the next European Commission. In turn, the second panel focused on the future of tax advisers in the EU and counted with the participation of Ana Xavier (Head of Unit Economic Analysis of Taxation, Impact Assessment and Evaluation support at the DG TAXUD of the European Commission) and Pascal Saint-Amans (Former Director of the OECD Centre for Tax Policy and Administration, Non-resident fellow at Bruegel, Partner at Brunswick) among others. The topics addressed included EU tax laws' complexity, reducing reporting requirements, tax transparency, and the impact of digitalization and AI on tax advisers. The recording of the conference is available here. bodies) will have immediate, unfiltered, direct and free access to beneficial ownership (BO) information held in national registries interconnected at EU level. In addition to current information, the registries will also include data going back at least five years. The laws also give Financial Intelligence Units (FIUs) more powers to analyse and detect money laundering and terrorist financing cases as well as to suspend suspicious transactions. In concrete terms, this AML package consists of: (i) the 6th AML Directive (which would, inter alia, grant more powers to FIUs to analyse and detect money laundering and terrorist finance cases, suspend suspicious transactions, accounts or business relationships, etc.); (ii) the EU 'Single Rulebook' Regulation (which would, among other things, harmonize rules applicable to obliged entities that are required to verify their customers' identity, monitor transactions and report any suspicious activity to FIUs); and (iii) the Anti-Money Laundering Authority (AMLA) regulation (which creates a new authority in Frankfurt, that will directly supervise the riskiest financial entities, intervene in case of supervisory failures, act as a central hub for supervisors and mediate disputes between them. AMLA will also supervise the implementation of targeted financial sanctions). The laws included in the AML package still need to be formally adopted by the Council before publication in the EU's Official Journal. EESC supports BEFIT Proposal but suggests further alignment with Pillar Two Rules On 24 April 2024, the European Economic and Social Committee (EESC) adopted its opinion on the BEFIT Proposal. The opinion, which is not binding for the Council of the European Union: (i) praises the Commission's continuous efforts to develop a common corporate tax framework to support the consolidation of the internal market; (ii) supports the Commission's decision to propose BEFIT through an EU directive, as the current variety of different national rules results in fragmentation and discrepancies, hindering cross-border activities on the internal market due to the high costs that companies incur to comply with multiple legal frameworks; (iii) notes that certain provisions of the EU Tax Alert 10 Direct Taxation and the OECD, has had several meetings over the last few months. Discussions primarily focused on the challenges raised by cross-border teleworkers and, in particular, around the creation of PEs, taxation of wages, the determination of where work takes place, etc.. While the OECD will reportedly address this topic in September 2024, the EU may, in the meantime, explore a temporary solution. Based on the task force's outcomes, the Belgian Presidency may propose solutions for optional adoption by Member States. Eurogroup identifies key priority areas and tax measures to improve functioning of EU Capital Markets On 11 March 2024, the Eurogroup, which consists of all EU finance ministers, issued a statement regarding the future of the European Capital Markets. The statement identifies key priority areas and measures to improve the functioning of the European capital markets,. Within three broad themes (i.e., Architecture, Business and Citizens), the Eurogroup considers that the following tax-related measures be imperatively and urgently taken forward during the next European legislative term: * Foster equity financing through well-designed national corporate tax systems to ensure EU companies have access to diversified sources of funding: Member States are invited to investigate ways to reduce the debt equity bias (for example, through their national tax systems) and share best practices and plans to address this bias. The Eurogroup invites the Commission to support this initiative by providing analysis and advice. * Improve conditions for institutional, retail, and cross-border investment in equity, in particular in growth/scale up venture capital through regulatory means, targeted tax incentives by Member States or other measures at EU and national level. * Create an attractive, easy-to-use and consumer-centric investment environment: Member States are invited to assess ways to make their respective personal income tax systems more supportive of investments in capital markets. Notably, the Eurogroup notes that Member States should review the tax treatment of long-term retail investment products and of capital gains and losses. EU Council supports a report proposing revaluation of the unanimity requirement for tax measures After a special meeting on 17 and 18 April 2024, the European Council welcomed and endorsed a report titled 'Much More Than A Market', which, apart from addressing ways to boost the EU Single Market, proposes to overcome the unanimity requirement for tax measures by relying on article 116 of the TFEU. In particular the report notes that 'where severe distortions require EU intervention, the Treaties provide for the safety-valve of Article 116 TFEU on the market distortions rules. Its application does not require unanimity, but only a qualified majority, which suffices to overrule any single unwilling Member State, regardless of its size. Based on a thorough economic and legal analysis already initiated by the Commission, the political viability of a targeted and timely use of this important instrument offered by the Treaties is key over the next years'. The European Council invited the current and future Council Presidencies to take work forward on the recommendations made in the report by the end of the year. It should be noted that, on 20 March 2024, the European Commission also raised the possibility of moving from unanimity to qualified majority voting on tax and other matters as part of a communication on pre-enlargement reforms and policy reviews. The Commission plans to conduct policy reviews by early 2025 and to suggest reforms, considering the concerns of Member States about strategic national interests, possibly integrating safeguards, such as allowing further deliberations or appealing to the European Council in exceptional cases. Member States discuss solutions for taxation of cross-border teleworkers According to a non-official source, the Belgian Presidency of the Council of the EU has established a task force to address the taxation of cross-border teleworkers. The task force, consisting of Member States, selected third countries, the European Commission, EU Tax Alert 11 Direct Taxation domestic situation. The Court understood that companies with a PE in another Member State are not, in principle, in a comparable situation to that of companies possessing a domestic PE, except where national tax legislation itself treats those two categories of PE in the same way for considering the losses and profits made by them. In this regard, the Court observed that France does not treat domestic branches and PEs located in Luxembourg in the same way, in so far as (pursuant to French Law and the applicable tax treaty) France could not tax profits made by the Luxembourg PE of a French company. Therefore, the Conseil d État, found that a French company with a PE in Luxembourg is not in a situation objectively comparable to that of a French company with a domestic branch. It therefore concluded that the impossibility for the French company to offset losses realized through the Luxembourg PE did not restrict the freedom of establishment. In the statement, the Eurogroup urged Member States to promptly implement the outlined measures and encourages the European Commission to initiate corresponding initiatives early in the new legislative term, aiming for completion by 2029. In addition, the Eurogroup in inclusive format commits to taking stock regularly of the performance of European capital markets and to monitoring progress on the above-listed measures at national and EU-level regularly, on the basis of input from the European Commission and starting from 2025. French Court judgment on whether EU law requires the deduction of PE's final losses On 26 April 2024, the French Supreme Administrative Court (Conseil d'Etat) delivered its judgment in the case Financière SPIE Batignolles (No. 466062) on whether EU law allows French resident companies to deduct the final losses they have realized through a PE located in another Member State from their profits taxable in France. The case involved a French company that set up a PE in Luxembourg in the context of a construction project. The French company aimed to deduct the final losses realized in Luxembourg through the PE from the profits of the French tax-consolidated group to which it belonged on the basis of CJ's judgments in the Marks and Spencer (C-446/03) and Bevola (C 650/16) cases. However, the French Conseil d'Etat fully rejected the taxpayer's claim and annulled the lower court's judgments that had ruled in favour of Financière SPIE Batignolles. In its judgment, the French Court first noted that both French domestic law and the tax treaty entered into with Luxemburg prevented French companies from deducting losses made through a PE located in the former country, whereas losses made through a French branch were deductible. The Court then emphasized that, according to the CJ's case law, such a difference in treatment does not constitute a violation of the freedom of establishment if the taxpayer's situation is not comparable to a purely EU Tax Alert 12 State Aid AG Medina's Opinion on UK's CFC Group Financing Exemption (United Kingdom v Commission and Others, Joined Cases C 555/22 P, C-C 556/22 P and C 564/22 P) On 11 April 2024, AG Medina issued her Opinion in the case United Kingdom v Commission and Others (Joined Cases C 555/22 P, C-C 556/22 P and C 564/22 P) on whether United Kingdom's Controlled Foreign Company (CFC) Group Financing Exemption (GFE) constitutes illegal State aid. In her Opinion, the AG proposed that the CJ to annul the Commission's decision that the UK's CFC GFE constituted illegal State aid and, therefore, to set aside the judgment of the General Court confirming the latter. By decision of 2 April 2019 (2019/1352), the European Commission found that the UK had granted between 2013 and 2018 illegal State aid to certain multinational groups by means of tax advantages. In particular, it considered that the UK unduly exempted those groups from a tax scheme targeting tax avoidance. According to the Commission, the UK's CFC rules were aimed at preventing UK companies from using a subsidiary, based in a low or no tax jurisdiction, to avoid taxation in the UK. They allowed the UK tax authorities to reallocate all profits artificially diverted to an offshore subsidiary back to the UK parent company, where it could be taxed accordingly. However, between 2013 and 2018, the CFC rules included an exemption for certain financing income (i.e., interest payments received from loans) of multinational groups active in the UK. The Commission considered part of this GFE as an illegal tax advantage. It ordered the UK to recover it from its beneficiaries. The UK and the company ITV challenged the Commission decision before the General Court of the European Union. By judgment of 8 June 2022 (T-363/19 and T-456/19), the General Court dismissed their actions. The United Kingdom, ITV and two companies of the London Stock Exchange Group appealed the latter judgment taking the case to the CJ. In her Opinion, AG Laila Medina proposes to the CJ to set aside the judgment of the General Court and to annul the Commission decision. The AG concluded that the General Court and the Commission erred in law when considering that the CFC rules constituted the correct reference framework for examining whether a selective advantage had been granted. Instead, the AG found that the correct reference framework ought to have been the general UK corporate tax system. Pursuant to the AG, the CFC rules form part of the general UK corporate tax system and cannot be severed from it. Therefore, she considered that the General Court erred by abstracting one set of rules (the CFC rules) from their broader legislative framework (the general corporate tax system). Indeed, she considered that the CFC rules can only be fully understood when considering the UK corporate tax system as a whole. According to the AG, in the context of determining the reference framework, the Commission and the General Court failed to carry out an objective examination of the content, structure and actual effects of the applicable rules under the national law concerned. Therefore, she considered that the error made in the determination of the reference framework necessarily vitiates the whole of the selectivity analysis. Furthermore, the AG highlights that it is, in principle, for each Member State to exercise their fiscal autonomy, and the Commission must accept the characteristics and principles explicit in those domestic provisions. In this regard, she opines that the Commission failed to demonstrate that the characterization provided by the UK is manifestly incompatible with the purpose, the constitutive elements and the structure of the CFC rules and the general corporate tax system of the UK. 3. State Aid EU Tax Alert 13 VAT AG Kokott's Opinion on fund management exemption (joint cases X, Y, Stichting BPL Pensioen, Stichting Bedrijfstakpensioensfonds voor het levensmiddelenbedrijf, Fiscale Eenheid Achmea BV, Stichting Pensioenfonds voor Fysiotherapeuten) On 14 March 2024, the Opinion of AG Kokott was published in the joint cases X (C 639/22), Y (C 641/22), Stichting Pensioenfonds voor Fysiotherapeuten (C 642/22), Stichting BPL Pensioen (C 643/22) and Stichting Bedrijfstakpensioensfonds voor het levensmiddelenbedrijf - BPFL (C 644/22). The applicants in these proceedings are Dutch pension funds that wish to apply the fund management exemption to their fund management expenses. The relevant pension schemes are based on a pension benefit agreement within the meaning of the Dutch law on pensions and provide, inter alia, for a lifelong or time limited retirement pension. The basis for assessment of the pension is the pensionable salary less an annually determined allowance. In this respect, the level of the pension entitlements and benefits depends primarily on the level of employment income and years of service. The AG established that the following conditions are relevant in order to establish if a (pension) fund qualifies as a 'special investment fund' for which the fund management exemption can be applied: (i) Raising of capital from the public; (ii) Investment on the principle of risk-spreading; (iii) Repurchase or redemption obligation; (iv) Specific State supervision; and (v) Unit-holders bear the investment risk. Based on these conditions, the AG argues that the Dutch pension funds are not comparable to 'special investment funds' as governed by the collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS) Directive on various grounds. In the first place, because the pension funds are not open to the public, but only to a limited circle of investors, namely employees in the sector, occupational group or undertaking in question. In the second place, because pension customers do not appear to have a repurchase or redemption right vis-à-vis the pension fund given the fact that participation is compulsory. In the third place, because the main emphasis of most of the models in the main proceedings would seem to be guaranteed pension commitments as a result of which the beneficiaries do not bear an investment risk comparable to 'special investment funds'. AG Kokott's Opinion on VAT exemption for gambling services (Casino de Spa SA and Chaudfontaine Loisirs SA, C 741/22 and C 73/23) On 25 March 2024, the opinion of AG Kokott was published in the cases Casino de Spa SA (C 741/22) and Chaudfontaine Loisirs SA (C 73/23). As of 1 July 2016, Belgium opted to no longer exempt online gambling from VAT (except online lotteries). Other forms of gambling (including lotteries) remain VAT exempt in Belgium. Casino de Spa SA and Chaudfontaine Loisirs consider this selective scope of the VAT exemption to be an infringement of the principle of neutrality. These applicants wish to apply the VAT exemption for gambling to their activities through directly invoking the provisions of the EU VAT Directive. 4. VAT EU Tax Alert 14 VAT AG Kokott opined that the provision of the gambling exemption in the VAT Directive do not have direct effect, as this provision is neither unconditional nor sufficiently precise. The relevant provision does not impose on Member States an obligation in unequivocal terms, as it does not clarify which forms of gambling are to be VAT exempted. Further, the gambling exemption provision is not unconditional as the wording allows Member States to lay down conditions and limitations to the exemption. The AG also considers that there is also no specific need for an extensive assumption of a direct effect of this specific gambling exemption. However, even if Article 135(1)(i) of the VAT Directive did have direct effect, Belgium's differentiation between gambling which is provided electronically and gambling which is not provided electronically would not constitute an infringement of the principle of neutrality according to the AG. The same applies in relation to the differentiation between gambling which is provided electronically and lotteries which are carried out electronically. The AG, therefore, opined that the differentiation under Belgian VAT law between online gambling and other forms of gambling and also between online lotteries and online gambling is objectively justified and therefore, not discriminatory. The rules on prohibited State aid also do not prohibit objectively justified differentiations in a general law. In proceedings relating solely to a business' own tax liability the question of State aid to a third party is inadmissible. In principle, those liable to pay a tax cannot rely on the argument that the exemption enjoyed by other businesses constitutes prohibited State aid in order to avoid payment of that tax, according to the AG. EU Tax Alert 15 Customs Duties, Excises and other Indirect Taxes CJ judgment on national legislation establishing a tax structure and tax rate for heating tobacco differing from those applicable to 'other smoking tobaccos' (f6 Cigarettenfabrik, C-336/22) On 14 March 2024, the CJ delivered its judgment in the case of f6 Cigarettenfabrik on national legislation establishing a tax structure and tax rate for heated tobacco differing from that of 'other smoking tobaccos'. f6 Cigarettenfabrik produces rolls of heated tobacco which are inserted into a batterypowered heating device. Until 31 December 2021, heated tobacco was only subject to excise duty at the same rate as pipe tobacco. In addition, from 1 January 2022, heated tobacco in Germany became subject to a supplementary tax consisting of 80% of the excise duty applicable to cigarettes minus the amount of excise duty applicable to pipe tobacco. f6 Cigarettenfabrik disputed the lawfulness of the supplementary tax. Its main argument is that the supplementary tax on heated tobacco does not constitute an authorised 'other indirect tax', because it does not satisfy the conditions laid down in Article 1(2) of Directive 2008/118. In short, this provision stipulates that Member States may levy other indirect taxes on excise goods for specific purposes, provided that those taxes comply with the Community tax rules applicable for excise duty. Subsequently, the CJ is asked to answer the question whether the national legislation in Germany on the levying of tobacco tax on heated tobacco complies with this provision. The first condition requires that other indirect taxes may only be levied for specific purposes and not merely for pursuing budgetary purposes. In the present case, the CJ concluded that the specific purpose condition is met, as the supplementary tax is intended to deter customers from giving up cigarettes in favour of heated tobacco, which is also harmful to health. As regards the second condition, the CJ considered that it is sufficient that the indirect taxes pursing specific purposes should, on those points, accord with the general scheme of the EU rules applicable either to excise duty or to VAT. In that connection, it observes that Article 14(1)(c) of Directive 2011/64 authorises the principle of a mixed excise duty which may combine an ad valorem element with a single specific element. Since the supplementary tax in Germany is simply the result of a deduction of an amount calculated on the basis of units from an amount calculated on the basis of weight, the second condition is met. Moreover, as regards any distinction as may have been introduced by the supplementary tax at issue between the goods belonging to the group of 'other smoking tobaccos', the CJ considered that the category of tobacco products identified as 'other smoking tobaccos' is a residual category containing heterogeneous and diversified products. Therefore, in such circumstances, to require that heated tobacco be subject to the same tax treatment as other smoking tobacco products, which do not share the same essential characteristics and mode of consumption, could lead to discrimination and distortion of competition. 5. Customs Duties, Excises and other Indirect Taxes EU Tax Alert 16 Customs Duties, Excises and other Indirect Taxes introducing that tax were incompatible with EU law (i.e., contrary to a clear, precise and unconditional provision of a directive that had not been transposed or had been incorrectly transposed) The CJ first dealt with question (i) above regarding the direct effect of directives. In this regard, it first noted that while, under EU law, a directive cannot, of itself, impose obligations on a private party and thus be relied on, as such, against that party before a national court, a Member State may, on the other hand, confer on the national courts the power to disapply, on the basis of its domestic law, any provision of national law which is contrary to a provision of EU law that does not have direct effect. Thus, the Court understood that - notwithstanding the absence of horizontal effect of a directive - a national court may allow a private party to rely on the unlawfulness of a tax which has been wrongly passed on to it by a supplier (in accordance with an option conferred on the latter by national legislation) if such a possibility is provided for by national legislation. The CJ noted that, in the case at issue, it is for the referring court to determine the existence of such possibility. Moreover, the Court noted that provisions of a directive that are unconditional and sufficiently precise may be relied upon by private parties, not only against a Member State and all the bodies of its administration, but also against organizations or bodies which are subject to the authority or control of the State or which possess special powers (i.e., powers beyond those which result from the normal rules applicable to relations between private parties). Here again, the Court considered that it is for the referring court to determine whether the Italian suppliers concerned fall into one of those categories. Based on the above, the CJ found that Article 288 TFEU must be interpreted as precluding the disapplication by a national court, in a dispute between private parties, of a provision of national law establishing a tax contrary to a clear, precise and unconditional provision of a directive that has not been transposed or has been incorrectly transposed, unless: (i) national law provides otherwise, or (ii) the entity against which that inconsistency of the aforementioned tax is relied upon is subject to the authority or control of the State or possesses special powers. In conclusion, the CJ ruled that the concept of 'other indirect taxes on excise goods for specific purposes' covers a supplementary tax applicable to heated tobacco, the amount of which is 80% of the excise applicable to cigarettes, minus the amount of excise duty applicable to such heated tobacco. CJ judgment on horizontal direct effect of directives and the principle of effectiveness (Gabel Industria Ressile SpA and others v A2A Energia SpA and others, Case C-316/122) On 11 April 2024, the CJ delivered its judgement in the case of Gabel Industria Ressile SpA and others v A2A Energia SpA and others (Case C-316/122) regarding the interpretation of the third paragraph of Article 288 TFEU (direct effect of EU directives) and the principle of effectiveness. The case addresses the questions of whether: (i) the third paragraph of Article 288 TFEU must be interpreted as precluding the disapplication by a national court, in a dispute between private parties, of a provision of national law establishing a tax contrary to a clear, precise and unconditional provision of a directive that has not been transposed or has been incorrectly transposed; and (ii) the principle of effectiveness precludes national legislation that does not allow a final consumer to seek direct reimbursement from the State in relation to taxes that are incompatible with EU law and were 'passed on' to the latter by their suppliers. The case concerns two Italian companies which signed contracts with two other Italian companies for the supply of electricity to their production sites. During 2010 and 2011, the recipient companies paid the amounts under those contracts including an additional tax, which was provided for in Italian national law and passed on to them by the suppliers, in accordance with an option conferred by such national legislation. This additional tax was repealed on 1 April 2012. In 2020, the recipient companies brought proceedings against the supplying companies to the referring court, seeking reimbursement of the sums paid in respect of that tax, in two civil actions, on the grounds that the national provisions EU Tax Alert 17 Customs Duties, Excises and other Indirect Taxes transparency by making written observations available on the court's website postproceedings, unless there are specific objections against this. The reform process was initiated in December 2022 at the request of the CJ and was finalized in December 2023, after negotiations among the European Parliament, the EU Council, the CJ and the Commission. The effective implementation of the adopted Regulation, requires an amendment of the Rules of Procedure of both the CJ and the General Court. It is expected that, once this has been achieved, both the Regulation and rules of procedures will be published and enter into force. Subsequently, the CJ examined question (ii) above which concerned whether the principle of effectiveness must be interpreted as precluding national legislation that does not allow final customers to seek reimbursement of an unlawful tax directly from the State. The CJ ruled that the customer must have the possibility of obtaining reimbursement of such tax either directly from that Member State of from the supplier. In particular, if such a reimbursement proved impossible or excessively difficult to obtain from the latter, the Court noted that the principle of effectiveness would require the final customer to be able to direct the application for reimbursement to the Member State directly. Accordingly, the CJ considered that legislation which does not allow a final consumer to apply directly to the Member State for reimbursement of the additional economic burden which he or she has borne as a result of the passing on of a tax which that supplier had itself unduly paid, infringes the principle of effectiveness. It therefore, concluded that such principle must be interpreted as precluding national legislation such as that analysed under the main proceeding. EU Council adopts regulation to transfer jurisdiction to General Courts on preliminary rulings on VAT, Excise Duties, Customs, Transport and GHG Emissions On 19 March 2024, the EU Council adopted a Regulation amending Protocol No 3 on the Statute of the CJ (the 'Regulation'), which transfers jurisdiction for preliminary rulings from the latter to the General Court with the aim of improving the efficiency of the administration of justice by both of these tribunals. The Regulation transfers the jurisdiction in six areas (i.e., VAT, Excise Duties, Customs, tariff classification of goods, Transports and GHG Emissions). The Court of Justice of the European Union will continue to oversee cases involving principles that require interpretation of the Treaties or the Charter of Fundamental Rights. The appeal process from the General Court will be further refined by an extended filtering mechanism, allowing only significant EU law cases to proceed to the CJ.

More than two years after the dramatic departure of music director Thomas Dausgaard in early 2022, the Seattle Symphony has yet to name his successor. And the process, at least to outside observers, has seemed opaque.

While it may seem to some like the Symphony is taking a long time to announce a new music director, according to some Symphony musicians, administrators and industry experts, it's actually not.

Hiring a music director for a major symphony is not as simple as posting a job description on LinkedIn, conducting a few interviews and making an offer. In a complex, competitive industry with a limited number of desirable candidates whose schedules are locked down years in advance, the process can be slow.

A music director's job today is about more than just making music.

""We ask a lot of our music directors, there's no question,"" said Simon Woods, president and CEO of the League of American Orchestras, and from 2011 until early 2018, president and CEO of the Seattle Symphony. In addition to that ineffable connection between maestro and musicians that generates electricity on stage, music directors must bring unique vision to artistic planning, cultivate board members and potential board members, build a relationship with their city and community, and, ideally, create a culture of respect, inclusion and excellence within the organization.

Common wisdom in the industry suggests an orchestra should begin its search for the next music director the moment it's hired its current one. Dausgaard's four-year appointment, which was announced in 2017, began in 2019. But in 2020 and 2021 the world was facing COVID lockdowns and restrictions; guest conductors were hard to come by. Dausgaard himself was hardly in Seattle during his tenure, due to travel restrictions, a problem that exacerbated tensions between Dausgaard and the Symphony board and administration, which ultimately led to Dausgaard's email resignation in January 2022, saying he felt ""not safe"" (an allegation the Symphony categorically rejected).

Krishna Thiagarajan, president and CEO of Seattle Symphony, said the Symphony's search for Dausgaard's successor began in earnest between one-and-a-half and two years ago, and today, it's ""really close [to] announcing somebody.""

Beyond that, Thiagarajan is tight-lipped, declining to even say how many names are on either the Symphony's longlist or shortlist of candidates. He said he wants to give every candidate the chance to make their music to the best of their ability, without any external pressure or prying eyes.

""I want all of the artists that come to the Seattle Symphony to be able to entirely focus on making the music in the way that they wish to share it with our audiences ... and get a chance to show who they are before any kind of prejudgment takes place,"" Thiagarajan said.

That kind of secrecy can be understandable, said a Symphony player who asked to remain anonymous as they're not authorized to speak on behalf of the organization. According to the player, any public discussion seems viewed by administration as inappropriate and unprofessional and something that could have negative ramifications for candidates who are not selected. But it's also artificial since any guest conductor working with the Symphony this season is likely under some sort of consideration.

Recent guest conductors include, for example, Kahchun Wong, who has taken the podium in Seattle many times (most recently to lead Mahler's Third Symphony last month) and is currently the chief conductor of the Japan Philharmonic Orchestra; and Dalia Stasevska, currently principal guest conductor of the BBC Symphony Orchestra and chief conductor of Sinfonia Lahti in Finland, who conducted here in both 2022 and 2023 and is slated to return in April next year.

Nor, perhaps, does the Symphony want to show its hand to fellow orchestras.

""There are always multiple orchestras doing music director searches at the same time,"" said Woods. ""And yes, of course, there's some competition for the most interesting names out there.""

Los Angeles is currently on the hunt to replace Gustavo Dudamel, the charismatic maestro who will become New York Philharmonic's music and artistic director in 2026. Cleveland is also looking, as is San Francisco, where Esa-Pekka Salonen announced in March that he will leave when his contract expires in 2025.

In an industry still recovering from COVID-era setbacks, generating excitement matters, as when Christian Mӑcelaru was just announced, with much pomp and circumstance, as Cincinnati Symphony's incoming music director (after a search that, Thiagarajan pointed out, took three years). The Chicago Symphony just made a splashy announcement about incoming music director Klaus Mäkelä, though he won't even begin his official tenure until 2027.

In Seattle, Thiagarajan said, they're looking for candidates who not only have an inspiring vision for the Symphony and excellent chemistry with the orchestra and the audience, but also a rapport with the diverse humanity of Seattle itself. ""There's a desire that this person really becomes a fabric of the greater King County and Seattle area,"" Thiagarajan said. ""We're seeking the person that really wants to be here.""

Said Woods, ""I think of [a music director] as a sort of civic community leadership role in this country ... and like it or not, American orchestras rely heavily on ticket sales, and having somebody who is going to take part in building a relationship with the audience is absolutely vital. It's difficult to balance all the things we ask of them alongside the fundamental point, which is the magic and the chemistry of the music making.""

Here's how that complicated decision is being made: An orchestra search committee, composed of board members, staff and players, considers a longlist of candidates they'd like to see for music director. Those candidates are then scheduled to conduct with the Symphony (which, Thiagarajan said, can take between 18 and 24 months to book).

Out of those candidates, the search committee creates a shortlist. Then, in order for those shortlisted candidates to move forward, Seattle Symphony musicians must hold a vote at which 80% of the players are present. Those candidates who receive at least 60% of the vote move on. From those candidates approved by the players, a final hiring vote will be made by the search committee, with each member getting one vote. Then the board formally hires the new music director.

In the meantime, another player said they're perfectly happy working without a music director for the time being, and sees little impact on the orchestra's cohesion -- artistic leaders only conduct part of a symphony's season anyway, they said, so it's not like things fall apart in their absence.

And it's hard to say whether the lack of a music director hurt the Seattle Symphony by any quantifiable metric, since Dausgaard quit while COVID was still impacting many arts organizations, so any changes in finances or subscriber numbers couldn't be attributed to one factor alone. But today, the Symphony said, its sales numbers are good: For the current fiscal year, ticket sales are up 37% from the previous year, and revenue from ticket sales is up 54%.

Whenever the hiring decision is made, a new artistic vision, guiding the Symphony into its next chapter, is going to be exciting.

""I'll just say this,"" Thiagarajan said. ""It's really important to me that we get to finish doing this job calmly and quietly, because we're really close ... and people are going to have a great time with this for many years to come. If that's the only thing I can help make happen here, then that's good enough.""",yakimaherald.com,news,Yakima Herald-Republic,,0.2078431372549019,453320444,1,https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/yakimaherald.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/e/7a/e7ac8fb0-8b06-50cb-9805-0671d6531757/6642533a9fce4.image.jpg?crop=1761%2C925%2C0%2C125&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize,

Grenoble- McPhy Energy, specialized in low-carbon hydrogen production and distribution equipment (electrolyzers and refueling stations), today announces that it has been selected by the VALOREM Group, a pioneer in green energy in France, and its construction subsidiary VALREA, to support them in the implementation of the ""Rouen Vallée Hydrogène"" (RVH) project. McPhy will provide a

1 MW electrolyzer and a 350 bar McFilling station to power public transport vehicles in the Greater Rouen area and provide renewable hydrogen to local industrial sites.

Supported by the VALOREM Group and Métropole Rouen Normandie, RVH was initiated in 2021 as part of ADEME's ""Territorial Hydrogen Ecosystems"" (""Ecosystèmes territoriaux hydrogène"", in French) call for projects. It aims at contributing significantly to the implementation of the Rouen metropolitan area's energy roadmap by developing complementary infrastructures.

The project involves setting up a local ecosystem to produce and distribute renewable hydrogen. It includes the installation of an electrolyzer, supplied by McPhy, entirely powered by green electricity produced by VALOREM. The hydrogen produced by the McLyzer electrolyzer will be used to supply a refueling station for a fleet of 14 buses purchased by the local authority, using 350-bar high-flow refueling points. Any excess hydrogen produced on site will be loaded into tube trailers and transferred to meet local industrial sites' needs for renewable hydrogen (""Hydrogen Hub"" function). All of the equipment is expected to be commissioned in January 2026.

With the creation of this ecosystem, RVH is the 5 ""Hydrogen Hub"" initiative for which McPhy gets involved, following HyPORT (Toulouse), ZEV (Clermont-Ferrand), R-HYNOCA (Strasbourg) and HNFC (Belfort).

In the framework of this project, a second contract for maintenance and technical support has been signed for an 8-year term. The service, provided entirely by McPhy, will be executed in collaboration with TSG Group, McPhy's preferred partner for the maintenance of its equipment.

Furthermore, the supply and maintenance of the 350 bar station will be subcontracted to Atawey, as part of McPhy's proposed sale of its stations business.

Philippe Etur, Deputy Managing Director of VALOREM Group, stated: ""We are delighted with this collaboration with McPhy. This is a significant step in the development of the renewable hydrogen ecosystem, in which the VALOREM Group has control over the entire value chain, including building the infrastructure carried out by our construction subsidiary VALREA. By scaling its projects in line with the territories' objectives, VALOREM is promoting joint development with local authorities and industrial firms in order to support ecological transition locally.

Jean-Baptiste Lucas, Chief Executive Officer of McPhy, states: ""We are proud that Groupe VALOREM has selected us to execute the RVHproject. We are convinced that hydrogen is key to the energy transition in urban areas. RVH is the 5 ""hub"" for which McPhy is bringing its know-how.""

Finland's transmission system operator Fingrid has identified five areas along the west coast where large offshore wind parks could be connected to the mainland's grid by the 2030s.

These connections would require significant investments in the grid, said the TSO.

The identified preliminary areas are Ulvila, Närpiö, Vaasa, Raahe, and Raisio.

The Inkoo area has also been identified as a potential connection area if offshore wind power development becomes feasible in Finland's southern sea areas.

Fingrid is seeking feedback from stakeholders on this study and their perspectives on defining more precise connection points until 23 June.

Several gigawatt-scale offshore wind projects are planned for Finland's sea areas. The TSO has received inquiries regarding connections for up to 95GW of offshore wind power.

In the autumn of 2023, Fingrid initiated a study on offshore wind power connection possibilities to its grid in the 2030s.

The study differs from Fingrid's baseline scenario with the assumption investments in wind will focus on the offshore at the transition from the 2020s to the 2030s due to factors such as economic viability and acceptability.

It is anticipated Finland's electricity consumption will approximately double from current levels by 2035, especially driven by industrial growth. The total installed capacity of offshore wind power is expected to reach 6.5GW by the end of the 2030s, corresponding to slightly over 30TWh of annual production.

To implement these gigawatt-scale offshore connections, additional investments of approximately €0.6bn are needed beyond the €4bn investment programme described in Fingrid's main grid development plan in 2023.

These necessary investments would be located in Central Ostrobothnia, Southwest Finland, and Uusimaa, covering approximately 1000km of new and reinforced 400kV power lines.

If offshore wind power development also becomes viable in Finland's southern sea areas, connecting it to the grid would reduce the need for grid reinforcements instead of causing them, said the TSO.

Feedback on the study will be received through a consultation until 23 June.

More precise connection points will be defined based on stakeholder feedback and Fingrid's internal detailed studies in the autumn of 2024.

Connection points will be reserved for individual customer projects as their development progresses. The TSO will be holding a stakeholder event on 22 May to discuss offshore wind power network connections.",renews.biz,news,Renews,,0.05882352941176472,453305558,21,https://renews.biz/media/15472/2generic-offshore-3-credit-renews.jpg?width=640,eng-9561258

Romantsova","What is the state of human rights regarding the aggression by Russia against Ukraine in early 2024?

*Further original, internal sources are at the bottom of the article.*

*Interview conducted April 16, 2024.*

Ms. Oleksandra Romantsova is the Executive Director (2018-present) of the Center for Civil Liberties in Ukraine, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2022 under her and others' leadership in documenting war crimes. This will be a live series on human rights from a leading expert in an active context from Kyiv, Ukraine. Here, we talk about updates from February 5 to April 16.

Scott Douglas Jacobsen: Okay, so today, we are here for our fourth interview with Oleksandra Romantsova of the Center for Civil Liberties in Kyiv, Ukraine. We have been covering the human rights aspects or facets of the Russo-Ukrainian war based on Russian aggression into Ukraine starting, in terms of a full-scale invasion, on February 24, 2022. I am based out of nearby Montreal, Quebec, Canada, so the time zones are more helpful this time than from Vancouver. Our last interview was February 5. So, we will start with the reportage from that time and continue forward from there. I will begin with a general sense. What have been some of the changes in tactics and some of the newer human rights trends you have noticed in the Spring of 2024 so far?

Oleksandra Romantsova: First of all, that was the opening of the second warrant of the chief of the army of the Russian Federation about shelling the civilian system. One of them made some little breaks, which was interesting. When you have this break, nobody attacks you via rockets. You are thinking about when they start to do that. It started months before. Now, it is the middle of April. That was the middle of March. They started shelling every day, during the day. It can be 50 rockets, some drones, or something like that. If something happened in Kyiv, then this means something happened in Dnipro, Zapirozhzhia, Mykolaiv, and other places. So, the main change is that they attack concrete electricity systems. They stopped doing that. We waited in the Winter because it is usually more painful without electricity, but they started in the Spring. Before that, Ukraine was a big country that produced much electricity. We sell it. We have many rivers with the stations. They try to destroy bigger stations. Which is called Dnipro station [Ed. Dinpro hydroelectric dam], these systems are regularly attacked now.], It was built during the Soviet Union. Before, there was an explosion by Hitler's army. So, for image, it is a wrong decision for the Russian military to try and destroy it. They supply a few rockets to them. However, it still works now. They have some images, but not crucial. They are trying to stop Ukraine, try not to allow us to have businesses, economics - any processes. Things people can need or want: leave Ukraine, etc. I do not know the main idea behind this targeting. People will speak about fighting. The more problems we have, the less support we have from the US, and the fewer shells we have. If they figure out the channels and what they are trying to do, they will put much effort into propaganda in the United States. They want to show it is not an important question - Ukraine - and Israel is more important. The US is totally in the process of election now. They are not so quick to make this decision. This means we are prepared to fight but do not have enough arms. That is a big problem. It is a big problem for us because it means that every day, people die there on the frontline. People are dying here because we do not have enough shells. We do not have enough shells to destroy their rockets, which they send to our cities. We know that. We have the skills, but we do not have the tools to implement what we know. It is the situation. This means that things have changed a lot inside Ukraine. It is primarily a reaction to that.

Jacobsen: What about the European Union providing finance, shells, and fighter jets?

Romantsova: The European Union decided to support us, meaning they will start producing more shells and can help us after a year. We must survive this year without enough shells, so that is the problem.

Jacobsen: With regards to the gridlock happening in a lot of American political cycles, is it more or less accurate when Zelensky states that if the United States does not support Ukraine with more resources, the Russian Federation is likely to take much Ukrainian territory if not win the war against Ukraine? [Ed. The new bill was passed on April 20, 2024, to support Israel, Taiwan, and Ukraine. Likewise, The Associated Press reported on ways military aid can be expedited. The expectation is a giant spring of aggression by the Russian Federation forces. NATO and others look to air defences for Ukraine. Kremlin claims America is repeating Vietnam-like humiliation, and more deaths will follow the aid package.]

Romantsova: Good question. The biggest problem is that people forget about the situation. The situation can get worse, not better. It is not a good position for politicians. People think of the Ukrainian war as a usual thing. Some politicians state this as a typical war, a usual thing. They say, ""Ukrainians will fight. It will be long. So, Ukrainians can do that alone."" However, we cannot... we can be finished. All of us who stay here will fight. All who do not will not prepare to continue to fight. They will start just going to other countries. It creates a crisis. Even certain millions of people are not easy for Europe; this makes them less and less comfortable. Is it possible Ukraine will fall? Yes, it is possible. It means all of us will be dead. It is impossible to have a miracle. Something is blowing up in the political system of the Russian Federation. If it happens, all of us will be surprised. It is not exactly what you can plan. You can say, ""Everyone, we planned that. We account for that or something like that."" No, we have one chance. It will be fought until the Russian Federation breaks down at the economic or political level, but it will not take one month. It takes years. That is why, for us, it is essential to remember the USA. It is not a question that some Ukrainians ask more than others. It is a question: If Ukraine will lose, it will be a problem for all of Europe. Some countries like Hungary or Slovenia have started collaborating with Russia. It is not so big, the castle. It can be the point of turn that can be a game changer. Although this situation is game-changing, it can be like this now. That is why we speak with Americans; even Europe will start to support us with the same money. However, you cannot shoot with cash. It would help if you hit with guns. So, we need guns. Most of the guns that we need are in America. As you know, the Canadian army cannot help.

Jacobsen: No, they have been in a tough spot now. They have also been shrinking for a while, even within an infusion of over $70 billion over several years [Ed. Two decades.]. The Canadian army is in a tough spot ethically and politically. Even though Canadian citizens who are not serving members will give contradictory or seemingly conflicting responses in surveys, on the one hand, Canadians will want Canadian forces to be more active in international affairs. Still, most do not want to serve in the first place. Fundamentally, they want to help other nations with their problems, but they do not want to be the ones troubled with helping those problems. There are violations of the rights of men and women in service. Internationally, in terms of NATO commitments, because we were well below even the minimum standard of relative GDP contribution (2%) to the Canadian Armed Forces, we may send 1,500 service members to Latvia; however, in general, we are pretty limited in our contributions internationally, except, maybe, in training, where we might train Ukrainian captains in French. Also, we have ancient equipment across the board, from rifles to submarines. So, on the Canadian side, I would not expect significant contributions from the Canadian Armed Forces for some time.

Romantsova: Canada has provided good financial support. However, that is the problem. You cannot eat money. You cannot shoot money. You need money transformed into something. Most of the support for our budget is limited only to social needs. So, that means that is why Russia attacks concrete suppliers, power plants, etc. Because we need 40% of our budget, which is produced by our economy, in steel, only this 40% can be used for arms, guns, and supporting the army. All other support from outside of Ukraine has conditions. We can use it only for salaries and pensions. Stuff like this. That is why it is so important to get support from the USA; support from the USA was for arms. That is the difference.

Jacobsen: One political commentator in the United States commented on the effect of weakening an enemy or rival nation with violent intent while also supporting a country in need and a more robust and muscular ally, which is a win-win situation. Also, the creation of those arms strengthens the American economy. It would be a positive in general for the American State. Now, about the human rights conditions of citizens, the newer actions or the stronger push has been toward the targeting of critical infrastructure in Ukraine by Russian Federation forces. People probably will not see this video, but the lights are off in your place. They are not off in mine. Even in Kyiv, they are targeting electrical grids and stations. How is this change to try to terrorize the public even more, impacting the trends of fighting and then the morale of the public at large?

Romantsova: It is a good question. During this time, we have one month of changes to legislation for recruitment and mobilization to the army. Many people do not like these changes. A lot of these people do not like these changes. What other decision can be made? No, you are not like this. What do you propose as a way to do this? So, but still, as for me, it is understandable. All of us, my team, and I, have the opportunity to work only because people from frontlines support us. They help us because they defend us. We are here because it is not our turn to go to the frontline. Maybe it happened. Perhaps it happened that even such a person who does not have any war specialization or something needs to go to the frontline. It is possible. As for me, it is still a big question. How does the army need to be organized? What kind of solution? What kind of weapons? What type of ammunition do people need? Because we will always have fewer people than Russia because Russia is four times bigger by population and four times less attractive to save someone. So, they do not care. They may care about some generals or professionals but do not care about soldiers. So, they can send thousands of them to kill a few Ukrainians because for them... we see this the last ten years. They do not care even about their population. It is a big problem. We call this an asymmetric answer. So, if they have many soldiers, we must have a lot of technology, such as drones. A lot of this is not about human rights. It is tough to speak about human rights when you have such a situation with war and your situation of security. So, from our side, we have not changed from the other side.

People still give their donations and lots of donations. Ukrainians collect the money and send it to volunteers for the technology, which they believe supports our citizens on the front lines. Drones, for example, or 'a system of audio fighting,' may be translated like this. It protects soldiers from drones from the Russian side. It still happens through NGOs. Minister of Defense they have their process. However, they are still working through NGOs, just through NGOs.

Jacobsen: How is the public morale in Ukraine now? Does it vary by city, or is there a general high or a general low?

Romantsova: All of us are tired and depressed. However, it does not change the situation. Yes, we are pretty not the politest and kindest people now. When people speak about an attack in Moscow, we are not celebrating, but we are not waiting or something. Israel was attacked. I have friends in Israel. However, sorry, all of this rocket and shell was destroyed before. However, nobody does that for Ukraine, and it is every day. Missiles killed people. The USA still discusses whether they need to support Ukraine or not. It is terrible competition. It can lead to more suffering from some war or not. However, it is still emotionally hurtful when people say, ""Ukraine is one country to get attacked every day."" It is injustice.

Jacobsen: Is the general idea that the Russian Federation is planning a more protracted war, given that it contributes one-third of its expenditures to the military?

Romantsova: Nobody knows what kind of plan Russia has. I think they need some victory. However, tomorrow, Putin can say to his population. ""We have a victory,"" and then stop the war. He can imagine. He can make his propaganda make any picture. We try to guess. They send more and more signals, not directly to Kyiv, but to different international parties. They want to have a negotiation. Now, they are on the negotiation side. We would be strong enough. If they stop this line and lead by their control of more than 21% of our territory and more than 6,000,000 people for them, it will look good enough for them. For us, it is destroying any opportunity to bring back these people. We do not know how many lives are changed because Russians kill every day. It is the same thing. We do not see what happens with kidnappings. First of all, it is not a question. I do not have an answer. I have the purpose to fight. I do not know what the end will be -- peace for us. If we exist, it means they bring back all of our people and are protected from Russia. It is important. Ukrainians do not like fighting. Ukrainians fight because we have no other choice but to defend ourselves. We will stop the fight if someone proposes another way to define ourselves. I think it is okay for us to look to other situations. People need to be released. It is important.

Jacobsen: In late February, President Zelensky went to Saudi Arabia to push for peace in a push for POWs in Russia. How was the POW (prisoner of war) situation with Ukraine and Russia? Has anything gone forward about exchanges?

Romantsova: They (POWs) are still there. They have one or two exchanges. That is all. It begs the question about civilians. We do not have only prisoners like combatants who are going to become prisoners of war. Also, all the prisoners of war, when they return to us, are in bad condition. They torture them. It is a good question. The status of prisoners of war is a status in international humanitarian law, which needs to protect you if you recognize the other side, e.g., prisoners of war. They need to care about you, give you food and normal conditions, not extremely hot or cold. You need to get medicine support if you need it. It would help if you had the opportunity to make contact with your family. Russia does not do anything of that, mainly through an International Committee of the Red Cross. So, you can be judged through the court because you take the duty in the army. Russia breaks even this. So, they put them in jail, some prisoners. It is like a big argument from Russia's side when trading inside negotiations. That is why they take people. They only need the people to press Ukraine down for the arguments as to why their proposition needs to be taken. Until now, many NGOs here, every day, including prisoners of war and civilian prisoners, have different communication campaigns around the world about that. Still, it is a point number for politicians in policy. It is still painful here.

Jacobsen: What about the elections in the Russian Federation with these murders, etc.?

Romantsova: It is like the election of President Putin, which wins President Putin. It is not an election. For 20 years, the Russian Federation has not had any elections. It is like Belarus. Nobody believes it is an election. Navalny is trying to push it in some way to use the mechanisms. They are trying to use different tools to create some intrigue there. However, no, it is always the election of President Putin. Now, it is illegally recognized. They include in this election occupied territory, and they make this illegal process poison. The election will be the same with Lukashenko (Belarus). Lukashenko was not recognized for the last election. Putin, as I understood, the European Union has this position. I do not hear about the consensus of West's voices that now he is illegal. However, he still leads the Russian Federation.

Jacobsen: What about the UN nuclear watchdog director going to Moscow to discuss nuclear safety in Ukraine? Was there any result from that?

Romantsova: Nuclear safety in Ukraine is one of the most significant results, not because they released the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. They think it has much more of a role than India, China, and somebody from the West to stop something terrible from happening. Macron changed his position in this way. He started answering, ""Okay, you are not alone with nuclear weapons."" It is a significant change. It is not because of Ukraine. It is because Wagner made a problem for the French army. You feel that you live on a small, connected Earth. That is the source of my optimism. We are still determining what we will indeed get from the Russian Federation. If China changes some positions, Russia will finally need to take back their army.

Jacobsen: Since joining NATO and ending its post-WWII neutrality, has Sweden made any moves to help in the Ukrainian efforts?

Romantsova: Most neutrality is an official status of some states like Switzerland, Austria, Finland, and Turkmenistan. It is funny that Turkmenistan has an official neutral status. You must have special voting, call signs, and unique documents at the UN. Switzerland is trying to take it back. Russia said they are an unfriendly country now since membership of NATO. Unless they lose it. In Europe, Austria stays in this status. Now, it is a big, big question. Maybe countries from Asia, Africa, etc., can take a spot. We are not counting this country. So, we are still looking to the West - America, Canada, maybe Germany, but we are not looking to other countries like Brazil, Argentina, or South Africa. These countries are in Africa. We are waiting, growing up, and starting a dialogue with all of these countries. They will not consistently be grown. A lot of them began to shoot during the negotiation. If African countries exist without any government but have an army and, sometimes, more arms than the Czech Republic or Poland, it is a huge question about the biggest problem that we still have. This terroristic act on the city hall near Moscow. It is part of this. They show this exactly when the Russian Federation is trying to concentrate its power and systems in Ukraine. They are open and vulnerable to other problems. Islamistic conflict between Russia and some groups, e.g., Russia supports the Taliban and ISIS. They are trying to kill them in Syria. All this continues. None of this stops because of the Ukrainian situation. I am trying to look at this round from the Ukrainian side. From the Ukrainian side, we need anything to fight and to survive. When we speak about the bigger picture, all of us need to not only look at Europe; we need to look around. It is not only Europe or a Western crisis. It is a crisis of the whole world.

Jacobsen: What about these human rights violations with regards to joining the Russian army, e.g., Indians being duped - Indian nationals, citizens - into joining the Russian Federation army and then fighting for them? They leave with an injury or something. Now, Indian authorities, at least since early March, are in early talks with Russian officers to deal with these kinds of human rights abuses of Indian nationals tricked into fighting for the Russian army based on false promises.

Romantsova: Look, Xenophobia in the Russian Federation is enormous. I do not think someone from another nation can come to the Russian army and will be enough in contact to be part of the rest. It is not possible. First, most Russians do not know other languages except Russian and rude Russian.

Jacobsen: Rude Russian?

Romantsova: It is from Fifth Element. It is trendy here. That was a phrase from the hero, Bruce Willis. 'I know only two languages. Rude words and English.' [Ed. ""Whoa, lady, I only speak two languages, English and bad English.""] Every time, they mention some nationality, such as Makhachkala. Makhachkala, they come to the airport and go to the airfield and try to take back from the plane; families, Jewish families, who were from Israel or something like this, or some other place, because it is a Muslim region.

The same situation now, when Crocus City Hall was attacked, these were guys from Turkmenistan. It is a part of the old Soviet Union, a separate country with a broad autocratic regime. Now, these people come to Russia to have a primitive... Whenever Russians have an opportunity to show their xenophobia, they do that. I cannot imagine people with dark skin, with absolutely no English, not the same English where they expect to hear from people. That is not the precise pronunciation that will be respected in the Russian Federation. I cannot even imagine. So, they will be killed, not by Russians, but sent without ammunition or something. They send, send, send people without any support. So, I do not know.

Jacobsen: On March 9, Pope Francis stated that Ukraine and its allies should, more or less, wave the white flag. Given the size of the Catholic Church worldwide, this comes from a prominent world religious leader. How was that met last month, the comment from the Pope?

Romantsova: The Pope said something. Ukrainians and their population are usually used to that.

Jacobsen: It was criticized and met on deaf ears.

Romantsova: In Ukraine, we have 72 different kinds of churches, including Jewish, old Oriental forms of Christianity like the Copts or Armenian Christian Church, Muslim, Russian, and Buddhist temples. It includes different kinds of Christianity: Baptist churches and old Russian churches. So, Greek and Catholic, it is an organized community. It is focused mainly on the western part of Ukraine. They connect it with the Pope. They first hear what the Pope will say because Ukrainians believe in the Pope of their church. All other people think, ""One more politician who says something. What can you expect?"" Most people do not make much distinction between the Pope and the president. They know it is in Italy and a separate country, blah-blah-blah. It exists, and people who work for that. My organization's head needs to meet with the Pope in the following months. The Pope, traditionally, is a figure who can make negotiations. We will be continuing to speak with them because he is still essential. He can say something.

Jacobsen: Not too long ago, Ukrainian forces lost the city of Avdiivka after several months of very, very intense fighting. What has been the social and political impact within the context of the war?

Romantsova: It is so interesting. You say a few months. A few actions cover it. Now, you cannot get the views. All of the social impacts of what happened. First of all, many soldiers commented about Avdiivka. They take it back earlier than in Bakhmut, but it takes two weeks or something like that. That is the effect on the population and its attention now. Two weeks after that, we had another problem. I am sure the family who lost someone there or soldiers who were angry for their combat that way. They organized getting out of there and taking them out of there. For them, that was different news. For the rest of the population, ""We had a terrible day on the frontline. What can we do to have a good day on the frontline?""

Jacobsen: What were the remaining presidential comments about Estonia becoming the next NATO alliance leader? Does this have worse or better political implications vis-a-vis NATO for Ukrainian support?

Romantsova: It is essential. Does the commentator take us there or not? We have some rules. They do not include new countries with a planned conflict or something like that. Every time we hear about someone, we will feel only one comment. If it is expected, will it be possible for them to take Ukraine tomorrow or not? If a specialist discusses how this person can be helpful or not for Ukraine membership, that's all.

Jacobsen: How extensively are prisoners of war being tortured by Russian forces? There are reports of Ukrainian prisoners of war being tortured in Russia. Is there an extent of how far this is going, or is it just general knowledge that there is torture being done to Ukrainian prisoners of war?

Romantsova: It has happened to all prisoners over the last ten years. When we take people back from there, they give testimonies about it. That is not just a torture. The whole scope of imagined horrors, Hollywood horrors, over the last 40 years, they use it, including sexual and gender-based violence. It is a huge, huge, massive variety of tortures. We have testimonies of people who went through that by themselves.

Jacobsen: It is reported that one-third of Russian warships in the Black Sea have been destroyed or disabled. Is this a significant win for the Ukrainian side of the war, or are more substantial wins or points of import for the Ukrainian military and Ukrainians in general more to do with air superiority and artillery now? In other words, are the Navy's victories not the sort of victories they need?

Romantsova: I cannot specifically comment on the military. Yes, I have friends. Some of my friends are on the frontline. They are mainly at the ordinary level of the army. So, I need insights or a deep understanding of it. People suffered. All of the relatives suffered. People were killed on the frontline. They are fighting. We are still not Russia. They have had enough success. That is all that I know.

Jacobsen: What about other nations that do not have outstanding human rights records supporting the war effort of the Russian Federation? Not merely Iran with drones or North Korea with missiles but significant support from the Chinese government based on intelligence reports.

Romantsova: Most countries or nations are in the Middle East or Central Asia. We do not understand all of this region, as we do not have a profound traditional relationship with them. We speak about Central Asia. It is a former Soviet Union country. That is why we have a connection, but it is not deep. Ukraine has most of its information from intelligence services, whether in diplomacy or trading. You can buy some information from commercials. For example, we buy from Sputnik and put them in space. So, when we speak about what kind of information we need for fighting and whether China, Iran, or India have some technologies to give information for fighting, do they have some support for Russia or some support for Ukraine? It is carefully secured information, where our army takes information. The British intelligence service only wants guys who regularly command something on the frontlines between Ukraine and Russia. It could have happened in other sources. However, for Ukrainian sources, we have many sources from British intelligence services -- they publicly have some commanders. So, this war depends on intelligence, not simply intelligence, but the cyber information database. The war information is only taken from cyberspace. For example, where is a power plant in Ukraine? You can try to use an old map from the Soviet Union.

In the same way, you can break this power plant's system management, which connects with primary sources in cyberspace. Cyberspace information is what you need in this conflict. Many people are involved in cyberspace fighting and cyberwarfare around our Ukrainian-Russian war. China plays a large part in that. I do not know if they will ever speak about that publicly. I do not know if they publicly support Russia, but Chinese hackers participate. I know that.

Jacobsen: The recent attack on Israel by Iran; I am mixing this because Russia uses the drones used by Iran in the Russo-Ukrainian war. There was a significant response from the Israelis and Americans. Reports are that at least 99% of those missiles and drones launched were taken down before impact. So, is there a lesson to be learned from that, given the fact that much of the long-distance being done can be done to Ukraine, whether infrastructure, residential areas, or military targets have to do with missiles and drones?

Romantsova: First, we must understand that Israel is small. Second, I need to find out the rockets used by Iran to make this strike and launch them. As I understand it, it is an excellent example that the USA or other countries have such technology, which can help us. They cover some parts of Ukraine. They may need help to do that for an extensive territory like Ukraine. If we compare Israel and Ukraine, the size difference is significant. So, Israel will always be protected by the USA. It is true. However, we need many negotiations to have the same status to negotiate a lot.

Jacobsen: Do the primary areas for winning significant hunks against the Russian Federation involve cyber operations, cyber warfare and economic warfare? If we look at critical economic indicators within the Russian Federation, things like the society's size and growth rate in terms of people brought in through immigration or being born there. Russia has been declining for at least two decades or stagnating yearly. By 2050, the estimates are that they will lose ten million people in their total population numbers. So, it is a shrinking population, as with China in the last couple of years...

Romantsova: But you know, Russia has had a demographic crisis before. That is why I told you about xenophobia but at the same time. Russia needs labour from Central Asian countries because Central Asian countries mostly have language, former Soviet Union countries, but Baltic countries are members of the EU. Most know the Russian language but will never come to Russia to be simple workers or work simple jobs. They will go to the EU if they need money. It is the same with Belarus. I am not going to Russia, but to Poland, for example. As you understand now, Ukrainians are in the same situation as Moldova. Georgia and Armenia are location countries. Azerbaijan has more profit and income than Russia, so they are not going to Russia to have money through simple work or labour. Georgians and Armenians are small, two small countries.

All of them have a problem with Russia. So, only Central Asia, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, all of those countries. Now, more and more, as big as Kazakhstan, they are much more speaking about anti-colonialism directions because they accept colonialism (former). The colonial politics of the Russian Federation, so only Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, etc., are countries with small populations. Now, no one likes them - the Russian Federation - because of Crocus City Center. That was the first season in these countries who returned to countries - these Central Asian countries - more than they left them. That means that the Russian Federation lost its labourers from Central Asia.

I think at the end of the year. They will lose even more. They are not like before, giving citizenship to the labourers in Central Asia. Most of them prefer to have citizenship of the Russian Federation, but they do not provide them. They like to use them like simple, cheap labourers, but not a part of politicians and the electorate. It is a difficult situation. Putin is trying to solve this through Ukrainian children. That is one of the reasons why they steal or kidnap them. It is the same if we speak about the Ukrainian population. One of my dreams of Putin is to join the territory of Ukraine tak, take all of this, repeal Ukrainians into the Russian population and solve the demographic crisis like this. However, one of the ways they are trying to control the matrimonial function of women. They are trying to put the women or motivate the women to have more children. One of the ideas is a bill in parliament that states that women can have higher education if they do not have two children.

Jacobsen: So, if they have higher education, they cannot.

Romantsova: It is just a bill. It is not a law now. They can, like all previous stupid bills, accept. It can be a backstep. Women in the Russian Federation, you must have two children before deciding to take higher education at university. It is against the classical, traditional Soviet Union idea that everyone should have higher education. Most of the populations of the former Soviet Union countries have higher education. In Ukraine, 80% of people have higher education. It is the usual and traditional period of your life. It does not mean you are choosing to go to university or not. You are going to university, or you - we call them - have a budget place where the State pays. Second, your parents collect the money and try to give it to you. For example, it is less expensive here in Ukraine than in the USA. It is traditional for most people here to have a higher education in some way. So, that is turning back from the evolution of the Soviet Union time.

Jacobsen: There are also statements about women having eight or more children or being urged to have eight or more children by Russian Federation leadership. At the same time, they are really pushing in the media and bills, not laws, so far, but also restricting the psychology of women's freedom through the repeal of physical protections for women. If a woman feels unsafe in the home, she will not feel safe to go out to do things freely: to get an education, to get a job, to have different and varied friends, and so on. Things like the repeal of the domestic violence protection law so that legally, you can, as a husband, beat your wife in Russia. That is a form of psychological warfare, too, not just a non-penalization of a negative behaviour. That sort of thing. It is along the lines of what you are saying as well. Only if you have children can you go and have children, where it is part, as you mentioned earlier, of what was a Soviet idea at the time of having higher education.

Romantsova: The Soviet idea was different at different times. It was 17 years. There was absolute equality between men and women initially, even in the understanding. They were trying to break the family's knowledge. It is not necessary to have a family to have some sexual relationship or to have children. However, after all the control of the State, they understood that having a family is much more comfortable for control. So, they started to speak, ""Yes, sure, women have equal rights here. In the Soviet Union, they are like men."" Society waiting, ""Yes, you have a job, but you have a 'second job.'"" At home, you take care of the children. Soviet women were with children. Women who care about the house and the deficit. It is a result of a centralized economy, a centralized planning economy. Women were mainly responsible for taking stock, finding, and buying things. Loads of people do not have the opportunity to use money, and those who do not use it. Women were responsible for home management, and they had work. They have a traditional need to have an education. All of this is built on a new glass ceiling for women. Some women are ministers in history or chiefs at big industrial companies. But mostly, you will not find these names in the history. That was not usual. That was not normal because women usually mainly cared about their families. So, education for women. That was a must-have. So, now, Russia wants to change. Russia changed the mental map of regular societal roles in the Russian Federation. They decriminalized home violence. They take back all the other areas of your life, except family, which you can control. You can't control your business, what kind of political media comes. You can't control whether you will have war or not. You can control one: Your family, if you are a man. If you are a woman, you need to find a man because all other ways to be protected will not help. So, inside the family, the man controls; it comes to a system of breeding families until the end of the 19th century when only men had a relationship with the State. Women always have any relationship with the State only through the man. Only your husband or your brother or father is responsible for your status. They determine your status. It is something like this. It is much easier to control men who only have power inside the family, so young control the family. So, the man controls the wife and children through this process. It is one of the ways they do this, as well as religion. They support spreading this Russian Orthodox ideology. But in this way, they are falling. They fall because statistics show fewer and fewer young people in the Russian Federation attend church. They may be believers but not members of the church.

Jacobsen: They are following in the line, ironically, of most of the Western world, which is a stark decline in attendance and belief in organized religion, particularly Christianity.

Romantsova: What happened with Russia is not a surprise, but a big problem for them; it is Islamization. In this situation, Islam gives more answers than Christianity.

Jacobsen: How so?

Romantsova: Islam talks about the Islamic State. Any state is foul. It needs to be corrected. It's because they need to recognize national or political management. In Muslim ideology, all the rights of believers are with one nation, Summa. All of these national countries or nations are false. It is temporary. We will all be in one Islamic world. So, it is one of the strong ideologies if you don't like a state. Putin created a state that is a system that can be unlikeable in one moment. If people do not have an average education, Islam proposes a sound system and understanding why Putin is wrong and all states are a bad idea. Allah did not create the states. So, that is all false. It is happening, first of all, in the jails. Before, in the Russian Federation, imagine 1 million people in prisons; it is a lot. Before, there were black and red jails; we call them zona. It is a secured zone, a jail. Black jails exist. The system of law calls them ""person who steals something.""

People who steal: Thieves. It was like a vast system of thieves during the Soviet era who created their law system. That's romanticized. This parallel reality exists in the jails. These are huge complexes that thieves control. They have their law, economic system, and all of this. It is not a mafia. It is a law. It is not one organization but a system of law. They call them ""thieves of the law."" Part of this reality was, again, the Soviet Union system. For example, Greek Catholic believers or a national movement against the Soviet Union. They are the same as Putin in jail. They start to be part of this system. It is fierce. They are criminals. They control part of these jails. Other parts of jails were controlled. During the Soviet Union, political cases and prisoners were put in red jails. Because police officers can prevent this, there are only two kinds of prisons now. Now, the third part of the jails is green, not black or red. Green means Islamic. This means that this is a closed society. It works by Islamic laws. It works through the law of crime. That is new. Before, it did not exist at all in the territory of former Soviet countries.

Jacobsen: It is points at interviews like this where I enjoy them because I have covered such a broad range of subject matter in a little over a decade.

Romantsova: [Laughing].

Jacobsen: Because I put in a lot of time. I have interviewed a lot of members of the ex-Muslim community. There is a whole host of them. A lot of the online secular community, especially, is one place in which they can formally organize, communicate, share arguments, share stories, help others who are getting out of more cases and help them leave religion when religion has taken an extreme form. Not as extreme as Salafi Wahhabi interpretations from Saudi Arabia, but certainly, family and community and national contexts where it is dangerous for them. So, you're talking about the thing in which they find many problems. Not they disagree with you; they agree with you because they see a threat of politicized religion in the way that a lot of people would see politicized Christianity as an issue in North America or in Russia, particularly in the United States and particularly in the Russian Federation. In the context of the Russian Federation, do you think that the xenophobia that you mentioned at the start has some ties to Islamist tendencies in the Russian Federation and concerns of politicized religion, providing some challenge to the leadership in the country? Is this enough of a challenge in the Russian Federation or more of a substantial nuisance to the leadership?

Romantsova: If Russia exists in Chechnya and a few other regions and a few more are more Islamic, Chechnya is more important because Kadyrov showed that the Islamic region in the Russian Federation could be in power. We do not know why. I think we know why, but Putin absolutely did not react as if there was any problem with Kadyrov, Chechnya's leader. It is not police, but special forces. He and his troops terroristically controlled Chechnya. They showed Russia that you can be absolutely Islamic and officially accepted. It is the same situation as the Taliban from Afghanistan. Putin officially meets with them. I think Putin showed that if you organize like an Islamic movement. You can even be strong enough that Putin accepts you as part of the dialogue.

(WSP) has announced strong financial results for the first quarter of 2024, marked by significant growth in key performance indicators. The company reported organic net revenue growth of 4.6%, an 8% increase in EBITDA, and a 13% rise in earnings per share. WSP's backlog reached $14.2 billion, equivalent to 11.8 months of revenues, and the Americas segment saw a 10.3% organic growth in backlog over the past year. The company is executing its strategy to enhance its margin profile, with a goal of at least a 150 basis-point improvement as part of its three-year strategic plan.

WSP's strategic acquisitions and the successful implementation of its global ERP system in the UK have positioned the company for continued success. The firm's commitment to productivity and efficiency, along with its confident outlook for various global markets, underscores its strategic direction. With a focus on selective bidding and margin expansion, WSP is poised to leverage its strong backlog and capitalize on growth opportunities across its diverse portfolio of services. The company's Annual Shareholder Meeting, scheduled for later in the day, will provide further insights into its strategy and operations.

Operator: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to WSP's First Quarter 2024 Results Conference Call. I would now like to turn the meeting over to Quentin Weber, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Mr. Weber.

Quentin Weber: Good morning. We hope you are all doing well, and thank you for joining our call today. We will be discussing our Q1 2024 performance followed by a Q&A Session. Joining us today this morning are Alexandre L'Heureux, our President and CEO; and Alain Michaud, our CFO. Please note that this call is also accessible on our website via webcast. During the call, we will be making some forward-looking statements and actual results could differ from those expressed or implied. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any of these statements. Relevant factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those forward-looking statements are listed in our MD&A for the quarter that ended March 31, 2024, which can be found on SEDAR and on our website. In addition, during the call, we may refer to certain non-IFRS measures. These measures are also defined in our MD&A for the quarter that ended March 31, 2024. Our MD&A includes reconciliations of non-IFRS measures to the most directly comparable IFRS measures. Management believes that these non-IFRS measures provide useful information to investors regarding the corporation's financial condition and results of operation as they provide additional key metrics of its performance. These non-IFRS measures are not recognized under IFRS, do not have any standardized meaning described under IFRS and may differ from similarly named measures as reported by other issuers, and accordingly, may not be comparable. These measures should not be viewed as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with IFRS. I will now turn the call over to Alexandre.

Alexandre L'Heureux: Thank you, Quentin. And good morning, everyone. I am pleased with our first quarter performance as it sets a solid foundation for the remainder of 2024 and reflects the positive momentum we continue to experience in our business. Globally, our backlog and pipeline of opportunities remains robust across all sectors, especially in the Americas, which recorded a double-digit organic backlog growth. In Q1, we delivered strong results in line with our expectations, and our top line and profitability continued to trend positively. During the quarter, we continued to future-proof WSP, over-indexing three core elements. First, we focus on optimizing our global platform to unlock even more possibilities and drive sustained organic growth and margin improvement. Second, we added expertise and new clients through a number of acquisitions completed in the first quarter. And third, we remain dedicated to being the premier partner to our clients and our communities. And let me review each in further detail. On the - optimization front, I'm sorry, we elevated further our outstanding platform, seizing productivity opportunities and bolstering project performance. These efforts are allowing us to already report an impressive increase of 50 basis points in adjusted EBITDA margin when compared to the first quarter of 2023. Moreover, it provides us with the confidence to deliver on our three-year strategic plan ambitions to increase our margin profile by at least 150 basis points. We also concluded the go-live of our global ERP in the UK. This region is the third key geography to onboard to the platform after Canada and the U.S., and we now have over 70% of our EBITDA converted and more than 50% of our employees on the new platform. This is one of the largest transformation we have undergone as a business, and it covers the modernization of our sales, procurement, project management, HR and finance functions. We are already beginning to reap the benefits of this initiative through enhanced business intelligence capabilities, the exchange of best practices, the leveraging of insights and data, and increased collaboration. Also, we are pleased to report that our deployment schedule is on plan and on budget. Since the beginning of the year, we have continued to bolster our platform by deploying capital towards strategic acquisitions, and we have announced four transactions recently. The first, Communica, is one of Canada's leading indigenous and stakeholder engagement and information management consulting firms. It is recognized for its collaborative approach and its ability to deliver authentic, open and transparent stakeholder and wider community engagement, including with indigenous - sorry -communities. This acquisition reinforces WSP's commitment to delivering impactful community projects and enhances its ability to respond to the increasing demand for stakeholder engagement and information management services. The second is Proxion, one of Finland's largest rail consultancies, that offers a range of railway and railway system design services, including traffic and energy services as well as safety and security expertise. Proxion adds key rail expertise in Finland to WSP's transport and infrastructure capabilities in the Nordics, and strengthens our market position and ability to lead large-scale projects in the Finnish market. By combining our respective expertise and teams, we aim to elevate our capabilities, broaden our portfolio and strengthen our market position in the country. The third is 1A Ingenieros, a Spanish consulting firm in transmission and distribution, operating mainly in the power and energy sector, which will enhance WSP capabilities in Spain, creating a strong multidisciplinary business in the region with a balanced portfolio in our core end markets. It will also increase our local workforce by approximately 70% and expand our geographical presence in the country by adding four new regions. Through this acquisition, WSP will be positioned as one of the leading international engineering firms in Spain. The fourth is AKF Group, a specialized mechanical, electrical firm that design complex health care, science and technology and mission-critical facilities. AKF enables us to strengthen our scale in the U.S. and expand our expertise within property and building by 20% in the U.S. alone. Through this acquisition, we aim to enhance our technical practice and boost our capabilities and presence in several essential high-end demand markets, and in a variety of sectors, such as corporate, cultural, health care, education, hospitality, retail, science and technology. The sustained expansion of our platform is attributable to strategic capital deployment and organic growth, but also to nurturing our internal talent and resources. This is why I am proud that we continue to focus on internal promotions and have set high ambitions in our strategic action plan. In 2023, we filled over 75% of our global leadership roles with internal candidates. And since the beginning of the fiscal year, another example was Joe Sczurko being promoted to the role of President of our business in the United States. Joe brings decades of invaluable leadership experience and a deep understanding of the industry and evolving client needs. I'm thrilled to see him and many others take on new challenges. The third core element of focus in the quarter was and will continue to be elevating the standard in client experience and being a premier partner to communities. We are making great strides on this front as witnessed by some recent project wins. Today, I have selected three that best illustrate this. In the UK, we have confirm our work on one of the largest programs ever won by WSP in the UK in terms of scale, revenue, length and complexity, which is aligned with our ambition to stay at the forefront of the energy transition and brings exciting new career opportunities for our talent. The Great Grid Upgrade is a major program to deliver electricity transmission infrastructure across the United Kingdom and enable 50 gigawatts of network capacity by 2030. It is a critical step in the pathway to net zero to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and enable the shift towards renewable energy. WSP has been appointed as one of seven industry partners tasked with providing over £9 billion worth of design and construction for national grids over 12 years. Our scope consists of providing professional services across the whole delivery life cycle, from early stage scheme development to environmental services, planning, consent and detailed design. This win is well aligned with our ambitions to stay at the forefront of the energy transition and bring exciting new career opportunities for our talent. In Los Angeles, we have also signed a new $100 million U.S. program management contract to support LA County Metro on the 15-mile light rail extension to Southeast Los Angeles County, which connect underserved communities from ten cities to downtown Los Angeles. The project is important as it broadens the scope of WSP traditional design services for this important customer. During the selection process, WSP scored highest amongst competing firms, achieving the best score in each of the major categories: firm experience and capabilities, key personnel and project approach. WSP has been the leader in the rail and transit sector in the U.S. since the design of the New York City subway system in the 1880s, and we fully intend to remain in the top position. In Australia, we are supporting the Queensland Train Manufacturing Program, which aims to deliver 65 new six-car passenger trains in time for the Brisbane 2032 Olympic and Paralympic games. This initiative is a pivotal support system for the region's growing population and economy. The program will not only boost Queensland's jobs market, but also offers substantial training and development opportunities. WSP provides civil, structural, rail, geotechnical, building and power design services for the greenfield facility. These three examples are a testament to the types of projects that allow us to partner with like-minded clients and deliver projects that profoundly enhance and impact the lives of communities. On that note, I will now invite Alain to review our financial results.

Alain Michaud: Thanks, Alex. I am very pleased this morning to report on our strong results for the first quarter of 2024, where we've seen net revenue grow organically by 4.6%, EBITDA by 8% and earnings per share by 13%. Let me elaborate further on each of these points, starting with our top line. For the first quarter, revenues and net revenue reached $3.6 billion and $2.8 billion, up 2.7% and 4.7%, respectively, compared to the first quarter of 2023. We achieved net revenue organic growth of approximately 6.5% when normalized for the same number of billable days compared to Q1 2023. As stated in our outlook issued in March, these additional billable days will reverse in Q4. Backlog as of March 30, 2024, stood at $14.2 billion, representing 11.8 months of revenues. And of interest, as Alex stated, the Americas reportable segment achieved organic backlog growth of 10.3% over the last 12 months. Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter reached $446 million, up 7.9% compared to the first quarter of 2023. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter reached 16%, an increase of 50 basis points when compared to the first quarter of 2023. And for the last 12 months, our EBITDA margin now stands at 17.7%. This increase is mainly attributable to our continued focus on productivity, as evidenced by a reduction in our personnel costs as a percentage of net revenues. For the quarter, adjusted net earnings reached $194 million or $1.55 per share, up approximately 13% compared to the first quarter or 2023. Free cash outflow reached $125 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, better than the same period last year and slightly of expectation. Our DSO stood at 76 days as of the end of March, stable and unchanged when compared to December 31, 2023. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio stood at 1.6 times, within management's target range of one to two times. As we progress through our business transformation journey, we continue to aim for 100% conversion of net earnings to free cash flow for 2024. In conclusion, we're off to a great start with a solid set of results, a strong operating plan and healthy market conditions. We are therefore reiterating our outlook with confidence. Now back to you, Alex.

Alexandre L'Heureux: Well, thank you, Alain. Given our prudent start of 2023, compared to our solid start in 2024 and given our progress made in the current strategic cycle, we are confident in the future. We welcomed approximately 10,000 employees through 15 acquisitions since the beginning of our plan, and notably, for since the beginning of the current year. We continue to have a promising pipeline of growth opportunities, a solid balance sheet and looking at the rest of 2024, we are moving forward with confidence. Our focus remains on delivering on our ambitions bolstered by healthy market conditions. Our shared vision and collective efforts are the cornerstone of our success, and I am confident they will continue to guide us on our journey to be recognized as the undisputed leader in our industry. On a final note, I would encourage you to explore our 2024 Global ESG Report which will be published shortly. You are also invited to take part in our Annual General Meeting which will be held in person and virtually at 11 a.m. Eastern Standard Time today. More details can be found on our website. And I will now open the line for questions.

Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. We will now take our first question. First question is from the line of Benoît Poirier from Desjardins. Please go ahead.

Benoît Poirier: Yes, good morning, Alain. Good morning Alex. And congratulations for the strong start.

Benoît Poirier: Yes. Just in terms of headcount, you added about 700 people so far this year. Obviously, you've been through four M&A transactions. So I was just curious to know how many people came from acquisition? And what's your expectation for the remainder of the year in light of your growth trajectory? And also, if you could comment about the greatest opportunities you still see from the productivity improvement standpoint.

Alexandre L'Heureux: Well, look, I think if I start with M&A, we have a very good start. I'm very pleased with where we stand at this point in time and the pipeline is healthy, so I'm confident that the remainder of the year should bear fruit. So I think, on that front, I'm feeling good that we should have a good year in 2024. Perhaps, Alain, you want to comment on headcount?

Alain Michaud: Yes. So on headcount, Benoît, with the Communica and Proxion acquisition in Q1, we've added about 200 people. Our focus is, as we've discussed many times in 2023 and at the start of 2024, we've been heavily engaged on maximizing the productivity of our business. So, headcount growth is important, but it's a balancing act, delivering also on increased productivity and efficiency. So, we are in line with our budget in terms of growth of headcount. And for the remainder of the year, we intend to continue on a similar path of maximizing our productivity.

Benoît Poirier: Okay.

Alexandre L'Heureux: You need to remember that the last two acquisitions have been completed in Q2.

Alain Michaud: That's right, beginning of Q2.

Benoît Poirier: Yes. Yes. Okay. That's great color. And some of your peers mentioned weakness in the Chinese housing market as well as in the UK, where one player proceeded to some cut headcount in their transportation division. I know China is not material for you, but I was wondering if there was any update and whether you were seeing anything similar.

Alexandre L'Heureux: No. Benoît - I mean, actually yes. I think we've consistently been saying over the last three or four quarters that Asia is challenging. There's no doubt about that. Having said all that, as you just mentioned, Mainland China for us, it's 300 people out of 67. So for us, it's de minimis. As it relates to the UK market, we are not seeing what has been perhaps described by others. The market is - we are feeling good about our performance. We are feeling extremely good around our recent win of a national grid which would provide good organic growth for the business for years to come. So overall, I'm extremely pleased with our performance in the UK market.

Operator: Thank you. We will now take our next question. This is from the line of Chris Murray from ATB Capital Markets. Please go ahead.

Chris Murray: Yes, thanks. Good morning. Just really quick, just looking at the backlog in Canada, the organic number was actually slightly negative this quarter. Just wondering if there's anything going on, or is this sort of a temporary thing? If you can just give us more color on maybe the reason for the - for it being kind of flat to down?

Alain Michaud: Yes, Chris, if anything, we feel extremely confident with the backlog in Canada and the market condition, it's mostly timing related, the ins and outs of a larger job. Underlying business is performing quite well and the backlog is solid. So no issue in Canada. Same comment for the Americas for that matter. And across the map...

Alexandre L'Heureux: I am feeling very, very good about Canada at this point.

Chris Murray: All right. No, that's helpful. And then just following on maybe your comments about the ERP system, so congratulations on getting to 70% complete. But thinking maybe over the next year or two, what's left to be done on this program? And is it fair to think that it should be substantially complete by the end of this fiscal year?

Alain Michaud: Well, currently, as Alex said, 70% of our EBITDA. So Canada, U.S. and UK is done. And when we reflect that what we've achieved since the beginning of the year, it's 25,000 and more that have been onboarded on the platform. So we're extremely proud of that and proud of our team that have devoted significant effort on that front. We are now moving to the East, and there is other region to be done, the Nordics, Australia, New Zealand. So, I think it's more 2025 calendar year that we will see the majority of our business into one platform. That's the intention, Chris.

Alexandre L'Heureux: The way, Chris, I am thinking about it and the way I think you should view this is, is we have - I'd like to think, and I'm saying that in a very - I'm obviously cautious in the way I'm saying it. But I feel we have substantially derisked this program at this point in time with our three largest countries on the platform, with 70% of our profit on the platform. However, we are operating in 60 countries. So the remainder 30% will take a bit more time, but we're highly confident that things are going to go well and they are going to be smooth. What I am especially proud of is, and you may have noticed it in our numbers, yes, the DSOs have increased slightly. But given the sheer task that we had to go through, I'm very proud that we kept our DSO stable, and I feel it's only going to improve from now.

Operator: Thank you. We'll now take our next question. [Operator Instructions] This is from the line of Jacob Bout from CIBC. Please go ahead.

Jacob Bout: Yes, I had a question just on M&A. I know you are saying that the pipeline looks pretty strong. But maybe you could talk a bit about how the pipeline is looking for the mid- to larger-sized acquisitions. And then my second question, just on the M&A, what the margin profile of recent acquisitions look like.

Alexandre L'Heureux: Yes. Margin acquisition of the acquisition we just - the margin, sorry, of the acquisition we just completed are fairly similar to our margin profile at this point in time. However, we continue to believe that we can improve the margin profile of those firms as soon as they - we are in a position to integrate them into our platform. So, feeling very good about this, Jacob. Look, around mid- to larger-size acquisition, I think, I've said that in numerous occasions in the past, it's extremely difficult to time acquisition. Oftentimes, it takes many years to convince a firm to join your ranks. It takes a lot of nurturing. What I can tell you is that we are - I continue to have formal and informal discussions with smaller-size, medium-size and larger-size acquisitions. I cannot guarantee you when we are going to complete these. But what I can tell you is that I am encouraged by the discussions that I am having right now.

Jacob Bout: Okay, that's fair. Maybe just going back to backlog and just looking specifically at APAC. It's down organically year-on-year, talked a bit about China, but how about Australia and New Zealand? I know you called out the timing of some projects there, but are you expecting a slowdown or is this just all timing in your view?

Alexandre L'Heureux: I think in New Zealand with the recent election, I think, there has been a pause, like any governments. Now I think it's more center-right government and took a pause on infrastructure spending. We expect that to change and resume in due course. Are we overly concerned by that? No. I think we're calm when things are hot and we are calm when things are cooling off a little bit because we believe this is timing and infrastructure needs are needed. Same with Australia. We've experienced double-digit organic growth for, I think, two years now. So obviously, we're starting from a higher base, but the activity level is good. We have a very strong business. We have a very strong team. So I'm positive in the longer term for that region. And yes, Asia, as I said earlier on today, it's been challenging and I believe will continue to be challenging for some time. Thankfully, for us, this is a small part of our business.

Operator: Thank you. We'll now take our next question. This is from Devin Dodge from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.

Devin Dodge: A couple of questions, maybe not so much related to Q1, but maybe longer term, but look, the demand environment is really quite strong across many of your regions. How do you think about the balance between pursuing the growth opportunities that are available and being more selective in your bidding activity to drive margin expansion?

Alexandre L'Heureux: Well, this is a balancing act, as you just mentioned, right? If I look where we are today as a company, WSP, I look at the brand awareness of the company, I look at the type of projects that we are now in the position to tackle as a prime designer or prime consultant, and I compare that to where we were five, seven, eight, nine, ten years ago. We are in a different space. Again, I mentioned and I highlighted three projects this morning that is a testament of what I just mentioned. I look at the great strides that we're making in sectors where three, four years ago, we were not big. I mentioned a few quarters ago the award of Propel project and other energy transition projects in the State of New York. Massive project for us. And now National Grid (LON:NG). Three, four years ago, we were not there. So I was telling our Board this week, the absolute number in organic growth is obviously important. And we're pleased, if you compare orange, with oranges or apples with apples that we grew 6.5% this quarter. But it's the type of growth that we are able to generate in sectors where we were fairly small few years ago I am extremely pleased with the type of award that we are able to secure right now. So that's telling me that we are continuing to diversify the platform. We continue to grow in sectors where we were not a leading firm. And then we continue to capitalize on the sectors where we have a strong presence. And the Proxion acquisition in Finland is a testament or an example of that. Now in the rail sector where we have the leadership franchise around the world, we're going to be able to tackle large projects in Finland. So overall, I'm feeling very good about that. And even though we're going through a conversion, an ERP conversion, we have been able to increase our utilization and we have been able to increase our margin over the recent past. So I feel, as Alain mentioned, our team should be commended for the extraordinary work that has been accomplished recently.

Devin Dodge: Excellent, that's good color. Okay. Second question on PFAS, lots of interest on the back of the EPA releasing some final rules last month.

Alexandre L'Heureux: Yes.

Devin Dodge: Do you view this as an opportunity for WSP? And if so, can you walk us through the services that you provide and where you expect to see the most benefit going forward?

Alexandre L'Heureux: Tremendous opportunities. Perhaps, Alain, you can cover that. But clearly, for us, like any other firms in the space, it's a real opportunity. The rules and the regulation are strict and the requirements will increase demands for our services. So I feel that, over the coming years, we'll have our share, and we'll be winning our share of work in that space. Alain?

Alain Michaud: Yes, definitely positive, Devin, in terms of development. The rules in the U.S. are probably the most strict that we've seen. But I think it bodes well for our expert. We probably have around 500 PFAS expert in the U.S. alone. Our backlog in Q1 has already seen some good level of work. So we're extremely positive about the impact of the new regulation and the flow of work that should come our way given our expertise and profile in the space.

Operator: Thank you. We'll now take our next question, this is from Frederic Bastien from Raymond James. Please go ahead.

Alexandre L'Heureux: [Foreign Language]

Frederic Bastien: [Foreign Language] Guys, I'd like to circle back on M&A for a bit. And really wondering what has changed from an internal or external standpoint to make you say, ""Hey, okay, now it's time to open up the M&A valve again?""

Alexandre L'Heureux: Yes. If you remember, Frederic I think, it was the last quarter, yes, at the last investor call, I mentioned that we viewed 2023 as a year of consolidation. Last year alone, we grew our top line by over 20%. Yes, not all of this was organic growth, there was a lot of acquisition growth, but we grew our top line by one fifth in one year. So I consider that to be very meaningful and very transformative. So, last year was a year of consolidation, we wanted to extract the value from the platform. We wanted to complete the integration of Golder, we wanted to activate our work on the integration of Wood E&I. So that's why I considered last year, a year of consolidation. This year, we've had a strong start of the year. Mind you, these are not large acquisitions, but are very strategic to us. And yes, we're clearly open for business. We have a strong balance sheet. As I said before, I feel we have substantially derisked the ERP project and transformation. So, I feel that all of the ingredients are now in place for us to continue to grow inorganically and organically.

Frederic Bastien: Thank, super helpful. Next one is perhaps for Alain. We saw better-than-expected margin expansion in the quarter, at least from my standpoint, and that sets you up quite nicely for the rest of the year. Do you anticipate similar gains in future quarters? Or will we see a bit of variability as we build into Q2, Q3 and Q4?

Alain Michaud: Yes. So as Alex said, we are very proud of the lift in Q1. We usually have lower margin expansion in the first quarter of the year, so we are extremely proud about that. We've devoted significant effort on working on all those levers, as you know, Fred, on productivity. We are certainly aiming to push and continue to increase margin in the following quarter. And we're feeling confident about the 65 basis point increase that we have guided for the full year. We'll keep on working hard and pushing hard on improving productivity of the firm.

Frederic Bastien: Okay. But do you expect that to be linear? Or I mean, 65% is a massive improvement. Would that be backend loaded?

Alexandre L'Heureux: You are very persistent. That's the intention, to continue to push in that direction.

Maxim Sytchev: Alex, maybe the first question for you, if I may. In terms of - certainly, it feels like there is a theme emerging when it comes to power. Big win in UK, Spanish acquisition. We are reading that UK will need to [indiscernible] by a factor of seven when it comes to [indiscernible] energy transition. Do you mind maybe expanding a little bit on this important theme and maybe the opportunity potentially in the U.S. and Canada, how to sort of take advantage of all this? Thank you so much.

Alexandre L'Heureux: Yes. Look, you've been following us for a very long time, Max, so you know us inside out. We've always have taken a very disciplined approach in the way we're building our firm. And as I said, the first pillar we started with more than ten years ago was with property and building, then we moved to transportation infrastructure, and we continue to raise the bar in those two sectors. More recently, we said that we wanted to become the leading firm in the green transition, so we build our pillar around Earth and Environment. And now I feel that we are ready to make a big push in the energy transition. So more recently, we've invested a lot in talent, and we invested a lot of effort in growing our presence in that sector. And as I said before, I could not be prouder of the work that has been accomplished. And this strat plan to grow our presence there, I think now we're tackling some of the largest energy transition program in the United States and in the UK, so I'm extremely pleased about that. And you're right in pointing out that our push in Central Europe with a 250-people acquisition in transmission and distribution is another example of our core strategy at this point in time. So yes, we're going to continue to push in that sector.

Maxim Sytchev: I appreciate that, thanks. And then one other follow-up that I have, do you have any update in terms of IIJA and how that funding is flowing through? And how should we think about this in terms of the impact? Thank you.

Alain Michaud: I could take that one, Max. So, the latest number that have been published, there's about 40% of funding that have been deployed. This is April data, and it's up from February data by more than 30%. So we were at 30% deployment in February, 40% in April. So it's moving certainly in the right direction. 40,000 projects have been awarded, funding through the Biden Infrastructure Bill. So that continues to support our thesis around and our confidence around the U.S. And if you combine that with the regulation on PFAS we've covered before, we continue to feel very strong about the U.S. and especially given our leadership position in the transportation business. And I have to say transportation represents currently about two third of all the funding that have been deployed through the bill. So that's good news for us and supports our thesis.

Operator: Thank you. We'll now take the next question, this is from Michael Tupholme from TD Securities. Please go ahead.

Michael Tupholme: This may tie into the last answer you just provided there regarding IIJA, but the 10.3% organic growth in backlog in the Americas that you've highlighted a few times. Can you talk a little bit about the areas that drove that increase in the quarter?

Alexandre L'Heureux: All the sector, Michael. I mean, transportation, property and building, earth and environment, we are seeing growth in those sectors. We've seen growth in power, as I talked about. So at the moment, I feel we are going to continue to grow in those sectors. And one that I would perhaps add as well is advanced manufacturing. We are doing more work in that space, and I expect to continue more and more. So that also is a real opportunity for us to grow and to develop new sectors.

Michael Tupholme: And it doesn't sound like it from your response just now or any of your other comments. But more broadly, when we look across the business from an end market perspective, are there any areas that are looking weaker right now or causing you to be concerned at all?

Alexandre L'Heureux: Are you talking in the Americas or you're talking globally?

Michael Tupholme: Globally, and I don't mean regionally. I mean, I know you've touched on Asia as a - and China regionally. But just from an end market perspective globally, is there anything that you see is slower?

Alexandre L'Heureux: I don't think we can look at our sectors and conclude that things are slowing down to the contrary I feel we're in a good spot right now. But yes, there are some pockets of geographies that are more challenging than others. But for the most part, I feel our top countries are performing well at this point.

Michael Tupholme: Perfect. And then just lastly, looking at the margins in the APAC segment, you did see a decline in EBITDA margins year-over-year in Q1. I see from the commentary that the performance in Asia was the source of that. I guess I'm just wondering how we should think about APAC margins going forward as you move through the year? Is there an opportunity to grow margins? Or how should we be thinking about margins?

Alexandre L'Heureux: Actually, Australia margin profile, we're not reporting the different countries, but just to give you a sense, in Australia, we have seen our margin profile going up, not going down. Equally, New Zealand has been stable. So overall, I think we're feeling good.

Alain Michaud: And if you look at Asia specifically, Q1 last year was a quasi-normal quarter, so the comparison Q1 over Q1 is a little tougher. But if you look sequentially versus Q4, Asia is not significantly moving down. So overall, if you think about Australia and New Zealand, feeling confident about their margin profile improvement for the rest of the year and stabilization in Asia.

Michael Tupholme: Okay, that's helpful. Thank you.

Operator: Thank you. We'll now take the next question. This is from Michael Doumet from Scotiabank. Please go ahead.

Michael Doumet: Hey Alex. You guys discussed productivity again as being a focus in 2024 and when I look at the project margins and the improvement there, obviously great in the first quarter. I can think about that as coming from an increase from a combination of higher price and higher utilization. Is there a way maybe that you can discuss the trend of each? And I am just curious, going forward, where you think there's more room.

Alexandre L'Heureux: Well, we definitely believe there is more room in the years to come. You can always improve. So, we believe there are some geographies and some sectors where the productivity is not where it needs to be as far as we are concerned, number one. And number two, going back perhaps to a question that was asked earlier on this morning, being more selective in the projects that we undertake. WSP, we excel in complex projects. That's where we feel we can do better and we can increase our margin profile. So the type of projects that we undertake is also going to have an impact on our margin profile. So obviously, by selecting projects where we believe we can really raise the bar, provide a better service or a differentiated service will allow us to increase our margin profile. So I would argue that this is all of the above at this point.

Michael Doumet: Okay. No, that makes sense. And then Alex, maybe just turning to M&A, look, you've been here for a long, long time and you've done a lot of deals. We're living in a world where valuations are high and interest rates are high. You would think that maybe one of the two would have given a little bit. But when you look at deals today, do you feel more strongly about the need to drive synergies to get to the appropriate IRR? Or do you still think that there is sufficient value out there, particularly when we're talking about the medium to larger deals?

Alexandre L'Heureux: Yes. Look, it's not the first time we are going through an environment that is challenging. I think you heard me saying that before, you just mentioned, I've been there for a very long time. So we've gone through times where, I remember 2014, the turn - that's ten years ago, but the turnaround in oil and gas and the markets were challenging. But you know what? In those difficult times, there are also some opportunities. So if you recall, at the time, the exchange rate between the U.S. and Canada was one for one. So we were able to acquire Parsons (NYSE:PSN) Brinckerhoff in a difficult period, where however, from an exchange point of view, we had favorable tailwinds. So, my belief is that in good times and in bad times, you have to be creative and you have to find value in the transaction that you look into. Mind you, you are right. We have to be disciplined. If the interest rate is impacting financial sponsor, I don't see why it would not impact us. So we have to be disciplined in the way we're thinking about the transactions. But for the right acquisition, I am not going to shy away because of the current environment. We need to have a long-term view on transaction and what we're trying to build as a company. So that would be my take at this point in time, is we should not be using the market conditions as an excuse, we should instead push ourselves to be creative and find value.

Michael Doumet: Yes. No, I appreciate those comments. Look, maybe I will ask a third. I am assuming I am the last here. But just as a clarification, should we interpret your reiterating of your guidance is it being unchanged, including the recent acquisition and the favorable FX, or just not updated yet?

Alain Michaud: It's early in the year, Michael, so we didn't feel, given this the impact of the recent acquisition, we didn't feel the need to increase or change our guidance. We'll continue to track that and see, in Q2 and Q3, what we do. But we are feeling equally strong as we felt in March when we issued our guidance with the platform we had at the time. So I think that...

Operator: Thank you. We will now take our next question. This is from Ian Gillies from Stifel. Please go ahead.

Ian Gillies: I just wanted to follow-on some of the questions in and around power and your intention to grow there. I am just curious on how that business or perhaps the ones you've looked at are, in broad strokes, how it stacks up, I guess, maybe against the corporate averages, because one of the great things about growing that Earth and Environment business, it was higher margin - it appears to be higher margin than the corporate average. I am wondering if power tends to have some of the same traits.

Alexandre L'Heureux: Yes, it's a fair assumption. It's a fair assumption. Right now, the world is in dire need of new sources of energy. So I feel - I mentioned a few projects this morning. This has not gone unnoticed for us, and we believe that WSP is uniquely positioned to provide services in that space, because the power space, it's not just about and around connecting new sources of energy to existing grid, there is also a collateral impact on other sectors, such as building, earth and environment and transportation. So we wanted, in a very disciplined way, to build our presence in earth and environment, which we've done since late 2018. But clearly, as you can see and notice, I've been talking about this over the last few quarters, I'm quite keen to continue to diversify our platform and I'm quite keen to continue to grow in sectors where we're not leading. And we have the aspire to become a leading firm.

Ian Gillies: That's incredibly helpful, thanks very much. The other separate question I had, one of the things that's been talked about on prior calls is trying to increase your presence in the U.S. with respect to federal government spending, whether it be through GSAs or other avenues. Is that still a focus? Or is there enough work going on elsewhere that you've shifted priorities?

Alexandre L'Heureux: No. They're not mutually exclusive, that's the way I would answer the question. I think we can continue to push. I talked about power, but I mentioned advanced manufacturing. I think there's real opportunities for us to grow in that space organically and potentially through acquisitions over time. So, I think these are new sources or new opportunities for WSP, and we intend to take advantage of them.

Ian Gillies: Okay, thanks very helpful. Thanks very much. I will turn it back over.

Alexandre L'Heureux: Okay, Ian.

Operator: Thank you. And we have one more question. And last question today is from Sabahat Khan from RBC. Please go ahead.

Sabahat Khan: Great. Thanks and good morning. I guess just hearing a little about where you see the demand, whether it's by region and market, how are you balancing these demand indicators against hiring and then trying to just maintain the right level of utilization and drive margins? Just trying to understand - the demand environment still seems like it's in a reasonable place, labor situation is somewhat better than a few years ago, but just curious how you are deciding on the right number of employees to onboard while also considering M&A there? Any color would be helpful.

Alexandre L'Heureux: Yes. Well, I'm glad you bring this topic, Saba. I mean, if I look at our trailing 12 months numbers, our turnover is historical low levels, meaning that we have a lower turnover in our last 12 months than we've had in pre-pandemic levels. So that, combined with our increased productivity and extracting the value from our platform, we are obviously - this is a balancing act. But recently, we have chosen to work on the engagement of our people, reducing our turnover, increasing productivity, rather than being out there and obviously hire just for the sake of hiring. You look at the fee per employees that we are generating and the curve that you are going to witness if you do the math, over the last ten years, I mean, that's something I'm really focused on. I want to make sure that - and I am saying that with all due respect to our employees that are listening to the call, but I want us to do more with less. I want us to be in a position to deliver more with less. So I want us to run a very, very tight ship and a very, very efficient platform. So that's the mindset right now.

Sabahat Khan: Okay, great. And then, I guess, with some of these moving parts about end market growth and the IIJA, if we look particularly at the U.S. market, do you expect any meaningful shift, putting M&A aside, any meaningful shift in your end market mix? I think you're large in transportation, that's a big part of the IIJA. Should we expect more of the same? Do you expect any evolution in where your business comes from over the next two to three years in the U.S. market?

Alexandre L'Heureux: Well, as I said, I think there are untapped territories for us. So I mentioned power, advanced manufacturing. I feel we could do more there. We can always do more in water, which we're going to continue to grow. But there's so much work in the property and building sector. There is so much more that we can do here. And transportation, we're subscale in many states and many parts of the U.S. So I do feel that we have tremendous opportunities pretty much in all sectors. But as I mentioned today, there are some sectors that I would like to grow because I feel we're too subscale at this point in time.

Sabahat Khan: Okay. Then one last quick one, maybe for Alain, I guess a lot of discussion on this call around M&A with the scale of the company growing and the cash flow base growing, should we expect any other areas of focus within capital allocation besides M&A over the next one to two years? Thanks.

Alexandre L'Heureux: I think you - I will take this one up and Alain can complement. But yes, as part of our next strategic cycle, clearly, we are going to continue to invest in R&D and digital, definitely.

Operator: Thank you. And there are no further questions at this time, so I'll hand back to the speakers for any closing comments. Thank you.

Alexandre L'Heureux: Well, thank you for attending the call today. Thank you for your support. As a friendly reminder, we will be holding our Annual Shareholder Meeting at 11:00 Eastern Time today. So, we are encouraging you to attend in person or virtually. And we look forward to updating you in Q2. On that note, I would like to wish you continued success and a great starting of the summer. Thank you very much.

Full transcript - None (WSPOF) Q1 2024:

Operator: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to WSP's First Quarter 2024 Results Conference Call. I would now like to turn the meeting over to Quentin Weber, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Mr. Weber.

Quentin Weber: Good morning. We hope you are all doing well, and thank you for joining our call today. We will be discussing our Q1 2024 performance followed by a Q&A Session. Joining us today this morning are Alexandre L'Heureux, our President and CEO; and Alain Michaud, our CFO. Please note that this call is also accessible on our website via webcast. During the call, we will be making some forward-looking statements and actual results could differ from those expressed or implied. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any of these statements. Relevant factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those forward-looking statements are listed in our MD&A for the quarter that ended March 31, 2024, which can be found on SEDAR and on our website. In addition, during the call, we may refer to certain non-IFRS measures. These measures are also defined in our MD&A for the quarter that ended March 31, 2024. Our MD&A includes reconciliations of non-IFRS measures to the most directly comparable IFRS measures. Management believes that these non-IFRS measures provide useful information to investors regarding the corporation's financial condition and results of operation as they provide additional key metrics of its performance. These non-IFRS measures are not recognized under IFRS, do not have any standardized meaning described under IFRS and may differ from similarly named measures as reported by other issuers, and accordingly, may not be comparable. These measures should not be viewed as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with IFRS. I will now turn the call over to Alexandre.

Alexandre L'Heureux: Thank you, Quentin. And good morning, everyone. I am pleased with our first quarter performance as it sets a solid foundation for the remainder of 2024 and reflects the positive momentum we continue to experience in our business. Globally, our backlog and pipeline of opportunities remains robust across all sectors, especially in the Americas, which recorded a double-digit organic backlog growth. In Q1, we delivered strong results in line with our expectations, and our top line and profitability continued to trend positively. During the quarter, we continued to future-proof WSP, over-indexing three core elements. First, we focus on optimizing our global platform to unlock even more possibilities and drive sustained organic growth and margin improvement. Second, we added expertise and new clients through a number of acquisitions completed in the first quarter. And third, we remain dedicated to being the premier partner to our clients and our communities. And let me review each in further detail. On the - optimization front, I'm sorry, we elevated further our outstanding platform, seizing productivity opportunities and bolstering project performance. These efforts are allowing us to already report an impressive increase of 50 basis points in adjusted EBITDA margin when compared to the first quarter of 2023. Moreover, it provides us with the confidence to deliver on our three-year strategic plan ambitions to increase our margin profile by at least 150 basis points. We also concluded the go-live of our global ERP in the UK. This region is the third key geography to onboard to the platform after Canada and the U.S., and we now have over 70% of our EBITDA converted and more than 50% of our employees on the new platform. This is one of the largest transformation we have undergone as a business, and it covers the modernization of our sales, procurement, project management, HR and finance functions. We are already beginning to reap the benefits of this initiative through enhanced business intelligence capabilities, the exchange of best practices, the leveraging of insights and data, and increased collaboration. Also, we are pleased to report that our deployment schedule is on plan and on budget. Since the beginning of the year, we have continued to bolster our platform by deploying capital towards strategic acquisitions, and we have announced four transactions recently. The first, Communica, is one of Canada's leading indigenous and stakeholder engagement and information management consulting firms. It is recognized for its collaborative approach and its ability to deliver authentic, open and transparent stakeholder and wider community engagement, including with indigenous - sorry -communities. This acquisition reinforces WSP's commitment to delivering impactful community projects and enhances its ability to respond to the increasing demand for stakeholder engagement and information management services. The second is Proxion, one of Finland's largest rail consultancies, that offers a range of railway and railway system design services, including traffic and energy services as well as safety and security expertise. Proxion adds key rail expertise in Finland to WSP's transport and infrastructure capabilities in the Nordics, and strengthens our market position and ability to lead large-scale projects in the Finnish market. By combining our respective expertise and teams, we aim to elevate our capabilities, broaden our portfolio and strengthen our market position in the country. The third is 1A Ingenieros, a Spanish consulting firm in transmission and distribution, operating mainly in the power and energy sector, which will enhance WSP capabilities in Spain, creating a strong multidisciplinary business in the region with a balanced portfolio in our core end markets. It will also increase our local workforce by approximately 70% and expand our geographical presence in the country by adding four new regions. Through this acquisition, WSP will be positioned as one of the leading international engineering firms in Spain. The fourth is AKF Group, a specialized mechanical, electrical firm that design complex health care, science and technology and mission-critical facilities. AKF enables us to strengthen our scale in the U.S. and expand our expertise within property and building by 20% in the U.S. alone. Through this acquisition, we aim to enhance our technical practice and boost our capabilities and presence in several essential high-end demand markets, and in a variety of sectors, such as corporate, cultural, health care, education, hospitality, retail, science and technology. The sustained expansion of our platform is attributable to strategic capital deployment and organic growth, but also to nurturing our internal talent and resources. This is why I am proud that we continue to focus on internal promotions and have set high ambitions in our strategic action plan. In 2023, we filled over 75% of our global leadership roles with internal candidates. And since the beginning of the fiscal year, another example was Joe Sczurko being promoted to the role of President of our business in the United States. Joe brings decades of invaluable leadership experience and a deep understanding of the industry and evolving client needs. I'm thrilled to see him and many others take on new challenges. The third core element of focus in the quarter was and will continue to be elevating the standard in client experience and being a premier partner to communities. We are making great strides on this front as witnessed by some recent project wins. Today, I have selected three that best illustrate this. In the UK, we have confirm our work on one of the largest programs ever won by WSP in the UK in terms of scale, revenue, length and complexity, which is aligned with our ambition to stay at the forefront of the energy transition and brings exciting new career opportunities for our talent. The Great Grid Upgrade is a major program to deliver electricity transmission infrastructure across the United Kingdom and enable 50 gigawatts of network capacity by 2030. It is a critical step in the pathway to net zero to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and enable the shift towards renewable energy. WSP has been appointed as one of seven industry partners tasked with providing over £9 billion worth of design and construction for national grids over 12 years. Our scope consists of providing professional services across the whole delivery life cycle, from early stage scheme development to environmental services, planning, consent and detailed design. This win is well aligned with our ambitions to stay at the forefront of the energy transition and bring exciting new career opportunities for our talent. In Los Angeles, we have also signed a new $100 million U.S. program management contract to support LA County Metro on the 15-mile light rail extension to Southeast Los Angeles County, which connect underserved communities from ten cities to downtown Los Angeles. The project is important as it broadens the scope of WSP traditional design services for this important customer. During the selection process, WSP scored highest amongst competing firms, achieving the best score in each of the major categories: firm experience and capabilities, key personnel and project approach. WSP has been the leader in the rail and transit sector in the U.S. since the design of the New York City subway system in the 1880s, and we fully intend to remain in the top position. In Australia, we are supporting the Queensland Train Manufacturing Program, which aims to deliver 65 new six-car passenger trains in time for the Brisbane 2032 Olympic and Paralympic games. This initiative is a pivotal support system for the region's growing population and economy. The program will not only boost Queensland's jobs market, but also offers substantial training and development opportunities. WSP provides civil, structural, rail, geotechnical, building and power design services for the greenfield facility. These three examples are a testament to the types of projects that allow us to partner with like-minded clients and deliver projects that profoundly enhance and impact the lives of communities. On that note, I will now invite Alain to review our financial results.

Alain Michaud: Thanks, Alex. I am very pleased this morning to report on our strong results for the first quarter of 2024, where we've seen net revenue grow organically by 4.6%, EBITDA by 8% and earnings per share by 13%. Let me elaborate further on each of these points, starting with our top line. For the first quarter, revenues and net revenue reached $3.6 billion and $2.8 billion, up 2.7% and 4.7%, respectively, compared to the first quarter of 2023. We achieved net revenue organic growth of approximately 6.5% when normalized for the same number of billable days compared to Q1 2023. As stated in our outlook issued in March, these additional billable days will reverse in Q4. Backlog as of March 30, 2024, stood at $14.2 billion, representing 11.8 months of revenues. And of interest, as Alex stated, the Americas reportable segment achieved organic backlog growth of 10.3% over the last 12 months. Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter reached $446 million, up 7.9% compared to the first quarter of 2023. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter reached 16%, an increase of 50 basis points when compared to the first quarter of 2023. And for the last 12 months, our EBITDA margin now stands at 17.7%. This increase is mainly attributable to our continued focus on productivity, as evidenced by a reduction in our personnel costs as a percentage of net revenues. For the quarter, adjusted net earnings reached $194 million or $1.55 per share, up approximately 13% compared to the first quarter or 2023. Free cash outflow reached $125 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, better than the same period last year and slightly of expectation. Our DSO stood at 76 days as of the end of March, stable and unchanged when compared to December 31, 2023. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio stood at 1.6 times, within management's target range of one to two times. As we progress through our business transformation journey, we continue to aim for 100% conversion of net earnings to free cash flow for 2024. In conclusion, we're off to a great start with a solid set of results, a strong operating plan and healthy market conditions. We are therefore reiterating our outlook with confidence. Now back to you, Alex.

Alexandre L'Heureux: Well, thank you, Alain. Given our prudent start of 2023, compared to our solid start in 2024 and given our progress made in the current strategic cycle, we are confident in the future. We welcomed approximately 10,000 employees through 15 acquisitions since the beginning of our plan, and notably, for since the beginning of the current year. We continue to have a promising pipeline of growth opportunities, a solid balance sheet and looking at the rest of 2024, we are moving forward with confidence. Our focus remains on delivering on our ambitions bolstered by healthy market conditions. Our shared vision and collective efforts are the cornerstone of our success, and I am confident they will continue to guide us on our journey to be recognized as the undisputed leader in our industry. On a final note, I would encourage you to explore our 2024 Global ESG Report which will be published shortly. You are also invited to take part in our Annual General Meeting which will be held in person and virtually at 11 a.m. Eastern Standard Time today. More details can be found on our website. And I will now open the line for questions.

Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. We will now take our first question. First question is from the line of Benoît Poirier from Desjardins. Please go ahead.

Benoît Poirier: Yes, good morning, Alain. Good morning Alex. And congratulations for the strong start.

Benoît Poirier: Yes. Just in terms of headcount, you added about 700 people so far this year. Obviously, you've been through four M&A transactions. So I was just curious to know how many people came from acquisition? And what's your expectation for the remainder of the year in light of your growth trajectory? And also, if you could comment about the greatest opportunities you still see from the productivity improvement standpoint.

Alexandre L'Heureux: Well, look, I think if I start with M&A, we have a very good start. I'm very pleased with where we stand at this point in time and the pipeline is healthy, so I'm confident that the remainder of the year should bear fruit. So I think, on that front, I'm feeling good that we should have a good year in 2024. Perhaps, Alain, you want to comment on headcount?

Alain Michaud: Yes. So on headcount, Benoît, with the Communica and Proxion acquisition in Q1, we've added about 200 people. Our focus is, as we've discussed many times in 2023 and at the start of 2024, we've been heavily engaged on maximizing the productivity of our business. So, headcount growth is important, but it's a balancing act, delivering also on increased productivity and efficiency. So, we are in line with our budget in terms of growth of headcount. And for the remainder of the year, we intend to continue on a similar path of maximizing our productivity.

Benoît Poirier: Okay.

Alexandre L'Heureux: You need to remember that the last two acquisitions have been completed in Q2.

Alain Michaud: That's right, beginning of Q2.

Benoît Poirier: Yes. Yes. Okay. That's great color. And some of your peers mentioned weakness in the Chinese housing market as well as in the UK, where one player proceeded to some cut headcount in their transportation division. I know China is not material for you, but I was wondering if there was any update and whether you were seeing anything similar.

Alexandre L'Heureux: No. Benoît - I mean, actually yes. I think we've consistently been saying over the last three or four quarters that Asia is challenging. There's no doubt about that. Having said all that, as you just mentioned, Mainland China for us, it's 300 people out of 67. So for us, it's de minimis. As it relates to the UK market, we are not seeing what has been perhaps described by others. The market is - we are feeling good about our performance. We are feeling extremely good around our recent win of a national grid which would provide good organic growth for the business for years to come. So overall, I'm extremely pleased with our performance in the UK market.

Operator: Thank you. We will now take our next question. This is from the line of Chris Murray from ATB Capital Markets. Please go ahead.

Chris Murray: Yes, thanks. Good morning. Just really quick, just looking at the backlog in Canada, the organic number was actually slightly negative this quarter. Just wondering if there's anything going on, or is this sort of a temporary thing? If you can just give us more color on maybe the reason for the - for it being kind of flat to down?

Alain Michaud: Yes, Chris, if anything, we feel extremely confident with the backlog in Canada and the market condition, it's mostly timing related, the ins and outs of a larger job. Underlying business is performing quite well and the backlog is solid. So no issue in Canada. Same comment for the Americas for that matter. And across the map...

Alexandre L'Heureux: I am feeling very, very good about Canada at this point.

Chris Murray: All right. No, that's helpful. And then just following on maybe your comments about the ERP system, so congratulations on getting to 70% complete. But thinking maybe over the next year or two, what's left to be done on this program? And is it fair to think that it should be substantially complete by the end of this fiscal year?

Alain Michaud: Well, currently, as Alex said, 70% of our EBITDA. So Canada, U.S. and UK is done. And when we reflect that what we've achieved since the beginning of the year, it's 25,000 and more that have been onboarded on the platform. So we're extremely proud of that and proud of our team that have devoted significant effort on that front. We are now moving to the East, and there is other region to be done, the Nordics, Australia, New Zealand. So, I think it's more 2025 calendar year that we will see the majority of our business into one platform. That's the intention, Chris.

Alexandre L'Heureux: The way, Chris, I am thinking about it and the way I think you should view this is, is we have - I'd like to think, and I'm saying that in a very - I'm obviously cautious in the way I'm saying it. But I feel we have substantially derisked this program at this point in time with our three largest countries on the platform, with 70% of our profit on the platform. However, we are operating in 60 countries. So the remainder 30% will take a bit more time, but we're highly confident that things are going to go well and they are going to be smooth. What I am especially proud of is, and you may have noticed it in our numbers, yes, the DSOs have increased slightly. But given the sheer task that we had to go through, I'm very proud that we kept our DSO stable, and I feel it's only going to improve from now.

Operator: Thank you. We'll now take our next question. [Operator Instructions] This is from the line of Jacob Bout from CIBC. Please go ahead.

Jacob Bout: Yes, I had a question just on M&A. I know you are saying that the pipeline looks pretty strong. But maybe you could talk a bit about how the pipeline is looking for the mid- to larger-sized acquisitions. And then my second question, just on the M&A, what the margin profile of recent acquisitions look like.

Alexandre L'Heureux: Yes. Margin acquisition of the acquisition we just - the margin, sorry, of the acquisition we just completed are fairly similar to our margin profile at this point in time. However, we continue to believe that we can improve the margin profile of those firms as soon as they - we are in a position to integrate them into our platform. So, feeling very good about this, Jacob. Look, around mid- to larger-size acquisition, I think, I've said that in numerous occasions in the past, it's extremely difficult to time acquisition. Oftentimes, it takes many years to convince a firm to join your ranks. It takes a lot of nurturing. What I can tell you is that we are - I continue to have formal and informal discussions with smaller-size, medium-size and larger-size acquisitions. I cannot guarantee you when we are going to complete these. But what I can tell you is that I am encouraged by the discussions that I am having right now.

Jacob Bout: Okay, that's fair. Maybe just going back to backlog and just looking specifically at APAC. It's down organically year-on-year, talked a bit about China, but how about Australia and New Zealand? I know you called out the timing of some projects there, but are you expecting a slowdown or is this just all timing in your view?

Alexandre L'Heureux: I think in New Zealand with the recent election, I think, there has been a pause, like any governments. Now I think it's more center-right government and took a pause on infrastructure spending. We expect that to change and resume in due course. Are we overly concerned by that? No. I think we're calm when things are hot and we are calm when things are cooling off a little bit because we believe this is timing and infrastructure needs are needed. Same with Australia. We've experienced double-digit organic growth for, I think, two years now. So obviously, we're starting from a higher base, but the activity level is good. We have a very strong business. We have a very strong team. So I'm positive in the longer term for that region. And yes, Asia, as I said earlier on today, it's been challenging and I believe will continue to be challenging for some time. Thankfully, for us, this is a small part of our business.

Operator: Thank you. We'll now take our next question. This is from Devin Dodge from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.

Devin Dodge: A couple of questions, maybe not so much related to Q1, but maybe longer term, but look, the demand environment is really quite strong across many of your regions. How do you think about the balance between pursuing the growth opportunities that are available and being more selective in your bidding activity to drive margin expansion?

Alexandre L'Heureux: Well, this is a balancing act, as you just mentioned, right? If I look where we are today as a company, WSP, I look at the brand awareness of the company, I look at the type of projects that we are now in the position to tackle as a prime designer or prime consultant, and I compare that to where we were five, seven, eight, nine, ten years ago. We are in a different space. Again, I mentioned and I highlighted three projects this morning that is a testament of what I just mentioned. I look at the great strides that we're making in sectors where three, four years ago, we were not big. I mentioned a few quarters ago the award of Propel project and other energy transition projects in the State of New York. Massive project for us. And now National Grid (LON: NG ). Three, four years ago, we were not there. So I was telling our Board this week, the absolute number in organic growth is obviously important. And we're pleased, if you compare orange, with oranges or apples with apples that we grew 6.5% this quarter. But it's the type of growth that we are able to generate in sectors where we were fairly small few years ago I am extremely pleased with the type of award that we are able to secure right now. So that's telling me that we are continuing to diversify the platform. We continue to grow in sectors where we were not a leading firm. And then we continue to capitalize on the sectors where we have a strong presence. And the Proxion acquisition in Finland is a testament or an example of that. Now in the rail sector where we have the leadership franchise around the world, we're going to be able to tackle large projects in Finland. So overall, I'm feeling very good about that. And even though we're going through a conversion, an ERP conversion, we have been able to increase our utilization and we have been able to increase our margin over the recent past. So I feel, as Alain mentioned, our team should be commended for the extraordinary work that has been accomplished recently.

Devin Dodge: Excellent, that's good color. Okay. Second question on PFAS, lots of interest on the back of the EPA releasing some final rules last month.

Alexandre L'Heureux: Yes.

Devin Dodge: Do you view this as an opportunity for WSP? And if so, can you walk us through the services that you provide and where you expect to see the most benefit going forward?

Alexandre L'Heureux: Tremendous opportunities. Perhaps, Alain, you can cover that. But clearly, for us, like any other firms in the space, it's a real opportunity. The rules and the regulation are strict and the requirements will increase demands for our services. So I feel that, over the coming years, we'll have our share, and we'll be winning our share of work in that space. Alain?

Alain Michaud: Yes, definitely positive, Devin, in terms of development. The rules in the U.S. are probably the most strict that we've seen. But I think it bodes well for our expert. We probably have around 500 PFAS expert in the U.S. alone. Our backlog in Q1 has already seen some good level of work. So we're extremely positive about the impact of the new regulation and the flow of work that should come our way given our expertise and profile in the space.

Frederic Bastien: [Foreign Language] Guys, I'd like to circle back on M&A for a bit. And really wondering what has changed from an internal or external standpoint to make you say, ""Hey, okay, now it's time to open up the M&A valve again?""

Alexandre L'Heureux: Yes. If you remember, Frederic I think, it was the last quarter, yes, at the last investor call, I mentioned that we viewed 2023 as a year of consolidation. Last year alone, we grew our top line by over 20%. Yes, not all of this was organic growth, there was a lot of acquisition growth, but we grew our top line by one fifth in one year. So I consider that to be very meaningful and very transformative. So, last year was a year of consolidation, we wanted to extract the value from the platform. We wanted to complete the integration of Golder, we wanted to activate our work on the integration of Wood E&I. So that's why I considered last year, a year of consolidation. This year, we've had a strong start of the year. Mind you, these are not large acquisitions, but are very strategic to us. And yes, we're clearly open for business. We have a strong balance sheet. As I said before, I feel we have substantially derisked the ERP project and transformation. So, I feel that all of the ingredients are now in place for us to continue to grow inorganically and organically.

Frederic Bastien: Thank, super helpful. Next one is perhaps for Alain. We saw better-than-expected margin expansion in the quarter, at least from my standpoint, and that sets you up quite nicely for the rest of the year. Do you anticipate similar gains in future quarters? Or will we see a bit of variability as we build into Q2, Q3 and Q4?

Alain Michaud: Yes. So as Alex said, we are very proud of the lift in Q1. We usually have lower margin expansion in the first quarter of the year, so we are extremely proud about that. We've devoted significant effort on working on all those levers, as you know, Fred, on productivity. We are certainly aiming to push and continue to increase margin in the following quarter. And we're feeling confident about the 65 basis point increase that we have guided for the full year. We'll keep on working hard and pushing hard on improving productivity of the firm.

Frederic Bastien: Okay. But do you expect that to be linear? Or I mean, 65% is a massive improvement. Would that be backend loaded?

Alexandre L'Heureux: You are very persistent. That's the intention, to continue to push in that direction.

Maxim Sytchev: Alex, maybe the first question for you, if I may. In terms of - certainly, it feels like there is a theme emerging when it comes to power. Big win in UK, Spanish acquisition. We are reading that UK will need to [indiscernible] by a factor of seven when it comes to [indiscernible] energy transition. Do you mind maybe expanding a little bit on this important theme and maybe the opportunity potentially in the U.S. and Canada, how to sort of take advantage of all this? Thank you so much.

Alexandre L'Heureux: Yes. Look, you've been following us for a very long time, Max, so you know us inside out. We've always have taken a very disciplined approach in the way we're building our firm. And as I said, the first pillar we started with more than ten years ago was with property and building, then we moved to transportation infrastructure, and we continue to raise the bar in those two sectors. More recently, we said that we wanted to become the leading firm in the green transition, so we build our pillar around Earth and Environment. And now I feel that we are ready to make a big push in the energy transition. So more recently, we've invested a lot in talent, and we invested a lot of effort in growing our presence in that sector. And as I said before, I could not be prouder of the work that has been accomplished. And this strat plan to grow our presence there, I think now we're tackling some of the largest energy transition program in the United States and in the UK, so I'm extremely pleased about that. And you're right in pointing out that our push in Central Europe with a 250-people acquisition in transmission and distribution is another example of our core strategy at this point in time. So yes, we're going to continue to push in that sector.

Maxim Sytchev: I appreciate that, thanks. And then one other follow-up that I have, do you have any update in terms of IIJA and how that funding is flowing through? And how should we think about this in terms of the impact? Thank you.

Alain Michaud: I could take that one, Max. So, the latest number that have been published, there's about 40% of funding that have been deployed. This is April data, and it's up from February data by more than 30%. So we were at 30% deployment in February, 40% in April. So it's moving certainly in the right direction. 40,000 projects have been awarded, funding through the Biden Infrastructure Bill. So that continues to support our thesis around and our confidence around the U.S. And if you combine that with the regulation on PFAS we've covered before, we continue to feel very strong about the U.S. and especially given our leadership position in the transportation business. And I have to say transportation represents currently about two third of all the funding that have been deployed through the bill. So that's good news for us and supports our thesis.

Operator: Thank you. We'll now take the next question, this is from Michael Tupholme from TD Securities. Please go ahead.

Michael Tupholme: This may tie into the last answer you just provided there regarding IIJA, but the 10.3% organic growth in backlog in the Americas that you've highlighted a few times. Can you talk a little bit about the areas that drove that increase in the quarter?

Alexandre L'Heureux: All the sector, Michael. I mean, transportation, property and building, earth and environment, we are seeing growth in those sectors. We've seen growth in power, as I talked about. So at the moment, I feel we are going to continue to grow in those sectors. And one that I would perhaps add as well is advanced manufacturing. We are doing more work in that space, and I expect to continue more and more. So that also is a real opportunity for us to grow and to develop new sectors.

Michael Tupholme: And it doesn't sound like it from your response just now or any of your other comments. But more broadly, when we look across the business from an end market perspective, are there any areas that are looking weaker right now or causing you to be concerned at all?

Alexandre L'Heureux: Are you talking in the Americas or you're talking globally?

Michael Tupholme: Globally, and I don't mean regionally. I mean, I know you've touched on Asia as a - and China regionally. But just from an end market perspective globally, is there anything that you see is slower?

Alexandre L'Heureux: I don't think we can look at our sectors and conclude that things are slowing down to the contrary I feel we're in a good spot right now. But yes, there are some pockets of geographies that are more challenging than others. But for the most part, I feel our top countries are performing well at this point.

Michael Tupholme: Perfect. And then just lastly, looking at the margins in the APAC segment, you did see a decline in EBITDA margins year-over-year in Q1. I see from the commentary that the performance in Asia was the source of that. I guess I'm just wondering how we should think about APAC margins going forward as you move through the year? Is there an opportunity to grow margins? Or how should we be thinking about margins?

Alexandre L'Heureux: Actually, Australia margin profile, we're not reporting the different countries, but just to give you a sense, in Australia, we have seen our margin profile going up, not going down. Equally, New Zealand has been stable. So overall, I think we're feeling good.

Alain Michaud: And if you look at Asia specifically, Q1 last year was a quasi-normal quarter, so the comparison Q1 over Q1 is a little tougher. But if you look sequentially versus Q4, Asia is not significantly moving down. So overall, if you think about Australia and New Zealand, feeling confident about their margin profile improvement for the rest of the year and stabilization in Asia.

Michael Tupholme: Okay, that's helpful. Thank you.

Operator: Thank you. We'll now take the next question. This is from Michael Doumet from Scotiabank. Please go ahead.

Michael Doumet: Hey Alex. You guys discussed productivity again as being a focus in 2024 and when I look at the project margins and the improvement there, obviously great in the first quarter. I can think about that as coming from an increase from a combination of higher price and higher utilization. Is there a way maybe that you can discuss the trend of each? And I am just curious, going forward, where you think there's more room.

Alexandre L'Heureux: Well, we definitely believe there is more room in the years to come. You can always improve. So, we believe there are some geographies and some sectors where the productivity is not where it needs to be as far as we are concerned, number one. And number two, going back perhaps to a question that was asked earlier on this morning, being more selective in the projects that we undertake. WSP, we excel in complex projects. That's where we feel we can do better and we can increase our margin profile. So the type of projects that we undertake is also going to have an impact on our margin profile. So obviously, by selecting projects where we believe we can really raise the bar, provide a better service or a differentiated service will allow us to increase our margin profile. So I would argue that this is all of the above at this point.

Michael Doumet: Okay. No, that makes sense. And then Alex, maybe just turning to M&A, look, you've been here for a long, long time and you've done a lot of deals. We're living in a world where valuations are high and interest rates are high. You would think that maybe one of the two would have given a little bit. But when you look at deals today, do you feel more strongly about the need to drive synergies to get to the appropriate IRR? Or do you still think that there is sufficient value out there, particularly when we're talking about the medium to larger deals?

Alexandre L'Heureux: Yes. Look, it's not the first time we are going through an environment that is challenging. I think you heard me saying that before, you just mentioned, I've been there for a very long time. So we've gone through times where, I remember 2014, the turn - that's ten years ago, but the turnaround in oil and gas and the markets were challenging. But you know what? In those difficult times, there are also some opportunities. So if you recall, at the time, the exchange rate between the U.S. and Canada was one for one. So we were able to acquire Parsons (NYSE: PSN ) Brinckerhoff in a difficult period, where however, from an exchange point of view, we had favorable tailwinds. So, my belief is that in good times and in bad times, you have to be creative and you have to find value in the transaction that you look into. Mind you, you are right. We have to be disciplined. If the interest rate is impacting financial sponsor, I don't see why it would not impact us. So we have to be disciplined in the way we're thinking about the transactions. But for the right acquisition, I am not going to shy away because of the current environment. We need to have a long-term view on transaction and what we're trying to build as a company. So that would be my take at this point in time, is we should not be using the market conditions as an excuse, we should instead push ourselves to be creative and find value.

Michael Doumet: Yes. No, I appreciate those comments. Look, maybe I will ask a third. I am assuming I am the last here. But just as a clarification, should we interpret your reiterating of your guidance is it being unchanged, including the recent acquisition and the favorable FX, or just not updated yet?

Alain Michaud: It's early in the year, Michael, so we didn't feel, given this the impact of the recent acquisition, we didn't feel the need to increase or change our guidance. We'll continue to track that and see, in Q2 and Q3, what we do. But we are feeling equally strong as we felt in March when we issued our guidance with the platform we had at the time. So I think that...

Operator: Thank you. We will now take our next question. This is from Ian Gillies from Stifel. Please go ahead.

Ian Gillies: I just wanted to follow-on some of the questions in and around power and your intention to grow there. I am just curious on how that business or perhaps the ones you've looked at are, in broad strokes, how it stacks up, I guess, maybe against the corporate averages, because one of the great things about growing that Earth and Environment business, it was higher margin - it appears to be higher margin than the corporate average. I am wondering if power tends to have some of the same traits.

Alexandre L'Heureux: Yes, it's a fair assumption. It's a fair assumption. Right now, the world is in dire need of new sources of energy. So I feel - I mentioned a few projects this morning. This has not gone unnoticed for us, and we believe that WSP is uniquely positioned to provide services in that space, because the power space, it's not just about and around connecting new sources of energy to existing grid, there is also a collateral impact on other sectors, such as building, earth and environment and transportation. So we wanted, in a very disciplined way, to build our presence in earth and environment, which we've done since late 2018. But clearly, as you can see and notice, I've been talking about this over the last few quarters, I'm quite keen to continue to diversify our platform and I'm quite keen to continue to grow in sectors where we're not leading. And we have the aspire to become a leading firm.

Ian Gillies: That's incredibly helpful, thanks very much. The other separate question I had, one of the things that's been talked about on prior calls is trying to increase your presence in the U.S. with respect to federal government spending, whether it be through GSAs or other avenues. Is that still a focus? Or is there enough work going on elsewhere that you've shifted priorities?

Alexandre L'Heureux: No. They're not mutually exclusive, that's the way I would answer the question. I think we can continue to push. I talked about power, but I mentioned advanced manufacturing. I think there's real opportunities for us to grow in that space organically and potentially through acquisitions over time. So, I think these are new sources or new opportunities for WSP, and we intend to take advantage of them.

Ian Gillies: Okay, thanks very helpful. Thanks very much. I will turn it back over.

Alexandre L'Heureux: Okay, Ian.

Operator: Thank you. And we have one more question. And last question today is from Sabahat Khan from RBC. Please go ahead.

Sabahat Khan: Great. Thanks and good morning. I guess just hearing a little about where you see the demand, whether it's by region and market, how are you balancing these demand indicators against hiring and then trying to just maintain the right level of utilization and drive margins? Just trying to understand - the demand environment still seems like it's in a reasonable place, labor situation is somewhat better than a few years ago, but just curious how you are deciding on the right number of employees to onboard while also considering M&A there? Any color would be helpful.

Alexandre L'Heureux: Yes. Well, I'm glad you bring this topic, Saba. I mean, if I look at our trailing 12 months numbers, our turnover is historical low levels, meaning that we have a lower turnover in our last 12 months than we've had in pre-pandemic levels. So that, combined with our increased productivity and extracting the value from our platform, we are obviously - this is a balancing act. But recently, we have chosen to work on the engagement of our people, reducing our turnover, increasing productivity, rather than being out there and obviously hire just for the sake of hiring. You look at the fee per employees that we are generating and the curve that you are going to witness if you do the math, over the last ten years, I mean, that's something I'm really focused on. I want to make sure that - and I am saying that with all due respect to our employees that are listening to the call, but I want us to do more with less. I want us to be in a position to deliver more with less. So I want us to run a very, very tight ship and a very, very efficient platform. So that's the mindset right now.

Sabahat Khan: Okay, great. And then, I guess, with some of these moving parts about end market growth and the IIJA, if we look particularly at the U.S. market, do you expect any meaningful shift, putting M&A aside, any meaningful shift in your end market mix? I think you're large in transportation, that's a big part of the IIJA. Should we expect more of the same? Do you expect any evolution in where your business comes from over the next two to three years in the U.S. market?

Alexandre L'Heureux: Well, as I said, I think there are untapped territories for us. So I mentioned power, advanced manufacturing. I feel we could do more there. We can always do more in water, which we're going to continue to grow. But there's so much work in the property and building sector. There is so much more that we can do here. And transportation, we're subscale in many states and many parts of the U.S. So I do feel that we have tremendous opportunities pretty much in all sectors. But as I mentioned today, there are some sectors that I would like to grow because I feel we're too subscale at this point in time.

Sabahat Khan: Okay. Then one last quick one, maybe for Alain, I guess a lot of discussion on this call around M&A with the scale of the company growing and the cash flow base growing, should we expect any other areas of focus within capital allocation besides M&A over the next one to two years? Thanks.

Alexandre L'Heureux: I think you - I will take this one up and Alain can complement. But yes, as part of our next strategic cycle, clearly, we are going to continue to invest in R&D and digital, definitely.

Operator: Thank you. And there are no further questions at this time, so I'll hand back to the speakers for any closing comments. Thank you.

Alexandre L'Heureux: Well, thank you for attending the call today. Thank you for your support. As a friendly reminder, we will be holding our Annual Shareholder Meeting at 11:00 Eastern Time today. So, we are encouraging you to attend in person or virtually. And we look forward to updating you in Q2. On that note, I would like to wish you continued success and a great starting of the summer. Thank you very much.

Operator: Thank you. This does conclude the conference for today.

(WSP) has announced strong financial results for the first quarter of 2024, marked by significant growth in key performance indicators. The company reported organic net revenue growth of 4.6%, an 8% increase in EBITDA, and a 13% rise in earnings per share. WSP's backlog reached $14.2 billion, equivalent to 11.8 months of revenues, and the Americas segment saw a 10.3% organic growth in backlog over the past year. The company is executing its strategy to enhance its margin profile, with a goal of at least a 150 basis-point improvement as part of its three-year strategic plan.

WSP's strategic acquisitions and the successful implementation of its global ERP system in the UK have positioned the company for continued success. The firm's commitment to productivity and efficiency, along with its confident outlook for various global markets, underscores its strategic direction. With a focus on selective bidding and margin expansion, WSP is poised to leverage its strong backlog and capitalize on growth opportunities across its diverse portfolio of services. The company's Annual Shareholder Meeting, scheduled for later in the day, will provide further insights into its strategy and operations.

Operator: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to WSP's First Quarter 2024 Results Conference Call. I would now like to turn the meeting over to Quentin Weber, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Mr. Weber.

Quentin Weber: Good morning. We hope you are all doing well, and thank you for joining our call today. We will be discussing our Q1 2024 performance followed by a Q&A Session. Joining us today this morning are Alexandre L'Heureux, our President and CEO; and Alain Michaud, our CFO. Please note that this call is also accessible on our website via webcast. During the call, we will be making some forward-looking statements and actual results could differ from those expressed or implied. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any of these statements. Relevant factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those forward-looking statements are listed in our MD&A for the quarter that ended March 31, 2024, which can be found on SEDAR and on our website. In addition, during the call, we may refer to certain non-IFRS measures. These measures are also defined in our MD&A for the quarter that ended March 31, 2024. Our MD&A includes reconciliations of non-IFRS measures to the most directly comparable IFRS measures. Management believes that these non-IFRS measures provide useful information to investors regarding the corporation's financial condition and results of operation as they provide additional key metrics of its performance. These non-IFRS measures are not recognized under IFRS, do not have any standardized meaning described under IFRS and may differ from similarly named measures as reported by other issuers, and accordingly, may not be comparable. These measures should not be viewed as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with IFRS. I will now turn the call over to Alexandre.

Alexandre L'Heureux: Thank you, Quentin. And good morning, everyone. I am pleased with our first quarter performance as it sets a solid foundation for the remainder of 2024 and reflects the positive momentum we continue to experience in our business. Globally, our backlog and pipeline of opportunities remains robust across all sectors, especially in the Americas, which recorded a double-digit organic backlog growth. In Q1, we delivered strong results in line with our expectations, and our top line and profitability continued to trend positively. During the quarter, we continued to future-proof WSP, over-indexing three core elements. First, we focus on optimizing our global platform to unlock even more possibilities and drive sustained organic growth and margin improvement. Second, we added expertise and new clients through a number of acquisitions completed in the first quarter. And third, we remain dedicated to being the premier partner to our clients and our communities. And let me review each in further detail. On the - optimization front, I'm sorry, we elevated further our outstanding platform, seizing productivity opportunities and bolstering project performance. These efforts are allowing us to already report an impressive increase of 50 basis points in adjusted EBITDA margin when compared to the first quarter of 2023. Moreover, it provides us with the confidence to deliver on our three-year strategic plan ambitions to increase our margin profile by at least 150 basis points. We also concluded the go-live of our global ERP in the UK. This region is the third key geography to onboard to the platform after Canada and the U.S., and we now have over 70% of our EBITDA converted and more than 50% of our employees on the new platform. This is one of the largest transformation we have undergone as a business, and it covers the modernization of our sales, procurement, project management, HR and finance functions. We are already beginning to reap the benefits of this initiative through enhanced business intelligence capabilities, the exchange of best practices, the leveraging of insights and data, and increased collaboration. Also, we are pleased to report that our deployment schedule is on plan and on budget. Since the beginning of the year, we have continued to bolster our platform by deploying capital towards strategic acquisitions, and we have announced four transactions recently. The first, Communica, is one of Canada's leading indigenous and stakeholder engagement and information management consulting firms. It is recognized for its collaborative approach and its ability to deliver authentic, open and transparent stakeholder and wider community engagement, including with indigenous - sorry -communities. This acquisition reinforces WSP's commitment to delivering impactful community projects and enhances its ability to respond to the increasing demand for stakeholder engagement and information management services. The second is Proxion, one of Finland's largest rail consultancies, that offers a range of railway and railway system design services, including traffic and energy services as well as safety and security expertise. Proxion adds key rail expertise in Finland to WSP's transport and infrastructure capabilities in the Nordics, and strengthens our market position and ability to lead large-scale projects in the Finnish market. By combining our respective expertise and teams, we aim to elevate our capabilities, broaden our portfolio and strengthen our market position in the country. The third is 1A Ingenieros, a Spanish consulting firm in transmission and distribution, operating mainly in the power and energy sector, which will enhance WSP capabilities in Spain, creating a strong multidisciplinary business in the region with a balanced portfolio in our core end markets. It will also increase our local workforce by approximately 70% and expand our geographical presence in the country by adding four new regions. Through this acquisition, WSP will be positioned as one of the leading international engineering firms in Spain. The fourth is AKF Group, a specialized mechanical, electrical firm that design complex health care, science and technology and mission-critical facilities. AKF enables us to strengthen our scale in the U.S. and expand our expertise within property and building by 20% in the U.S. alone. Through this acquisition, we aim to enhance our technical practice and boost our capabilities and presence in several essential high-end demand markets, and in a variety of sectors, such as corporate, cultural, health care, education, hospitality, retail, science and technology. The sustained expansion of our platform is attributable to strategic capital deployment and organic growth, but also to nurturing our internal talent and resources. This is why I am proud that we continue to focus on internal promotions and have set high ambitions in our strategic action plan. In 2023, we filled over 75% of our global leadership roles with internal candidates. And since the beginning of the fiscal year, another example was Joe Sczurko being promoted to the role of President of our business in the United States. Joe brings decades of invaluable leadership experience and a deep understanding of the industry and evolving client needs. I'm thrilled to see him and many others take on new challenges. The third core element of focus in the quarter was and will continue to be elevating the standard in client experience and being a premier partner to communities. We are making great strides on this front as witnessed by some recent project wins. Today, I have selected three that best illustrate this. In the UK, we have confirm our work on one of the largest programs ever won by WSP in the UK in terms of scale, revenue, length and complexity, which is aligned with our ambition to stay at the forefront of the energy transition and brings exciting new career opportunities for our talent. The Great Grid Upgrade is a major program to deliver electricity transmission infrastructure across the United Kingdom and enable 50 gigawatts of network capacity by 2030. It is a critical step in the pathway to net zero to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and enable the shift towards renewable energy. WSP has been appointed as one of seven industry partners tasked with providing over £9 billion worth of design and construction for national grids over 12 years. Our scope consists of providing professional services across the whole delivery life cycle, from early stage scheme development to environmental services, planning, consent and detailed design. This win is well aligned with our ambitions to stay at the forefront of the energy transition and bring exciting new career opportunities for our talent. In Los Angeles, we have also signed a new $100 million U.S. program management contract to support LA County Metro on the 15-mile light rail extension to Southeast Los Angeles County, which connect underserved communities from ten cities to downtown Los Angeles. The project is important as it broadens the scope of WSP traditional design services for this important customer. During the selection process, WSP scored highest amongst competing firms, achieving the best score in each of the major categories: firm experience and capabilities, key personnel and project approach. WSP has been the leader in the rail and transit sector in the U.S. since the design of the New York City subway system in the 1880s, and we fully intend to remain in the top position. In Australia, we are supporting the Queensland Train Manufacturing Program, which aims to deliver 65 new six-car passenger trains in time for the Brisbane 2032 Olympic and Paralympic games. This initiative is a pivotal support system for the region's growing population and economy. The program will not only boost Queensland's jobs market, but also offers substantial training and development opportunities. WSP provides civil, structural, rail, geotechnical, building and power design services for the greenfield facility. These three examples are a testament to the types of projects that allow us to partner with like-minded clients and deliver projects that profoundly enhance and impact the lives of communities. On that note, I will now invite Alain to review our financial results.

Alain Michaud: Thanks, Alex. I am very pleased this morning to report on our strong results for the first quarter of 2024, where we've seen net revenue grow organically by 4.6%, EBITDA by 8% and earnings per share by 13%. Let me elaborate further on each of these points, starting with our top line. For the first quarter, revenues and net revenue reached $3.6 billion and $2.8 billion, up 2.7% and 4.7%, respectively, compared to the first quarter of 2023. We achieved net revenue organic growth of approximately 6.5% when normalized for the same number of billable days compared to Q1 2023. As stated in our outlook issued in March, these additional billable days will reverse in Q4. Backlog as of March 30, 2024, stood at $14.2 billion, representing 11.8 months of revenues. And of interest, as Alex stated, the Americas reportable segment achieved organic backlog growth of 10.3% over the last 12 months. Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter reached $446 million, up 7.9% compared to the first quarter of 2023. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter reached 16%, an increase of 50 basis points when compared to the first quarter of 2023. And for the last 12 months, our EBITDA margin now stands at 17.7%. This increase is mainly attributable to our continued focus on productivity, as evidenced by a reduction in our personnel costs as a percentage of net revenues. For the quarter, adjusted net earnings reached $194 million or $1.55 per share, up approximately 13% compared to the first quarter or 2023. Free cash outflow reached $125 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, better than the same period last year and slightly of expectation. Our DSO stood at 76 days as of the end of March, stable and unchanged when compared to December 31, 2023. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio stood at 1.6 times, within management's target range of one to two times. As we progress through our business transformation journey, we continue to aim for 100% conversion of net earnings to free cash flow for 2024. In conclusion, we're off to a great start with a solid set of results, a strong operating plan and healthy market conditions. We are therefore reiterating our outlook with confidence. Now back to you, Alex.

Alexandre L'Heureux: Well, thank you, Alain. Given our prudent start of 2023, compared to our solid start in 2024 and given our progress made in the current strategic cycle, we are confident in the future. We welcomed approximately 10,000 employees through 15 acquisitions since the beginning of our plan, and notably, for since the beginning of the current year. We continue to have a promising pipeline of growth opportunities, a solid balance sheet and looking at the rest of 2024, we are moving forward with confidence. Our focus remains on delivering on our ambitions bolstered by healthy market conditions. Our shared vision and collective efforts are the cornerstone of our success, and I am confident they will continue to guide us on our journey to be recognized as the undisputed leader in our industry. On a final note, I would encourage you to explore our 2024 Global ESG Report which will be published shortly. You are also invited to take part in our Annual General Meeting which will be held in person and virtually at 11 a.m. Eastern Standard Time today. More details can be found on our website. And I will now open the line for questions.

Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. We will now take our first question. First question is from the line of Benoît Poirier from Desjardins. Please go ahead.

Benoît Poirier: Yes, good morning, Alain. Good morning Alex. And congratulations for the strong start.

Benoît Poirier: Yes. Just in terms of headcount, you added about 700 people so far this year. Obviously, you've been through four M&A transactions. So I was just curious to know how many people came from acquisition? And what's your expectation for the remainder of the year in light of your growth trajectory? And also, if you could comment about the greatest opportunities you still see from the productivity improvement standpoint.

Alexandre L'Heureux: Well, look, I think if I start with M&A, we have a very good start. I'm very pleased with where we stand at this point in time and the pipeline is healthy, so I'm confident that the remainder of the year should bear fruit. So I think, on that front, I'm feeling good that we should have a good year in 2024. Perhaps, Alain, you want to comment on headcount?

Alain Michaud: Yes. So on headcount, Benoît, with the Communica and Proxion acquisition in Q1, we've added about 200 people. Our focus is, as we've discussed many times in 2023 and at the start of 2024, we've been heavily engaged on maximizing the productivity of our business. So, headcount growth is important, but it's a balancing act, delivering also on increased productivity and efficiency. So, we are in line with our budget in terms of growth of headcount. And for the remainder of the year, we intend to continue on a similar path of maximizing our productivity.

Benoît Poirier: Okay.

Alexandre L'Heureux: You need to remember that the last two acquisitions have been completed in Q2.

Alain Michaud: That's right, beginning of Q2.

Benoît Poirier: Yes. Yes. Okay. That's great color. And some of your peers mentioned weakness in the Chinese housing market as well as in the UK, where one player proceeded to some cut headcount in their transportation division. I know China is not material for you, but I was wondering if there was any update and whether you were seeing anything similar.

Alexandre L'Heureux: No. Benoît - I mean, actually yes. I think we've consistently been saying over the last three or four quarters that Asia is challenging. There's no doubt about that. Having said all that, as you just mentioned, Mainland China for us, it's 300 people out of 67. So for us, it's de minimis. As it relates to the UK market, we are not seeing what has been perhaps described by others. The market is - we are feeling good about our performance. We are feeling extremely good around our recent win of a national grid which would provide good organic growth for the business for years to come. So overall, I'm extremely pleased with our performance in the UK market.

Operator: Thank you. We will now take our next question. This is from the line of Chris Murray from ATB Capital Markets. Please go ahead.

Chris Murray: Yes, thanks. Good morning. Just really quick, just looking at the backlog in Canada, the organic number was actually slightly negative this quarter. Just wondering if there's anything going on, or is this sort of a temporary thing? If you can just give us more color on maybe the reason for the - for it being kind of flat to down?

Alain Michaud: Yes, Chris, if anything, we feel extremely confident with the backlog in Canada and the market condition, it's mostly timing related, the ins and outs of a larger job. Underlying business is performing quite well and the backlog is solid. So no issue in Canada. Same comment for the Americas for that matter. And across the map...

Alexandre L'Heureux: I am feeling very, very good about Canada at this point.

Chris Murray: All right. No, that's helpful. And then just following on maybe your comments about the ERP system, so congratulations on getting to 70% complete. But thinking maybe over the next year or two, what's left to be done on this program? And is it fair to think that it should be substantially complete by the end of this fiscal year?

Alain Michaud: Well, currently, as Alex said, 70% of our EBITDA. So Canada, U.S. and UK is done. And when we reflect that what we've achieved since the beginning of the year, it's 25,000 and more that have been onboarded on the platform. So we're extremely proud of that and proud of our team that have devoted significant effort on that front. We are now moving to the East, and there is other region to be done, the Nordics, Australia, New Zealand. So, I think it's more 2025 calendar year that we will see the majority of our business into one platform. That's the intention, Chris.

Alexandre L'Heureux: The way, Chris, I am thinking about it and the way I think you should view this is, is we have - I'd like to think, and I'm saying that in a very - I'm obviously cautious in the way I'm saying it. But I feel we have substantially derisked this program at this point in time with our three largest countries on the platform, with 70% of our profit on the platform. However, we are operating in 60 countries. So the remainder 30% will take a bit more time, but we're highly confident that things are going to go well and they are going to be smooth. What I am especially proud of is, and you may have noticed it in our numbers, yes, the DSOs have increased slightly. But given the sheer task that we had to go through, I'm very proud that we kept our DSO stable, and I feel it's only going to improve from now.

Operator: Thank you. We'll now take our next question. [Operator Instructions] This is from the line of Jacob Bout from CIBC. Please go ahead.

Jacob Bout: Yes, I had a question just on M&A. I know you are saying that the pipeline looks pretty strong. But maybe you could talk a bit about how the pipeline is looking for the mid- to larger-sized acquisitions. And then my second question, just on the M&A, what the margin profile of recent acquisitions look like.

Alexandre L'Heureux: Yes. Margin acquisition of the acquisition we just - the margin, sorry, of the acquisition we just completed are fairly similar to our margin profile at this point in time. However, we continue to believe that we can improve the margin profile of those firms as soon as they - we are in a position to integrate them into our platform. So, feeling very good about this, Jacob. Look, around mid- to larger-size acquisition, I think, I've said that in numerous occasions in the past, it's extremely difficult to time acquisition. Oftentimes, it takes many years to convince a firm to join your ranks. It takes a lot of nurturing. What I can tell you is that we are - I continue to have formal and informal discussions with smaller-size, medium-size and larger-size acquisitions. I cannot guarantee you when we are going to complete these. But what I can tell you is that I am encouraged by the discussions that I am having right now.

Jacob Bout: Okay, that's fair. Maybe just going back to backlog and just looking specifically at APAC. It's down organically year-on-year, talked a bit about China, but how about Australia and New Zealand? I know you called out the timing of some projects there, but are you expecting a slowdown or is this just all timing in your view?

Alexandre L'Heureux: I think in New Zealand with the recent election, I think, there has been a pause, like any governments. Now I think it's more center-right government and took a pause on infrastructure spending. We expect that to change and resume in due course. Are we overly concerned by that? No. I think we're calm when things are hot and we are calm when things are cooling off a little bit because we believe this is timing and infrastructure needs are needed. Same with Australia. We've experienced double-digit organic growth for, I think, two years now. So obviously, we're starting from a higher base, but the activity level is good. We have a very strong business. We have a very strong team. So I'm positive in the longer term for that region. And yes, Asia, as I said earlier on today, it's been challenging and I believe will continue to be challenging for some time. Thankfully, for us, this is a small part of our business.

Operator: Thank you. We'll now take our next question. This is from Devin Dodge from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.

Devin Dodge: A couple of questions, maybe not so much related to Q1, but maybe longer term, but look, the demand environment is really quite strong across many of your regions. How do you think about the balance between pursuing the growth opportunities that are available and being more selective in your bidding activity to drive margin expansion?

Alexandre L'Heureux: Well, this is a balancing act, as you just mentioned, right? If I look where we are today as a company, WSP, I look at the brand awareness of the company, I look at the type of projects that we are now in the position to tackle as a prime designer or prime consultant, and I compare that to where we were five, seven, eight, nine, ten years ago. We are in a different space. Again, I mentioned and I highlighted three projects this morning that is a testament of what I just mentioned. I look at the great strides that we're making in sectors where three, four years ago, we were not big. I mentioned a few quarters ago the award of Propel project and other energy transition projects in the State of New York. Massive project for us. And now National Grid (LON:NG). Three, four years ago, we were not there. So I was telling our Board this week, the absolute number in organic growth is obviously important. And we're pleased, if you compare orange, with oranges or apples with apples that we grew 6.5% this quarter. But it's the type of growth that we are able to generate in sectors where we were fairly small few years ago I am extremely pleased with the type of award that we are able to secure right now. So that's telling me that we are continuing to diversify the platform. We continue to grow in sectors where we were not a leading firm. And then we continue to capitalize on the sectors where we have a strong presence. And the Proxion acquisition in Finland is a testament or an example of that. Now in the rail sector where we have the leadership franchise around the world, we're going to be able to tackle large projects in Finland. So overall, I'm feeling very good about that. And even though we're going through a conversion, an ERP conversion, we have been able to increase our utilization and we have been able to increase our margin over the recent past. So I feel, as Alain mentioned, our team should be commended for the extraordinary work that has been accomplished recently.

Devin Dodge: Excellent, that's good color. Okay. Second question on PFAS, lots of interest on the back of the EPA releasing some final rules last month.

Alexandre L'Heureux: Yes.

Devin Dodge: Do you view this as an opportunity for WSP? And if so, can you walk us through the services that you provide and where you expect to see the most benefit going forward?

Alexandre L'Heureux: Tremendous opportunities. Perhaps, Alain, you can cover that. But clearly, for us, like any other firms in the space, it's a real opportunity. The rules and the regulation are strict and the requirements will increase demands for our services. So I feel that, over the coming years, we'll have our share, and we'll be winning our share of work in that space. Alain?

Alain Michaud: Yes, definitely positive, Devin, in terms of development. The rules in the U.S. are probably the most strict that we've seen. But I think it bodes well for our expert. We probably have around 500 PFAS expert in the U.S. alone. Our backlog in Q1 has already seen some good level of work. So we're extremely positive about the impact of the new regulation and the flow of work that should come our way given our expertise and profile in the space.

Operator: Thank you. We'll now take our next question, this is from Frederic Bastien from Raymond James. Please go ahead.

Alexandre L'Heureux: [Foreign Language]

Frederic Bastien: [Foreign Language] Guys, I'd like to circle back on M&A for a bit. And really wondering what has changed from an internal or external standpoint to make you say, ""Hey, okay, now it's time to open up the M&A valve again?""

Alexandre L'Heureux: Yes. If you remember, Frederic I think, it was the last quarter, yes, at the last investor call, I mentioned that we viewed 2023 as a year of consolidation. Last year alone, we grew our top line by over 20%. Yes, not all of this was organic growth, there was a lot of acquisition growth, but we grew our top line by one fifth in one year. So I consider that to be very meaningful and very transformative. So, last year was a year of consolidation, we wanted to extract the value from the platform. We wanted to complete the integration of Golder, we wanted to activate our work on the integration of Wood E&I. So that's why I considered last year, a year of consolidation. This year, we've had a strong start of the year. Mind you, these are not large acquisitions, but are very strategic to us. And yes, we're clearly open for business. We have a strong balance sheet. As I said before, I feel we have substantially derisked the ERP project and transformation. So, I feel that all of the ingredients are now in place for us to continue to grow inorganically and organically.

Frederic Bastien: Thank, super helpful. Next one is perhaps for Alain. We saw better-than-expected margin expansion in the quarter, at least from my standpoint, and that sets you up quite nicely for the rest of the year. Do you anticipate similar gains in future quarters? Or will we see a bit of variability as we build into Q2, Q3 and Q4?

Alain Michaud: Yes. So as Alex said, we are very proud of the lift in Q1. We usually have lower margin expansion in the first quarter of the year, so we are extremely proud about that. We've devoted significant effort on working on all those levers, as you know, Fred, on productivity. We are certainly aiming to push and continue to increase margin in the following quarter. And we're feeling confident about the 65 basis point increase that we have guided for the full year. We'll keep on working hard and pushing hard on improving productivity of the firm.

Frederic Bastien: Okay. But do you expect that to be linear? Or I mean, 65% is a massive improvement. Would that be backend loaded?

Alexandre L'Heureux: You are very persistent. That's the intention, to continue to push in that direction.

Operator: Thank you. We'll now take the next question. This is from Maxim Sytchev from NBF. Please go ahead.

Maxim Sytchev: Alex, maybe the first question for you, if I may. In terms of - certainly, it feels like there is a theme emerging when it comes to power. Big win in UK, Spanish acquisition. We are reading that UK will need to [indiscernible] by a factor of seven when it comes to [indiscernible] energy transition. Do you mind maybe expanding a little bit on this important theme and maybe the opportunity potentially in the U.S. and Canada, how to sort of take advantage of all this? Thank you so much.

Alexandre L'Heureux: Yes. Look, you've been following us for a very long time, Max, so you know us inside out. We've always have taken a very disciplined approach in the way we're building our firm. And as I said, the first pillar we started with more than ten years ago was with property and building, then we moved to transportation infrastructure, and we continue to raise the bar in those two sectors. More recently, we said that we wanted to become the leading firm in the green transition, so we build our pillar around Earth and Environment. And now I feel that we are ready to make a big push in the energy transition. So more recently, we've invested a lot in talent, and we invested a lot of effort in growing our presence in that sector. And as I said before, I could not be prouder of the work that has been accomplished. And this strat plan to grow our presence there, I think now we're tackling some of the largest energy transition program in the United States and in the UK, so I'm extremely pleased about that. And you're right in pointing out that our push in Central Europe with a 250-people acquisition in transmission and distribution is another example of our core strategy at this point in time. So yes, we're going to continue to push in that sector.

Maxim Sytchev: I appreciate that, thanks. And then one other follow-up that I have, do you have any update in terms of IIJA and how that funding is flowing through? And how should we think about this in terms of the impact? Thank you.

Alain Michaud: I could take that one, Max. So, the latest number that have been published, there's about 40% of funding that have been deployed. This is April data, and it's up from February data by more than 30%. So we were at 30% deployment in February, 40% in April. So it's moving certainly in the right direction. 40,000 projects have been awarded, funding through the Biden Infrastructure Bill. So that continues to support our thesis around and our confidence around the U.S. And if you combine that with the regulation on PFAS we've covered before, we continue to feel very strong about the U.S. and especially given our leadership position in the transportation business. And I have to say transportation represents currently about two third of all the funding that have been deployed through the bill. So that's good news for us and supports our thesis.

Operator: Thank you. We'll now take the next question, this is from Michael Tupholme from TD Securities. Please go ahead.

Michael Tupholme: This may tie into the last answer you just provided there regarding IIJA, but the 10.3% organic growth in backlog in the Americas that you've highlighted a few times. Can you talk a little bit about the areas that drove that increase in the quarter?

Alexandre L'Heureux: All the sector, Michael. I mean, transportation, property and building, earth and environment, we are seeing growth in those sectors. We've seen growth in power, as I talked about. So at the moment, I feel we are going to continue to grow in those sectors. And one that I would perhaps add as well is advanced manufacturing. We are doing more work in that space, and I expect to continue more and more. So that also is a real opportunity for us to grow and to develop new sectors.

Michael Tupholme: And it doesn't sound like it from your response just now or any of your other comments. But more broadly, when we look across the business from an end market perspective, are there any areas that are looking weaker right now or causing you to be concerned at all?

Alexandre L'Heureux: Are you talking in the Americas or you're talking globally?

Michael Tupholme: Globally, and I don't mean regionally. I mean, I know you've touched on Asia as a - and China regionally. But just from an end market perspective globally, is there anything that you see is slower?

Alexandre L'Heureux: I don't think we can look at our sectors and conclude that things are slowing down to the contrary I feel we're in a good spot right now. But yes, there are some pockets of geographies that are more challenging than others. But for the most part, I feel our top countries are performing well at this point.

Michael Tupholme: Perfect. And then just lastly, looking at the margins in the APAC segment, you did see a decline in EBITDA margins year-over-year in Q1. I see from the commentary that the performance in Asia was the source of that. I guess I'm just wondering how we should think about APAC margins going forward as you move through the year? Is there an opportunity to grow margins? Or how should we be thinking about margins?

Alexandre L'Heureux: Actually, Australia margin profile, we're not reporting the different countries, but just to give you a sense, in Australia, we have seen our margin profile going up, not going down. Equally, New Zealand has been stable. So overall, I think we're feeling good.

Alain Michaud: And if you look at Asia specifically, Q1 last year was a quasi-normal quarter, so the comparison Q1 over Q1 is a little tougher. But if you look sequentially versus Q4, Asia is not significantly moving down. So overall, if you think about Australia and New Zealand, feeling confident about their margin profile improvement for the rest of the year and stabilization in Asia.

Michael Tupholme: Okay, that's helpful. Thank you.

Operator: Thank you. We'll now take the next question. This is from Michael Doumet from Scotiabank. Please go ahead.

Michael Doumet: Hey Alex. You guys discussed productivity again as being a focus in 2024 and when I look at the project margins and the improvement there, obviously great in the first quarter. I can think about that as coming from an increase from a combination of higher price and higher utilization. Is there a way maybe that you can discuss the trend of each? And I am just curious, going forward, where you think there's more room.

Alexandre L'Heureux: Well, we definitely believe there is more room in the years to come. You can always improve. So, we believe there are some geographies and some sectors where the productivity is not where it needs to be as far as we are concerned, number one. And number two, going back perhaps to a question that was asked earlier on this morning, being more selective in the projects that we undertake. WSP, we excel in complex projects. That's where we feel we can do better and we can increase our margin profile. So the type of projects that we undertake is also going to have an impact on our margin profile. So obviously, by selecting projects where we believe we can really raise the bar, provide a better service or a differentiated service will allow us to increase our margin profile. So I would argue that this is all of the above at this point.

Michael Doumet: Okay. No, that makes sense. And then Alex, maybe just turning to M&A, look, you've been here for a long, long time and you've done a lot of deals. We're living in a world where valuations are high and interest rates are high. You would think that maybe one of the two would have given a little bit. But when you look at deals today, do you feel more strongly about the need to drive synergies to get to the appropriate IRR? Or do you still think that there is sufficient value out there, particularly when we're talking about the medium to larger deals?

Alexandre L'Heureux: Yes. Look, it's not the first time we are going through an environment that is challenging. I think you heard me saying that before, you just mentioned, I've been there for a very long time. So we've gone through times where, I remember 2014, the turn - that's ten years ago, but the turnaround in oil and gas and the markets were challenging. But you know what? In those difficult times, there are also some opportunities. So if you recall, at the time, the exchange rate between the U.S. and Canada was one for one. So we were able to acquire Parsons (NYSE:PSN) Brinckerhoff in a difficult period, where however, from an exchange point of view, we had favorable tailwinds. So, my belief is that in good times and in bad times, you have to be creative and you have to find value in the transaction that you look into. Mind you, you are right. We have to be disciplined. If the interest rate is impacting financial sponsor, I don't see why it would not impact us. So we have to be disciplined in the way we're thinking about the transactions. But for the right acquisition, I am not going to shy away because of the current environment. We need to have a long-term view on transaction and what we're trying to build as a company. So that would be my take at this point in time, is we should not be using the market conditions as an excuse, we should instead push ourselves to be creative and find value.

Michael Doumet: Yes. No, I appreciate those comments. Look, maybe I will ask a third. I am assuming I am the last here. But just as a clarification, should we interpret your reiterating of your guidance is it being unchanged, including the recent acquisition and the favorable FX, or just not updated yet?

Alain Michaud: It's early in the year, Michael, so we didn't feel, given this the impact of the recent acquisition, we didn't feel the need to increase or change our guidance. We'll continue to track that and see, in Q2 and Q3, what we do. But we are feeling equally strong as we felt in March when we issued our guidance with the platform we had at the time. So I think that...

Operator: Thank you. We will now take our next question. This is from Ian Gillies from Stifel. Please go ahead.

Ian Gillies: I just wanted to follow-on some of the questions in and around power and your intention to grow there. I am just curious on how that business or perhaps the ones you've looked at are, in broad strokes, how it stacks up, I guess, maybe against the corporate averages, because one of the great things about growing that Earth and Environment business, it was higher margin - it appears to be higher margin than the corporate average. I am wondering if power tends to have some of the same traits.

Alexandre L'Heureux: Yes, it's a fair assumption. It's a fair assumption. Right now, the world is in dire need of new sources of energy. So I feel - I mentioned a few projects this morning. This has not gone unnoticed for us, and we believe that WSP is uniquely positioned to provide services in that space, because the power space, it's not just about and around connecting new sources of energy to existing grid, there is also a collateral impact on other sectors, such as building, earth and environment and transportation. So we wanted, in a very disciplined way, to build our presence in earth and environment, which we've done since late 2018. But clearly, as you can see and notice, I've been talking about this over the last few quarters, I'm quite keen to continue to diversify our platform and I'm quite keen to continue to grow in sectors where we're not leading. And we have the aspire to become a leading firm.

Ian Gillies: That's incredibly helpful, thanks very much. The other separate question I had, one of the things that's been talked about on prior calls is trying to increase your presence in the U.S. with respect to federal government spending, whether it be through GSAs or other avenues. Is that still a focus? Or is there enough work going on elsewhere that you've shifted priorities?

Alexandre L'Heureux: No. They're not mutually exclusive, that's the way I would answer the question. I think we can continue to push. I talked about power, but I mentioned advanced manufacturing. I think there's real opportunities for us to grow in that space organically and potentially through acquisitions over time. So, I think these are new sources or new opportunities for WSP, and we intend to take advantage of them.

Ian Gillies: Okay, thanks very helpful. Thanks very much. I will turn it back over.

Alexandre L'Heureux: Okay, Ian.

Operator: Thank you. And we have one more question. And last question today is from Sabahat Khan from RBC. Please go ahead.

Sabahat Khan: Great. Thanks and good morning. I guess just hearing a little about where you see the demand, whether it's by region and market, how are you balancing these demand indicators against hiring and then trying to just maintain the right level of utilization and drive margins? Just trying to understand - the demand environment still seems like it's in a reasonable place, labor situation is somewhat better than a few years ago, but just curious how you are deciding on the right number of employees to onboard while also considering M&A there? Any color would be helpful.

Alexandre L'Heureux: Yes. Well, I'm glad you bring this topic, Saba. I mean, if I look at our trailing 12 months numbers, our turnover is historical low levels, meaning that we have a lower turnover in our last 12 months than we've had in pre-pandemic levels. So that, combined with our increased productivity and extracting the value from our platform, we are obviously - this is a balancing act. But recently, we have chosen to work on the engagement of our people, reducing our turnover, increasing productivity, rather than being out there and obviously hire just for the sake of hiring. You look at the fee per employees that we are generating and the curve that you are going to witness if you do the math, over the last ten years, I mean, that's something I'm really focused on. I want to make sure that - and I am saying that with all due respect to our employees that are listening to the call, but I want us to do more with less. I want us to be in a position to deliver more with less. So I want us to run a very, very tight ship and a very, very efficient platform. So that's the mindset right now.

Sabahat Khan: Okay, great. And then, I guess, with some of these moving parts about end market growth and the IIJA, if we look particularly at the U.S. market, do you expect any meaningful shift, putting M&A aside, any meaningful shift in your end market mix? I think you're large in transportation, that's a big part of the IIJA. Should we expect more of the same? Do you expect any evolution in where your business comes from over the next two to three years in the U.S. market?

Alexandre L'Heureux: Well, as I said, I think there are untapped territories for us. So I mentioned power, advanced manufacturing. I feel we could do more there. We can always do more in water, which we're going to continue to grow. But there's so much work in the property and building sector. There is so much more that we can do here. And transportation, we're subscale in many states and many parts of the U.S. So I do feel that we have tremendous opportunities pretty much in all sectors. But as I mentioned today, there are some sectors that I would like to grow because I feel we're too subscale at this point in time.

Sabahat Khan: Okay. Then one last quick one, maybe for Alain, I guess a lot of discussion on this call around M&A with the scale of the company growing and the cash flow base growing, should we expect any other areas of focus within capital allocation besides M&A over the next one to two years? Thanks.

Alexandre L'Heureux: I think you - I will take this one up and Alain can complement. But yes, as part of our next strategic cycle, clearly, we are going to continue to invest in R&D and digital, definitely.

Operator: Thank you. And there are no further questions at this time, so I'll hand back to the speakers for any closing comments. Thank you.

Alexandre L'Heureux: Well, thank you for attending the call today. Thank you for your support. As a friendly reminder, we will be holding our Annual Shareholder Meeting at 11:00 Eastern Time today. So, we are encouraging you to attend in person or virtually. And we look forward to updating you in Q2. On that note, I would like to wish you continued success and a great starting of the summer. Thank you very much.

Operator: Thank you. This does conclude the conference for today. Thank you for participating and you may now disconnect.",investing.com,news,Investing.com,,0.5764705882352941,453290203,13,https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/LYNXNPEB6J0AJ_L.jpg,

Full transcript - None (WSPOF) Q1 2024:

Operator: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to WSP's First Quarter 2024 Results Conference Call. I would now like to turn the meeting over to Quentin Weber, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Mr. Weber.

Quentin Weber: Good morning. We hope you are all doing well, and thank you for joining our call today. We will be discussing our Q1 2024 performance followed by a Q&A Session. Joining us today this morning are Alexandre L'Heureux, our President and CEO; and Alain Michaud, our CFO. Please note that this call is also accessible on our website via webcast. During the call, we will be making some forward-looking statements and actual results could differ from those expressed or implied. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any of these statements. Relevant factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those forward-looking statements are listed in our MD&A for the quarter that ended March 31, 2024, which can be found on SEDAR and on our website. In addition, during the call, we may refer to certain non-IFRS measures. These measures are also defined in our MD&A for the quarter that ended March 31, 2024. Our MD&A includes reconciliations of non-IFRS measures to the most directly comparable IFRS measures. Management believes that these non-IFRS measures provide useful information to investors regarding the corporation's financial condition and results of operation as they provide additional key metrics of its performance. These non-IFRS measures are not recognized under IFRS, do not have any standardized meaning described under IFRS and may differ from similarly named measures as reported by other issuers, and accordingly, may not be comparable. These measures should not be viewed as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with IFRS. I will now turn the call over to Alexandre.

Alexandre L'Heureux: Thank you, Quentin. And good morning, everyone. I am pleased with our first quarter performance as it sets a solid foundation for the remainder of 2024 and reflects the positive momentum we continue to experience in our business. Globally, our backlog and pipeline of opportunities remains robust across all sectors, especially in the Americas, which recorded a double-digit organic backlog growth. In Q1, we delivered strong results in line with our expectations, and our top line and profitability continued to trend positively. During the quarter, we continued to future-proof WSP, over-indexing three core elements. First, we focus on optimizing our global platform to unlock even more possibilities and drive sustained organic growth and margin improvement. Second, we added expertise and new clients through a number of acquisitions completed in the first quarter. And third, we remain dedicated to being the premier partner to our clients and our communities. And let me review each in further detail. On the - optimization front, I'm sorry, we elevated further our outstanding platform, seizing productivity opportunities and bolstering project performance. These efforts are allowing us to already report an impressive increase of 50 basis points in adjusted EBITDA margin when compared to the first quarter of 2023. Moreover, it provides us with the confidence to deliver on our three-year strategic plan ambitions to increase our margin profile by at least 150 basis points. We also concluded the go-live of our global ERP in the UK. This region is the third key geography to onboard to the platform after Canada and the U.S., and we now have over 70% of our EBITDA converted and more than 50% of our employees on the new platform. This is one of the largest transformation we have undergone as a business, and it covers the modernization of our sales, procurement, project management, HR and finance functions. We are already beginning to reap the benefits of this initiative through enhanced business intelligence capabilities, the exchange of best practices, the leveraging of insights and data, and increased collaboration. Also, we are pleased to report that our deployment schedule is on plan and on budget. Since the beginning of the year, we have continued to bolster our platform by deploying capital towards strategic acquisitions, and we have announced four transactions recently. The first, Communica, is one of Canada's leading indigenous and stakeholder engagement and information management consulting firms. It is recognized for its collaborative approach and its ability to deliver authentic, open and transparent stakeholder and wider community engagement, including with indigenous - sorry -communities. This acquisition reinforces WSP's commitment to delivering impactful community projects and enhances its ability to respond to the increasing demand for stakeholder engagement and information management services. The second is Proxion, one of Finland's largest rail consultancies, that offers a range of railway and railway system design services, including traffic and energy services as well as safety and security expertise. Proxion adds key rail expertise in Finland to WSP's transport and infrastructure capabilities in the Nordics, and strengthens our market position and ability to lead large-scale projects in the Finnish market. By combining our respective expertise and teams, we aim to elevate our capabilities, broaden our portfolio and strengthen our market position in the country. The third is 1A Ingenieros, a Spanish consulting firm in transmission and distribution, operating mainly in the power and energy sector, which will enhance WSP capabilities in Spain, creating a strong multidisciplinary business in the region with a balanced portfolio in our core end markets. It will also increase our local workforce by approximately 70% and expand our geographical presence in the country by adding four new regions. Through this acquisition, WSP will be positioned as one of the leading international engineering firms in Spain. The fourth is AKF Group, a specialized mechanical, electrical firm that design complex health care, science and technology and mission-critical facilities. AKF enables us to strengthen our scale in the U.S. and expand our expertise within property and building by 20% in the U.S. alone. Through this acquisition, we aim to enhance our technical practice and boost our capabilities and presence in several essential high-end demand markets, and in a variety of sectors, such as corporate, cultural, health care, education, hospitality, retail, science and technology. The sustained expansion of our platform is attributable to strategic capital deployment and organic growth, but also to nurturing our internal talent and resources. This is why I am proud that we continue to focus on internal promotions and have set high ambitions in our strategic action plan. In 2023, we filled over 75% of our global leadership roles with internal candidates. And since the beginning of the fiscal year, another example was Joe Sczurko being promoted to the role of President of our business in the United States. Joe brings decades of invaluable leadership experience and a deep understanding of the industry and evolving client needs. I'm thrilled to see him and many others take on new challenges. The third core element of focus in the quarter was and will continue to be elevating the standard in client experience and being a premier partner to communities. We are making great strides on this front as witnessed by some recent project wins. Today, I have selected three that best illustrate this. In the UK, we have confirm our work on one of the largest programs ever won by WSP in the UK in terms of scale, revenue, length and complexity, which is aligned with our ambition to stay at the forefront of the energy transition and brings exciting new career opportunities for our talent. The Great Grid Upgrade is a major program to deliver electricity transmission infrastructure across the United Kingdom and enable 50 gigawatts of network capacity by 2030. It is a critical step in the pathway to net zero to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and enable the shift towards renewable energy. WSP has been appointed as one of seven industry partners tasked with providing over £9 billion worth of design and construction for national grids over 12 years. Our scope consists of providing professional services across the whole delivery life cycle, from early stage scheme development to environmental services, planning, consent and detailed design. This win is well aligned with our ambitions to stay at the forefront of the energy transition and bring exciting new career opportunities for our talent. In Los Angeles, we have also signed a new $100 million U.S. program management contract to support LA County Metro on the 15-mile light rail extension to Southeast Los Angeles County, which connect underserved communities from ten cities to downtown Los Angeles. The project is important as it broadens the scope of WSP traditional design services for this important customer. During the selection process, WSP scored highest amongst competing firms, achieving the best score in each of the major categories: firm experience and capabilities, key personnel and project approach. WSP has been the leader in the rail and transit sector in the U.S. since the design of the New York City subway system in the 1880s, and we fully intend to remain in the top position. In Australia, we are supporting the Queensland Train Manufacturing Program, which aims to deliver 65 new six-car passenger trains in time for the Brisbane 2032 Olympic and Paralympic games. This initiative is a pivotal support system for the region's growing population and economy. The program will not only boost Queensland's jobs market, but also offers substantial training and development opportunities. WSP provides civil, structural, rail, geotechnical, building and power design services for the greenfield facility. These three examples are a testament to the types of projects that allow us to partner with like-minded clients and deliver projects that profoundly enhance and impact the lives of communities. On that note, I will now invite Alain to review our financial results.

Alain Michaud: Thanks, Alex. I am very pleased this morning to report on our strong results for the first quarter of 2024, where we've seen net revenue grow organically by 4.6%, EBITDA by 8% and earnings per share by 13%. Let me elaborate further on each of these points, starting with our top line. For the first quarter, revenues and net revenue reached $3.6 billion and $2.8 billion, up 2.7% and 4.7%, respectively, compared to the first quarter of 2023. We achieved net revenue organic growth of approximately 6.5% when normalized for the same number of billable days compared to Q1 2023. As stated in our outlook issued in March, these additional billable days will reverse in Q4. Backlog as of March 30, 2024, stood at $14.2 billion, representing 11.8 months of revenues. And of interest, as Alex stated, the Americas reportable segment achieved organic backlog growth of 10.3% over the last 12 months. Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter reached $446 million, up 7.9% compared to the first quarter of 2023. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter reached 16%, an increase of 50 basis points when compared to the first quarter of 2023. And for the last 12 months, our EBITDA margin now stands at 17.7%. This increase is mainly attributable to our continued focus on productivity, as evidenced by a reduction in our personnel costs as a percentage of net revenues. For the quarter, adjusted net earnings reached $194 million or $1.55 per share, up approximately 13% compared to the first quarter or 2023. Free cash outflow reached $125 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, better than the same period last year and slightly of expectation. Our DSO stood at 76 days as of the end of March, stable and unchanged when compared to December 31, 2023. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio stood at 1.6 times, within management's target range of one to two times. As we progress through our business transformation journey, we continue to aim for 100% conversion of net earnings to free cash flow for 2024. In conclusion, we're off to a great start with a solid set of results, a strong operating plan and healthy market conditions. We are therefore reiterating our outlook with confidence. Now back to you, Alex.

Alexandre L'Heureux: Well, thank you, Alain. Given our prudent start of 2023, compared to our solid start in 2024 and given our progress made in the current strategic cycle, we are confident in the future. We welcomed approximately 10,000 employees through 15 acquisitions since the beginning of our plan, and notably, for since the beginning of the current year. We continue to have a promising pipeline of growth opportunities, a solid balance sheet and looking at the rest of 2024, we are moving forward with confidence. Our focus remains on delivering on our ambitions bolstered by healthy market conditions. Our shared vision and collective efforts are the cornerstone of our success, and I am confident they will continue to guide us on our journey to be recognized as the undisputed leader in our industry. On a final note, I would encourage you to explore our 2024 Global ESG Report which will be published shortly. You are also invited to take part in our Annual General Meeting which will be held in person and virtually at 11 a.m. Eastern Standard Time today. More details can be found on our website. And I will now open the line for questions.

Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. We will now take our first question. First question is from the line of Benoît Poirier from Desjardins. Please go ahead.

Benoît Poirier: Yes, good morning, Alain. Good morning Alex. And congratulations for the strong start.

Benoît Poirier: Yes. Just in terms of headcount, you added about 700 people so far this year. Obviously, you've been through four M&A transactions. So I was just curious to know how many people came from acquisition? And what's your expectation for the remainder of the year in light of your growth trajectory? And also, if you could comment about the greatest opportunities you still see from the productivity improvement standpoint.

Alexandre L'Heureux: Well, look, I think if I start with M&A, we have a very good start. I'm very pleased with where we stand at this point in time and the pipeline is healthy, so I'm confident that the remainder of the year should bear fruit. So I think, on that front, I'm feeling good that we should have a good year in 2024. Perhaps, Alain, you want to comment on headcount?

Alain Michaud: Yes. So on headcount, Benoît, with the Communica and Proxion acquisition in Q1, we've added about 200 people. Our focus is, as we've discussed many times in 2023 and at the start of 2024, we've been heavily engaged on maximizing the productivity of our business. So, headcount growth is important, but it's a balancing act, delivering also on increased productivity and efficiency. So, we are in line with our budget in terms of growth of headcount. And for the remainder of the year, we intend to continue on a similar path of maximizing our productivity.

Benoît Poirier: Okay.

Alexandre L'Heureux: You need to remember that the last two acquisitions have been completed in Q2.

Alain Michaud: That's right, beginning of Q2.

Benoît Poirier: Yes. Yes. Okay. That's great color. And some of your peers mentioned weakness in the Chinese housing market as well as in the UK, where one player proceeded to some cut headcount in their transportation division. I know China is not material for you, but I was wondering if there was any update and whether you were seeing anything similar.

Alexandre L'Heureux: No. Benoît - I mean, actually yes. I think we've consistently been saying over the last three or four quarters that Asia is challenging. There's no doubt about that. Having said all that, as you just mentioned, Mainland China for us, it's 300 people out of 67. So for us, it's de minimis. As it relates to the UK market, we are not seeing what has been perhaps described by others. The market is - we are feeling good about our performance. We are feeling extremely good around our recent win of a national grid which would provide good organic growth for the business for years to come. So overall, I'm extremely pleased with our performance in the UK market.

Operator: Thank you. We will now take our next question. This is from the line of Chris Murray from ATB Capital Markets. Please go ahead.

Chris Murray: Yes, thanks. Good morning. Just really quick, just looking at the backlog in Canada, the organic number was actually slightly negative this quarter. Just wondering if there's anything going on, or is this sort of a temporary thing? If you can just give us more color on maybe the reason for the - for it being kind of flat to down?

Alain Michaud: Yes, Chris, if anything, we feel extremely confident with the backlog in Canada and the market condition, it's mostly timing related, the ins and outs of a larger job. Underlying business is performing quite well and the backlog is solid. So no issue in Canada. Same comment for the Americas for that matter. And across the map...

Alexandre L'Heureux: I am feeling very, very good about Canada at this point.

Chris Murray: All right. No, that's helpful. And then just following on maybe your comments about the ERP system, so congratulations on getting to 70% complete. But thinking maybe over the next year or two, what's left to be done on this program? And is it fair to think that it should be substantially complete by the end of this fiscal year?

Alain Michaud: Well, currently, as Alex said, 70% of our EBITDA. So Canada, U.S. and UK is done. And when we reflect that what we've achieved since the beginning of the year, it's 25,000 and more that have been onboarded on the platform. So we're extremely proud of that and proud of our team that have devoted significant effort on that front. We are now moving to the East, and there is other region to be done, the Nordics, Australia, New Zealand. So, I think it's more 2025 calendar year that we will see the majority of our business into one platform. That's the intention, Chris.

Alexandre L'Heureux: The way, Chris, I am thinking about it and the way I think you should view this is, is we have - I'd like to think, and I'm saying that in a very - I'm obviously cautious in the way I'm saying it. But I feel we have substantially derisked this program at this point in time with our three largest countries on the platform, with 70% of our profit on the platform. However, we are operating in 60 countries. So the remainder 30% will take a bit more time, but we're highly confident that things are going to go well and they are going to be smooth. What I am especially proud of is, and you may have noticed it in our numbers, yes, the DSOs have increased slightly. But given the sheer task that we had to go through, I'm very proud that we kept our DSO stable, and I feel it's only going to improve from now.

Operator: Thank you. We'll now take our next question. [Operator Instructions] This is from the line of Jacob Bout from CIBC. Please go ahead.

Jacob Bout: Yes, I had a question just on M&A. I know you are saying that the pipeline looks pretty strong. But maybe you could talk a bit about how the pipeline is looking for the mid- to larger-sized acquisitions. And then my second question, just on the M&A, what the margin profile of recent acquisitions look like.

Alexandre L'Heureux: Yes. Margin acquisition of the acquisition we just - the margin, sorry, of the acquisition we just completed are fairly similar to our margin profile at this point in time. However, we continue to believe that we can improve the margin profile of those firms as soon as they - we are in a position to integrate them into our platform. So, feeling very good about this, Jacob. Look, around mid- to larger-size acquisition, I think, I've said that in numerous occasions in the past, it's extremely difficult to time acquisition. Oftentimes, it takes many years to convince a firm to join your ranks. It takes a lot of nurturing. What I can tell you is that we are - I continue to have formal and informal discussions with smaller-size, medium-size and larger-size acquisitions. I cannot guarantee you when we are going to complete these. But what I can tell you is that I am encouraged by the discussions that I am having right now.

Jacob Bout: Okay, that's fair. Maybe just going back to backlog and just looking specifically at APAC. It's down organically year-on-year, talked a bit about China, but how about Australia and New Zealand? I know you called out the timing of some projects there, but are you expecting a slowdown or is this just all timing in your view?

Alexandre L'Heureux: I think in New Zealand with the recent election, I think, there has been a pause, like any governments. Now I think it's more center-right government and took a pause on infrastructure spending. We expect that to change and resume in due course. Are we overly concerned by that? No. I think we're calm when things are hot and we are calm when things are cooling off a little bit because we believe this is timing and infrastructure needs are needed. Same with Australia. We've experienced double-digit organic growth for, I think, two years now. So obviously, we're starting from a higher base, but the activity level is good. We have a very strong business. We have a very strong team. So I'm positive in the longer term for that region. And yes, Asia, as I said earlier on today, it's been challenging and I believe will continue to be challenging for some time. Thankfully, for us, this is a small part of our business.

Operator: Thank you. We'll now take our next question. This is from Devin Dodge from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.

Devin Dodge: A couple of questions, maybe not so much related to Q1, but maybe longer term, but look, the demand environment is really quite strong across many of your regions. How do you think about the balance between pursuing the growth opportunities that are available and being more selective in your bidding activity to drive margin expansion?

Alexandre L'Heureux: Well, this is a balancing act, as you just mentioned, right? If I look where we are today as a company, WSP, I look at the brand awareness of the company, I look at the type of projects that we are now in the position to tackle as a prime designer or prime consultant, and I compare that to where we were five, seven, eight, nine, ten years ago. We are in a different space. Again, I mentioned and I highlighted three projects this morning that is a testament of what I just mentioned. I look at the great strides that we're making in sectors where three, four years ago, we were not big. I mentioned a few quarters ago the award of Propel project and other energy transition projects in the State of New York. Massive project for us. And now National Grid (LON: NG ). Three, four years ago, we were not there. So I was telling our Board this week, the absolute number in organic growth is obviously important. And we're pleased, if you compare orange, with oranges or apples with apples that we grew 6.5% this quarter. But it's the type of growth that we are able to generate in sectors where we were fairly small few years ago I am extremely pleased with the type of award that we are able to secure right now. So that's telling me that we are continuing to diversify the platform. We continue to grow in sectors where we were not a leading firm. And then we continue to capitalize on the sectors where we have a strong presence. And the Proxion acquisition in Finland is a testament or an example of that. Now in the rail sector where we have the leadership franchise around the world, we're going to be able to tackle large projects in Finland. So overall, I'm feeling very good about that. And even though we're going through a conversion, an ERP conversion, we have been able to increase our utilization and we have been able to increase our margin over the recent past. So I feel, as Alain mentioned, our team should be commended for the extraordinary work that has been accomplished recently.

Devin Dodge: Excellent, that's good color. Okay. Second question on PFAS, lots of interest on the back of the EPA releasing some final rules last month.

Alexandre L'Heureux: Yes.

Devin Dodge: Do you view this as an opportunity for WSP? And if so, can you walk us through the services that you provide and where you expect to see the most benefit going forward?

Alexandre L'Heureux: Tremendous opportunities. Perhaps, Alain, you can cover that. But clearly, for us, like any other firms in the space, it's a real opportunity. The rules and the regulation are strict and the requirements will increase demands for our services. So I feel that, over the coming years, we'll have our share, and we'll be winning our share of work in that space. Alain?

Alain Michaud: Yes, definitely positive, Devin, in terms of development. The rules in the U.S. are probably the most strict that we've seen. But I think it bodes well for our expert. We probably have around 500 PFAS expert in the U.S. alone. Our backlog in Q1 has already seen some good level of work. So we're extremely positive about the impact of the new regulation and the flow of work that should come our way given our expertise and profile in the space.

Operator: Thank you. We'll now take our next question, this is from Frederic Bastien from Raymond James. Please go ahead.

Alexandre L'Heureux: [Foreign Language]

Frederic Bastien: [Foreign Language] Guys, I'd like to circle back on M&A for a bit. And really wondering what has changed from an internal or external standpoint to make you say, ""Hey, okay, now it's time to open up the M&A valve again?""

Alexandre L'Heureux: Yes. If you remember, Frederic I think, it was the last quarter, yes, at the last investor call, I mentioned that we viewed 2023 as a year of consolidation. Last year alone, we grew our top line by over 20%. Yes, not all of this was organic growth, there was a lot of acquisition growth, but we grew our top line by one fifth in one year. So I consider that to be very meaningful and very transformative. So, last year was a year of consolidation, we wanted to extract the value from the platform. We wanted to complete the integration of Golder, we wanted to activate our work on the integration of Wood E&I. So that's why I considered last year, a year of consolidation. This year, we've had a strong start of the year. Mind you, these are not large acquisitions, but are very strategic to us. And yes, we're clearly open for business. We have a strong balance sheet. As I said before, I feel we have substantially derisked the ERP project and transformation. So, I feel that all of the ingredients are now in place for us to continue to grow inorganically and organically.

Frederic Bastien: Thank, super helpful. Next one is perhaps for Alain. We saw better-than-expected margin expansion in the quarter, at least from my standpoint, and that sets you up quite nicely for the rest of the year. Do you anticipate similar gains in future quarters? Or will we see a bit of variability as we build into Q2, Q3 and Q4?

Alain Michaud: Yes. So as Alex said, we are very proud of the lift in Q1. We usually have lower margin expansion in the first quarter of the year, so we are extremely proud about that. We've devoted significant effort on working on all those levers, as you know, Fred, on productivity. We are certainly aiming to push and continue to increase margin in the following quarter. And we're feeling confident about the 65 basis point increase that we have guided for the full year. We'll keep on working hard and pushing hard on improving productivity of the firm.

Frederic Bastien: Okay. But do you expect that to be linear? Or I mean, 65% is a massive improvement. Would that be backend loaded?

Alexandre L'Heureux: You are very persistent. That's the intention, to continue to push in that direction.

Maxim Sytchev: Alex, maybe the first question for you, if I may. In terms of - certainly, it feels like there is a theme emerging when it comes to power. Big win in UK, Spanish acquisition. We are reading that UK will need to [indiscernible] by a factor of seven when it comes to [indiscernible] energy transition. Do you mind maybe expanding a little bit on this important theme and maybe the opportunity potentially in the U.S. and Canada, how to sort of take advantage of all this? Thank you so much.

Alexandre L'Heureux: Yes. Look, you've been following us for a very long time, Max, so you know us inside out. We've always have taken a very disciplined approach in the way we're building our firm. And as I said, the first pillar we started with more than ten years ago was with property and building, then we moved to transportation infrastructure, and we continue to raise the bar in those two sectors. More recently, we said that we wanted to become the leading firm in the green transition, so we build our pillar around Earth and Environment. And now I feel that we are ready to make a big push in the energy transition. So more recently, we've invested a lot in talent, and we invested a lot of effort in growing our presence in that sector. And as I said before, I could not be prouder of the work that has been accomplished. And this strat plan to grow our presence there, I think now we're tackling some of the largest energy transition program in the United States and in the UK, so I'm extremely pleased about that. And you're right in pointing out that our push in Central Europe with a 250-people acquisition in transmission and distribution is another example of our core strategy at this point in time. So yes, we're going to continue to push in that sector.

Maxim Sytchev: I appreciate that, thanks. And then one other follow-up that I have, do you have any update in terms of IIJA and how that funding is flowing through? And how should we think about this in terms of the impact? Thank you.

Alain Michaud: I could take that one, Max. So, the latest number that have been published, there's about 40% of funding that have been deployed. This is April data, and it's up from February data by more than 30%. So we were at 30% deployment in February, 40% in April. So it's moving certainly in the right direction. 40,000 projects have been awarded, funding through the Biden Infrastructure Bill. So that continues to support our thesis around and our confidence around the U.S. And if you combine that with the regulation on PFAS we've covered before, we continue to feel very strong about the U.S. and especially given our leadership position in the transportation business. And I have to say transportation represents currently about two third of all the funding that have been deployed through the bill. So that's good news for us and supports our thesis.

Operator: Thank you. We'll now take the next question, this is from Michael Tupholme from TD Securities. Please go ahead.

Michael Tupholme: This may tie into the last answer you just provided there regarding IIJA, but the 10.3% organic growth in backlog in the Americas that you've highlighted a few times. Can you talk a little bit about the areas that drove that increase in the quarter?

Alexandre L'Heureux: All the sector, Michael. I mean, transportation, property and building, earth and environment, we are seeing growth in those sectors. We've seen growth in power, as I talked about. So at the moment, I feel we are going to continue to grow in those sectors. And one that I would perhaps add as well is advanced manufacturing. We are doing more work in that space, and I expect to continue more and more. So that also is a real opportunity for us to grow and to develop new sectors.

Michael Tupholme: And it doesn't sound like it from your response just now or any of your other comments. But more broadly, when we look across the business from an end market perspective, are there any areas that are looking weaker right now or causing you to be concerned at all?

Alexandre L'Heureux: Are you talking in the Americas or you're talking globally?

Michael Tupholme: Globally, and I don't mean regionally. I mean, I know you've touched on Asia as a - and China regionally. But just from an end market perspective globally, is there anything that you see is slower?

Alexandre L'Heureux: I don't think we can look at our sectors and conclude that things are slowing down to the contrary I feel we're in a good spot right now. But yes, there are some pockets of geographies that are more challenging than others. But for the most part, I feel our top countries are performing well at this point.

Michael Tupholme: Perfect. And then just lastly, looking at the margins in the APAC segment, you did see a decline in EBITDA margins year-over-year in Q1. I see from the commentary that the performance in Asia was the source of that. I guess I'm just wondering how we should think about APAC margins going forward as you move through the year? Is there an opportunity to grow margins? Or how should we be thinking about margins?

Alexandre L'Heureux: Actually, Australia margin profile, we're not reporting the different countries, but just to give you a sense, in Australia, we have seen our margin profile going up, not going down. Equally, New Zealand has been stable. So overall, I think we're feeling good.

Alain Michaud: And if you look at Asia specifically, Q1 last year was a quasi-normal quarter, so the comparison Q1 over Q1 is a little tougher. But if you look sequentially versus Q4, Asia is not significantly moving down. So overall, if you think about Australia and New Zealand, feeling confident about their margin profile improvement for the rest of the year and stabilization in Asia.

Michael Tupholme: Okay, that's helpful. Thank you.

Operator: Thank you. We'll now take the next question. This is from Michael Doumet from Scotiabank. Please go ahead.

Michael Doumet: Hey Alex. You guys discussed productivity again as being a focus in 2024 and when I look at the project margins and the improvement there, obviously great in the first quarter. I can think about that as coming from an increase from a combination of higher price and higher utilization. Is there a way maybe that you can discuss the trend of each? And I am just curious, going forward, where you think there's more room.

Alexandre L'Heureux: Well, we definitely believe there is more room in the years to come. You can always improve. So, we believe there are some geographies and some sectors where the productivity is not where it needs to be as far as we are concerned, number one. And number two, going back perhaps to a question that was asked earlier on this morning, being more selective in the projects that we undertake. WSP, we excel in complex projects. That's where we feel we can do better and we can increase our margin profile. So the type of projects that we undertake is also going to have an impact on our margin profile. So obviously, by selecting projects where we believe we can really raise the bar, provide a better service or a differentiated service will allow us to increase our margin profile. So I would argue that this is all of the above at this point.

Michael Doumet: Okay. No, that makes sense. And then Alex, maybe just turning to M&A, look, you've been here for a long, long time and you've done a lot of deals. We're living in a world where valuations are high and interest rates are high. You would think that maybe one of the two would have given a little bit. But when you look at deals today, do you feel more strongly about the need to drive synergies to get to the appropriate IRR? Or do you still think that there is sufficient value out there, particularly when we're talking about the medium to larger deals?

Alexandre L'Heureux: Yes. Look, it's not the first time we are going through an environment that is challenging. I think you heard me saying that before, you just mentioned, I've been there for a very long time. So we've gone through times where, I remember 2014, the turn - that's ten years ago, but the turnaround in oil and gas and the markets were challenging. But you know what? In those difficult times, there are also some opportunities. So if you recall, at the time, the exchange rate between the U.S. and Canada was one for one. So we were able to acquire Parsons (NYSE: PSN ) Brinckerhoff in a difficult period, where however, from an exchange point of view, we had favorable tailwinds. So, my belief is that in good times and in bad times, you have to be creative and you have to find value in the transaction that you look into. Mind you, you are right. We have to be disciplined. If the interest rate is impacting financial sponsor, I don't see why it would not impact us. So we have to be disciplined in the way we're thinking about the transactions. But for the right acquisition, I am not going to shy away because of the current environment. We need to have a long-term view on transaction and what we're trying to build as a company. So that would be my take at this point in time, is we should not be using the market conditions as an excuse, we should instead push ourselves to be creative and find value.

Michael Doumet: Yes. No, I appreciate those comments. Look, maybe I will ask a third. I am assuming I am the last here. But just as a clarification, should we interpret your reiterating of your guidance is it being unchanged, including the recent acquisition and the favorable FX, or just not updated yet?

Alain Michaud: It's early in the year, Michael, so we didn't feel, given this the impact of the recent acquisition, we didn't feel the need to increase or change our guidance. We'll continue to track that and see, in Q2 and Q3, what we do. But we are feeling equally strong as we felt in March when we issued our guidance with the platform we had at the time. So I think that...

Operator: Thank you. We will now take our next question. This is from Ian Gillies from Stifel. Please go ahead.

Ian Gillies: I just wanted to follow-on some of the questions in and around power and your intention to grow there. I am just curious on how that business or perhaps the ones you've looked at are, in broad strokes, how it stacks up, I guess, maybe against the corporate averages, because one of the great things about growing that Earth and Environment business, it was higher margin - it appears to be higher margin than the corporate average. I am wondering if power tends to have some of the same traits.

Alexandre L'Heureux: Yes, it's a fair assumption. It's a fair assumption. Right now, the world is in dire need of new sources of energy. So I feel - I mentioned a few projects this morning. This has not gone unnoticed for us, and we believe that WSP is uniquely positioned to provide services in that space, because the power space, it's not just about and around connecting new sources of energy to existing grid, there is also a collateral impact on other sectors, such as building, earth and environment and transportation. So we wanted, in a very disciplined way, to build our presence in earth and environment, which we've done since late 2018. But clearly, as you can see and notice, I've been talking about this over the last few quarters, I'm quite keen to continue to diversify our platform and I'm quite keen to continue to grow in sectors where we're not leading. And we have the aspire to become a leading firm.

Ian Gillies: That's incredibly helpful, thanks very much. The other separate question I had, one of the things that's been talked about on prior calls is trying to increase your presence in the U.S. with respect to federal government spending, whether it be through GSAs or other avenues. Is that still a focus? Or is there enough work going on elsewhere that you've shifted priorities?

Alexandre L'Heureux: No. They're not mutually exclusive, that's the way I would answer the question. I think we can continue to push. I talked about power, but I mentioned advanced manufacturing. I think there's real opportunities for us to grow in that space organically and potentially through acquisitions over time. So, I think these are new sources or new opportunities for WSP, and we intend to take advantage of them.

Ian Gillies: Okay, thanks very helpful. Thanks very much. I will turn it back over.

Alexandre L'Heureux: Okay, Ian.

Operator: Thank you. And we have one more question. And last question today is from Sabahat Khan from RBC. Please go ahead.

Sabahat Khan: Great. Thanks and good morning. I guess just hearing a little about where you see the demand, whether it's by region and market, how are you balancing these demand indicators against hiring and then trying to just maintain the right level of utilization and drive margins? Just trying to understand - the demand environment still seems like it's in a reasonable place, labor situation is somewhat better than a few years ago, but just curious how you are deciding on the right number of employees to onboard while also considering M&A there? Any color would be helpful.

Alexandre L'Heureux: Yes. Well, I'm glad you bring this topic, Saba. I mean, if I look at our trailing 12 months numbers, our turnover is historical low levels, meaning that we have a lower turnover in our last 12 months than we've had in pre-pandemic levels. So that, combined with our increased productivity and extracting the value from our platform, we are obviously - this is a balancing act. But recently, we have chosen to work on the engagement of our people, reducing our turnover, increasing productivity, rather than being out there and obviously hire just for the sake of hiring. You look at the fee per employees that we are generating and the curve that you are going to witness if you do the math, over the last ten years, I mean, that's something I'm really focused on. I want to make sure that - and I am saying that with all due respect to our employees that are listening to the call, but I want us to do more with less. I want us to be in a position to deliver more with less. So I want us to run a very, very tight ship and a very, very efficient platform. So that's the mindset right now.

Sabahat Khan: Okay, great. And then, I guess, with some of these moving parts about end market growth and the IIJA, if we look particularly at the U.S. market, do you expect any meaningful shift, putting M&A aside, any meaningful shift in your end market mix? I think you're large in transportation, that's a big part of the IIJA. Should we expect more of the same? Do you expect any evolution in where your business comes from over the next two to three years in the U.S. market?

Alexandre L'Heureux: Well, as I said, I think there are untapped territories for us. So I mentioned power, advanced manufacturing. I feel we could do more there. We can always do more in water, which we're going to continue to grow. But there's so much work in the property and building sector. There is so much more that we can do here. And transportation, we're subscale in many states and many parts of the U.S. So I do feel that we have tremendous opportunities pretty much in all sectors. But as I mentioned today, there are some sectors that I would like to grow because I feel we're too subscale at this point in time.

Sabahat Khan: Okay. Then one last quick one, maybe for Alain, I guess a lot of discussion on this call around M&A with the scale of the company growing and the cash flow base growing, should we expect any other areas of focus within capital allocation besides M&A over the next one to two years? Thanks.

Alexandre L'Heureux: I think you - I will take this one up and Alain can complement. But yes, as part of our next strategic cycle, clearly, we are going to continue to invest in R&D and digital, definitely.

Operator: Thank you. And there are no further questions at this time, so I'll hand back to the speakers for any closing comments. Thank you.

Alexandre L'Heureux: Well, thank you for attending the call today. Thank you for your support. As a friendly reminder, we will be holding our Annual Shareholder Meeting at 11:00 Eastern Time today. So, we are encouraging you to attend in person or virtually. And we look forward to updating you in Q2. On that note, I would like to wish you continued success and a great starting of the summer. Thank you very much.

Operator: Thank you. This does conclude the conference for today.

This carbon saving rises to over 60% when renewable electricity is used. Producing Europe's demand for battery cells and components locally would save an estimated 133 Mt of CO2 between 2024 and 2030, equivalent to the total annual emissions of Czechia.

But less than half (47%) of the lithium-ion battery production planned for Europe up to 2030 is secure, the report also finds. This is up from one-third a year ago following a raft of measures put in place to respond to the US Inflation Reduction Act. The remaining 53% of announced cell manufacturing capacity is still at medium or high risk of being delayed, scaled down or cancelled without stronger government action.

Julia Poliscanova, senior director for vehicles and emobility supply chains at T&E, said: ""Batteries, and metals that go into them, are the new oil. European leaders will need laser sharp focus and joined-up thinking to reap their climate and industrial benefits. Strong sustainability requirements, such as the upcoming battery carbon footprint rules, can reward local clean manufacturing. Crucially, Europe needs better instruments under the European Investment Bank and EU Battery Fund to support gigafactory investments.""

France, Germany and Hungary have made the most progress in securing gigafactory capacity since T&E's previous risk assessment last year. [1] In France, ACC started production in Pas-de-Calais last year while plants by Verkor in Dunkirk and Northvolt in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany, are going ahead thanks to generous government subsidies.

Finland, the UK, Norway and Spain have the most production capacity at medium or high risk due to question marks over projects by the Finnish Minerals Group, West Midlands Gigafactory, Freyr and InoBat. T&E called on lawmakers to help lock in investments by doubling down on EU electric car policies, enforcing strong battery sustainability requirements that reward local manufacturing, and beefing up EU-level funding.",transportenvironment.org,news,Transport & Environment,,0.1686274509803922,453273728,1,https://te-cdn.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/_1200x630_crop_center-center_82_none/northvolt-drei.png?mtime=1715173444,eng-9566481

Artificial intelligence is the development of massive computational capabilities for understanding and managing specific activities. For example, the air traffic control system already relies heavily on AI to match up the four-dimensional process of moving aircraft around the world. An aircraft carrier battle group has extensive AI in its defensive system. Israel's Iron Dome anti-missile system relies heavily on computational analysis and decision-making, in virtual real time, to decide which incoming projectiles and drones are likely to hit populated areas and which can be safely ignored to focus on the gravest threats.

In health care, AI is increasingly capable of evaluating diagnostic information and CT scans, MRIs and other tests. If it had been properly used, AI could have dramatically improved our understanding of and response to COVID-19. Unfortunately, the public health service in general -- and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in particular -- are obsolete bureaucratic systems incapable of adapting to modern technology. Americans pay with their health and their lives for the refusal of these bureaucracies to modernize.

These are examples of the ways in which AI is already affecting our lives. It is getting faster, more comprehensive, and more capable of learning from its mistakes and improving through repetitive use.

Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, is a dramatically more powerful theoretical system. Some people argue it may be unattainable. Essentially, AGI would be a system that could constantly learn and evolve without being limited to one particular area or topic. It would be a constantly evolving and self-improving system. At least in theory, it could outthink humans and even compete with them. There is a consensus that AGI is still years away while AI is around us -- constantly improving in speed and capability.

As it improves, AI is going to transform our way of doing things on a scale that resembles the combination of electricity, chemistry and internal combustion engines around 1880.

No one in 1880 could have forecast the scale and breadth of change coming -- although a few futurist novelists such as Jules Verne and H.G. Wells wrote fascinating fictional forecasts of the coming scientific and technological revolution.

No one in 1880 could have foreseen that electric lights would eliminate night. Farmers used to work from light to dark, and then Thomas Edison made dark obsolete.

No one at the peak of vaudeville could have imagined its replacement by movies, radio, and then television (Steve Allen's ""The Funny Men"" is a remarkable outline of that process and its impact on comedians and their work).

My favorite example of the unimaginable scale of change is the 1894 London Times story about the Horse Manure Crisis. London and New York had so many horses that their daily production of horse manure threatened to use up all the vacant lots in the two cities.

It did not occur to anyone in 1894 that in a few short years, Henry Ford would begin to eliminate horse manure as an urban problem by giving it a new problem in cars, trucks and buses.

In the early 1950s, there were 58,000 cases of polio annually. In 1953, Dr. Jonas Salk tested a polio vaccine on himself and his family and in 1955, the polio vaccine was tested on 1.6 million children in Canada, Finland and the United States. This is inconceivable with today's Food and Drug Administration rules, which prefer the certainty of disease over risks from cures.

We are at the same moment of dramatic change that Thomas Kuhn described in ""The Structure of Scientific Revolutions"" and called a paradigm shift.

The challenge will be to understand AI's potential (putting off applying AGI until it is developed) and then reimagine the way the world works with these powerful new tools.

The key is to leap into the future and have the kind of imagination Verne and Wells showed in imagining the future for their generation.

The first instinct will be to apply AI to marginally improve existing bureaucracies, processes and activities.

It will take a great leap of imagination to fully explore what AI could achieve if we redesigned our systems and habits around the capabilities it will make available to improve our lives, increase our productivity, and enhance our range of choices.

This is 91 percent. Electricity generated by the entire energy sector in this country. This class continues in May. Just one year ago, the percentage in April was 73.3%, and in May it was 71.8%. Okay, but what about the prices? Can the average Portuguese be happy with the fact that energy is ""green""?

This is confirmed by the electricity price map as of Friday. In Europe, Portugal is more expensive than its counterparts: Finland, France and Spain. Prices in Poland are three times higher than in Portugal on that day.

Moreover, as we checked Poland's average daily electricity price was 820% higher this year. Higher than Portuguese. The peak was in the second half of February, when our prices exceeded 100 euros, and Portuguese prices even less than 5 euros.

However, renewable energy sources offer lower prices. So why do prices in our country not fall significantly due to the rapid development of wind farms and photovoltaics, but remain among the highest on the continent? Let's first look at what renewable energy is used in Portugal.

Portugal produced an average of 87% this year. Energy from green sourcesincluding 23 percent of riverine hydropower plants, 23 percent of wind, 14 percent of pumped power plants, 10 percent of water reservoirs, and only 4 percent of photovoltaics.

The transcript continues below the video

Power plants, pumped tanks and storage are critical to the price. These power plants act as energy storage facilities. In Portugal, which is more mountainous than Poland, there are more suitable places to build. You can store energy in such tanks for a time (using electricity to fill the tanks) that is produced, for example, by photovoltaics during peak sunlight hours, or windmills on windy days, and return this energy (emptying the water tanks) when prices Higher or higher at other times there will be energy demand.

In Poland, pumped-storage power plants produced only 1.1%. energy this yearWater tanks are only 0.1%. Although in April and May it was already 35 percent. The energy came from ""green"" sources, and PSE repeatedly banned the operation of photovoltaics because they produced too much reported demand and there was nowhere to store them. Some coal-fired power plants simply cannot be downsized, that is, they cannot be scaled down any further without higher start-up costs, otherwise they would have to be closed. They have little flexibility in work.

Not Portugal, but Finland and France

However, it is not Portugal with its almost exclusively green energy that can serve as an example of a system providing cheap energy in Europe. here Finland and France are role models.

On Friday in Europe, these two countries had the lowest prices and have a lot in common when it comes to energy. This year, France produced almost as much energy from renewable energy sources as Poland, and even in April and May we produced more from green sources than the French, because in their case the percentage was less than 33%. In these two months, in our case 34 percent. The difference and the key to success lies in the corn.

The proportion of nuclear energy in France is 57.5%. Energy mix in 2024 In Finland, the share of nuclear energy reached 38% this year. Share in energy, renewable energy 44%. In this system, any excess energy from renewable energy sources is not regulated by exceptions, but by reductions in nuclear energy production. Hence, energy storage becomes unnecessary.

The ""green"" energy sector is very unstable and needs stabilizers in the form of nuclear, gas or coal power plants or energy reservoirs. In Poland this year, renewable energy produced at least 8.4% in one day. energy (February 28), and a maximum of 51.7 percent (February 4). On the first day, something had to be done to make up for the shortage of renewable energy sources, and on the second day, something had to be disabled so as not to cause an energy surplus. But in our case, the price of energy rises because power plants need to buy the rights to emit carbon dioxide.

(NASDAQ:MERC) Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Mercer International Inc. isn't one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (see the details here).

Operator: Good morning, and welcome to Mercer International's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. On the call today is Juan Carlos Bueno, Mercer's President and Chief Executive Officer, and Richard Short, Mercer's Chief Financial Officer and Secretary. I will now hand the call over to Richard.

Richard Short: Thanks, Liz. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I will begin by touching on the financial and operating highlights of the first quarter before turning the call to Juan Carlos to provide further color into the markets, our operations, and our strategic initiatives. Also, for those of you that are joining today's call by telephone, there is presentation material that we have attached to the Investors section of our website. But before turning to our results, I would like to remind you that we will make forward-looking statements in this morning's conference call according to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. I'd like to call your attention to the risks related to these statements, which are more fully described in our press release and in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

This quarter, our EBITDA was $64 million compared to Q4 EBITDA of $21 million. The improved results were driven by not having any major maintenance downtime, improving pulp sales realizations, and lower fiber and other production costs. Our pulp segment contributed quarterly EBITDA of $68 million, and our solid wood segment EBITDA was negative $1 million. You can find additional segment disclosures in our Form 10-Q, which can be found on our website and that of the SEC. In Q1, both our NBSK and NBHK sales realizations increased compared to Q4. Average list prices increased in Europe and North America due to stronger demand and global supply constraints. In China, prices were flat as demand slowed during the Chinese New Year and picked up near the end of the quarter.

The European NBSK list price averaged $1,400 per ton in the current quarter, an increase of $155 or 12% from Q4. And the North American NBSK list price averaged $1,440 per ton in the current quarter, an increase of $128 or 10% from Q4. In China, the Q1 average NBHK net price was $662 per ton, up $19 or about 3% compared to the Q4 average price, resulting in the market price gap between NBSK and NBHK in China, narrowing to about $83 per ton in Q1 from $105 per ton in Q4. The North American NBHK average Q1 list price was $1,223 per ton, up $140 or 13% from Q4. Total pulp sales volumes in the first quarter increased by 75,000 tons to 566,000 tons, driven by the timing of sales and higher production due to lower scheduled maintenance downtime. We had no scheduled maintenance downtime in Q1 compared to 23 days of downtime in Q4, which positively impacted Q1 EBITDA by about $23 million when compared to Q4.

After adjusting for the Q4 planned shuts, pulp production was essentially flat from the fourth quarter. For our solid wood segment, we had modest lumber pricing improvements in both Europe and the U.S. market. Despite the price increases, overall lumber demand remained subdued as a result of uncertain economic conditions in Europe and high interest rates. The random length U.S. benchmark for western SPF #2&Btr was $462 per thousand board feet at the end of Q1, compared to $422 at the end of Q4. Today, that benchmark price for western SPF #2&Btr is around $421 per thousand board feet, virtually unchanged from the beginning of 2024. For Q2, we are expecting generally flat lumber prices in the U.S. and European markets as demand remains weak. Lumber production was a near record 127 million board feet in Q1, up 14% due to seasonal downtime in the fourth quarter.

Lumber sales volumes were 121 million board feet, up 8% from Q4. Electricity sales totaled 259 gigawatt hours in the quarter, which was about the same as Q4. Pricing in Q1 modestly decreased to about $94 per megawatt hour from $98 in Q4 due to lower spot prices in Germany. In Q1, our pulp segment had lower fiber costs in Q4 as supplied remained stable. On the other hand, our solid wood segment had higher sawlog costs due to strong demand in Germany. Production for our solid wood segment's mass timber operations decreased in Q1 from Q4 due to minor customer driven delays for certain large-scale projects. These projects are now underway and we are satisfied with the order book today. In the first quarter, we made the strategic decision to dissolve the Cariboo mill joint venture, which resulted in the recording of a non-cash loss of roughly $24 million, or $0.35 per share.

We expect the transaction to only have a nominal impact on 2024 EBITDA. Juan Carlos will have more to say on this in a moment. We reported a consolidated net loss of $17 million for the first quarter, or $0.25 per share, compared to a net loss of $87 million, or $1.31 per share, in Q4. We consumed about $40 million of cash in Q1, compared to $30 million in Q4. The large cash usage in Q1 was primarily due to higher receivables, which were up roughly $64 million, driven by higher sales realizations and sales volumes. We expect the majority of this working capital bill to reverse in Q2. At the end of Q1, our liquidity position totaled $555 million, comprised of $274 million of cash and about $281 million of undrawn revolvers. Finally, our Board has approved a quarterly dividend of $0.075 per share for shareholders of record on June 26, for which payment will be made on July 3, 2024.

That ends my overview of the financial results. I'll now turn the call over to Juan Carlos.

Juan Carlos Bueno: Thanks, Rich. Our Q1 operating results improved significantly relatively to Q4. The improvement was primarily the result of higher pulp prices in combination with no major maintenance at any of our mills, and our results in Q1 also benefited from lower costs, including fiber and energy costs. Overall, all of our mills ran at near record production levels, while both our energy production and sales volumes were at record levels in Q1. As previously announced, we came to the decision to dissolve the Cariboo mill joint venture after reviewing this asset and its future prospect against the strategic priorities, and determined that dissolving the joint venture will allow us to focus our resources to areas more aligned with our long-term strategic goals.

I will also add that we were not expecting Cariboo to have any meaningful impact on our 2024 earnings. In Q1, we invested roughly $18.5 million in our operations. This CapEx spending was in line with our 2024 CapEx target of between $75 million to $100 million. Those of you who follow the company closely will recognize that our 2024 CapEx target is well below our traditional spend. Our 2024 CapEx target is essentially a maintenance of business budget, and is the result of our weak cash flow generation in 2023. I will speak about our markets in a moment, but we're optimistic about our cash flow generation in light of improved pulp pricing expectations for the remainder of the year. Consequently, we are comfortable restarting our Torgau lumber expansion project and the Spokane shorting line project.

Both of them will provide significant added value and were originally contemplated as part of our investment strategy for each mill. We have also approved a handful of other small value adding projects, and as a result of these decisions, we now expect our CapEx to be between $95 million to $120 million in 2024. We will also continue to manage our working capital and costs closely. Despite our improved outlook for 2024, we believe the recovery for all our markets will be gradual. Overall, pulp markets have improved significantly in the quarter, with both the European and North American markets showing the most improvement, and China lagging a little bit. We're seeing strong demand from European paper and tissue producers, and this demand is primarily the result of merchant destocking and logistical challenges around Chinese imports.

To a lesser extent, we are seeing demand increases in North America as well. This strong demand is exacerbating the impact of the permanent closure of NBSK mills in the last two years. While the impact of the finished transport strike and the significant unplanned downtime of one of Finland's largest mills are also adding to the supply challenges. Looking forward, we expect upward pulp price pressure through the second quarter. In addition, pulp markets may face an even tighter supply situation should the Canadian railway unions take labor action, as they are currently threatening to do. We're implementing mitigation strategies, but ultimately, should this labor action be significant, it could negatively impact our ability to get our Canadian mills products to market.

Our mills run at near record levels in the quarter when comparing our first quarter production to Q4. Remember that Celgar took a 22-day major maintenance shut in Q4 of last year and Stendal took a one-day maintenance shut, while in Q1 we didn't have any at all. Our remaining major maintenance downtime for 2024 is as follows: In Q2, Peace River already has taken their 16-day maintenance shuts in April. This shut was extended by two days due to final work. In addition, Stendal will take a long 17-day shut. Combined, this downtime equals to roughly a loss of about 61,000 tons of production. In Q3, Rosenthal will have a 14-day maintenance shut, and Celgar will take a short four-day mini shut, which will amount to about 20,000 tons production loss in total during Q3.

As a reminder, Celgar has moved to an 18-month major maintenance schedule and will not have a major maintenance shut in 2024. Our solid wood segment results, although improved compared to Q4, are still not where we expected to be. The U.S. and European lumber markets were up slightly. However, high interest rates continue to weigh on housing starts and construction in general. We see the potential for lumber pricing improvements in Q2, but generally expect pricing to stay flat, with any improvement likely linked to improved economic data. We recognize there may be some short-term pricing upside due to recently announced lumber production curtailments or the realization of a prolonged Canadian railway strike. That said, we continue to believe that low lumber inventories, the large number of sawmill curtailments, relatively low housing stock wood shortages created by recent Canadian forest fires, and homeowner demographics are still very strong fundamentals for the construction industry, and this will put sustained positive pressure on the supply demand balance of this business in the midterm.

We continue to optimize our mix of lumber products and customers to current market conditions. As such, in Q1, 43% of our lumber sales volume was sold in the U.S. market, with a remainder sold in European and other markets. Shipping pallet market remains weak due to an overall weak European economy. Once the European economy begins to show signs of recovery, we expect pallet prices to return to normal levels, allowing our Torgau assets to deliver significant shareholder value. Heating pellet prices were down in Q1 due to expected seasonality in this market. In addition, the integration of the recently acquired mass timber assets continues to progress very well. We now have roughly 35% of North American mass timber production capacity, a broader range of product offerings, and a much larger geographic footprint, which gives us competitive access to the entire North American market.

We continue to see strong customer interest in our mass timber products, which has allowed us to build a significant order file. At the end of March, our order file totaled about $80 million. As I previously noticed, we are in the process of restarting strategic and high return CapEx projects at both Torgau and Spokane mills. The Torgau project is focused on the mill's woodyard and log infeed systems. Once completed in the late 2025, this project will allow the mill to produce more high-quality dimensional lumber. This project was originally envisioned as part of our investment strategy for this mill, and we're looking forward to completing this work while lumber prices are in cyclical lows. Similarly, the Spokane project is focused on the mill's wood infeed and sorting processes.

Once this project is complete in May 2025, the mill will be able to source lower-cost feedstock and process it into high-quality lamstock. Ultimately, this will significantly reduce the mill's fiber costs. In Q1, our overall pulp fiber costs decreased from Q4. In Germany, a steady supply of sawmill chips resulted in modest cost decreases, and in Canada, a ramp up of Peace River's wood room, and our Celgar wood strategy also pushed our fiber costs down in Q1. Looking ahead, we expect further modest declines in pulpwood costs at our mills in Q2, but we expect a slight increase to our sawlog costs due to strong demand. I am pleased with our new lignin extraction pilot plant ramp-up and the partnerships we have entered into to support the future commercialization of this product.

As a reminder, this new lignin plant is a large step towards Mercer being able to develop a portfolio of novel offerings before going commercial with it. We're excited about the future prospect of this product as a sustainable alternative to fossil fuel-based products such as in adhesives and advanced battery elements, to name only a few. This aligns perfectly with our strategy, which involves expanding into green chemicals and products that are compatible with a circular carbon economy. As the world becomes more sensitive to reducing carbon emissions, we believe that products like lignin, mass timber, green energy, lumber and pulp will play increasingly important roles in displacing carbon intensive products, products like concrete and steel for construction or plastic for packaging.

Furthermore, the potential demand for sustainable fossil fuel substitutes is very significant and has the potential to be transformative to the wood products industry. We remain committed to our 2030 carbon reduction targets, and believe our products form part of the climate change solution. In fact, we believe that in the fullness of time, demand for our low-carbon products will dramatically increase as the world looks for solutions to reduce its carbon emissions. We remain bullish on the long-term value of pulp, and are committed to better balance our company through faster growth in our lumber and mass timber businesses. In closing, I am pleased that our pulp markets are recovering a little more quickly than expected, and the fact that this improvement is giving us the confidence to increase our planned 2024 capital spend, which will allow the benefits from these key high-return projects to be realized even sooner.

We also expect an improved result from our solid wood business in Q2. As a reminder, we have an unusually heavy schedule of major maintenance in Q2, which will be a drag on what we're expecting, would otherwise be a strong financial quarter. We will remain focused on our cost saving initiatives, and we will also continue to work on rebalancing our assets in line with the execution of our strategic plan, and we'll continue to manage our cash and liquidity prudently. Thanks for listening, and I will now return the call to the operator for questions. Thanks.

(NASDAQ:MERC) Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Mercer International Inc. isn't one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (see the details here).

Operator: Good morning, and welcome to Mercer International's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. On the call today is Juan Carlos Bueno, Mercer's President and Chief Executive Officer, and Richard Short, Mercer's Chief Financial Officer and Secretary. I will now hand the call over to Richard.

Richard Short: Thanks, Liz. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I will begin by touching on the financial and operating highlights of the first quarter before turning the call to Juan Carlos to provide further color into the markets, our operations, and our strategic initiatives. Also, for those of you that are joining today's call by telephone, there is presentation material that we have attached to the Investors section of our website. But before turning to our results, I would like to remind you that we will make forward-looking statements in this morning's conference call according to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. I'd like to call your attention to the risks related to these statements, which are more fully described in our press release and in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

This quarter, our EBITDA was $64 million compared to Q4 EBITDA of $21 million. The improved results were driven by not having any major maintenance downtime, improving pulp sales realizations, and lower fiber and other production costs. Our pulp segment contributed quarterly EBITDA of $68 million, and our solid wood segment EBITDA was negative $1 million. You can find additional segment disclosures in our Form 10-Q, which can be found on our website and that of the SEC. In Q1, both our NBSK and NBHK sales realizations increased compared to Q4. Average list prices increased in Europe and North America due to stronger demand and global supply constraints. In China, prices were flat as demand slowed during the Chinese New Year and picked up near the end of the quarter.

The European NBSK list price averaged $1,400 per ton in the current quarter, an increase of $155 or 12% from Q4. And the North American NBSK list price averaged $1,440 per ton in the current quarter, an increase of $128 or 10% from Q4. In China, the Q1 average NBHK net price was $662 per ton, up $19 or about 3% compared to the Q4 average price, resulting in the market price gap between NBSK and NBHK in China, narrowing to about $83 per ton in Q1 from $105 per ton in Q4. The North American NBHK average Q1 list price was $1,223 per ton, up $140 or 13% from Q4. Total pulp sales volumes in the first quarter increased by 75,000 tons to 566,000 tons, driven by the timing of sales and higher production due to lower scheduled maintenance downtime. We had no scheduled maintenance downtime in Q1 compared to 23 days of downtime in Q4, which positively impacted Q1 EBITDA by about $23 million when compared to Q4.

After adjusting for the Q4 planned shuts, pulp production was essentially flat from the fourth quarter. For our solid wood segment, we had modest lumber pricing improvements in both Europe and the U.S. market. Despite the price increases, overall lumber demand remained subdued as a result of uncertain economic conditions in Europe and high interest rates. The random length U.S. benchmark for western SPF #2&Btr was $462 per thousand board feet at the end of Q1, compared to $422 at the end of Q4. Today, that benchmark price for western SPF #2&Btr is around $421 per thousand board feet, virtually unchanged from the beginning of 2024. For Q2, we are expecting generally flat lumber prices in the U.S. and European markets as demand remains weak. Lumber production was a near record 127 million board feet in Q1, up 14% due to seasonal downtime in the fourth quarter.

Lumber sales volumes were 121 million board feet, up 8% from Q4. Electricity sales totaled 259 gigawatt hours in the quarter, which was about the same as Q4. Pricing in Q1 modestly decreased to about $94 per megawatt hour from $98 in Q4 due to lower spot prices in Germany. In Q1, our pulp segment had lower fiber costs in Q4 as supplied remained stable. On the other hand, our solid wood segment had higher sawlog costs due to strong demand in Germany. Production for our solid wood segment's mass timber operations decreased in Q1 from Q4 due to minor customer driven delays for certain large-scale projects. These projects are now underway and we are satisfied with the order book today. In the first quarter, we made the strategic decision to dissolve the Cariboo mill joint venture, which resulted in the recording of a non-cash loss of roughly $24 million, or $0.35 per share.

We expect the transaction to only have a nominal impact on 2024 EBITDA. Juan Carlos will have more to say on this in a moment. We reported a consolidated net loss of $17 million for the first quarter, or $0.25 per share, compared to a net loss of $87 million, or $1.31 per share, in Q4. We consumed about $40 million of cash in Q1, compared to $30 million in Q4. The large cash usage in Q1 was primarily due to higher receivables, which were up roughly $64 million, driven by higher sales realizations and sales volumes. We expect the majority of this working capital bill to reverse in Q2. At the end of Q1, our liquidity position totaled $555 million, comprised of $274 million of cash and about $281 million of undrawn revolvers. Finally, our Board has approved a quarterly dividend of $0.075 per share for shareholders of record on June 26, for which payment will be made on July 3, 2024.

That ends my overview of the financial results. I'll now turn the call over to Juan Carlos.

Juan Carlos Bueno: Thanks, Rich. Our Q1 operating results improved significantly relatively to Q4. The improvement was primarily the result of higher pulp prices in combination with no major maintenance at any of our mills, and our results in Q1 also benefited from lower costs, including fiber and energy costs. Overall, all of our mills ran at near record production levels, while both our energy production and sales volumes were at record levels in Q1. As previously announced, we came to the decision to dissolve the Cariboo mill joint venture after reviewing this asset and its future prospect against the strategic priorities, and determined that dissolving the joint venture will allow us to focus our resources to areas more aligned with our long-term strategic goals.

I will also add that we were not expecting Cariboo to have any meaningful impact on our 2024 earnings. In Q1, we invested roughly $18.5 million in our operations. This CapEx spending was in line with our 2024 CapEx target of between $75 million to $100 million. Those of you who follow the company closely will recognize that our 2024 CapEx target is well below our traditional spend. Our 2024 CapEx target is essentially a maintenance of business budget, and is the result of our weak cash flow generation in 2023. I will speak about our markets in a moment, but we're optimistic about our cash flow generation in light of improved pulp pricing expectations for the remainder of the year. Consequently, we are comfortable restarting our Torgau lumber expansion project and the Spokane shorting line project.

Both of them will provide significant added value and were originally contemplated as part of our investment strategy for each mill. We have also approved a handful of other small value adding projects, and as a result of these decisions, we now expect our CapEx to be between $95 million to $120 million in 2024. We will also continue to manage our working capital and costs closely. Despite our improved outlook for 2024, we believe the recovery for all our markets will be gradual. Overall, pulp markets have improved significantly in the quarter, with both the European and North American markets showing the most improvement, and China lagging a little bit. We're seeing strong demand from European paper and tissue producers, and this demand is primarily the result of merchant destocking and logistical challenges around Chinese imports.

To a lesser extent, we are seeing demand increases in North America as well. This strong demand is exacerbating the impact of the permanent closure of NBSK mills in the last two years. While the impact of the finished transport strike and the significant unplanned downtime of one of Finland's largest mills are also adding to the supply challenges. Looking forward, we expect upward pulp price pressure through the second quarter. In addition, pulp markets may face an even tighter supply situation should the Canadian railway unions take labor action, as they are currently threatening to do. We're implementing mitigation strategies, but ultimately, should this labor action be significant, it could negatively impact our ability to get our Canadian mills products to market.

Our mills run at near record levels in the quarter when comparing our first quarter production to Q4. Remember that Celgar took a 22-day major maintenance shut in Q4 of last year and Stendal took a one-day maintenance shut, while in Q1 we didn't have any at all.

In Q3, Rosenthal will have a 14-day maintenance shut, and Celgar will take a short four-day mini shut, which will amount to about 20,000 tons production loss in total during Q3.

As a reminder, Celgar has moved to an 18-month major maintenance schedule and will not have a major maintenance shut in 2024. Our solid wood segment results, although improved compared to Q4, are still not where we expected to be. The U.S. and European lumber markets were up slightly.

As we the people reflect on the implications of the 300 per cent increase in electricity tariff for us and the social and human development sector, notably (education and health), let's continue to deconstruct how Germany ha continued to be a tower of strength to even North America on their unique vocational-technical education construct.

As I was saying last week here, In Germany, the state, too, benefits from the dual system through easing the burden on public budgets by participation of the enterprises and by keeping the workforce up-to-date. The German dual system has proved its success over a long period, and it still shows its ability to react quickly and effectively to the many changes currently affecting the economy and society. That is why I am doing this for the benefit of all at the national and sub-national levels - to tackle insecurity, now number-one public enemy.

Germany And U.S Skills Initiative

As part of the business-focused first meeting between former Chancellor Angela Merkel and former President Donald Trump back then, three CEO's of German companies and their respective apprentices met with the two leaders to discuss the benefits of the dual system of vocational training.

The U.S has had to engage Germany, in this conection because the dual system of vocational training in Germany has an excellent reputation worldwide. With more than 350 recognized training occupations nationwide and 1.5 million trainees, the programme has become a disk in the backbone of the German workforce. By combining theory and practice with equal time spent in vocational school and at the place of employment, employees are given a head start in their occupations by exiting their degree with both the required technical knowledge and hands-on experience.

Let's note this: it isn't the trainees alone who benefit from the dual system, nor does the burden fall entirely on companies. First and foremost, the programme is structured on financial burden sharing. Private companies bear about 75 per cent of costs, while the Federal Employment Agency and the German federal states handle the remaining 15 per cent and 10 per cent, respectively. Total cost per trainee lands under 20,000 dollars per person. Though it is a short-term investment for employers, it produces employees who are specialised in the technical skills needed to fit their company's needs

and is shown to increase employee retention.

Besides, the dual system is not an exclusive option for Germany, and with 3,400 German businesses providing 672,000 jobs in the United States, it is as much in the interest of German employers as American employers to consider the benefits of supporting vocational education stateside. Though investing in the United States is a long-maintained and healthy relationship for German businesses, job skills has been identified as a key challenge to their success in the U.S. market.

As such, the key focus of the then Angela Merkel's first meeting in the White House with President Donald Trump was trade policy. This included a meeting with business people and apprentices in a round-table discussion on skills and vocational training. CEO's of major German employers in the United States BMW, Siemens, and Schaeffler brought with them exemplary apprentices Marie Davis, Chad Robinson, and Maria Puckett, all of whom have benefited from the German model of vocationa training.

Let's study the profile of the three specialists who benefited from this diplomatic deal on skillset exchange programme:

Chad Robinson came to Washington as a representative of the apprenticeship program at Siemens gas turbine plant in Charlotte, North Carolina. Now an apprentice machinist, Chad said he initially received pushback from family that favored a traditional four year degree. However, when Chad was presented with the offer of a debt-free education and guaranteed end-of-program employment from Siemens, the offer was too good to refuse. Chad plans to continue his education at the end of his apprenticeship, continuing on to get a degree in engineering -- a degree that his employer plans to financially support. When asked what he wishes more people knew about working at a plant, Chad said, ""I wish they knew that plants or working in a trade isn't a 'dirty' profession. In fact, Siemens is spotless and modern -- much cleaner than my room!"" He also wanted others to understand that, like any career path, there were as many options for him to work his way up in his field.

Marie Davis of Cheraw, South Carolina came to Schaeffler by way of the U.S. Air Force. After serving for four years, she came home and was accepted into the Schaeffler Apprenticeship Program. The three year program involved both classroom and hands on experience and was completed in conjunction with Northeastern Technical College. Marie said she was originally exposed to the option of vocational training in high school and by an uncle who owns a machine tool company in Illinois. Having always enjoyed working with her hands, the program was a natural fit.

of BMW's famous Spartanburg, South Carolina facility originally auditioned for American Idol to pursue a music career upon high school graduation. After a friend exposed her to the apprenticeship program at BMW, she learned that she had just as much of an aptitude and passion for technical work. Maria said she loves representing women in a traditionally-male field and that she'd like to reduce the stigma in the United States of receiving a technical education and promote those options to local high schoolers.

Maria Puckett of BMW's famous Spartanburg, South Carolina facility originally auditioned for American Idol to pursue a music career upon high school graduation. After a friend exposed her to the apprenticeship program at BMW, she learned that she had just as much of an aptitude and passion for technical work. Maria said she loves representing women in a traditionally-male field and that she'd like to reduce the stigma in the United States of receiving a technical education and promote those options to local high schoolers.

The three apprentices and CEO's sat at a round table with other business leaders, journalists, and the two heads of government to elaborate on how they have personally and professionally benefited from vocational training. President Donald Trump had then stated in his press conference with Angela Merkel, ""We just concluded a productive meeting with the German and American companies to discuss workforce development and vocational training. Germany has done an incredible job training the employees and future employees and employing its manufacturing and industrial workforce. It's crucial that we provide our American workers with a really great employment outlook.""

Given time and exposure to alternative career paths, American employers -- especially those in manufacturing are likely to find vocational training to be a win-win for employer and employee.

This development was triggered by a development that leadership in both countries Germany and United States didn't ignore on human development indices: Some companies in America that are finding it difficult to hire and retain qualified industrial workers are looking to the German skills training model for inspiration, according to a Wall Street Journal article at the time.

""Two million U.S. manufacturing jobs will remain vacant over the next decade due to a shortage of trained workers, according to an analysis by the Manufacturing Institute, a nonprofit advocacy group affiliated with the National Association of Manufacturers, and professional-services firm Deloitte LLP.""

In Germany, the dual system of classroom learning and on-the-job training is used to train skilled workers in everything from manufacturing to hospitality. Young people decide before they leave school whether to pursue the trainee track or a college track. Trainees are paid by the company during their apprenticeship years and are often hired by the same companies. Uniform national standards and testing ensure that trainees who complete the programs can transport their skills to other companies.

The article specifically looked at the work of the Illinois Consortium for Advanced Technical Training (ICATT), which is working with the German-American Chamber of Commerce to get American companies in the region to adopt a German-style training system. Organisations in other states, specifically Michigan, Kentucky and Georgia, are also working with the German-American Chamber of Commerce.

The German Embassy in Washington launched the Skills Initiative in 2014 to share German best practices in skills training in America. The effort to bring more German-style training programs to the US got a boost in 2015 when the German Federal Ministries of Education, Economic Affairs, and Labour and the US Departments of Commerce, Labour, and Education signed a Joint Declaration of Workforce Training, which outlined the shared belief of the importance of technical education while strengthening ties between the nations.

I think this is what we should get our diplomatic missions to do wherever we post them. They are not there to sit down in the offices to expect allowances from Abuja. What are Nigeria's missions in Germany, Japan, South Korea, China, Mexico, Sinpapore, Thailand, Indonesia, UAE, Turkey etc doing for the advancement of knowledge and skills needed to develop our country at this time?

What do we get to exchange with even our neighbours in West Africa, notably Benin Republic, Togo and Ghana where our building project artisans are being sought by our builders? Can't we swallow our pride and vanity and collaborate with them and relearn from them what they have done to sustain their Technical Schools?

Without prejudice to the backgrounds of those who teach arts and social science subjects (where I belong), it is imperative that our ministries and education and education policy development experts put heads together on how to reward science and technology teachers in primary and post primary schools. That is where we rise and fall in this age. Those who teach (science, technology, engineering, mathematics (STEM) subjects should be encouraged to take degrees and National Certificates in Education (NCE) in all the science subjects not as second option.

The trouble with our education system has been that our children are now being forced to take up education faculty degrees when they can't get admission to read the popular courses such as Law, Medicine, Journalism, Accounting, Pharmacy, etc. This is tragically so because in this place no one wants his or her wards to read a teaching subjects where we ask teachers to wait for their rewards in heaven. This is where so many Scandinavian countries, notably Finland have taught the world to get quality of manpower from the quality of teachers they reward far above other public servants.

Specifically, science and technology hold the key to the progress and development of any nation even at this time. Tehnology play a fundamental role in wealth creation, improvement of th quality of life and real economic growth and transformation in this 21stc entury that social technologies daily shape.

So, the Tinubu administration that is upbeat about first year in office this month, should call for experts to help the Ministries of Education, Science and Technology to develop the framwwork for robust investments in science and technogy teachers. They should also renew their minds about the expediency of re-equipping the universities for the challenges of 21st century research and development - instead of fighting teachers in the universities.",guardian.ng,news,The Guardian,,0.3960784313725489,453187541,1,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Uchenna-Nnaji-640x360.jpg,

Einstein defined the 20th century with the revelation that mass is a form of energy. Today's theoretical physics posits something more fundamental: Mass and energy are all information. The 21st century will be defined by the recognition that the most powerful form of energy is the manipulation of information: compute. The companies that control compute will be the most dominant businesses in history.

Energy has been the tail that wags every dog from the beginning of economies. Yet, the narrative in the equity markets now is that Big Oil has passed the reins to Big Tech. It's a practical observation: The majority of the most valuable firms in 1980 and 2024 were/are in energy and tech, respectively. However, the construction of acres of data centers and the energy investments needed to power them reflect a deeper convergence. AI is accelerating Big Tech's transformation from an industry that sells computers to an industry that sells compute. And in a knowledge economy, compute is energy.

Power Up

Ten thousand years ago, energy was the only industry. The world ran on thew (muscle power), and food was the energy source. Settled agriculture in the fertile Middle East created surpluses, and economics emerged as the science of trading that surplus - exchanging energy. We then unlocked the energy in organic matter (wood, coal, oil), machines supplanted muscles, and the energy business became the business of powering machines. Oil's unrivaled source material for machine power has created wealthy nations out of deserts. Big Tech companies may dominate the league tables of market capitalization, but energy remains the revenue king. Six of the 10 largest firms by revenue are energy companies, and the industry generates more revenue than any other. However... tech looks more similar to energy each year.

CapEx = Moats = Profits

The energy business requires massive capital expenditures, allocated on data and faith, offering unrivaled payoffs for those who wager correctly. If the whaling industry is the origin story of venture capital, energy is the original gangster of CapEx. Investment across all energy sources will total $2.8 trillion in 2024. Fossil fuel companies, responsible for $1 trillion of that CapEx, generate $4 trillion in revenue. Exxon Mobil (XOM) spent $23 billion on CapEx in 2023, and made $36 billion in profit. The investments are chunky: The UK's newest nuclear plant, under construction in Somerset, is projected to cost $57 billion. Planning the 20th century energy's mega-projects required the development of a new science of forecasting, Shell's (SHEL) famous ""scenario planning"" process. Side note: Scenario planning is not predicting the future, but determining which decisions will register the best outcome(s) across several possible futures.

Now Big Tech is flexing its own thew. In 2024, the tech giants will spend the GDP of Finland ($300 billion, give or take), mainly on data centers - the modern equivalent of oilfield development. Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) spent $12 billion in the last quarter alone, up 90% year over year, Microsoft (MSFT) spent $14 billion, up 79%, and Amazon (AMZN) $14 billion. Tech does not match global energy investment yet, but individually, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta (META), and Microsoft will spend more in CapEx this year than Exxon Mobil, Chevron (CVX), or Saudi Aramco (ARMCO). Meta operates 18 data centers that cover the same area as 19 Disneylands. The Core in Las Vegas, one of the world's largest data centers, has its own hype video. (About 1 minute in, it gets... impressive.)

Big Tech's profits are also historic, and growing. Last week, Alphabet added $200 billion in market cap (to reach $2 trillion) after beating profit estimates by 25%, and Apple also added $200 billion after an earnings beat and announcing a $110 billion share buyback. Both generated more net income than Exxon Mobil in 2023, as did Microsoft.

More, I Want More

Energy companies can justify these investments because our imagination for uses of energy is limitless. The iron law of big(ger) energy: The more we generate, the more we use. There's no such thing as too much energy. Energy is the antithesis of GLP-1 drugs. With energy, the more we consume, the hungrier we get.

Energy = Prosperity

Wealth and energy consumption are correlated. It's not just power for profligate lifestyles, but productive power: light, cooking and storing food, communications networks, building, transport. Academic estimates of optimal per capita energy consumption only trend up. No number of energy-efficient microwaves and double-paned windows can counter the consumption of billions moving into the middle class: Global energy consumption is projected to increase 44% by 2050.

Tech's appetite is also insatiable. Tech's Iron Rule is Moore's Law: Processing power doubles every two years. Nitpicking about the technical details aside, the principle has held true since 1965. ""How will we use this power?"" Queried nobody, ever. Intel (INTC), a client of my first firm, Prophet, impressed on us its singular strategic vision. They invested massive CapEx in fabrication plants for chips they hadn't invented for applications they hadn't imagined. In sum, ""If we build it, they will come."" Nobody needed a faster chip until Apple showed the world a graphical user interface, until Netscape browsed the Web, until God (Google) began responding to any prayer/query with millions of answers, or until a new god (ChatGPT) responded to your prayer with a single answer. Intel stumbled with the transition to mobile, but the paradigm hasn't changed. There's no such thing as too much compute.

The New New Energy

Big Tech isn't just similar to the energy business, it is the new energy business. AI's growing power requirements make this concrete. AI compute requirements are doubling every 100 days, dramatically countervailing the gains in efficiency that every AI evangelist boasts about after vomiting that it will save/destroy humanity. Training the trillion-plus-parameter models being stewed in a medium-size city (San Francisco) requires the energy consumption of a small country. One ChatGPT request requires 10 times the energy of a Google search. In five years, the incremental energy demand of AI will be equivalent to 40 million homes - more than California, Texas, Florida, and New York combined. Data centers make up 3% of total U.S. power demand, but that's projected to triple by 2030. BTW, 2030 is the same distance into the future as the finale of Game of Thrones is in the past (2019).

To feed their data centers, tech companies are investing billions in energy production and storage. The WSJ reports Big Tech execs descended on this year's annual oil and gas conference, hunting for energy. Bill Gates was the featured speaker. Amazon, the largest corporate buyer of renewable energy, has over 500 projects operating or in development. Announcements of new data centers are accompanied by commitments to develop new wind and solar farms to provide the power.

Compute = Energy2

The convergence of tech and energy reflects tech's transition from selling computing tools to selling compute itself. We don't buy DVD players and discs, we stream. We don't buy maps, we get directions. We don't purchase film, we capture images. Apple, the most profitable product company in history, depends on services for growth. Amazon, the Apple of retail, is a data center business that offers retail.

AI pushes this trend to everything and everyone. Search, the most profitable business in history, will be replaced by Answers. Spreadsheets and browsers will be replaced by agents. ""Apps"" and ""programs"" will be mutable, evolving code organisms raised by other agents. According to energy conference keynote speaker Bill Gates: ""Agents will affect how we use software as well as how it's written... They'll replace word processors, spreadsheets, and other productivity apps. Businesses that are separate today - search advertising, social networking with advertising, shopping, productivity software - will become one business."" Sam Altman believes that compute will be ""the currency of the future,"" the world's most precious commodity.

In the 21st century, humanity has added a new page to physics, a new form of energy: compute. Just as our bodies convert the chemical energy of food into heat and mechanical energy, as solar panels convert the sun's electromagnetic energy into electricity, data centers convert electrical energy to compute, and it powers the digital economy. As with other forms of energy, compute is created by the largest companies in the world, who have staggering capital to build moats the width of the Amazon (the river). As with other forms of energy, its consumption is inextricably linked with prosperity and growth. Compute defies economic gravity - increased supply speedballs demand. The future of energy isn't renewable, but computable.

No Free Lunch

The passing of the torch from energy to tech felt good for a hot minute, because energy has gotten too in touch with its dark side. Energy firms invented the term ""externality"": carbon, corruption, and capitalism as a Sith Lord. In contrast, tech felt better. Mark, Sheryl, Larry, Sergei, and Jeff were just too cute, too likable to be that evil... they even told us they would do no evil.

But then kids started harming themselves, misinformation proliferated, and our discourse became coarse. Wait... the tech lords are not better than the titans of Big Oil, they're worse. Actually, they're neither - they are the same.

Any arbitrage of one substance to another for economic gain creates emissions. Plants to beef: methane. Fossil fuels to motion: carbon. Attention to advertising: rage. To believe the great arbitrage of compute won't create extraordinary externalities is to believe that Zuckerberg/Sandberg/Brin/Bezos would prioritize the well-being of the commonwealth over their wealth. If we could go back 100 years to the beginning of the fossil fuel era, or 20 years to the start of social, what would we do differently?

Many argue that Big Tech is capitalism collapsing under its own weight. A jockey who's lost control of a thoroughbred. Regulating compute is similar to a 5-foot, 110-pound jockey mounting a Tyrannosaurus Rex. We know it will be ungainly. The bigger question is, will it be violent?

Alexandre L'Heureux - President and Chief Executive Officer

Alain Michaud - Chief Financial Officer

Good morning, everyone. Welcome to WSP's First Quarter 2024 Results Conference Call.

I would now like to turn the meeting over to Quentin Weber, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Mr. Weber.

Quentin Weber

Good morning. We hope you are all doing well, and thank you for joining our call today. We will be discussing our Q1 2024 performance followed by a Q&A Session.

Joining us today this morning are Alexandre L'Heureux, our President and CEO; and Alain Michaud, our CFO.

Please note that this call is also accessible on our website via webcast.

During the call, we will be making some forward-looking statements and actual results could differ from those expressed or implied. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any of these statements. Relevant factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those forward-looking statements are listed in our MD&A for the quarter that ended March 31, 2024, which can be found on SEDAR and on our website.

In addition, during the call, we may refer to certain non-IFRS measures. These measures are also defined in our MD&A for the quarter that ended March 31, 2024. Our MD&A includes reconciliations of non-IFRS measures to the most directly comparable IFRS measures. Management believes that these non-IFRS measures provide useful information to investors regarding the corporation's financial condition and results of operation as they provide additional key metrics of its performance. These non-IFRS measures are not recognized under IFRS, do not have any standardized meaning described under IFRS and may differ from similarly named measures as reported by other issuers, and accordingly, may not be comparable. These measures should not be viewed as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with IFRS.

I am pleased with our first quarter performance as it sets a solid foundation for the remainder of 2024 and reflects the positive momentum we continue to experience in our business. Globally, our backlog and pipeline of opportunities remains robust across all sectors, especially in the Americas, which recorded a double-digit organic backlog growth.

In Q1, we delivered strong results in line with our expectations, and our top line and profitability continued to trend positively.

During the quarter, we continued to future-proof WSP, over-indexing three core elements. First, we focus on optimizing our global platform to unlock even more possibilities and drive sustained organic growth and margin improvement. Second, we added expertise and new clients through a number of acquisitions completed in the first quarter. And third, we remain dedicated to being the premier partner to our clients and our communities. And let me review each in further detail.

On the - optimization front, I'm sorry, we elevated further our outstanding platform, seizing productivity opportunities and bolstering project performance. These efforts are allowing us to already report an impressive increase of 50 basis points in adjusted EBITDA margin when compared to the first quarter of 2023. Moreover, it provides us with the confidence to deliver on our three-year strategic plan ambitions to increase our margin profile by at least 150 basis points.

We also concluded the go-live of our global ERP in the UK. This region is the third key geography to onboard to the platform after Canada and the U.S., and we now have over 70% of our EBITDA converted and more than 50% of our employees on the new platform. This is one of the largest transformation we have undergone as a business, and it covers the modernization of our sales, procurement, project management, HR and finance functions.

We are already beginning to reap the benefits of this initiative through enhanced business intelligence capabilities, the exchange of best practices, the leveraging of insights and data, and increased collaboration. Also, we are pleased to report that our deployment schedule is on plan and on budget.

Since the beginning of the year, we have continued to bolster our platform by deploying capital towards strategic acquisitions, and we have announced four transactions recently. The first, Communica, is one of Canada's leading indigenous and stakeholder engagement and information management consulting firms. It is recognized for its collaborative approach and its ability to deliver authentic, open and transparent stakeholder and wider community engagement, including with indigenous - sorry -communities. This acquisition reinforces WSP's commitment to delivering impactful community projects and enhances its ability to respond to the increasing demand for stakeholder engagement and information management services.

The second is Proxion, one of Finland's largest rail consultancies, that offers a range of railway and railway system design services, including traffic and energy services as well as safety and security expertise. Proxion adds key rail expertise in Finland to WSP's transport and infrastructure capabilities in the Nordics, and strengthens our market position and ability to lead large-scale projects in the Finnish market. By combining our respective expertise and teams, we aim to elevate our capabilities, broaden our portfolio and strengthen our market position in the country.

The third is 1A Ingenieros, a Spanish consulting firm in transmission and distribution, operating mainly in the power and energy sector, which will enhance WSP capabilities in Spain, creating a strong multidisciplinary business in the region with a balanced portfolio in our core end markets. It will also increase our local workforce by approximately 70% and expand our geographical presence in the country by adding four new regions. Through this acquisition, WSP will be positioned as one of the leading international engineering firms in Spain.

The fourth is AKF Group, a specialized mechanical, electrical firm that design complex health care, science and technology and mission-critical facilities. AKF enables us to strengthen our scale in the U.S. and expand our expertise within property and building by 20% in the U.S. alone. Through this acquisition, we aim to enhance our technical practice and boost our capabilities and presence in several essential high-end demand markets, and in a variety of sectors, such as corporate, cultural, health care, education, hospitality, retail, science and technology.

The sustained expansion of our platform is attributable to strategic capital deployment and organic growth, but also to nurturing our internal talent and resources. This is why I am proud that we continue to focus on internal promotions and have set high ambitions in our strategic action plan.

In 2023, we filled over 75% of our global leadership roles with internal candidates. And since the beginning of the fiscal year, another example was Joe Sczurko being promoted to the role of President of our business in the United States. Joe brings decades of invaluable leadership experience and a deep understanding of the industry and evolving client needs. I'm thrilled to see him and many others take on new challenges.

The third core element of focus in the quarter was and will continue to be elevating the standard in client experience and being a premier partner to communities. We are making great strides on this front as witnessed by some recent project wins. Today, I have selected three that best illustrate this.

In the UK, we have confirm our work on one of the largest programs ever won by WSP in the UK in terms of scale, revenue, length and complexity, which is aligned with our ambition to stay at the forefront of the energy transition and brings exciting new career opportunities for our talent.

The Great Grid Upgrade is a major program to deliver electricity transmission infrastructure across the United Kingdom and enable 50 gigawatts of network capacity by 2030. It is a critical step in the pathway to net zero to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and enable the shift towards renewable energy.

WSP has been appointed as one of seven industry partners tasked with providing over £9 billion worth of design and construction for national grids over 12 years. Our scope consists of providing professional services across the whole delivery life cycle, from early stage scheme development to environmental services, planning, consent and detailed design. This win is well aligned with our ambitions to stay at the forefront of the energy transition and bring exciting new career opportunities for our talent.

In Los Angeles, we have also signed a new $100 million U.S. program management contract to support LA County Metro on the 15-mile light rail extension to Southeast Los Angeles County, which connect underserved communities from ten cities to downtown Los Angeles. The project is important as it broadens the scope of WSP traditional design services for this important customer. During the selection process, WSP scored highest amongst competing firms, achieving the best score in each of the major categories: firm experience and capabilities, key personnel and project approach. WSP has been the leader in the rail and transit sector in the U.S. since the design of the New York City subway system in the 1880s, and we fully intend to remain in the top position.

In Australia, we are supporting the Queensland Train Manufacturing Program, which aims to deliver 65 new six-car passenger trains in time for the Brisbane 2032 Olympic and Paralympic games. This initiative is a pivotal support system for the region's growing population and economy. The program will not only boost Queensland's jobs market, but also offers substantial training and development opportunities. WSP provides civil, structural, rail, geotechnical, building and power design services for the greenfield facility. These three examples are a testament to the types of projects that allow us to partner with like-minded clients and deliver projects that profoundly enhance and impact the lives of communities.

On that note, I will now invite Alain to review our financial results.

Alain Michaud

Thanks, Alex. I am very pleased this morning to report on our strong results for the first quarter of 2024, where we've seen net revenue grow organically by 4.6%, EBITDA by 8% and earnings per share by 13%.

Let me elaborate further on each of these points, starting with our top line. For the first quarter, revenues and net revenue reached $3.6 billion and $2.8 billion, up 2.7% and 4.7%, respectively, compared to the first quarter of 2023. We achieved net revenue organic growth of approximately 6.5% when normalized for the same number of billable days compared to Q1 2023. As stated in our outlook issued in March, these additional billable days will reverse in Q4.

Backlog as of March 30, 2024, stood at $14.2 billion, representing 11.8 months of revenues. And of interest, as Alex stated, the Americas reportable segment achieved organic backlog growth of 10.3% over the last 12 months.

Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter reached $446 million, up 7.9% compared to the first quarter of 2023. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter reached 16%, an increase of 50 basis points when compared to the first quarter of 2023. And for the last 12 months, our EBITDA margin now stands at 17.7%. This increase is mainly attributable to our continued focus on productivity, as evidenced by a reduction in our personnel costs as a percentage of net revenues.

For the quarter, adjusted net earnings reached $194 million or $1.55 per share, up approximately 13% compared to the first quarter or 2023.

Free cash outflow reached $125 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, better than the same period last year and slightly of expectation.

Our DSO stood at 76 days as of the end of March, stable and unchanged when compared to December 31, 2023.

Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio stood at 1.6 times, within management's target range of one to two times.

As we progress through our business transformation journey, we continue to aim for 100% conversion of net earnings to free cash flow for 2024.

In conclusion, we're off to a great start with a solid set of results, a strong operating plan and healthy market conditions. We are therefore reiterating our outlook with confidence.

Well, thank you, Alain. Given our prudent start of 2023, compared to our solid start in 2024 and given our progress made in the current strategic cycle, we are confident in the future. We welcomed approximately 10,000 employees through 15 acquisitions since the beginning of our plan, and notably, for since the beginning of the current year. We continue to have a promising pipeline of growth opportunities, a solid balance sheet and looking at the rest of 2024, we are moving forward with confidence. Our focus remains on delivering on our ambitions bolstered by healthy market conditions.

Our shared vision and collective efforts are the cornerstone of our success, and I am confident they will continue to guide us on our journey to be recognized as the undisputed leader in our industry.

On a final note, I would encourage you to explore our 2024 Global ESG Report which will be published shortly. You are also invited to take part in our Annual General Meeting which will be held in person and virtually at 11 a.m. Eastern Standard Time today. More details can be found on our website.

Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. We will now take our first question. First question is from the line of Benoît Poirier from Desjardins. Please go ahead.

Benoît Poirier

Yes, good morning, Alain. Good morning Alex. And congratulations for the strong start.

Yes. Just in terms of headcount, you added about 700 people so far this year. Obviously, you've been through four M&A transactions. So I was just curious to know how many people came from acquisition? And what's your expectation for the remainder of the year in light of your growth trajectory? And also, if you could comment about the greatest opportunities you still see from the productivity improvement standpoint.

Alexandre L'Heureux

Well, look, I think if I start with M&A, we have a very good start. I'm very pleased with where we stand at this point in time and the pipeline is healthy, so I'm confident that the remainder of the year should bear fruit. So I think, on that front, I'm feeling good that we should have a good year in 2024.

Yes. So on headcount, Benoît, with the Communica and Proxion acquisition in Q1, we've added about 200 people. Our focus is, as we've discussed many times in 2023 and at the start of 2024, we've been heavily engaged on maximizing the productivity of our business. So, headcount growth is important, but it's a balancing act, delivering also on increased productivity and efficiency. So, we are in line with our budget in terms of growth of headcount. And for the remainder of the year, we intend to continue on a similar path of maximizing our productivity.

You need to remember that the last two acquisitions have been completed in Q2.

Yes. Yes. Okay. That's great color. And some of your peers mentioned weakness in the Chinese housing market as well as in the UK, where one player proceeded to some cut headcount in their transportation division. I know China is not material for you, but I was wondering if there was any update and whether you were seeing anything similar.

Alexandre L'Heureux

No. Benoît - I mean, actually yes. I think we've consistently been saying over the last three or four quarters that Asia is challenging. There's no doubt about that. Having said all that, as you just mentioned, Mainland China for us, it's 300 people out of 67. So for us, it's de minimis.

As it relates to the UK market, we are not seeing what has been perhaps described by others. The market is - we are feeling good about our performance. We are feeling extremely good around our recent win of a national grid which would provide good organic growth for the business for years to come. So overall, I'm extremely pleased with our performance in the UK market.

Thank you. We will now take our next question. This is from the line of Chris Murray from ATB Capital Markets. Please go ahead.

Chris Murray

Yes, thanks. Good morning. Just really quick, just looking at the backlog in Canada, the organic number was actually slightly negative this quarter. Just wondering if there's anything going on, or is this sort of a temporary thing? If you can just give us more color on maybe the reason for the - for it being kind of flat to down?

Alain Michaud

Yes, Chris, if anything, we feel extremely confident with the backlog in Canada and the market condition, it's mostly timing related, the ins and outs of a larger job. Underlying business is performing quite well and the backlog is solid. So no issue in Canada. Same comment for the Americas for that matter. And across the map...

Alexandre L'Heureux

I am feeling very, very good about Canada at this point.

Chris Murray

All right. No, that's helpful. And then just following on maybe your comments about the ERP system, so congratulations on getting to 70% complete. But thinking maybe over the next year or two, what's left to be done on this program? And is it fair to think that it should be substantially complete by the end of this fiscal year?

Alain Michaud

Well, currently, as Alex said, 70% of our EBITDA. So Canada, U.S. and UK is done. And when we reflect that what we've achieved since the beginning of the year, it's 25,000 and more that have been onboarded on the platform. So we're extremely proud of that and proud of our team that have devoted significant effort on that front. We are now moving to the East, and there is other region to be done, the Nordics, Australia, New Zealand. So, I think it's more 2025 calendar year that we will see the majority of our business into one platform. That's the intention, Chris.

Alexandre L'Heureux

The way, Chris, I am thinking about it and the way I think you should view this is, is we have - I'd like to think, and I'm saying that in a very - I'm obviously cautious in the way I'm saying it. But I feel we have substantially derisked this program at this point in time with our three largest countries on the platform, with 70% of our profit on the platform. However, we are operating in 60 countries. So the remainder 30% will take a bit more time, but we're highly confident that things are going to go well and they are going to be smooth.

What I am especially proud of is, and you may have noticed it in our numbers, yes, the DSOs have increased slightly. But given the sheer task that we had to go through, I'm very proud that we kept our DSO stable, and I feel it's only going to improve from now.

Thank you. We'll now take our next question. [Operator Instructions] This is from the line of Jacob Bout from CIBC. Please go ahead.

Yes, I had a question just on M&A. I know you are saying that the pipeline looks pretty strong. But maybe you could talk a bit about how the pipeline is looking for the mid- to larger-sized acquisitions.

And then my second question, just on the M&A, what the margin profile of recent acquisitions look like.

Alexandre L'Heureux

Yes. Margin acquisition of the acquisition we just - the margin, sorry, of the acquisition we just completed are fairly similar to our margin profile at this point in time. However, we continue to believe that we can improve the margin profile of those firms as soon as they - we are in a position to integrate them into our platform. So, feeling very good about this, Jacob.

Look, around mid- to larger-size acquisition, I think, I've said that in numerous occasions in the past, it's extremely difficult to time acquisition. Oftentimes, it takes many years to convince a firm to join your ranks. It takes a lot of nurturing. What I can tell you is that we are - I continue to have formal and informal discussions with smaller-size, medium-size and larger-size acquisitions. I cannot guarantee you when we are going to complete these. But what I can tell you is that I am encouraged by the discussions that I am having right now.

Jacob Bout

Okay, that's fair. Maybe just going back to backlog and just looking specifically at APAC. It's down organically year-on-year, talked a bit about China, but how about Australia and New Zealand? I know you called out the timing of some projects there, but are you expecting a slowdown or is this just all timing in your view?

Alexandre L'Heureux

I think in New Zealand with the recent election, I think, there has been a pause, like any governments. Now I think it's more center-right government and took a pause on infrastructure spending. We expect that to change and resume in due course. Are we overly concerned by that? No. I think we're calm when things are hot and we are calm when things are cooling off a little bit because we believe this is timing and infrastructure needs are needed.

Same with Australia. We've experienced double-digit organic growth for, I think, two years now. So obviously, we're starting from a higher base, but the activity level is good. We have a very strong business. We have a very strong team. So I'm positive in the longer term for that region.

And yes, Asia, as I said earlier on today, it's been challenging and I believe will continue to be challenging for some time. Thankfully, for us, this is a small part of our business.

Thank you. We'll now take our next question. This is from Devin Dodge from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.

A couple of questions, maybe not so much related to Q1, but maybe longer term, but look, the demand environment is really quite strong across many of your regions. How do you think about the balance between pursuing the growth opportunities that are available and being more selective in your bidding activity to drive margin expansion?

Alexandre L'Heureux

Well, this is a balancing act, as you just mentioned, right? If I look where we are today as a company, WSP, I look at the brand awareness of the company, I look at the type of projects that we are now in the position to tackle as a prime designer or prime consultant, and I compare that to where we were five, seven, eight, nine, ten years ago. We are in a different space.

Again, I mentioned and I highlighted three projects this morning that is a testament of what I just mentioned. I look at the great strides that we're making in sectors where three, four years ago, we were not big. I mentioned a few quarters ago the award of Propel project and other energy transition projects in the State of New York. Massive project for us. And now National Grid.

Three, four years ago, we were not there. So I was telling our Board this week, the absolute number in organic growth is obviously important. And we're pleased, if you compare orange, with oranges or apples with apples that we grew 6.5% this quarter. But it's the type of growth that we are able to generate in sectors where we were fairly small few years ago I am extremely pleased with the type of award that we are able to secure right now.

So that's telling me that we are continuing to diversify the platform. We continue to grow in sectors where we were not a leading firm. And then we continue to capitalize on the sectors where we have a strong presence. And the Proxion acquisition in Finland is a testament or an example of that. Now in the rail sector where we have the leadership franchise around the world, we're going to be able to tackle large projects in Finland. So overall, I'm feeling very good about that.

And even though we're going through a conversion, an ERP conversion, we have been able to increase our utilization and we have been able to increase our margin over the recent past. So I feel, as Alain mentioned, our team should be commended for the extraordinary work that has been accomplished recently.

Devin Dodge

Excellent, that's good color. Okay. Second question on PFAS, lots of interest on the back of the EPA releasing some final rules last month.

Do you view this as an opportunity for WSP? And if so, can you walk us through the services that you provide and where you expect to see the most benefit going forward?

Alexandre L'Heureux

Tremendous opportunities. Perhaps, Alain, you can cover that. But clearly, for us, like any other firms in the space, it's a real opportunity. The rules and the regulation are strict and the requirements will increase demands for our services. So I feel that, over the coming years, we'll have our share, and we'll be winning our share of work in that space. Alain?

Alain Michaud

Yes, definitely positive, Devin, in terms of development. The rules in the U.S. are probably the most strict that we've seen. But I think it bodes well for our expert. We probably have around 500 PFAS expert in the U.S. alone. Our backlog in Q1 has already seen some good level of work. So we're extremely positive about the impact of the new regulation and the flow of work that should come our way given our expertise and profile in the space.

Thank you. We'll now take our next question, this is from Frederic Bastien from Raymond James. Please go ahead.

[Foreign Language] Guys, I'd like to circle back on M&A for a bit. And really wondering what has changed from an internal or external standpoint to make you say, ""Hey, okay, now it's time to open up the M&A valve again?""

Alexandre L'Heureux

Yes. If you remember, Frederic I think, it was the last quarter, yes, at the last investor call, I mentioned that we viewed 2023 as a year of consolidation. Last year alone, we grew our top line by over 20%. Yes, not all of this was organic growth, there was a lot of acquisition growth, but we grew our top line by one fifth in one year. So I consider that to be very meaningful and very transformative.

So, last year was a year of consolidation, we wanted to extract the value from the platform. We wanted to complete the integration of Golder, we wanted to activate our work on the integration of Wood E&I. So that's why I considered last year, a year of consolidation. This year, we've had a strong start of the year. Mind you, these are not large acquisitions, but are very strategic to us.

And yes, we're clearly open for business. We have a strong balance sheet. As I said before, I feel we have substantially derisked the ERP project and transformation. So, I feel that all of the ingredients are now in place for us to continue to grow inorganically and organically.

Frederic Bastien

Thank, super helpful. Next one is perhaps for Alain. We saw better-than-expected margin expansion in the quarter, at least from my standpoint, and that sets you up quite nicely for the rest of the year. Do you anticipate similar gains in future quarters? Or will we see a bit of variability as we build into Q2, Q3 and Q4?

Alain Michaud

Yes. So as Alex said, we are very proud of the lift in Q1. We usually have lower margin expansion in the first quarter of the year, so we are extremely proud about that. We've devoted significant effort on working on all those levers, as you know, Fred, on productivity. We are certainly aiming to push and continue to increase margin in the following quarter. And we're feeling confident about the 65 basis point increase that we have guided for the full year. We'll keep on working hard and pushing hard on improving productivity of the firm.

Frederic Bastien

Okay. But do you expect that to be linear? Or I mean, 65% is a massive improvement. Would that be backend loaded?

Alexandre L'Heureux

You are very persistent. That's the intention, to continue to push in that direction.

Thank you. We'll now take the next question. This is from Maxim Sytchev from NBF. Please go ahead.

Alex, maybe the first question for you, if I may. In terms of - certainly, it feels like there is a theme emerging when it comes to power. Big win in UK, Spanish acquisition. We are reading that UK will need to [indiscernible] by a factor of seven when it comes to [indiscernible] energy transition. Do you mind maybe expanding a little bit on this important theme and maybe the opportunity potentially in the U.S. and Canada, how to sort of take advantage of all this? Thank you so much.

Alexandre L'Heureux

Yes. Look, you've been following us for a very long time, Max, so you know us inside out. We've always have taken a very disciplined approach in the way we're building our firm. And as I said, the first pillar we started with more than ten years ago was with property and building, then we moved to transportation infrastructure, and we continue to raise the bar in those two sectors.

More recently, we said that we wanted to become the leading firm in the green transition, so we build our pillar around Earth and Environment. And now I feel that we are ready to make a big push in the energy transition. So more recently, we've invested a lot in talent, and we invested a lot of effort in growing our presence in that sector. And as I said before, I could not be prouder of the work that has been accomplished.

And this strat plan to grow our presence there, I think now we're tackling some of the largest energy transition program in the United States and in the UK, so I'm extremely pleased about that. And you're right in pointing out that our push in Central Europe with a 250-people acquisition in transmission and distribution is another example of our core strategy at this point in time. So yes, we're going to continue to push in that sector.

Maxim Sytchev

I appreciate that, thanks. And then one other follow-up that I have, do you have any update in terms of IIJA and how that funding is flowing through? And how should we think about this in terms of the impact? Thank you.

Alain Michaud

I could take that one, Max. So, the latest number that have been published, there's about 40% of funding that have been deployed. This is April data, and it's up from February data by more than 30%. So we were at 30% deployment in February, 40% in April. So it's moving certainly in the right direction. 40,000 projects have been awarded, funding through the Biden Infrastructure Bill. So that continues to support our thesis around and our confidence around the U.S. And if you combine that with the regulation on PFAS we've covered before, we continue to feel very strong about the U.S. and especially given our leadership position in the transportation business. And I have to say transportation represents currently about two third of all the funding that have been deployed through the bill. So that's good news for us and supports our thesis.

Thank you. We'll now take the next question, this is from Michael Tupholme from TD Securities. Please go ahead.

This may tie into the last answer you just provided there regarding IIJA, but the 10.3% organic growth in backlog in the Americas that you've highlighted a few times. Can you talk a little bit about the areas that drove that increase in the quarter?

Alexandre L'Heureux

All the sector, Michael. I mean, transportation, property and building, earth and environment, we are seeing growth in those sectors. We've seen growth in power, as I talked about. So at the moment, I feel we are going to continue to grow in those sectors. And one that I would perhaps add as well is advanced manufacturing. We are doing more work in that space, and I expect to continue more and more. So that also is a real opportunity for us to grow and to develop new sectors.

Michael Tupholme

And it doesn't sound like it from your response just now or any of your other comments. But more broadly, when we look across the business from an end market perspective, are there any areas that are looking weaker right now or causing you to be concerned at all?

Alexandre L'Heureux

Are you talking in the Americas or you're talking globally?

Michael Tupholme

Globally, and I don't mean regionally. I mean, I know you've touched on Asia as a - and China regionally. But just from an end market perspective globally, is there anything that you see is slower?

Alexandre L'Heureux

I don't think we can look at our sectors and conclude that things are slowing down to the contrary I feel we're in a good spot right now. But yes, there are some pockets of geographies that are more challenging than others. But for the most part, I feel our top countries are performing well at this point.

Michael Tupholme

Perfect. And then just lastly, looking at the margins in the APAC segment, you did see a decline in EBITDA margins year-over-year in Q1. I see from the commentary that the performance in Asia was the source of that. I guess I'm just wondering how we should think about APAC margins going forward as you move through the year? Is there an opportunity to grow margins? Or how should we be thinking about margins?

Alexandre L'Heureux

Actually, Australia margin profile, we're not reporting the different countries, but just to give you a sense, in Australia, we have seen our margin profile going up, not going down. Equally, New Zealand has been stable. So overall, I think we're feeling good.

Alain Michaud

And if you look at Asia specifically, Q1 last year was a quasi-normal quarter, so the comparison Q1 over Q1 is a little tougher. But if you look sequentially versus Q4, Asia is not significantly moving down. So overall, if you think about Australia and New Zealand, feeling confident about their margin profile improvement for the rest of the year and stabilization in Asia.

Thank you. We'll now take the next question. This is from Michael Doumet from Scotiabank. Please go ahead.

Hey Alex. You guys discussed productivity again as being a focus in 2024 and when I look at the project margins and the improvement there, obviously great in the first quarter. I can think about that as coming from an increase from a combination of higher price and higher utilization. Is there a way maybe that you can discuss the trend of each? And I am just curious, going forward, where you think there's more room.

Alexandre L'Heureux

Well, we definitely believe there is more room in the years to come. You can always improve. So, we believe there are some geographies and some sectors where the productivity is not where it needs to be as far as we are concerned, number one.

And number two, going back perhaps to a question that was asked earlier on this morning, being more selective in the projects that we undertake. WSP, we excel in complex projects. That's where we feel we can do better and we can increase our margin profile. So the type of projects that we undertake is also going to have an impact on our margin profile.

So obviously, by selecting projects where we believe we can really raise the bar, provide a better service or a differentiated service will allow us to increase our margin profile. So I would argue that this is all of the above at this point.

Michael Doumet

Okay. No, that makes sense. And then Alex, maybe just turning to M&A, look, you've been here for a long, long time and you've done a lot of deals. We're living in a world where valuations are high and interest rates are high. You would think that maybe one of the two would have given a little bit. But when you look at deals today, do you feel more strongly about the need to drive synergies to get to the appropriate IRR? Or do you still think that there is sufficient value out there, particularly when we're talking about the medium to larger deals?

Alexandre L'Heureux

Yes. Look, it's not the first time we are going through an environment that is challenging. I think you heard me saying that before, you just mentioned, I've been there for a very long time. So we've gone through times where, I remember 2014, the turn - that's ten years ago, but the turnaround in oil and gas and the markets were challenging. But you know what? In those difficult times, there are also some opportunities. So if you recall, at the time, the exchange rate between the U.S. and Canada was one for one. So we were able to acquire Parsons Brinckerhoff in a difficult period, where however, from an exchange point of view, we had favorable tailwinds.

So, my belief is that in good times and in bad times, you have to be creative and you have to find value in the transaction that you look into. Mind you, you are right. We have to be disciplined. If the interest rate is impacting financial sponsor, I don't see why it would not impact us.

So we have to be disciplined in the way we're thinking about the transactions. But for the right acquisition, I am not going to shy away because of the current environment. We need to have a long-term view on transaction and what we're trying to build as a company.

So that would be my take at this point in time, is we should not be using the market conditions as an excuse, we should instead push ourselves to be creative and find value.

Michael Doumet

Yes. No, I appreciate those comments. Look, maybe I will ask a third. I am assuming I am the last here. But just as a clarification, should we interpret your reiterating of your guidance is it being unchanged, including the recent acquisition and the favorable FX, or just not updated yet?

Alain Michaud

It's early in the year, Michael, so we didn't feel, given this the impact of the recent acquisition, we didn't feel the need to increase or change our guidance. We'll continue to track that and see, in Q2 and Q3, what we do. But we are feeling equally strong as we felt in March when we issued our guidance with the platform we had at the time. So I think that...

Thank you. We will now take our next question. This is from Ian Gillies from Stifel. Please go ahead.

I just wanted to follow-on some of the questions in and around power and your intention to grow there. I am just curious on how that business or perhaps the ones you've looked at are, in broad strokes, how it stacks up, I guess, maybe against the corporate averages, because one of the great things about growing that Earth and Environment business, it was higher margin - it appears to be higher margin than the corporate average. I am wondering if power tends to have some of the same traits.

Alexandre L'Heureux

Yes, it's a fair assumption. It's a fair assumption. Right now, the world is in dire need of new sources of energy. So I feel - I mentioned a few projects this morning. This has not gone unnoticed for us, and we believe that WSP is uniquely positioned to provide services in that space, because the power space, it's not just about and around connecting new sources of energy to existing grid, there is also a collateral impact on other sectors, such as building, earth and environment and transportation.

So we wanted, in a very disciplined way, to build our presence in earth and environment, which we've done since late 2018. But clearly, as you can see and notice, I've been talking about this over the last few quarters, I'm quite keen to continue to diversify our platform and I'm quite keen to continue to grow in sectors where we're not leading. And we have the aspire to become a leading firm.

Ian Gillies

That's incredibly helpful, thanks very much. The other separate question I had, one of the things that's been talked about on prior calls is trying to increase your presence in the U.S. with respect to federal government spending, whether it be through GSAs or other avenues. Is that still a focus? Or is there enough work going on elsewhere that you've shifted priorities?

Alexandre L'Heureux

No. They're not mutually exclusive, that's the way I would answer the question. I think we can continue to push. I talked about power, but I mentioned advanced manufacturing. I think there's real opportunities for us to grow in that space organically and potentially through acquisitions over time. So, I think these are new sources or new opportunities for WSP, and we intend to take advantage of them.

Ian Gillies

Okay, thanks very helpful. Thanks very much. I will turn it back over.

Thank you. And we have one more question. And last question today is from Sabahat Khan from RBC. Please go ahead.

Sabahat Khan

Great. Thanks and good morning. I guess just hearing a little about where you see the demand, whether it's by region and market, how are you balancing these demand indicators against hiring and then trying to just maintain the right level of utilization and drive margins? Just trying to understand - the demand environment still seems like it's in a reasonable place, labor situation is somewhat better than a few years ago, but just curious how you are deciding on the right number of employees to onboard while also considering M&A there? Any color would be helpful.

Alexandre L'Heureux

Yes. Well, I'm glad you bring this topic, Saba. I mean, if I look at our trailing 12 months numbers, our turnover is historical low levels, meaning that we have a lower turnover in our last 12 months than we've had in pre-pandemic levels. So that, combined with our increased productivity and extracting the value from our platform, we are obviously - this is a balancing act. But recently, we have chosen to work on the engagement of our people, reducing our turnover, increasing productivity, rather than being out there and obviously hire just for the sake of hiring.

You look at the fee per employees that we are generating and the curve that you are going to witness if you do the math, over the last ten years, I mean, that's something I'm really focused on. I want to make sure that - and I am saying that with all due respect to our employees that are listening to the call, but I want us to do more with less. I want us to be in a position to deliver more with less. So I want us to run a very, very tight ship and a very, very efficient platform. So that's the mindset right now.

Sabahat Khan

Okay, great. And then, I guess, with some of these moving parts about end market growth and the IIJA, if we look particularly at the U.S. market, do you expect any meaningful shift, putting M&A aside, any meaningful shift in your end market mix? I think you're large in transportation, that's a big part of the IIJA. Should we expect more of the same? Do you expect any evolution in where your business comes from over the next two to three years in the U.S. market?

Alexandre L'Heureux

Well, as I said, I think there are untapped territories for us. So I mentioned power, advanced manufacturing. I feel we could do more there. We can always do more in water, which we're going to continue to grow. But there's so much work in the property and building sector. There is so much more that we can do here. And transportation, we're subscale in many states and many parts of the U.S. So I do feel that we have tremendous opportunities pretty much in all sectors. But as I mentioned today, there are some sectors that I would like to grow because I feel we're too subscale at this point in time.

Sabahat Khan

Okay. Then one last quick one, maybe for Alain, I guess a lot of discussion on this call around M&A with the scale of the company growing and the cash flow base growing, should we expect any other areas of focus within capital allocation besides M&A over the next one to two years? Thanks.

Alexandre L'Heureux

I think you - I will take this one up and Alain can complement. But yes, as part of our next strategic cycle, clearly, we are going to continue to invest in R&D and digital, definitely.

Thank you. And there are no further questions at this time, so I'll hand back to the speakers for any closing comments. Thank you.

Alexandre L'Heureux

Well, thank you for attending the call today. Thank you for your support. As a friendly reminder, we will be holding our Annual Shareholder Meeting at 11:00 Eastern Time today. So, we are encouraging you to attend in person or virtually. And we look forward to updating you in Q2.

On that note, I would like to wish you continued success and a great starting of the summer. Thank you very much.

Comparing prices is tricky because tax systems and wage levels are different in different countries. However, since the Lidl chain is now established in Estonia, it is possible to make some comparisons.

Lidl came to Finland 20 years ago. When the first stores opened in 2002, Finns were suspicious of the low prices, the goods seemed dubious and many products were not accepted by Finns.

Inevitably, Lidl had to sell more and more Finnish products, as Finns prefer to buy local. In Finland, short check-out lines were also introduced in stores, so the chain eventually had to give in and switch to long checkouts with two check-out lines.

In response to consumer pressure, the chain also abandoned a much-maligned discount system that required activation to get a better price -now most discounts are automatically extended to loyalty card holders.

Lidl's price level intensified competition in the Finnish market and forced other supermarket chains to lower their prices. In Estonia, all this was known, and the chains already operating in the local market tried their best to protect their market share.

Estonian consumers, however, are price-sensitive, so at least in Tallinn's Lasnamäe district, Lidl does not have to worry about a lack of customers with constant queues at the checkouts. When comparing prices, however, it is a bitter pill to swallow to know that in Finland, where wages are higher, some products are cheaper than in Estonia.

Strawberries and asparagus more expensive at Lidl in Estonia

Vegetables are usually much cheaper in Estonia than in Finland. The cheapest loose potato this week costs 37 cents in Estonia and 85 cents in Finland. You can be satisfied. But the joy disappears when you look at the price of carrots. A kilo of carrots costs €2.29 euros in Estonia and €1.89 in Finland.

Cultivated blueberries are not an essential product, but sometimes you want a treat: in Estonia a 400 gram package costs €6.99, in Finland the same package costs €4.99, this week with a special offer €3.49. Strawberries and asparagus are also more expensive at Lidl in Estonia than in Finland. Strawberry jam is also more expensive in Estonia. A jar of exactly the same Maribel jam costs €2.39 in Estonia, but €1.69 in Finland.

Speaking of sweets, I also noticed that the same cookies are priced differently. In Estonia, Biscino butter cookies with milk chocolate cost €1.56, while at Lidl in Finland the same cookies cost €0.79.

When you get to the butcher's corner, your mind calms down a bit, although you can't really make a clear comparison because the composition of the products is slightly different. In any case, ""Kodune"" beef and pork mincemeat is slightly cheaper in Estonia: €5.43 per kilo in Estonia, €5.63 in Finland, but the mincemeat sold at Lidl in Finland is domestic.

It is difficult to compare chicken products, so I took the most similar products. The Polish chicken fillet we sell is €3.29 per kilo, while Finnish home-made flavored chicken wings are €2.95 per kilo.

Cheese half the price in Estonia

The comparison of milk prices always annoys the Estonian shops and they start talking about fat percentage. In Finland, and in most of the rest of the European Union, normal drinking milk has a fat content of 1.5 percent, while in Estonia it is 2.5 percent. In Finland they don't sell things like plastic milk either, so let's leave that aside for the moment, even though it's really the cheapest. I compared the price of a litre of milk in a tetra pack: in Estonia this week Alma milk is €0.89, in Finland at Lidl a domestic litre of milk is also €0.89.

Finns often buy cheese by the kilo, while in Estonia cheese tends to be sold in small packets and sliced, but there are many special offers. A half-kilo package of Estover sliced Estonian cheese costs €5.98 at Lidl in Lasnamäe, while our Epiim cream cheese costs €5.89 per kilo at Lidl in Finland.

Alcohol in Estonia has long been enticingly cheap for Finns. Wine prices have long since converged, but beer is still a little cheaper in Estonia. A half liter of A-Le Coq Premium, for example, costs €1.59 at Lidl in Estonia and €2.24 in Finland.

High prices in Estonia are often excused by the small size of the market.

Electricity is also more expensive in Estonia than in Finland, and this is reflected in the prices. There is also a small difference in the price of gasoline: some weeks the price is the same, but most weeks gasoline is 10-20 cents more expensive in Finland than in Estonia.

Hourly wage in Finnish Lidil doubled

But let's compare the salaries of salespeople. The collective agreement of PAM, the Finnish service workers' union, stipulates that the least qualified salesperson should be paid at least €11.96 per hour in their first year of employment. Finland has a graduated income tax, so income tax on such a low salary is only a few percent. Thanks to strong trade unions, bonuses are added to wages, for example for evening and weekend work.

The job advertisement on Lidl Estonia's website offers a salary of €6.40 per hour.",news.err.ee,news,ERR,Kai Vare,0.0117647058823529,453133448,80,https://s.err.ee/photo/crop/2024/05/11/2390289h7987t24.jpg,

At a time when the dominant narrative around cash is that its demise is all but inevitable, as well as broadly desirable, the 2024 payment report by Sweden's Riksbank may offer a cautionary tale.

In October last year, in More Good News for Cash in Europe, More Bad News for Digital Dollar in US, we reported that recent developments suggest that the trend away from cash and toward purely digital-only payment systems may not be quite as smooth or as seamless as some may have wished or expected. One of the developments we highlighted in that report was growing concern among central bankers and politicians in Sweden, one of Europe's most cashless economies, about the unintended consequences of driving cash out of the economy:

Even by late 2020, Sweden had less cash in circulation than just about anywhere else in the world, at around 1% of gross domestic product, according to the latest available data. That compares with 8% in the U.S. and more than 10% in the euro area. As a recent piece in Interesting Engineering notes, Sweden is already ""officially cashless"":

Cash is never needed, not even for small purchases like hot chocolate at a Christmas market in Stockholm. All vendors have a mobile payment chip-and-PIN card reader like the one offered by Stockholm-based mobile payments company iZettle, or they accept payments through the mobile application Swish. Swishing is perhaps the easiest way of payment for everyone.

The Risks of Going Fully Cashless

But now the country is beginning to realise that an almost exclusively digital payments system comes with significant risks, especially at a time of heightened geopolitical tensions. In time-honoured fashion, the article in the UK Telegraph began with a spot of fearmongering about Vladimir Putin.

""People started to realise that it is very easy for Vladimir Putin to switch everything off,"" Björn Eriksson, a retired police chief, former head of Interpol and leading cash advocate, told the Telegraph. ""At first we were arguing for vulnerable people, the elderly, women in abusive relationships who rely on cash... Now we are talking about national security. And it's not only Putin, it could also be organised crime.""

In 2021, the Riksbank, Sweden's central bank (and the world's oldest), introduced a new directive obliging the country's six largest credit institutions to continue providing their customers with certain basic cash services.

But while that may have meant that people in Sweden can continue to access cash from their local branch, it is becoming increasingly difficult to use it as fewer and fewer retail businesses accept notes and coins.

This is partly due to the greater convenience of handling digital payments while the card processing fees are substantially lower than the US. But it is also because most Swedes, including many pensioners, prefer to use cards or mobile payments. As a baker in Stockholm told the Telegraph, ""the only people who bring cash to the shop are tourists. I feel bad for them because they just take the krona home, where it is useless.""

But even that trend may be reversing. According to Eriksson, a growing number of young people are joining the pro-cash movement -- and mainly over privacy concerns.

Rediscovering the Benefits of Cash

Earlier this week, Heise Online, a German online news service that covers IT, telecommunications, and technology sectors, published a long, in-depth report about the Riksbank's apparent rediscovery of some of the benefits of cash. The article also explores some of the Riksbank's concerns about the potential fragility of a fully cashless payment system, as outlined in its 2024 Payments Report, published in March.

At a time when the dominant narrative around cash -- as espoused by senior bankers, central bankers, big tech and fintech executives, politicians and economists, and of course, their ever-faithful servants in the media -- is that its demise is all but inevitable, even in countries where cash is still King (Germany, Spain, Austria, Mexico, Thailand, Japan...), the Riksbank's report may offer a cautionary tale. From the Heise Online piece (machine translated):

""The Swedish payments market has been digitized rapidly,"" states the Riksbank. Cash and manual payment services have been replaced by cards, mobile phones and internet services. ""As a result, payments have become faster, smoother and cheaper overall,"" which the institute points out is ""a positive development."" However, there are groups in society ""who do not have access to digital payment services or find it difficult to use them and are therefore marginalized"". There are also ""serious fraud problems that could undermine trust in the payment system.""

Digitalization also makes payments ""more vulnerable to cyber attacks and disruptions to the power grid and data communication,"" the bank points out. At the same time, the geopolitical developments of the past few years required ""Sweden to have strong civil defense."" The developments suggested ""that we should concentrate more than before on the challenges of digitalization.""

Put another way, cash does not crash. It does not fail in a power cut or seize up during a cyber attack (though, of course, ATMs might). By contrast, digital payment systems need a stable and continuous internet connection to process transactions. When these connections fail, the result is often chaos. Digital payment outages have caused significant disruption in a host of countries in recent years, including the US, the UK, Australia, Indonesia, Germany, Canada, Spain and Norway. Generally speaking, the more cashless the country, the greater the disruption.

Sweden's Cashless Journey

Sweden is one of the world's most cashless economies. In large part, its abandonment of cash was the result of technological and generational shifts. As payment technologies began to change in the first two decades of this century, most Swedish citizens began to prefer the speed, ease and convenience of digital payments.

They were also nudged heavily in that direction by commercial banks, which by 2016 had made 60% of their branches cashless, as a 2019 Riksbank working paper documents. This made it much more difficult for citizens to access cash and for businesses to deposit it, which in turn accelerated the uptake of digital payments and the abandonment.

Sweden's legal tender laws also made it possible for the Riksbank to withdraw many of Sweden's large denomination notes in circulation. For instance, the value of 1,000-krona notes (worth just over $90) in circulation declined gradually from SEK 48.4 billion in 2001 to SEK 21.4 billion in December 2012. Beginning in 2013, this decline accelerated, plunging to SEK 9.7 billion by December 2013.

After playing a part in the wholesale removal of cash from Sweden's economy, the Riksbank is now trying to reverse some of the damage it has caused. It is not the only Scandinavian central bank to have flagged up the fragility risks of exclusively digital payment systems. In 2022, the Bank of Finland recommended that the use of cash payments be guaranteed by law. Like all Nordic countries, Finland is a largely cash-free economy. But like Sweden, it has begun to see the risks of going too far, too soon.

In March 2022, the central bank initiated a proposal for legislation to ensure a minimal level of cash-paid services. In October of that year, the Head of the Payment Systems Department and Chief Cashier at the Bank of Finland, Päivi Heikkinen, even advised households to make sure they have some cash on hand, just in case the country's payments system were to go down. At the time, Finland had just applied to become a NATO member and the government was fretting about the risk of cyber attacks from Russia. In an interview with the national broadcaster, Heikkinen said her intention was not to ""fabricate catastrophic scenarios"" -- before saying that in the worst case scenario, the payments system could go down for a period of weeks.

In Sweden, the Riksbank is already taking countermeasures to try to guarantee a steady supply of cash, the Heise Online article notes:

It is improving the cash supply by setting up new offices where companies can collect and deposit cash. Having such cash depots in more locations across the country would reduce both the costs for businesses and the risk that cash would no longer be usable in the event of a disruption.

This is the only way to ensure ""that everyone can pay"". In general, ""stronger legal protection for cash"" is necessary. Banks should be required to ""accept cash deposits, including coins, from individuals.""

The Riksbank supports its demands with reference to an annual representative survey on the payment habits of Swedes. According to this, ""cash is being used more frequently than before"". Almost half of respondents reported using cash in the past month, an increase of 15 percentage points compared to 2022.

This pro-active approach to bolstering the cash system contrasts sharply with what some central banks and governments are saying and doing in other Western or Western-adjacent countries. As we reported in August, Brazil's Chamber of Deputies is mulling a number of legislative proposals calling for an end to the printing, minting and circulation of physical notes and coins. As the World Economic Forum trumpeted in 2022, Brazilians are adopting digital payments faster than anyone else.

In Australia, the government refuses to legally protect the use of cash in retail settings. The Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, Michele Bullock, has even warned that as the running costs of processing cash for banks and businesses mount as a result of the declining share of consumer payments made using cash, it may become necessary to begin charging people for using cash in retail settings.

Granted, Australia is significantly larger and more sparsely populated than Sweden, making it much harder and more costly to transport money securely to all parts of the country, including remote parts of Queensland, Northern Territory and Western Australia. But whereas the Riksbank is talking about taking on a proactive role, together with other authorities and banks, to ensure that cash can be transported to and from retail outlets at reasonable prices, the RBA is talking about making consumers pay for the privilege of using cash. Meanwhile, Armaguard, Australia's largest currency transport business, servicing around 90% of the cash-in-transit market, is warning of bankruptcy -- unless the banks agree to pay more for its services.

Predictably, Bullock's suggestion that citizens may one day have to fork over extra fees for the privilege of paying with cash -- to protect the banks and retailers from the exorbitant costs of maintaining cash infrastructure -- did not go down well with many Australians. While most citizens are using digital payments for most, if not all, of their purchases, millions still depend on cash in their daily lives.

What's more, the very same Big Four banks Bullock wants to protect from having to part with extra money to fortify Australia's cash network have posted record or near-record profits in recent times, in part because of surging interest rates but also because of the rising fees they charge on card payments. Those same banks received huge sums of cheap debt to tide them over during the COVID-19 pandemic while at the same time closing hundreds of branches and ATMs across the country.

In Sweden, as Heisse Online notes, more and more Swedes see the decline in cash consumption as a negative development -- 44 percent in 2023 compared to 36 percent in the previous year:

The proportion of respondents who believe that they cannot get by without cash in today's society has also increased compared to 2022. This could also be ""an effect of increased crisis awareness due to the war in Ukraine,"" the bankers speculate.

The need to pay in cash in certain situations such as at clubs, in corner shops and at flea markets is also mentioned, the report goes on to say. Some also emphasized that using cash made it easier for them to keep track of their finances. Older people generally find it much more difficult to get by without cash than younger people. In the 2023 survey, half of respondents said they wanted to pay cash but the store did not accept it. In 2022 the corresponding value was only 37 percent...

These numbers suggest that cash may be experiencing a mini-renaissance in Sweden, which would echo similar trends seen in other heavily cashless economies. For example, a recent survey down under by fintech company Waave revealed that as many as 71% of Australians are worried about the economy becoming completely cashless. Those most concerned include Baby Boomers (82%), regional Australians (77%), and lower income households earning less than $100k (75%) -- a reminder of the oft-ignored class-war element of the War on Cash.

It's not hard to see why concerns about the future of cash are on the rise down under. In recent months, three of Australia's Big Four banks have removed over-the-counter cash withdrawals from some of their branches while increasing numbers of businesses, both large and small, are choosing to reject cash payments altogether. In Australia, it is perfectly legal for businesses to refuse to accept cash as long as they inform consumers of their stance before any ""contract"" for the supply of goods or services is entered into.

Aussie cash lovers recently expressed their displeasure with these trends through a ""Draw Out Some Cash Day"" on April 2. According to news.com.au, hoards of people were seen lining up to withdraw cash:

The movement, led by the Cash is King Facebook group, aimed to show banks and retailers there is still a demand for cash amid warnings the country will be ""functionally cashless"" by 2025.

Social media posts show ""massive queues"" of people, both young and old, lining up at various banks around the country, with one woman sharing she waited for up to an hour to get her hands on bank notes.

""All banks I passed today had queues out the door,"" one person wrote on Facebook alongside a picture of people lining up outside a Commonwealth Bank branch.

Governments in other countries, including Ireland, Spain, Slovakia and Austria, are taking pro-active steps to protect the use of cash. Even the European Central Bank has called for a regulatory crackdown on all businesses and public bodies in the Euro Area that refuse to accept cash. At the same time, the ECB is proceeding in its digital euro project from the ""investigation phase"" to the ""preparation phase.""

As I noted at the time, cash is still the most frequently used payment method in the Euro Area, though it is losing ground to cards. Even if, or when, the digital euro is launched, it will presumably coexist with cash for some time, at least until the digital euro gains a strong enough foothold. ECB President Lagarde has said that ""cash is here to stay,"" adding that European citizens ""will have both options: cash and digital cash."" How long it stays that way will remain to be seen. My guess is that if the digital euro does gain a strong foothold, the ECB will begin financially incentivising its use while decentivising the use of cash.

In the UK, meanwhile, cash may even be staging a comeback of sorts after ten consecutive years of falling use. According to both UK Finance, the country's largest bank association, and the British Retail Consortium Group, the most influential retail lobbying group, cash use increased in 2022, for the first time in a decade. Whether this rebound represents a genuine trend reversal or merely a dead cat bounce (apologies, as always, to feline lovers) remains to be seen. But the mere fact that cash use is growing at all despite concerted efforts by the government, banks and retailers to reduce its use is noteworthy.

So, too, is the fact that Sweden's Riksbank is expressing reservations about the resilience of a fully cashless society. After all, the Riksbank was one of the first central banks in Europe to begin aggressively undermining the role of cash in the economy. That said, its U-turn on cash it is not as novel a development as is suggested by the Heise Online article. The Riksbank, the article claims in its introduction, ""is suddenly emphasising the indispensable role of cash in secure, widely available payment systems. This is a change in strategy.""

That is somewhat misleading. As the German financial journalist Norbert Häring notes (in German) on his blog, while there has definitely been a sea change in strategy at the Riksbank, that change did not begin just now but rather eight years ago, ""after the central bank, together with Sweden's commercial banks, had done everything they could to undermine the use of cash."" Since early 2016 Sweden's central bank has slowed the march towards a cashless society, as Häring reported at the time.

Now, the Riksbank is not just questioning the wisdom of moving to a fully cashless economy at this current moment in time; it is explicitly warning about the potential risks such a move might entail. At the same time, it is working on developing a CBDC -- the so-called e-krona, now in its fourth and final pilot phase, looking at ""how an e-Krona can be used offline for payments if electricity and telecommunications are not working."" Which begs the question: once the e-krona is ready to launch, which will presumably be sooner than most other CBDCs in the West, how will it co-exist with cash? That will have to be the subject of a future article, though readers' suggestions are more than welcome in the meantime.",therussophile.org,news,TheRussophiles,Tyler Durden,-0.02745098039215688,453122602,13,https://i0.wp.com/therussophile.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/cashless.jpg?fit=500%2C284&ssl=1,

At a time when the dominant narrative around cash is that its demise is all but inevitable, as well as broadly desirable, the 2024 payment report by Sweden's Riksbank may offer a cautionary tale.

In October last year, in More Good News for Cash in Europe, More Bad News for Digital Dollar in US, we reported that recent developments suggest that the trend away from cash and toward purely digital-only payment systems may not be quite as smooth or as seamless as some may have wished or expected. One of the developments we highlighted in that report was growing concern among central bankers and politicians in Sweden, one of Europe's most cashless economies, about the unintended consequences of driving cash out of the economy:

Even by late 2020, Sweden had less cash in circulation than just about anywhere else in the world, at around 1% of gross domestic product, according to the latest available data. That compares with 8% in the U.S. and more than 10% in the euro area. As a recent piece in Interesting Engineering notes, Sweden is already ""officially cashless"":

Cash is never needed, not even for small purchases like hot chocolate at a Christmas market in Stockholm. All vendors have a mobile payment chip-and-PIN card reader like the one offered by Stockholm-based mobile payments company iZettle, or they accept payments through the mobile application Swish. Swishing is perhaps the easiest way of payment for everyone.

The Risks of Going Fully Cashless

But now the country is beginning to realise that an almost exclusively digital payments system comes with significant risks, especially at a time of heightened geopolitical tensions. In time-honoured fashion, the article in the UK Telegraph began with a spot of fearmongering about Vladimir Putin.

""People started to realise that it is very easy for Vladimir Putin to switch everything off,"" Björn Eriksson, a retired police chief, former head of Interpol and leading cash advocate, told the Telegraph. ""At first we were arguing for vulnerable people, the elderly, women in abusive relationships who rely on cash... Now we are talking about national security. And it's not only Putin, it could also be organised crime.""

In 2021, the Riksbank, Sweden's central bank (and the world's oldest), introduced a new directive obliging the country's six largest credit institutions to continue providing their customers with certain basic cash services.

But while that may have meant that people in Sweden can continue to access cash from their local branch, it is becoming increasingly difficult to use it as fewer and fewer retail businesses accept notes and coins.

This is partly due to the greater convenience of handling digital payments while the card processing fees are substantially lower than the US. But it is also because most Swedes, including many pensioners, prefer to use cards or mobile payments. As a baker in Stockholm told the Telegraph, ""the only people who bring cash to the shop are tourists. I feel bad for them because they just take the krona home, where it is useless.""

But even that trend may be reversing. According to Eriksson, a growing number of young people are joining the pro-cash movement -- and mainly over privacy concerns.

Rediscovering the Benefits of Cash

Earlier this week, Heise Online, a German online news service that covers IT, telecommunications, and technology sectors, published a long, in-depth report about the Riksbank's apparent rediscovery of some of the benefits of cash. The article also explores some of the Riksbank's concerns about the potential fragility of a fully cashless payment system, as outlined in its 2024 Payments Report, published in March.

At a time when the dominant narrative around cash -- as espoused by senior bankers, central bankers, big tech and fintech executives, politicians and economists, and of course, their ever-faithful servants in the media -- is that its demise is all but inevitable, even in countries where cash is still King (Germany, Spain, Austria, Mexico, Thailand, Japan...), the Riksbank's report may offer a cautionary tale. From the Heise Online piece (machine translated):

""The Swedish payments market has been digitized rapidly,"" states the Riksbank. Cash and manual payment services have been replaced by cards, mobile phones and internet services. ""As a result, payments have become faster, smoother and cheaper overall,"" which the institute points out is ""a positive development."" However, there are groups in society ""who do not have access to digital payment services or find it difficult to use them and are therefore marginalized"". There are also ""serious fraud problems that could undermine trust in the payment system.""

Digitalization also makes payments ""more vulnerable to cyber attacks and disruptions to the power grid and data communication,"" the bank points out. At the same time, the geopolitical developments of the past few years required ""Sweden to have strong civil defense.""

There are also ""serious fraud problems that could undermine trust in the payment system.""

Digitalization also makes payments ""more vulnerable to cyber attacks and disruptions to the power grid and data communication,"" the bank points out. At the same time, the geopolitical developments of the past few years required ""Sweden to have strong civil defense."" The developments suggested ""that we should concentrate more than before on the challenges of digitalization.""

Put another way, cash does not crash. It does not fail in a power cut or seize up during a cyber attack (though, of course, ATMs might). By contrast, digital payment systems need a stable and continuous internet connection to process transactions. When these connections fail, the result is often chaos. Digital payment outages have caused significant disruption in a host of countries in recent years, including the US, the UK, Australia, Indonesia, Germany, Canada, Spain and Norway. Generally speaking, the more cashless the country, the greater the disruption.

Sweden's Cashless Journey

Sweden is one of the world's most cashless economies. In large part, its abandonment of cash was the result of technological and generational shifts. As payment technologies began to change in the first two decades of this century, most Swedish citizens began to prefer the speed, ease and convenience of digital payments.

They were also nudged heavily in that direction by commercial banks, which by 2016 had made 60% of their branches cashless, as a 2019 Riksbank working paper documents. This made it much more difficult for citizens to access cash and for businesses to deposit it, which in turn accelerated the uptake of digital payments and the abandonment.

Sweden's legal tender laws also made it possible for the Riksbank to withdraw many of Sweden's large denomination notes in circulation. For instance, the value of 1,000-krona notes (worth just over $90) in circulation declined gradually from SEK 48.4 billion in 2001 to SEK 21.4 billion in December 2012. Beginning in 2013, this decline accelerated, plunging to SEK 9.7 billion by December 2013.

After playing a part in the wholesale removal of cash from Sweden's economy, the Riksbank is now trying to reverse some of the damage it has caused. It is not the only Scandinavian central bank to have flagged up the fragility risks of exclusively digital payment systems. In 2022, the Bank of Finland recommended that the use of cash payments be guaranteed by law. Like all Nordic countries, Finland is a largely cash-free economy. But like Sweden, it has begun to see the risks of going too far, too soon.

In March 2022, the central bank initiated a proposal for legislation to ensure a minimal level of cash-paid services. In October of that year, the Head of the Payment Systems Department and Chief Cashier at the Bank of Finland, Päivi Heikkinen, even advised households to make sure they have some cash on hand, just in case the country's payments system were to go down. At the time, Finland had just applied to become a NATO member and the government was fretting about the risk of cyber attacks from Russia. In an interview with the national broadcaster, Heikkinen said her intention was not to ""fabricate catastrophic scenarios"" -- before saying that in the worst case scenario, the payments system could go down for a period of weeks.

In Sweden, the Riksbank is already taking countermeasures to try to guarantee a steady supply of cash, the Heise Online article notes:

It is improving the cash supply by setting up new offices where companies can collect and deposit cash. Having such cash depots in more locations across the country would reduce both the costs for businesses and the risk that cash would no longer be usable in the event of a disruption.

This is the only way to ensure ""that everyone can pay"". In general, ""stronger legal protection for cash"" is necessary. Banks should be required to ""accept cash deposits, including coins, from individuals.""

The Riksbank supports its demands with reference to an annual representative survey on the payment habits of Swedes. According to this, ""cash is being used more frequently than before"". Almost half of respondents reported using cash in the past month, an increase of 15 percentage points compared to 2022.

This pro-active approach to bolstering the cash system contrasts sharply with what some central banks and governments are saying and doing in other Western or Western-adjacent countries. As we reported in August, Brazil's Chamber of Deputies is mulling a number of legislative proposals calling for an end to the printing, minting and circulation of physical notes and coins. As the World Economic Forum trumpeted in 2022, Brazilians are adopting digital payments faster than anyone else.

In Australia, the government refuses to legally protect the use of cash in retail settings. The Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, Michele Bullock, has even warned that as the running costs of processing cash for banks and businesses mount as a result of the declining share of consumer payments made using cash, it may become necessary to begin charging people for using cash in retail settings.

Granted, Australia is significantly larger and more sparsely populated than Sweden, making it much harder and more costly to transport money securely to all parts of the country, including remote parts of Queensland, Northern Territory and Western Australia. But whereas the Riksbank is talking about taking on a proactive role, together with other authorities and banks, to ensure that cash can be transported to and from retail outlets at reasonable prices, the RBA is talking about making consumers pay for the privilege of using cash. Meanwhile, Armaguard, Australia's largest currency transport business, servicing around 90% of the cash-in-transit market, is warning of bankruptcy -- unless the banks agree to pay more for its services.

Predictably, Bullock's suggestion that citizens may one day have to fork over extra fees for the privilege of paying with cash -- to protect the banks and retailers from the exorbitant costs of maintaining cash infrastructure -- did not go down well with many Australians. While most citizens are using digital payments for most, if not all, of their purchases, millions still depend on cash in their daily lives.

What's more, the very same Big Four banks Bullock wants to protect from having to part with extra money to fortify Australia's cash network have posted record or near-record profits in recent times, in part because of surging interest rates but also because of the rising fees they charge on card payments. Those same banks received huge sums of cheap debt to tide them over during the COVID-19 pandemic while at the same time closing hundreds of branches and ATMs across the country.

In Sweden, as Heisse Online notes, more and more Swedes see the decline in cash consumption as a negative development -- 44 percent in 2023 compared to 36 percent in the previous year:

The proportion of respondents who believe that they cannot get by without cash in today's society has also increased compared to 2022. This could also be ""an effect of increased crisis awareness due to the war in Ukraine,"" the bankers speculate.

The need to pay in cash in certain situations such as at clubs, in corner shops and at flea markets is also mentioned, the report goes on to say. Some also emphasized that using cash made it easier for them to keep track of their finances. Older people generally find it much more difficult to get by without cash than younger people. In the 2023 survey, half of respondents said they wanted to pay cash but the store did not accept it. In 2022 the corresponding value was only 37 percent...

These numbers suggest that cash may be experiencing a mini-renaissance in Sweden, which would echo similar trends seen in other heavily cashless economies. For example, a recent survey down under by fintech company Waave revealed that as many as 71% of Australians are worried about the economy becoming completely cashless. Those most concerned include Baby Boomers (82%), regional Australians (77%), and lower income households earning less than $100k (75%) -- a reminder of the oft-ignored class-war element of the War on Cash.

It's not hard to see why concerns about the future of cash are on the rise down under. In recent months, three of Australia's Big Four banks have removed over-the-counter cash withdrawals from some of their branches while increasing numbers of businesses, both large and small, are choosing to reject cash payments altogether. In Australia, it is perfectly legal for businesses to refuse to accept cash as long as they inform consumers of their stance before any ""contract"" for the supply of goods or services is entered into.

Aussie cash lovers recently expressed their displeasure with these trends through a ""Draw Out Some Cash Day"" on April 2. According to news.com.au, hoards of people were seen lining up to withdraw cash:

The movement, led by the Cash is King Facebook group, aimed to show banks and retailers there is still a demand for cash amid warnings the country will be ""functionally cashless"" by 2025.

Social media posts show ""massive queues"" of people, both young and old, lining up at various banks around the country, with one woman sharing she waited for up to an hour to get her hands on bank notes.

""All banks I passed today had queues out the door,"" one person wrote on Facebook alongside a picture of people lining up outside a Commonwealth Bank branch.

Governments in other countries, including Ireland, Spain, Slovakia and Austria, are taking pro-active steps to protect the use of cash. Even the European Central Bank has called for a regulatory crackdown on all businesses and public bodies in the Euro Area that refuse to accept cash. At the same time, the ECB is proceeding in its digital euro project from the ""investigation phase"" to the ""preparation phase.""

As I noted at the time, cash is still the most frequently used payment method in the Euro Area, though it is losing ground to cards. Even if, or when, the digital euro is launched, it will presumably coexist with cash for some time, at least until the digital euro gains a strong enough foothold. ECB President Lagarde has said that ""cash is here to stay,"" adding that European citizens ""will have both options: cash and digital cash."" How long it stays that way will remain to be seen. My guess is that if the digital euro does gain a strong foothold, the ECB will begin financially incentivising its use while decentivising the use of cash.

In the UK, meanwhile, cash may even be staging a comeback of sorts after ten consecutive years of falling use. According to both UK Finance, the country's largest bank association, and the British Retail Consortium Group, the most influential retail lobbying group, cash use increased in 2022, for the first time in a decade. Whether this rebound represents a genuine trend reversal or merely a dead cat bounce (apologies, as always, to feline lovers) remains to be seen. But the mere fact that cash use is growing at all despite concerted efforts by the government, banks and retailers to reduce its use is noteworthy.

So, too, is the fact that Sweden's Riksbank is expressing reservations about the resilience of a fully cashless society. After all, the Riksbank was one of the first central banks in Europe to begin aggressively undermining the role of cash in the economy. That said, its U-turn on cash it is not as novel a development as is suggested by the Heise Online article. The Riksbank, the article claims in its introduction, ""is suddenly emphasising the indispensable role of cash in secure, widely available payment systems. This is a change in strategy.""

That is somewhat misleading. As the German financial journalist Norbert Häring notes (in German) on his blog, while there has definitely been a sea change in strategy at the Riksbank, that change did not begin just now but rather eight years ago, ""after the central bank, together with Sweden's commercial banks, had done everything they could to undermine the use of cash."" Since early 2016 Sweden's central bank has slowed the march towards a cashless society, as Häring reported at the time.

Now, the Riksbank is not just questioning the wisdom of moving to a fully cashless economy at this current moment in time; it is explicitly warning about the potential risks such a move might entail. At the same time, it is working on developing a CBDC -- the so-called e-krona, now in its fourth and final pilot phase, looking at ""how an e-Krona can be used offline for payments if electricity and telecommunications are not working."" Which begs the question: once the e-krona is ready to launch, which will presumably be sooner than most other CBDCs in the West, how will it co-exist with cash? That will have to be the subject of a future article, though readers' suggestions are more than welcome in the meantime.",zerohedge.com,news,Zero Hedge,,0.2,453115917,13,https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/styles/16_9_max_700/public/2024-05/cashless.JPG?itok=9Wsbr2Y5,

Israel has imposed a complete siege on the densely populated territory, cutting off fuel, electricity, food, and water to the more than two million Palestinians living there.

Anger and frustration with the suffering of the Palestinian people in Gaza have sparked university protests across the world.

""Tensions are boiling over on university campuses across the US as student protests in support of Palestinians continue to grow, and are increasingly met with police violence despite students and faculty insisting the demonstrations have been peaceful,""

the Guardian reported.

Many universities have called police and other law enforcement agencies onto campus. In the United States alone, more than 2,000 students have been arrested.

Both protests and the campus crackdowns have also spread to other parts of the world - from Canada to Australia, and in multiple European nations. On Monday, students at Oxford and Cambridge in the United Kingdom also set up encampments.

Al Jazeera has reported that students at over 100 universities are protesting across the US. Their counterparts in at least 20 campuses outside of the US are protesting and several of these protests are also encampments.

Students at Harvard, and Brown have joined in pro-Palestinian protests across college campuses. They want their schools to stop accepting funding from groups that directly or indirectly fund the war in Gaza, NBC Boston has reported.

Protesters are demanding that their schools sever any direct or indirect financial and academic links with Israel.

At Berlin's Freie Universität in Germany on Tuesday, hundreds of pro-Palestinian protesters occupied a courtyard.

The protesters set up tents and formed a human chain, chanting slogans such as ""Viva, Viva Palestina"".

Student protests demanding that universities sever ties with Israel over the Gaza war have spread across Europe, sparking clashes and arrests as new demonstrations broke out in the Netherlands, Germany, France, Switzerland, and Austria, the Guardian reported.

In recent days, students have held protests or set up encampments in Finland, Denmark, Italy, Spain, France, and Britain following earlier protests in the US, Euronews reported.

Dublin's Trinity College students in Ireland and Lausanne University in Switzerland have joined US universities in solidarity with the encampments protesting against the Israeli war on Gaza.

On May 7, Dutch police violently broke up a pro-Palestinian demonstration camp at the University of Amsterdam, arresting 125 students.

Students at various European universities, inspired by ongoing demonstrations at US campuses, have been occupying halls and facilities, demanding an end to partnerships with Israeli institutions because of Israel's assault on Gaza.

According to CNN, pro-Palestinian encampments have been set up at the universities of Oxford and Cambridge in England, as students there call on leadership to sever ties to Israel.

The Western media coverage tries to frame the pro-Palestine protesters in Western universities as violent and racist, a social activist from Canada, told Mehr News Agency.

""I think camera phones and social media make the truth much harder to hide,"" Tyler Berglund added.

Dr. Jody Armour, a distinguished Professor of Law at the University of Southern California, told The Tehran Times, ""We spend a lot of time teaching these students to think freely and independently, and then we crack down on them when they put our teachings into practice.""

Iran's Deputy Minister of Science, Research, and Technology Hashem Dadashpour has voiced Iran's readiness to offer scholarships to American students who have been expelled due to protesting the crimes of the Zionist regime in Gaza.

Operator

Good morning, and welcome to Mercer International's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call.

On the call today is Juan Carlos Bueno, Mercer's President and Chief Executive Officer, and Richard Short, Mercer's Chief Financial Officer and Secretary.

I will now hand the call over to Richard.

Richard Short

Thanks, Liz. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today.

I will begin by touching on the financial and operating highlights of the first quarter before turning the call to Juan Carlos to provide further color into the markets, our operations, and our strategic initiatives. Also, for those of you that are joining today's call by telephone, there is presentation material that we have attached to the Investors section of our website.

But before turning to our results, I would like to remind you that we will make forward-looking statements in this morning's conference call according to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. I'd like to call your attention to the risks related to these statements, which are more fully described in our press release and in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

This quarter, our EBITDA was $64 million compared to Q4 EBITDA of $21 million. The improved results were driven by not having any major maintenance downtime, improving pulp sales realizations, and lower fiber and other production costs. Our pulp segment contributed quarterly EBITDA of $68 million, and our solid wood segment EBITDA was negative $1 million. You can find additional segment disclosures in our Form 10-Q, which can be found on our website and that of the SEC.

In Q1, both our NBSK and NBHK sales realizations increased compared to Q4. Average list prices increased in Europe and North America due to stronger demand and global supply constraints. In China, prices were flat as demand slowed during the Chinese New Year and picked up near the end of the quarter. The European NBSK list price averaged $1,400 per ton in the current quarter, an increase of $155 or 12% from Q4. And the North American NBSK list price averaged $1,440 per ton in the current quarter, an increase of $128 or 10% from Q4. In China, the Q1 average NBHK net price was $662 per ton, up $19 or about 3% compared to the Q4 average price, resulting in the market price gap between NBSK and NBHK in China, narrowing to about $83 per ton in Q1 from $105 per ton in Q4. The North American NBHK average Q1 list price was $1,223 per ton, up $140 or 13% from Q4.

Total pulp sales volumes in the first quarter increased by 75,000 tons to 566,000 tons, driven by the timing of sales and higher production due to lower scheduled maintenance downtime. We had no scheduled maintenance downtime in Q1 compared to 23 days of downtime in Q4, which positively impacted Q1 EBITDA by about $23 million when compared to Q4. After adjusting for the Q4 planned shuts, pulp production was essentially flat from the fourth quarter.

For our solid wood segment, we had modest lumber pricing improvements in both Europe and the U.S. market. Despite the price increases, overall lumber demand remained subdued as a result of uncertain economic conditions in Europe and high interest rates. The random length U.S. benchmark for western SPF #2&Btr was $462 per thousand board feet at the end of Q1, compared to $422 at the end of Q4. Today, that benchmark price for western SPF #2&Btr is around $421 per thousand board feet, virtually unchanged from the beginning of 2024. For Q2, we are expecting generally flat lumber prices in the U.S. and European markets as demand remains weak. Lumber production was a near record 127 million board feet in Q1, up 14% due to seasonal downtime in the fourth quarter. Lumber sales volumes were 121 million board feet, up 8% from Q4.

Electricity sales totaled 259 gigawatt hours in the quarter, which was about the same as Q4. Pricing in Q1 modestly decreased to about $94 per megawatt hour from $98 in Q4 due to lower spot prices in Germany. In Q1, our pulp segment had lower fiber costs in Q4 as supplied remained stable. On the other hand, our solid wood segment had higher sawlog costs due to strong demand in Germany. Production for our solid wood segment's mass timber operations decreased in Q1 from Q4 due to minor customer driven delays for certain large-scale projects. These projects are now underway and we are satisfied with the order book today.

In the first quarter, we made the strategic decision to dissolve the Cariboo mill joint venture, which resulted in the recording of a non-cash loss of roughly $24 million, or $0.35 per share. We expect the transaction to only have a nominal impact on 2024 EBITDA. Juan Carlos will have more to say on this in a moment.

We reported a consolidated net loss of $17 million for the first quarter, or $0.25 per share, compared to a net loss of $87 million, or $1.31 per share, in Q4.

We consumed about $40 million of cash in Q1, compared to $30 million in Q4. The large cash usage in Q1 was primarily due to higher receivables, which were up roughly $64 million, driven by higher sales realizations and sales volumes. We expect the majority of this working capital bill to reverse in Q2.

At the end of Q1, our liquidity position totaled $555 million, comprised of $274 million of cash and about $281 million of undrawn revolvers.

Finally, our Board has approved a quarterly dividend of $0.075 per share for shareholders of record on June 26, for which payment will be made on July 3, 2024.

That ends my overview of the financial results. I'll now turn the call over to Juan Carlos.

Juan Carlos Bueno

Thanks, Rich.

Our Q1 operating results improved significantly relatively to Q4. The improvement was primarily the result of higher pulp prices in combination with no major maintenance at any of our mills, and our results in Q1 also benefited from lower costs, including fiber and energy costs. Overall, all of our mills ran at near record production levels, while both our energy production and sales volumes were at record levels in Q1.

As previously announced, we came to the decision to dissolve the Cariboo mill joint venture after reviewing this asset and its future prospect against the strategic priorities, and determined that dissolving the joint venture will allow us to focus our resources to areas more aligned with our long-term strategic goals. I will also add that we were not expecting Cariboo to have any meaningful impact on our 2024 earnings.

In Q1, we invested roughly $18.5 million in our operations. This CapEx spending was in line with our 2024 CapEx target of between $75 million to $100 million. Those of you who follow the company closely will recognize that our 2024 CapEx target is well below our traditional spend. Our 2024 CapEx target is essentially a maintenance of business budget, and is the result of our weak cash flow generation in 2023. I will speak about our markets in a moment, but we're optimistic about our cash flow generation in light of improved pulp pricing expectations for the remainder of the year. Consequently, we are comfortable restarting our Torgau lumber expansion project and the Spokane shorting line project. Both of them will provide significant added value and were originally contemplated as part of our investment strategy for each mill. We have also approved a handful of other small value adding projects, and as a result of these decisions, we now expect our CapEx to be between $95 million to $120 million in 2024.

We will also continue to manage our working capital and costs closely. Despite our improved outlook for 2024, we believe the recovery for all our markets will be gradual.

Overall, pulp markets have improved significantly in the quarter, with both the European and North American markets showing the most improvement, and China lagging a little bit. We're seeing strong demand from European paper and tissue producers, and this demand is primarily the result of merchant destocking and logistical challenges around Chinese imports. To a lesser extent, we are seeing demand increases in North America as well. This strong demand is exacerbating the impact of the permanent closure of NBSK mills in the last two years. While the impact of the finished transport strike and the significant unplanned downtime of one of Finland's largest mills are also adding to the supply challenges.

Looking forward, we expect upward pulp price pressure through the second quarter. In addition, pulp markets may face an even tighter supply situation should the Canadian railway unions take labor action, as they are currently threatening to do. We're implementing mitigation strategies, but ultimately, should this labor action be significant, it could negatively impact our ability to get our Canadian mills products to market.

Our mills run at near record levels in the quarter when comparing our first quarter production to Q4. Remember that Celgar took a 22-day major maintenance shut in Q4 of last year and Stendal took a one-day maintenance shut, while in Q1 we didn't have any at all. Our remaining major maintenance downtime for 2024 is as follows: In Q2, Peace River already has taken their 16-day maintenance shuts in April. This shut was extended by two days due to final work. In addition, Stendal will take a long 17-day shut. Combined, this downtime equals to roughly a loss of about 61,000 tons of production. In Q3, Rosenthal will have a 14-day maintenance shut, and Celgar will take a short four-day mini shut, which will amount to about 20,000 tons production loss in total during Q3. As a reminder, Celgar has moved to an 18-month major maintenance schedule and will not have a major maintenance shut in 2024.

Our solid wood segment results, although improved compared to Q4, are still not where we expected to be. The U.S. and European lumber markets were up slightly. However, high interest rates continue to weigh on housing starts and construction in general. We see the potential for lumber pricing improvements in Q2, but generally expect pricing to stay flat, with any improvement likely linked to improved economic data. We recognize there may be some short-term pricing upside due to recently announced lumber production curtailments or the realization of a prolonged Canadian railway strike. That said, we continue to believe that low lumber inventories, the large number of sawmill curtailments, relatively low housing stock wood shortages created by recent Canadian forest fires, and homeowner demographics are still very strong fundamentals for the construction industry, and this will put sustained positive pressure on the supply demand balance of this business in the midterm.

We continue to optimize our mix of lumber products and customers to current market conditions. As such, in Q1, 43% of our lumber sales volume was sold in the U.S. market, with a remainder sold in European and other markets. Shipping pallet market remains weak due to an overall weak European economy. Once the European economy begins to show signs of recovery, we expect pallet prices to return to normal levels, allowing our Torgau assets to deliver significant shareholder value. Heating pellet prices were down in Q1 due to expected seasonality in this market.

In addition, the integration of the recently acquired mass timber assets continues to progress very well. We now have roughly 35% of North American mass timber production capacity, a broader range of product offerings, and a much larger geographic footprint, which gives us competitive access to the entire North American market. We continue to see strong customer interest in our mass timber products, which has allowed us to build a significant order file. At the end of March, our order file totaled about $80 million.

As I previously noticed, we are in the process of restarting strategic and high return CapEx projects at both Torgau and Spokane mills. The Torgau project is focused on the mill's woodyard and log infeed systems. Once completed in the late 2025, this project will allow the mill to produce more high-quality dimensional lumber. This project was originally envisioned as part of our investment strategy for this mill, and we're looking forward to completing this work while lumber prices are in cyclical lows. Similarly, the Spokane project is focused on the mill's wood infeed and sorting processes. Once this project is complete in May 2025, the mill will be able to source lower-cost feedstock and process it into high-quality lamstock. Ultimately, this will significantly reduce the mill's fiber costs.

In Q1, our overall pulp fiber costs decreased from Q4. In Germany, a steady supply of sawmill chips resulted in modest cost decreases, and in Canada, a ramp up of Peace River's wood room, and our Celgar wood strategy also pushed our fiber costs down in Q1. Looking ahead, we expect further modest declines in pulpwood costs at our mills in Q2, but we expect a slight increase to our sawlog costs due to strong demand.

I am pleased with our new lignin extraction pilot plant ramp-up and the partnerships we have entered into to support the future commercialization of this product. As a reminder, this new lignin plant is a large step towards Mercer being able to develop a portfolio of novel offerings before going commercial with it. We're excited about the future prospect of this product as a sustainable alternative to fossil fuel-based products such as in adhesives and advanced battery elements, to name only a few. This aligns perfectly with our strategy, which involves expanding into green chemicals and products that are compatible with a circular carbon economy.

As the world becomes more sensitive to reducing carbon emissions, we believe that products like lignin, mass timber, green energy, lumber and pulp will play increasingly important roles in displacing carbon intensive products, products like concrete and steel for construction or plastic for packaging. Furthermore, the potential demand for sustainable fossil fuel substitutes is very significant and has the potential to be transformative to the wood products industry. We remain committed to our 2030 carbon reduction targets, and believe our products form part of the climate change solution. In fact, we believe that in the fullness of time, demand for our low-carbon products will dramatically increase as the world looks for solutions to reduce its carbon emissions. We remain bullish on the long-term value of pulp, and are committed to better balance our company through faster growth in our lumber and mass timber businesses.

In closing, I am pleased that our pulp markets are recovering a little more quickly than expected, and the fact that this improvement is giving us the confidence to increase our planned 2024 capital spend, which will allow the benefits from these key high-return projects to be realized even sooner. We also expect an improved result from our solid wood business in Q2. As a reminder, we have an unusually heavy schedule of major maintenance in Q2, which will be a drag on what we're expecting, would otherwise be a strong financial quarter. We will remain focused on our cost saving initiatives, and we will also continue to work on rebalancing our assets in line with the execution of our strategic plan, and we'll continue to manage our cash and liquidity prudently.

Thanks for listening, and I will now return the call to the operator for questions. Thanks.

Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Hamir Patel with CIBC.

Hamir Patel

Hi, good morning. Juan Carlos, one of your peers recently announced a large reduction of its pulp capacity in British Columbia. Just given your presence in the province, how much more pulp capacity do you think needs to come out of the region? And can you speak to how comfortable you are with the long-term capacity potential at Celgar?

Juan Carlos Bueno

Thank you, Hamir. Yes, obviously, this is something that actually news that we were expecting from some time. It is well known that the fiber supply in the province has been pretty tight, and getting tighter and tighter as time goes by. So, it comes as no surprise that, that announcement came up yesterday. Now, one of the things that we've decided to do, and I think that it puts us in a very favorable position in the case of Celgar in BC, is that we're taking full advantage of the strategic location of the mill very close to the U.S. border. That has proven for us extremely beneficial. Our cost of fiber has been coming down as we've started implementing that strategy, and that is basically allowing us to source chips from the U.S. at costs that are competitive as logistics have been arranged accordingly, and we're seeing more and more inflow from the U.S. into Celgar. We can easily think about Celgar going as much as between 30% to 50% of fiber sourced from the US. So again, that takes the pressure off the mill from this very complicated situation that BC is going through.

Regardless, and I have to say that the Kootenays, that region in particular, has not been impacted as much as other regions in northern BC on reductions in access to fiber. So that also has helped Celgar in a good way. We have a very good source for fiber in the mill, and we expect this to continue that way.

Hamir Patel

Great. Thanks for all that detail there, Juan Carlos. And just last question I had was on the lumber side with respect to demand in Europe. Could you comment on what you're seeing there across the different end markets in terms of R&R, new res, industrial, and maybe where if anything, stands out as inflecting on the R&R side?

Juan Carlos Bueno

Yeah. The European market has been very weak over the past, I would say over the past year. The situation in the European economy in general, in Germany, which is probably the one that we focus ourselves a lot more, is still not in a recovery mode. It's still very dormant. The only thing that we have seen recently that has built a little bit of momentum, possible momentum even in prices, has been the resurgence of the U.K. and Ireland market. So, we've been able to get back into that market after being out of it for almost a year. So, Europe is still, I would say, very precarious, and nothing that we expect any significant change, most likely for the next couple of quarters. We'll see if there's some improvement in economy indicators by the end of the year, and obviously that would definitely push the construction industry in a better trajectory as it has been before, or at least in our recovery mode. So, yeah, it's been very, very slow, incredibly slow.

We have the advantage that since our mill is very competitive from a cost production point of view, we're able to serve the U.S. market very competitively. And obviously, we've taken advantage of that as much as we can. In the last year, we did exactly the same thing. Almost 50% of our sales went to the U.S. This year, it's been a bit lower than that, again, because U.K. and Ireland has shown good signs of recovery. But we always play that card. It gives us that confidence that if Europe is not giving us what we expect, then we can take advantage of the U.S. market.

Hamir Patel

Perfect. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. That's all I had. I'll turn over. Thanks, Juan Carlos.

Juan Carlos Bueno

Thanks.

Our next question comes from the line of Sean Steuart with TD Cowen.

Sean Steuart

Thank you. Good morning. A couple of questions. The discretionary projects at Torgau and Spokane, can you give us a sense of the return parameters you're looking at for that type of CapEx? I suppose once markets normalize a little bit, how do you think about the returns for those types of projects?

Juan Carlos Bueno

Absolutely, Sean. We have two important projects, as I was mentioning, the first one -- and both of them were envisioned when we acquired the mills. So, if we talk first about Torgau, Torgau as we acquired it, it has four saw lines, but it's not optimized in any way. It's an old mill, very big in size, with a lot of capacity, but it's totally underutilized. And it was focused its production on pallet production to a large extent. And what we are doing right now with this investment is we're freeing up capacity so that we can produce lumber in addition to what we're producing in Friesau. And that additional capacity that would put Torgau as not only as a pallet mill, but both lumber and pallets, bringing a little bit down the volume of pallets, but really increasing the volumes that we can get for lumber.

So that's what we're planning for. The return on those projects is relatively short. We have those investments coming, probably completed next year. So, by the end of next year, we will already, which we believe that lumber prices will be better by the end of next year than they are today. So, when we said that we're doing all this investment during the cyclical low part of the -- or the low part of the cycle, we're preparing ourselves to be ready whenever the markets rebound. The return of those projects, both lumber or what we're doing in Spokane, when we do it, it's usually less than three-year returns. So, for us, those are high-return projects in general terms.

In the case of Spokane, it's the same. It's a similar situation. The mill, even though it's a brand-new mill when we acquired it, not because it's brand new, means that it was designed ideally or in optimal way. So, there's a few things that we need to do, particularly on sorting lines. Later down the road, we'll do some improvements on the press capacity and those things will drive cost down significantly for us. Again, same as in Torgau. Those are two to three year payback projects when fully implemented.

Sean Steuart

That's great detail. Thanks for that. Second question is on pulp markets. Curious on your assessment of current momentum sustainability into the second half of the year. How much of the recent surge do you attribute -- I suppose a lot of it is temporary supply constraints, but, on the demand side, how much do you think is customer restocking versus real pull from paper demand improvement?

Juan Carlos Bueno

Absolutely. Sean. Yes, what you said is absolutely true. Supply constraint is a huge driver of the surge that we've seen in pulp prices. There's no doubt about it, and it's still increasing. We just heard the announcement yesterday about yet another closure, another 300,000 tons that goes out of the market. So, the elements to keep the pressure upwards around prices is there, is sustained, no doubt. And we do believe that we will see further price improvements along the second half of the year.

Now, when it comes to demand, it has been a lot better, but not as we would like, let's put it that way. So, yes, European demand has improved, North American demand has improved, Chinese demand not so much. We know that they're exporting quite a bit. So, there's a balance on how much of that demand coming in from China goes elsewhere. But it is a fact that European -- especially European, was so low, just I would say six months ago or nine months ago, demand was incredibly low, and we've seen a very big resurgence of demand. It's still, I wouldn't say that is strong enough as we like it, as we would prefer it to be, but it's obviously much, much healthier than it was before.

So, all in all, I think the prospects are positive. The logistic constraints that we see, issues that we still see in the Middle East and the logistic constraints that that causes, now there's a potential issue of railway strikes in Canada, obviously, those things just add noise and probably put more pressure on prices than anything else upwards. So again, we're bullish -- probably cautiously bullish on the price increases that we may see in the coming months. I don't think there is any sign of softwood giving way within these current market conditions.

Sean Steuart

Thank you very much for that context. That's all I have.

[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Harman Dhatt with RBC Capital Markets.

Harman Dhatt

Hi, this is Harman on for Matt McKellar. I just had a quick question. You noted in the release that you've begun work on certain large-scale mass timber projects as of Q2. Are you able to provide a bit more detail more broadly on the kind of pickup we should expect in manufactured product sales or EBITDA in the next couple of quarters?

Juan Carlos Bueno

Sure, Harman. To give you a sense of magnitude, we have two very large projects, and I wish I was at liberty to say the companies, I'm not allowed to say which companies they are, but we have two very large projects that are currently being produced at the mill. These projects will keep us busy for this quarter for sure. One of them is also going to be built up in the beginning of 2025. So, we see the order book gaining good momentum, and therefore, we see very positive results as a result of this.

Now, one of those projects had a delay, a minor delay for them. But a minor delay for them means that instead of becoming a Q1 production project, it became a Q2 production project. And as we're ramping up, obviously when we have a major project that moves from one quarter to another, that creates a hole that we cannot fill up as we would like. So that's why our results in Q1 for mass timber were very short, almost at breakeven level. But in Q2, we expect mass timber to be much better in terms of profitability.

Our sales for the year, we expect them to be almost twice as much as we had last year. So last year, our sales were around $60 million. We're estimating that for 2024, we should be around $100 million to $120 million give or take, with further sustained levels in 2025.

One of the things that we're seeing in this market, which is not different from many things that we see in lumber spaces, with the interest rates being still at a very high level, what we're seeing is that, yes, there's more demand for more interest in projects to be built on mass timber. So, there's a lot of tailwinds on interest from developers, architects on mass timber, many more designs and many more quotations that we're putting out, and projects that are being designed for mass timber than previously before. But what is happening is that there's a lot more that are being put on hold until the financing gets better for those developers. So, what we expect is maybe in 2025, we won't see as much increase as we would otherwise have thought there would be, until there's a start to see a reduction in interest. And then, what we will see is all of these amounts of projects that are being repressed, that are being put on hold, plus the ones that were coming up as new, that's going to come in a big wave. So, we do expect a very, very strong growth of this business, whether it's in late '25 or '26, depending on how interest rates behave. And obviously, we will take advantage of it.

When we look at maturity from our business, we're looking at a business that should be north of 20% EBITDA when it comes to -- when we're at maturity level, and running at least two shifts on our facilities.

So that's the forecast that we have. And we're very, very eager to keep on investing in these assets. Make sure that all three of them, the Canadian one and the ones that -- the two that will have in the U.S. are very cost competitive.

Harman Dhatt

Over the past few days, the Sun has experienced several strong solar flares and eruptions of its corona - the gas ring surrounding the Sun, which is predicted to cause rare geomagnetic activity on Earth.

According to the Finnish Meteorological Institute's forecast, the probability of Aurora Borealis over the weekend is high and the Northern Lights are likely to be visible throughout Finland.

On Friday, the Finnish Meteorological Institute's (FMI) space weather forecast reported four solar coronal mass ejections. The first of these is expected to hit as early as Friday night and could cause a powerful geomagnetic storm.

Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are large clouds of solar plasma ejected from the sun, often accompanied by a solar flare of X-rays.

Although CME's happen over a period of time, the first three may combine with the others, which occurs when faster-moving CMEs overtake and coalesce with other slower-moving ones. They could then hit Earth at the same time and further intensify their geomagnetic impact.

According to FMI, single strong flares and mass ejections are not uncommon, but their occurrence within such a short period of time is less common.

""The last time there were five major, or so-called X-class, outbursts in two days was in 2017, and the last time before that was in 2005,"" Ilja Honkonen, a researcher at the Finnish Meteorological Institute, told Yle.

Large geomagnetic disturbances or storms typically last a couple of days, according to FMI. If there are several mass ejections in a row, the magnetically disrupted period can last for up to a week without interruption.

Honkonen says that at this stage it is still difficult to predict how strong a storm the eruptions will eventually become. He says a strong, or G3-class, storm looks likely over the weekend. Geomagnetic storms of this strength can cause intermittent disruptions to satellite positioning.

According to Honkonen, there is an estimated 10-20 percent chance of an extremely strong G5-class storm, which can cause problems with electricity supply.

Honkonen adds that Finland's electricity distribution network withstands geomagnetic storms better than other countries due to, among other things, transformers that tolerate space weather well.",yle.fi,news,Yle.fi,,0.1764705882352942,453050388,13,"https://images.cdn.yle.fi/image/upload/c_crop,x_0,y_0,w_4256,h_2394/w_1200,ar_1.91,c_fill/q_auto:eco,f_auto,fl_lossy/v1715354211/39-5415965c5d24f913c0d",eng-9554069

THE City of Harare will fork out almost US$9,5 million in annual garbage collection fees if an exclusive deal still under discussion with Geo Pomona Waste Management Private Limited is consummated, the Zimbabwe Independent was told this week.

In an exclusive interview, Geo Pomona Waste Management Pvt Ltd CEO and executive chairperson Dilesh Nguwaya said according to the terms of the transaction, which were exclusively reported by the Independent last week, his firm will be collecting 650 tonnes of waste at a cost of US$40 per tonne daily.

Geo Pomona Waste Management's plan is to get rid of waste, which has been blamed for deadly epidemic outbreaks, like cholera and typhoid, in Harare in the past few years.

The waste will be used for electricity generation for the national grid, according to Nguwaya.

""The City of Harare committed to deliver a minimum of 650 tonnes per day at US$40 per tonne,"" Nguwaya said this week.

""They have been found wanting in respect of waste collection and delivery. This is the basis of the proposal we are currently discussing,"" he added.

Nguwaya explained that the charges set out and agreed to by the City of Harare in the Joint Venture Concession Agreement were ""fairly cheaper"" than those charged in Europe.

""You will be aware that the standards at Pomona are in line with modern European trends in waste management. Below, we put the figures charged per tonne; Austria (US$166), Belgium (US$112), Denmark (US$114), Finland (US$116), France (US$95), Ireland (US$154), Italy (US$127), and the United Kingdom (US$135),"" he said.

Harare mayor Jacob Mafume and top council officials were recently summoned to the Ministry of Local Government and told to relinquish refuse collection to Geo Pomona from next month.

The negotiations come two years after the government handed over managing rights of the capital's main dumpsite in Pomona, Harare, for 30 years to Netherlands-based Geogenix BV fronted by Nguwaya.

The transaction between Geoginx BV, which runs Geo Pomona, and government, has over the years triggered a fierce tussle between government and the City of Harare.

Calculations by the Independent showed that the 650 tonnes of daily waste translate to US$26 000 per day, and US$9,49 million annually.

These are some of the terms of the US$310 million investment deal Geo Pomona agreed with City of Harare in 2019 to transform the Pomona dumpsite.

Between 16 megawatts (MW) and 20MW will be generated and fed into the national grid from the waste-to-energy plant.

Nguwaya said discussions with the City of Harare, which has been struggling to collect waste in the capital, were still underway.

With garbage being a core raw material required to set up the power generation plant, Nguwaya added that Geo Pomona Waste Management would require 1 000 tonnes of waste to generate electricity.

Several other companies have also commenced small scale power generation at their operations for internal consumption, with surplus being directed to the national grid.

Last week, Gloria Magombo, permanent secretary in the Ministry of Energy and Power Development, said small scale power projects like these would be vital to help Zimbabwe deal with power deficits.

Power generation has mainly been affected by droughts, especially at the hydro power station in Kariba. Zimbabwe requires an estimated 4 000MW to power its industries and for domestic use per day.

However, as a result of limited generating capacity, the southern African country bridges its deficit through imports.

""We plan to incinerate 1 000 tonnes per day of solid municipal waste to produce 16MW to 22MW of electricity, which will be fed to the national grid for the benefit of the country,"" Nguwaya said.

""This is a sustainable way of managing waste and reducing the waste that goes to landfills. Previously, the (Pomona) site lacked proper access due to overflowing waste.""

The investment project has triggered fears that City of Harare workers under its public works department may lose jobs when Geo Pomona Waste Management starts to collect garbage.

However, Nguwaya allayed those fears, indicating that the scope of the project entailed retaining jobs.

""These are some of the issues that are under discussion. We do not believe in exclusionary business practices. The plan is to employ the City of Harare workers, who might be directly affected,"" Nguwaya explained.

The decision to pave the way for Geo Pomana Waste Management to start collecting garbage was based on the failure by Harare to effectively collect waste in most parts of the capital, forcing some residents to engage private garbage collectors at monthly costs of around US$90 per household.

In Harare, areas like the central business district suffer from chronic litter and neglect, with piles of refuse accumulating unchecked for extended periods.

A recent investigation by the Finnish Homeowners' Association has unveiled a near-tenfold difference in electricity transfer fees among various providers.

Some companies charge over 40 euros as the basic monthly fee, while others offer prices as low as under five euros.

Out of Finland's 77 electricity distribution network companies, nearly half raised their basic fees last year. Only two providers -- Imatran Seudun Sähkö and Kuopion Sähköverkko -- reduced prices, while 37 kept their prices unchanged.

The basic fee for electricity transmission is a fixed fee billed to electricity consumers regularly. It does not depend on the amount of electricity consumption but is intended to cover the costs of maintaining and operating the electricity network.

The Finnish Home Owners' Association aims to curb the costs of electricity transmission fees.

Large price differences can depend on the company's distribution infrastructure, operating principles and ownership structure, according to the association's Financial and Development Manager Katja Keränen.

The range of the electricity network per customer is wider in rural areas than in urban areas, which can impact costs.

Keränen noted that some companies have also aimed to maximize their profits, while others do not distribute profits to owners or shareholders. The ownership structure of distribution network companies varies from investors to municipally-owned and cooperative entities.

""This is about a monopoly situation, where the customer doesn't have the option of choosing the company. Oversight is therefore necessary. It is important that companies cannot collect unreasonable profits,"" Keränen said.

About SBTi

The Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) is a corporate climate action organization that enables companies and financial institutions worldwide to play their part in combating the climate crisis. They develop standards, tools and guidance which allow companies to set greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions targets in line with what is needed to keep global heating below catastrophic levels and reach net-zero by 2050 at latest.

The SBTi is incorporated as a charity, with a subsidiary which will host its target validation services. Their partners are CDP, the United Nations Global Compact, the We Mean Business Coalition, the World Resources Institute (WRI), and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF).

About SBTi FLAG

The world's Forest, Land and Agriculture (FLAG) sector are one of the industries at highest risk from the impact of climate change. But it is also a significant source of emissions. It represents nearly a quarter of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions - the largest emitting sector after energy, but it also has the potential to absorb a significant amount of existing emissions from the atmosphere. To address this gap in emission accounting and reduction, the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi) introduced new FLAG guidance in April 2023 that requires SBTi committed companies to account for their FLAG emissions and provide pathways for decarbonization in line with the 1.5 degrees Celsius scenario.

GHG accounting criteria and recommendations on FLAG emissions have been historically poorly addressed and there has been no framework on target setting for these emissions. Only a few companies have been accounting for and reporting these emissions at some level. The reason for this is lack of data and methodology, resulting in around 22% of global emissions from the land sector not being accounted for appropriately in corporate carbon footprint calculations.

The SBTi's FLAG Guidance provides the world's first standard method for companies in land-intensive sectors to set science-based targets that include land-based emission reductions and removals.

Will Other Central Banks Listen? | naked capitalism,"At a time when the dominant narrative around cash is that its demise is all but inevitable, as well as broadly desirable, the 2024 payment report by Sweden's Riksbank may offer a cautionary tale.

In October last year, in More Good News for Cash in Europe, More Bad News for Digital Dollar in US, we reported that recent developments suggest that the trend away from cash and toward purely digital-only payment systems may not be quite as smooth or as seamless as some may have wished or expected. One of the developments we highlighted in that report was growing concern among central bankers and politicians in Sweden, one of Europe's most cashless economies, about the unintended consequences of driving cash out of the economy:

Even by late 2020, Sweden had less cash in circulation than just about anywhere else in the world, at around 1% of gross domestic product, according to the latest available data. That compares with 8% in the U.S. and more than 10% in the euro area. As a recent piece in Interesting Engineering notes, Sweden is already ""officially cashless"":

Cash is never needed, not even for small purchases like hot chocolate at a Christmas market in Stockholm. All vendors have a mobile payment chip-and-PIN card reader like the one offered by Stockholm-based mobile payments company iZettle, or they accept payments through the mobile application Swish. Swishing is perhaps the easiest way of payment for everyone.

The Risks of Going Fully Cashless

But now the country is beginning to realise that an almost exclusively digital payments system comes with significant risks, especially at a time of heightened geopolitical tensions. In time-honoured fashion, the article in the UK Telegraph began with a spot of fearmongering about Vladimir Putin.

""People started to realise that it is very easy for Vladimir Putin to switch everything off,"" Björn Eriksson, a retired police chief, former head of Interpol and leading cash advocate, told the Telegraph. ""At first we were arguing for vulnerable people, the elderly, women in abusive relationships who rely on cash... Now we are talking about national security. And it's not only Putin, it could also be organised crime.""

In 2021, the Riksbank, Sweden's central bank (and the world's oldest), introduced a new directive obliging the country's six largest credit institutions to continue providing their customers with certain basic cash services.

But while that may have meant that people in Sweden can continue to access cash from their local branch, it is becoming increasingly difficult to use it as fewer and fewer retail businesses accept notes and coins.

This is partly due to the greater convenience of handling digital payments while the card processing fees are substantially lower than the US. But it is also because most Swedes, including many pensioners, prefer to use cards or mobile payments. As a baker in Stockholm told the Telegraph, ""the only people who bring cash to the shop are tourists. I feel bad for them because they just take the krona home, where it is useless.""

But even that trend may be reversing. According to Eriksson, a growing number of young people are joining the pro-cash movement -- and mainly over privacy concerns.

Rediscovering the Benefits of Cash

Earlier this week, Heise Online, a German online news service that covers IT, telecommunications, and technology sectors, published a long, in-depth report about the Riksbank's apparent rediscovery of some of the benefits of cash. The article also explores some of the Riksbank's concerns about the potential fragility of a fully cashless payment system, as outlined in its 2024 Payments Report, published in March.

At a time when the dominant narrative around cash -- as espoused by senior bankers, central bankers, big tech and fintech executives, politicians and economists, and of course, their ever-faithful servants in the media -- is that its demise is all but inevitable, even in countries where cash is still King (Germany, Spain, Austria, Mexico, Thailand, Japan...), the Riksbank's report may offer a cautionary tale. From the Heise Online piece (machine translated):

""The Swedish payments market has been digitized rapidly,"" states the Riksbank. Cash and manual payment services have been replaced by cards, mobile phones and internet services. ""As a result, payments have become faster, smoother and cheaper overall,"" which the institute points out is ""a positive development."" However, there are groups in society ""who do not have access to digital payment services or find it difficult to use them and are therefore marginalized"". There are also ""serious fraud problems that could undermine trust in the payment system.""

Digitalization also makes payments ""more vulnerable to cyber attacks and disruptions to the power grid and data communication,"" the bank points out. At the same time, the geopolitical developments of the past few years required ""Sweden to have strong civil defense."" The developments suggested ""that we should concentrate more than before on the challenges of digitalization.""

Put another way, cash does not crash. It does not fail in a power cut or seize up during a cyber attack (though, of course, ATMs might). By contrast, digital payment systems need a stable and continuous internet connection to process transactions. When these connections fail, the result is often chaos. Digital payment outages have caused significant disruption in a host of countries in recent years, including the US, the UK, Australia, Indonesia, Germany, Canada, Spain and Norway. Generally speaking, the more cashless the country, the greater the disruption.

Sweden's Cashless Journey

Sweden is one of the world's most cashless economies. In large part, its abandonment of cash was the result of technological and generational shifts. As payment technologies began to change in the first two decades of this century, most Swedish citizens began to prefer the speed, ease and convenience of digital payments.

They were also nudged heavily in that direction by commercial banks, which by 2016 had made 60% of their branches cashless, as a 2019 Riksbank working paper documents. This made it much more difficult for citizens to access cash and for businesses to deposit it, which in turn accelerated the uptake of digital payments and the abandonment.

Sweden's legal tender laws also made it possible for the Riksbank to withdraw many of Sweden's large denomination notes in circulation. For instance, the value of 1,000-krona notes (worth just over $90) in circulation declined gradually from SEK 48.4 billion in 2001 to SEK 21.4 billion in December 2012. Beginning in 2013, this decline accelerated, plunging to SEK 9.7 billion by December 2013.

After playing a part in the wholesale removal of cash from Sweden's economy, the Riksbank is now trying to reverse some of the damage it has caused. It is not the only Scandinavian central bank to have flagged up the fragility risks of exclusively digital payment systems. In 2022, the Bank of Finland recommended that the use of cash payments be guaranteed by law. Like all Nordic countries, Finland is a largely cash-free economy. But like Sweden, it has begun to see the risks of going too far, too soon.

In March 2022, the central bank initiated a proposal for legislation to ensure a minimal level of cash-paid services. In October of that year, the Head of the Payment Systems Department and Chief Cashier at the Bank of Finland, Päivi Heikkinen, even advised households to make sure they have some cash on hand, just in case the country's payments system were to go down. At the time, Finland had just applied to become a NATO member and the government was fretting about the risk of cyber attacks from Russia. In an interview with the national broadcaster, Heikkinen said her intention was not to ""fabricate catastrophic scenarios"" -- before saying that in the worst case scenario, the payments system could go down for a period of weeks.

In Sweden, the Riksbank is already taking countermeasures to try to guarantee a steady supply of cash, the Heise Online article notes:

It is improving the cash supply by setting up new offices where companies can collect and deposit cash. Having such cash depots in more locations across the country would reduce both the costs for businesses and the risk that cash would no longer be usable in the event of a disruption.

This is the only way to ensure ""that everyone can pay"". In general, ""stronger legal protection for cash"" is necessary. Banks should be required to ""accept cash deposits, including coins, from individuals.""

The Riksbank supports its demands with reference to an annual representative survey on the payment habits of Swedes. According to this, ""cash is being used more frequently than before"". Almost half of respondents reported using cash in the past month, an increase of 15 percentage points compared to 2022.

This pro-active approach to bolstering the cash system contrasts sharply with what some central banks and governments are saying and doing in other Western or Western-adjacent countries. As we reported in August, Brazil's Chamber of Deputies is mulling a number of legislative proposals calling for an end to the printing, minting and circulation of physical notes and coins. As the World Economic Forum trumpeted in 2022, Brazilians are adopting digital payments faster than anyone else.

In Australia, the government refuses to legally protect the use of cash in retail settings. The Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, Michele Bullock, has even warned that as the running costs of processing cash for banks and businesses mount as a result of the declining share of consumer payments made using cash, it may become necessary to begin charging people for using cash in retail settings.

Granted, Australia is significantly larger and more sparsely populated than Sweden, making it much harder and more costly to transport money securely to all parts of the country, including remote parts of Queensland, Northern Territory and Western Australia. But whereas the Riksbank is talking about taking on a proactive role, together with other authorities and banks, to ensure that cash can be transported to and from retail outlets at reasonable prices, the RBA is talking about making consumers pay for the privilege of using cash. Meanwhile, Armaguard, Australia's largest currency transport business, servicing around 90% of the cash-in-transit market, is warning of bankruptcy -- unless the banks agree to pay more for its services.

Predictably, Bullock's suggestion that citizens may one day have to fork over extra fees for the privilege of paying with cash -- to protect the banks and retailers from the exorbitant costs of maintaining cash infrastructure -- did not go down well with many Australians. While most citizens are using digital payments for most, if not all, of their purchases, millions still depend on cash in their daily lives.

What's more, the very same Big Four banks Bullock wants to protect from having to part with extra money to fortify Australia's cash network have posted record or near-record profits in recent times, in part because of surging interest rates but also because of the rising fees they charge on card payments. Those same banks received huge sums of cheap debt to tide them over during the COVID-19 pandemic while at the same time closing hundreds of branches and ATMs across the country.

In Sweden, as Heisse Online notes, more and more Swedes see the decline in cash consumption as a negative development -- 44 percent in 2023 compared to 36 percent in the previous year:

The proportion of respondents who believe that they cannot get by without cash in today's society has also increased compared to 2022. This could also be ""an effect of increased crisis awareness due to the war in Ukraine,"" the bankers speculate.

The need to pay in cash in certain situations such as at clubs, in corner shops and at flea markets is also mentioned, the report goes on to say. Some also emphasized that using cash made it easier for them to keep track of their finances. Older people generally find it much more difficult to get by without cash than younger people. In the 2023 survey, half of respondents said they wanted to pay cash but the store did not accept it. In 2022 the corresponding value was only 37 percent...

These numbers suggest that cash may be experiencing something of a renaissance among key segments of Sweden's populations, which echoes similar trends seen elsewhere. For example, a recent survey down under by fintech company Waave revealed that as many as 71% of Australians are worried about the economy becoming completely cashless. Those most concerned include Baby Boomers (82%), regional Australians (77%), and lower income households earning less than $100k (75%) -- a reminder of the oft-ignored class-war element of the War on Cash.

It's not hard to see why concerns about the future of cash are on the rise down under. In recent months, three of Australia's Big Four banks have removed over-the-counter cash withdrawals from some of their branches while increasing numbers of businesses, both large and small, are choosing to reject cash payments altogether. In Australia, it is perfect legal for businesses to refuse to accept cash as long as they inform consumers of their stance before any ""contract"" for the supply of goods or services is entered into.

Aussie cash lovers recently expressed their displeasure with a ""Draw Out Some Cash Day"". According to news.com.au, hoards of people were seen lining up to withdraw cash on April 2:

The movement, led by the Cash is King Facebook group, aimed to show banks and retailers there is still a demand for cash amid warnings the country will be ""functionally cashless"" by 2025.

Social media posts show ""massive queues"" of people, both young and old, lining up at various banks around the country, with one woman sharing she waited for up to an hour to get her hands on bank notes.

""All banks I passed today had queues out the door,"" one person wrote on Facebook alongside a picture of people lining up outside a Commonwealth Bank branch.

Governments in other countries, including Ireland, Spain, Slovakia and Austria, are taking pro-active steps to protect the use of cash. In the UK, meanwhile, cash may even be staging a comeback after ten consecutive years of falling use. According to both UK Finance, the country's largest bank association, and the British Retail Consortium Group, the most influential retail lobbying group, cash use increased in 2022, for the first time in a decade. Whether this rebound represents a genuine trend reversal or merely a dead cat bounce (apologies, as always, to feline lovers) remains to seen. But the mere fact that cash use is growing at all despite concerted efforts by the government, banks and retailers is noteworthy.

So, too, is the fact that Sweden's Riksbank is expressing reservations about the resilience of a fully cashless society. After all, the Riksbank was one of the first central banks in Europe to begin aggressively undermining the role of cash in the economy. That said, its U-turn on cash it is not as novel a development as is suggested by the Heise Online article. The Riksbank, the article claims in its introduction, ""is suddenly emphasising the indispensable role of cash in secure, widely available payment systems. This is a change in strategy.""

That is somewhat misleading. As the German financial journalist Norbert Häring notes (in German) on his blog, while there has definitely been a sea change in strategy at the Riksbank, that change did not begin just now but rather eight years ago, ""after the central bank, together with Sweden's commercial banks, had done everything they could to undermine the use of cash."" Since early 2016 Sweden's central bank has slowed the march towards a cashless society, as Häring reported at the time.

Now, the Riksbank is not just questioning the wisdom of moving to a fully cashless economy at this current moment in time; it is explicitly warning about the potential risks such a move might entail. At the same time, it is working on developing a CBDC -- the so-called e-krona, now in its fourth and final pilot phase, looking at ""how an e-Krona can be used offline for payments if electricity and telecommunications are not working."" Which begs the question: once the e-krona is ready to launch, which will presumably be sooner than most other CBDCs in the West, how will it co-exist with cash? That will have to be the subject of a future article.",nakedcapitalism.com,news,naked capitalism,Nick Corbishley,0.2,453034155,13,,

The logistics centre is built to serve the volumes of goods of the companies of TKM Group, primarily serving the cargo volumes of Selver, one of the largest retail store chains in Estonia, in its initial phase. Spanning a total area of 17,200 m², the new centre is planned to be completed in autumn 2024.

The centre will be a modern building with an energy class of A and built in accordance with the requirements of the BREEAM ""Excellent"" certificate. A solar park will be built on the roof of the logistics centre, which will cover a significant part of the building's electricity consumption.

The chosen location is well connected to major transport hubs, and the nearly 5-hectare plot will also allow for the future expansion of the building.

""NIB's financing to TKM Grupp aligns with our strategy to expand private sector lending in the Baltics. The new logistics center in Maardu will significantly increase efficiency and business opportunities. This will enhance grocery market competition, and ultimately, benefit Estonian households,"" says André Küüsvek, NIB President and CEO.

Situated in the Källa area adjacent to Fortum's Loviisa nuclear power plant, the facility will be situated on company-owned land. Construction of the Kalla test center will commence in summer 2024, with the plant slated for commissioning in late 2025.

Hydrogen production will involve electrolysers, utilizing electricity to separate water into hydrogen and oxygen. With a capacity of approximately two megawatts sourced from the main grid and local household water in Loviisa, the process will be facilitated. A hydrogen filling station will be constructed alongside the plant to cater to industrial customers' needs. Funding for the Kalla test center is fully provided through Fortum's research and development funds, with the majority of the design work undertaken by in-house designers. Operating between 2025 and 2028, the Kalla test center is projected to be operational for about two years. The total research and development cost for the pilot project amounts to approximately EUR 17 million. As part of Fortum's strategy, the company plans to gradually explore hydrogen through small-scale projects in the Nordics.

""Conducting hydrogen production tests at the Kalla test center on a megawatt scale will yield invaluable insights, not just regarding the design and operation of potential larger facilities, but also regarding the business prospects associated with green hydrogen and its derivatives. This pilot initiative marks the initial stride toward potential future ventures and investments. Alongside the test center, we are actively engaged in other hydrogen-related studies involving customers and partners across diverse industries,"" remarked Satu Sipola, Vice President of Power-to-X at Fortum.

Hydrogen generated with clean electricity has the potential to substitute fossil fuels and raw materials across various industries, including steel manufacturing and fertilizer production. Given its versatile chemical properties, hydrogen can serve multiple functions: as an energy carrier, a substitute for fossil carbon in steel and iron production, and a sustainable fuel source.

Fortum holds a robust stance in clean energy production and is dedicated to discovering solutions to assist industrial customers in decarbonizing their operations. The company is actively spearheading the advancement of clean hydrogen in the Nordic regions and is engaged in collaborative research efforts with companies in various sectors, including forestry, steel, chemicals, and transportation,"" Sipola remarks.

Fortum is a Nordic energy company with a mission to fuel a world where people, businesses, and nature flourish together.

THE City of Harare will fork out almost US$9,5 million in annual garbage collection fees if an exclusive deal still under discussion with Geo Pomona Waste Management Private Limited is consummated, the Zimbabwe Independent was told this week.

In an exclusive interview, Geo Pomona Waste Management Pvt Ltd CEO and executive chairperson Dilesh Nguwaya said according to the terms of the transaction, which were exclusively reported by the Independent last week, his firm will be collecting 650 tonnes of waste at a cost of US$40 per tonne daily.

Geo Pomona Waste Management's plan is to get rid of waste, which has been blamed for deadly epidemic outbreaks, like cholera and typhoid, in Harare in the past few years.

The waste will be used for electricity generation for the national grid, according to Nguwaya.

""The City of Harare committed to deliver a minimum of 650 tonnes per day at US$40 per tonne,"" Nguwaya said this week.

""They have been found wanting in respect of waste collection and delivery. This is the basis of the proposal we are currently discussing,"" he added.

Nguwaya explained that the charges set out and agreed to by the City of Harare in the Joint Venture Concession Agreement were ""fairly cheaper"" than those charged in Europe.

""You will be aware that the standards at Pomona are in line with modern European trends in waste management. Below, we put the figures charged per tonne; Austria (US$166), Belgium (US$112), Denmark (US$114), Finland (US$116), France (US$95), Ireland (US$154), Italy (US$127), and the United Kingdom (US$135),"" he said.

Harare mayor Jacob Mafume and top council officials were recently summoned to the Ministry of Local Government and told to relinquish refuse collection to Geo Pomona from next month.

The negotiations come two years after the government handed over managing rights of the capital's main dumpsite in Pomona, Harare, for 30 years to Netherlands-based Geogenix BV fronted by Nguwaya.

The transaction between Geoginx BV, which runs Geo Pomona, and government, has over the years triggered a fierce tussle between government and the City of Harare.

Calculations by the Independent showed that the 650 tonnes of daily waste translate to US$26 000 per day, and US$9,49 million annually.

These are some of the terms of the US$310 million investment deal Geo Pomona agreed with City of Harare in 2019 to transform the Pomona dumpsite.

Between 16 megawatts (MW) and 20MW will be generated and fed into the national grid from the waste-to-energy plant.

Nguwaya said discussions with the City of Harare, which has been struggling to collect waste in the capital, were still underway.

With garbage being a core raw material required to set up the power generation plant, Nguwaya added that Geo Pomona Waste Management would require 1 000 tonnes of waste to generate electricity.

Several other companies have also commenced small scale power generation at their operations for internal consumption, with surplus being directed to the national grid.

Last week, Gloria Magombo, permanent secretary in the Ministry of Energy and Power Development, said small scale power projects like these would be vital to help Zimbabwe deal with power deficits.

Power generation has mainly been affected by droughts, especially at the hydro power station in Kariba. Zimbabwe requires an estimated 4 000MW to power its industries and for domestic use per day.

However, as a result of limited generating capacity, the southern African country bridges its deficit through imports.

""We plan to incinerate 1 000 tonnes per day of solid municipal waste to produce 16MW to 22MW of electricity, which will be fed to the national grid for the benefit of the country,"" Nguwaya said.

""This is a sustainable way of managing waste and reducing the waste that goes to landfills. Previously, the (Pomona) site lacked proper access due to overflowing waste.""

The investment project has triggered fears that City of Harare workers under its public works department may lose jobs when Geo Pomona Waste Management starts to collect garbage.

However, Nguwaya allayed those fears, indicating that the scope of the project entailed retaining jobs.

""These are some of the issues that are under discussion. We do not believe in exclusionary business practices. The plan is to employ the City of Harare workers, who might be directly affected,"" Nguwaya explained.

The decision to pave the way for Geo Pomana Waste Management to start collecting garbage was based on the failure by Harare to effectively collect waste in most parts of the capital, forcing some residents to engage private garbage collectors at monthly costs of around US$90 per household.

In Harare, areas like the central business district suffer from chronic litter and neglect, with piles of refuse accumulating unchecked for extended periods.

Apart from Harare, other local authorities in Zimbabwe have been battling to come up with a lasting solution to address the eyesore problem of garbage.",newsday.co.zw,news,NewsDay Zimbabwe,Tinashe Kairiza,-0.2313725490196078,453028657,9,https://cdn.thestandard.co.zw/images/theindependent/uploads/2024/05/5WSC5emLTfgoEUgpTjLAvagSQiKWWKT4wPLbnUUQ.jpg,

The production result was mainly driven by new - both newly completed wind farms and those under construction in Lithuania, Finland and Estonia. These wind farms contributed more than a third of Enefit Green's total electricity production and about 70% of the growth in production.

The average wind speeds in April were 6.2 m/s and 6.5 m/s, in Estonian and Lithuanian wind farms respectively (in April 2023, 5.7 m/s and 6.0 m/s, respectively). In Tolpanvaara wind farm (Finland) the average wind speed was recorded at 7.2 m/s.

The electricity and heat energy production of the cogeneration segment declined notably (by -38.5% and -39.8% y-o-y, respectively). Approximately half of this change is explained by sale of biomass assets in previous quarters. Electricity and heat energy production in Iru power station declined by 21% and 24% respectively, which was related to two unplanned maintenance stops with combined duration of 5 days.

The contribution of the solar energy segment to the total production remained subdued despite 133% y-o-y increase in production from new solar farms. Total production of the solar energy segment increased by a fifth to 6.3 GWh or ca 4% of Enefit Green's total electricity production.

""Although the wind conditions in April were better than last year, they were still somewhat below expectations. The production of wind farms under construction in Lithuania and in Finland, was below expectations. In the solar segment, production was affected by cloudy weather and, surprisingly, snow that fell at the beginning of April in Estonia. In the second half of April there were restrictions by the network operator in Poland. About 1% of the total monthly production remained unproduced due to our own reaction to negative market prices - we reduced production to reduce related losses. In addition, we offer system services to the network operator in Estonia, which negatively affects the amount of production, but at the same time brings additional income to the company. Without limiting production, Estonian wind production would have exceeded our expectations even given the modest wind conditions. We were especially satisfied with the availability of the WinWind turbines,"" commented Innar Kaasik, Member of the Management Board and Head of Production at Enefit Green.

This means the trade deficit fell on year to March, by €14 million, to €216 million, a decline which related most to trade with EU countries.

Exports of goods amounted to about €1.5 billion and imports to €1.7 billion at current prices, the agency says.

Jane Leppmets, analyst at Statistics Estonia, said that in March this year, the biggest falls were see in trade with EU countries.

She said: ""Trade with non-EU countries grew by 3 percent, but trade with EU member states fell, in the case of exports by 22 percent, and by 18 percent for imports.""

""The most substantial decline was registered in trade with our neighboring countries Finland and Latvia,"" Leppmets added.

The share of goods of Estonian origin within total exports rose by 4 percentage points compared with March 2023, reaching a total of 68 percent in March this year.

Meanwhile the exports of goods of Estonian origin fell by 11 percent on year.

Leppmets said that, in March, the top partner countries for exports of goods were Finland (15 percent of Estonia's total) and Sweden (10 percent of the total).

The main commodities exported were electrical equipment, to Finland, and electrical equipment and wood and articles of wood in the case of Sweden.

Compared with March 2023, the largest fall occurred in exports of goods to Finland (down by €116 million), due to the termination of exports of natural gas, and to Latvia (down by €53 million ), as a result of decreased exports of electricity.

The greatest increase was seen in exports to Singapore (up by €41 million), where Estonia exported more mineral products (including shale oil).

The main commodities exported in March were electrical equipment (15 percent of Estonia's total exports), agricultural products and food preparations (13 percent), and wood and articles of wood (13 percent).

Compared with March 2023, the biggest fall occurred in the exports of mechanical appliances (down by €52 million), mineral products (down by €41 million), base metals and articles of base metal (down by €35 million), and miscellaneous manufactured articles (down by €35 million).

""A rise was registered in the exports of agricultural products and food preparations, including cereals, which increased by €12 million,"" Leppmets said.

The main commodities imported in March were electrical equipment, and agricultural products and food preparations (each representing 13 percent of Estonia's total imports), followed by transport equipment (12 percent).

Compared with March 2023, the biggest fall occurred in the imports of mineral products (down by €80 million), transport equipment (down by €51 million), and electrical equipment (down by €48 million). There was an increase seen in the imports of agricultural products and food preparations (up by €12 million).

In March, the main partner countries for imports of goods were Germany (13 percent of Estonia's total imports), Latvia (12 percent) and Finland (12 percent).

The main commodities imported were transport equipment from Germany, and mineral products from Latvia and Finland.

Compared with March 2023, the biggest fall occurred in imports of goods from Finland (down by €85 million) and Latvia (down by €45 million).

This was due to decreased arrivals of mineral products, specifically reduced imports of electricity from Finland and natural gas from Latvia.

Leppmets added that imports from the U.S. grew the most (by €20 million) as there were more arrivals of electrical equipment than the year before.",news.err.ee,news,ERR,,0.05098039215686279,453022831,33,https://s.err.ee/photo/crop/2024/05/10/2388558hc8e9t24.jpg,eng-9549644

The production result was mainly driven by new - both newly completed wind farms and those under construction in Lithuania, Finland and Estonia. These wind farms contributed more than a third of Enefit Green's total electricity production and about 70% of the growth in production.

The average wind speeds in April were 6.2 m/s and 6.5 m/s, in Estonian and Lithuanian wind farms respectively (in April 2023, 5.7 m/s and 6.0 m/s, respectively). In Tolpanvaara wind farm (Finland) the average wind speed was recorded at 7.2 m/s.

The electricity and heat energy production of the cogeneration segment declined notably (by -38.5% and -39.8% y-o-y, respectively). Approximately half of this change is explained by sale of biomass assets in previous quarters. Electricity and heat energy production in Iru power station declined by 21% and 24% respectively, which was related to two unplanned maintenance stops with combined duration of 5 days.

The contribution of the solar energy segment to the total production remained subdued despite 133% y-o-y increase in production from new solar farms. Total production of the solar energy segment increased by a fifth to 6.3 GWh or ca 4% of Enefit Green's total electricity production.

""Although the wind conditions in April were better than last year, they were still somewhat below expectations.

Other benefits of Kempower's charging technology include extremely high reliability and dynamic power distribution, improving charging availability. Kempower's charger design is driven by EV charging experience, enhanced by features such as cable management and user-friendly charging displays. The Kempower charging solutions to be installed for K-Lataus will offer up to 400 kW charging power depending on the vehicle. Kempower solutions support a charging voltage of 800 volts, just like the rest of K-Lataus's network.

""We are very pleased with the collaboration with K-Lataus, which once again makes EV travel easier for Finnish drivers. This new phase is a great example of the power of Finnish e-mobility expertise and collaboration, as well as the important role of retail in providing charging services. Kempower delivers one of the best and most efficient charging systems to K-Lataus,"" says Erik Kanerva, Sales Director for Northern Europe at Kempower.

""At the core of our strategy has always been to offer high-power charging in prime locations. Collaboration with Kempower really supports this goal,"" Määttänen adds.

There are a total of about 300 charging hubs and over 1500 charging points in K-Lataus' nationwide network from Hanko in Southern Finland to Kittilä in Northern Finland. The network has approximately 175,000 registered private and corporate customers. All electricity charged at K-Lataus stations is renewable and produced with domestic wind power.

And with that out of the way, I'm going to turn the call over to Fred to kick things off. Fred?

Fred Thiel

Thank you, Rob. The first quarter of 2024 was one of our most transformative to-date, we officially transitioned Marathon from being an asset-light Bitcoin miner, and laid a solid foundation on which we're building this organization into a globally diversified company that leverages digital assets compute to build a more sustainable and inclusive future.

During the quarter, we significantly grew and improve the resilience of our portfolio of digital assets compute by acquiring and integrating our first fully-owned and operated Bitcoin mining sites.

At the end of last year, our portfolio consisted of 584 megawatts of capacity, only 3%, of which we directly owned and operated. In less than four months, we initiated, negotiated, closed and integrated our first two acquisitions comprised of three sites, the first two being the sites in Granbury, Texas and Kearney, Nebraska, and the second being the site in Garden City, Texas, that is adjacent to a wind farm.

We purchased these assets for approximately 458,000 and 437,000 per megawatt, respectively, which is approximately half the cost of what some of our competitors have paid to build new sites.

In Q1, we effectively doubled the size of our portfolio to 1.1 gigawatts of capacity, and we gained far more direct influence over our operations by taking direct ownership and operation control of 54% of the portfolio.

We did this while generating significant savings for our shareholders relative to building sites the way our competitors have, and we quickly gained enough capacity to meet our near-term growth targets of 50 exahash by the end of this year.

As we cost effectively laid this path to accelerate our scale and enhance our operational influence, we also launched our first products and services as an organization, each of which demonstrates our commitment to expanding and diversifying revenues by creating advanced technologies that transform digital infrastructure and diversify our revenue streams.

In February, we launched Slipstream, which is a direct Bitcoin transaction submission service that is designed to streamline confirmations of large or nonstandard Bitcoin transactions. In essence, it provides sophisticated users with a simple, transparent and trusted means of adding complex Bitcoin transactions to the blockchain, provided they adhere to Bitcoin's protocol, and it provides Marathon with an opportunity to increase revenue by capturing more transaction fees, which is particularly advantageous in a post-having environment.

Although the service is only a few months old, it has already proven valuable -- last month, just before the having, we earned an additional 4.25 Bitcoin from Slipstream alone. MARA Pool, which powers Slipstream captured one block with 10 Bitcoin in transaction fees and another with 16, generating nearly 10% greater fees than FPPS pools at the time.

While these numbers are small relative to our overall production, Slipstream serves as a tangible example of the strategic importance of operating our own mining pool of being at scale and of deploying our proprietary technology stack.

As a matter of fact, if you were to look at the [Indiscernible] for the past week and look at mining pools, you would see that Marathon's pool performed 40% above average.

As we demonstrated in March, Slipstream was just the beginning. During the first quarter, we also brought our first products to market, all of which contribute to one of our key competitive advantages, our vertically integrated tech stack and provide us with an opportunity to diversify our revenue streams. These products include our industry-leading MARA Firmware, Controller Board and 2-Phase Immersion technology, which we call 2PIC.

We showcased each of these products at the Empower Conference in March and the reception was overwhelmingly positive. We already have paying customers for our Firmware and 2PIC as a pipeline that is in the tens of millions of dollars and growing.

We're currently integrating 2PIC at some of our own sites, which is part of our strategy to optimize our performance by increasing uptime, improving efficiency, and reducing maintenance downtime and costs.

For the market, our goal is to begin shipping these systems in volume to third-parties by the end of this year. While the quarter was highlighted by the significant expansion of our portfolio of digital assets compute and the launch of our first products and services geared towards transforming digital infrastructure, our Bitcoin production was negatively impacted throughout the first quarter by unexpected equipment failures, predominantly transformers that are third-party hosted sites, utility company transmission line maintenance, and the higher-than-anticipated weather-related curtailment across multiple sites.

However, I'm pleased to say that we have mitigated a number of these issues and are currently operating at a record high level of 27 exahash. While there will always be the potential for exogenous events that impact operations, we believe we can mitigate their impact over time as we continue to scale, standardize equipment, diversify globally, and build redundancies and leverage economies of scale that stem from owning and operating multiple sites around the world.

In the meantime, we can always control how we respond to challenges and just as we always have, our team quickly began working on solutions that were within our control.

We were able to immediately take advantage of the newly available capacity from our recent strategic acquisitions. Once it became clear that the transformer issues at Ellendale were more complicated than originally believed, our team quickly began reallocating miners from this site to Garden City, where there was available capacity.

We successfully moved 9,500 idle miners from Ellendale and simultaneously began energizing new machines to expand our capacity. Our ability to adapt, combined with the uptime improving across our sites, these challenges were resolved, enabled us to achieve an all-time high operating hashed of 27 exahash this month.

The transformer issues that negatively impacted our ability to convert megawatts into terahash and therefore, Bitcoin have been challenging, but with our hash rate continuing to grow to record levels, we have clearly been able to work through the challenges and to execute.

And fortunately, the resilience we've built into our diversified portfolio, our ability to adapt to change -- and changing circumstances and our hurdle strategy allowed us to still capitalize on Bitcoin's positive momentum. Despite the operational challenges, we still produced record financial results during the first quarter.

To unpack our financial results, I'm now going to turn the call over to Salmon, who will cover the results in more detail. Salman?

Salman Khan

Thank you, Fred and welcome, Rob to team MARA. As Fred mentioned, our Bitcoin production was negatively impacted in the first quarter by transformer and other issues.

Despite these challenges, the positive momentum in Bitcoin price, our strategy to increase our Bitcoin holdings over time, and our team's consistent ability to execute helped us drive record financial results for the quarter.

Let's dig into the details. We reported net income of $337 million or $1.26 per diluted share in the quarter. This was a 184% increase from net income of $119 million or $0.72 per diluted share in Q1 of last year.

The increase in net income was primarily driven by favorable Bitcoin price, higher production, and fair market value of digital assets on our balance sheet. Revenues increased 223% to a record $165 million from $51 million in the first quarter of 2023.

With the average price of Bitcoin mined being 126% higher this quarter than the year ago period, the increase in revenue was primarily driven by a $77 million increase in the average price of Bitcoin mined.

We produced an average of 30.9 Bitcoin each day during the quarter compared to 24.4 Bitcoin each day in the prior year period. These improvements in production also contributed approximately $10 million to our top line.

As a result of closing the recent acquisitions, we are temporarily providing hosting services to existing hosted customers during the transition period. The revenue we generated from hosting revenues was $21 million, which was not present a year ago. We expect this revenue to taper off in the coming quarters as we work with current tenants of the sites on their transition plans and use that space for our own growth.

Our hosting and energy costs were $71 million compared to $33 million last year. In both time periods, the increase was primarily due to growth in our mining fleet and related costs.

In the first quarter of 2024, global hash rate or network difficulty levels continue to increase. Average global hash rate has increased by more than approximately 86% since Q1 of 2023. That, combined with operational issues at our third-party hosted sites in Q1 of 2024 resulted in a higher cost per coin.

Our non-GAAP cost of revenue without depreciation has improved 16% from $53.7 per petahash per day in Q1 of 2023 to $45.2 per petahash per day in Q1 of 2024. As we realize synergies from our recently announced acquisitions, reenergized production at our third-party hosted sites, and spread the fixed cost over a larger 50 exahash capacity, we expect our marginal cost per coin to improve.

Total cost of revenues, which includes depreciation and amortization $168 million compared to $151 million of last year. Depreciation and amortization was $78 million, a $60 million increase from the same quarter in the prior year. The change was predominantly the result of growing our energized hash rate from 11 exahash to 27.8 exahash and recent acquisition of two sites in Texas and Nebraska.

Our non-GAAP total margin, excluding depreciation and amortization was $75 million this quarter compared to $18 million in the same quarter last year. The change was predominantly related to higher Bitcoin prices, increased production, and increased operational efficiency.

General and administrative expenses, excluding stock-based compensation, were $21 million compared with $11 million in the prior year period. This increase in expenses was primarily due to the increase in scale of the business.

Headcount grew from 30 employees at the end of Q1 last year to 60 employees at the end of Q1 this year, which subsequently has increased to over 100 employees. As we thoughtfully grow our company, we continue to opportunistically add talent across the organization.

Part of our treasury management strategy involved selling enough of the Bitcoin we produced to cover operating expenses and then hurdling the remainder on our balance sheet.

By employing this strategy, we have essentially been dollar cost averaging into Bitcoin at a discount for the past several years. With our cost to produce a coin significantly lower than the Bitcoin price, the dollar average strategy generally has been even more accretive for our stockholders.

With the new accounting rules that require the measurement of crypto assets at fair value and with the Bitcoins price appreciating nearly 150% from the end of Q1 last year to the end of Q1 this year, this strategy has proven very effective for us.

In Q1 of this year, we increased our Bitcoin holdings 15% from 5,126 to 7,320 Bitcoin. Because of the significant amount of Bitcoin we hold on our balance sheet, we recognized a gain on digital assets of $489 million during the first quarter of 2024. Primarily due to this favorable value investment, our adjusted EBITDA increased 266% to $529 million from $145 million in the prior year period.

A reminder that the fair value accounting reflects the changes in market value of Bitcoin that we hold on our balance sheet. In the current environment of Bitcoin price appreciation in recent quarters, we have continued to recognize gains through our income statement, reflecting the impact hurdle strategy has had on our financial statements.

For example, every 10,000 change in Bitcoin price period-over-period can impact our adjusted EBITDA by approximately $170 million to $200 million. Digging more into our Bitcoin holdings and cash position, unrestricted cash and cash equivalents totaled $324 million, up from $125 million a year ago.

Also at March 31, we held approximately 7,320 bitcoin with a fair value of $1.2 billion on the balance sheet. Combined, our balance of cash and Bitcoin was approximately $1.6 billion as of March 31, 2024.

We sold 730 Bitcoin during Q1, realizing cash proceeds of $45 million. These proceeds were utilized to fund operating expenses, including cost of revenues for energy hosting and other cash operating expenses and general administrative expenses.

During the quarter, we raised $489 million from at-the-market equity sales, which we primarily intended to use for miners, acquisition of infrastructure, and for other general corporate purposes.

We expect our future Bitcoin holdings will generally increase, but will fluctuate depending on operating and market conditions. We intend to add to our Bitcoin holdings primarily through our production activities, and we will also continue to sell Bitcoin as a means of generating cash to fund monthly operating costs and general corporate purposes.

As Fred mentioned, we have systematically deployed capital for accretive growth and strategic investments, which our teams have been able to integrate successfully in Q1 of this year. These acquisitions have not only been almost half the construction cost, but also have allowed us flexibility to move our miners from asset-light sites with operational issues as discussed above.

If we are -- if we were to construct such sites on our own, it would have taken us more than a year to energize and likely cost twice the amount on a per megawatt basis, making these acquisitions highly accretive for our stockholders.

The acquisition of sites in Granbury, Texas; and Kearney, Nebraska have been accounted for as a business combination for FASB rules, and we have recognized the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed on our balance sheet.

As a result, we also recognized goodwill of $30.9 million and intangible assets of $22 million, primarily related to customer relationships. We also accrued early termination expenses of $22 million as we terminated certain hosted customers subsequently.

Another item worth highlighting is that Marathon was added to S&P SmallCap 600 Index. Just a reminder, the S&P SmallCap 600 tracks 600 U.S. companies with a market cap between $1 billion and $6.7 billion that have positive earnings over the most recent quarter and four quarters combined. We are proud to be the first Bitcoin miner added to the S&P SmallCap Index.

This inclusion is a testament to the consistently improving financial performance of our organization as we have scaled and implemented effective strategies to capitalize on market conditions.

And that completes my update. I'll now turn it back over to Fred who will talk more about our future plans. Fred?

Fred Thiel

Thanks Salman. Over the past year, we've evolved from outsourcing our operations to third-party hosting providers to owning and operating sites, developing and marketing technology products and using waste and stranded power to generate energy and recycle heat.

During Q1, we laid the foundation for Marathon to become a globally diversified company that leverages digital asset compute to build a more sustainable and inclusive future. And as we transition into the second quarter, we are reorganizing the internal structure of the business to better align with our growth opportunities, sharpen our strategic focus, bolster accountability. and maintain our speed and agility as we scale.

Starting in the second quarter, Marathon will be restructured into a matrix organization consisting of three business units; utility-scale mining, technological innovations, and energy harvesting and supporting organizations such as Marcom, Finance, et cetera.

In my opening remarks, I spoke at length about the first two of these verticals. Utility-scale mining is our large-scale global digital asset mining operations. This vertical is what Marathon is primarily known for today, large-scale digital asset compute that's geared towards enhancing grid stability and the security of the world's preeminent blockchain ledger.

Our technology division is focused on creating advanced technologies that transform digital infrastructure. This group has already launched its first series of products and going forward, its mission will be to deliver innovative hardware, software and services that maximize energy efficiency, improve performance, and unlock new opportunities for those who operate at the edge and for those who are building the foundation of the digital future.

In March at the Empower Conference, we demonstrated how the combination of MARA Firmware and 2PIC immersion enabled us to operate state-of-the-art digital asset miners at significantly higher performance levels with near minimal impact to energy efficiency.

Using this solution enables digital asset miners to significantly increase the productivity of their digital mining assets, earn a higher return on the compute investment dollars, and reduce the total cost of operating sites.

Our third vertical, which I did not discuss in my opening remarks, is energy harvesting. The mission of energy harvesting to support the energy transformation by converting environmentally-harmful waste energy, stranded clean energy, or otherwise underutilized sources of energy into economic value.

For now, it's perhaps easiest to think of this as the next evolution of Bitcoin mining, involving leveraging digital asset compute to convert waste into energy sequester methane and generate and reuse heat for industrial and commercial purposes.

This last part is quite important as nearly 50% of total energy use is used for heat and a portion of that is low-grade heat, i.e., sub-50 degrees Celsius that can be provided by heat harvested from our digital asset compute system.

This includes applications such as preheating materials and industrial processes, heating buildings and water for communities, and food production applications such as greenhouses and trim farms.

We created these business units in response to the opportunities we saw in the market and how we believe this industry will evolve. As you all know, the industry just underwent to Havy event, during which the block reward was reduced by 50%. As block rewards will continue to reduce by 50% every four years, it is critical to find new ways to leverage expertise and create value for others in order to maintain a position as a leader in the industry. And we believe that we can do so successfully, then we can not only mitigate the impact of Havy events but also excel.

While utility scale mining is by far the most significant portion of our business today, we believe each of these businesses will contribute meaningfully to our organization over the coming years.

Long-term, our goal is for 50% of our revenues to come from non-utility-scale mining. It will take time to reach that scale, but these new businesses are already showing progress.

We already have a pipeline valued at tens of millions of dollars for our technology products. Our pilot project in Utah, where we're capturing methane from landfill to power Bitcoin miners is our first energy harvesting project, and we expect to launch several others in the coming quarters.

The demand for these verticals isn't just domestic, it's global, and we're chasing after it. In April, we announced that we appointed a new Managing Director to lead our expansion in Europe, Middle East, Africa, and parts of Asia. Since his appointment, our team has generated promising opportunities across the region from Finland in the North to Kenya and the South.

While Marathon is already operating on three continents, our plan is to continue scaling our international business over coming years such that approximately 50% of our revenues come from overseas by 2028.

In the more immediate term, we're doubling down on our utility-scale mining business. We originally targeted to grow our operations to 35 or 37 exahash by the end of 2024 and 50 exahash by the end of 2025.

However, with the expansion capacity gained from our recent acquisitions and the 45 exahash of additional compute available to us between current orders and options, we're now targeting 50 exahash by the end of this year.

We already have 12 exahash of new miners arriving in early Q3 to take advantage of our acquired and expanded capacity with more coming to fill waiting capacity over the balance of this year. This represents a doubling of our compute capacity and further increases our energy efficiency, in under one year and will strongly extend our position as the leader in our industry.

While we will always be raising capital to continue growing our business, we currently have ample liquidity to fully fund the balance of our 50 exahash growth target this year.

Q1 was a transformative quarter for Marathon, during which we battled against operational challenges to produce record financial results. We launched and began building the pipeline of our first product, and we doubled the size of our portfolio of digital asset compute.

With 11 sites diversified across three continents and the road to 50 exahash clear ahead of us, we look forward to evolving into and excelling as a globally-diversified company that leverages digital asset compute to build a more sustainable and inclusive future for all.

And with that, I'll turn it back to Rob for Q&A. Rob?

Question-and-Answer Session

A - Robert Samuels

Thanks, Fred. At this time, we are going to commence the Q&A section of today's call. We'll start by answering some of the most popular questions submitted by investors through our Q&A platform.

So, our first question from Alexander Ren, who asks post Havy in what way does MARA a better position to stay profitable and grow compared to other mining companies. Fred, do you want to take that one?

Fred Thiel

Sure. So, a number of things. By acquiring sites in integrating, we lower our cost structure. So, essentially taking out the middleman who was the third-party hosting operator and take me out their margin, which, in some cases, can lower our cost by as much as 20%.

Additionally, the diversification of our revenue streams, technologies such as slipstream, which enhance our ability to earn transaction fees over and above what normal FPPS pools earn provide us with abilities to in a lower Bitcoin block subsidy world, such as post-Havy generate generally greater revenues on a per block basis.

So, we believe we're very well-positioned with our diversified revenue streams that we'll be developing over the coming years to be positioned to take advantage of whatever the market brings to us in the near and long-term.

Robert Samuels

Thanks. Our next question, and we had a couple of questions related to M&A, the Parminder asks, is MARA looking for a merger or planning to buy other miners in the short-term? Fred, do you want to take that one as well?

Fred Thiel

Well, we've already shown that we're acquiring hosting companies and the sites for capacity. Now to-date, these have been mostly sites where we have miners installed currently. So, it's a very easy integration.

The challenge with integrating and acquiring miners that have their own fleet of miners is the age of miners that they have in their fleet. Most companies today are still transitioning to the latest state-of-the-art S21 class of machines and maybe running S19j Pros or even XPs.

The challenge is, if we were to acquire a miner today and attribute any value to their fleet of existing machines, especially if their machines were S19j Pro or older, that wouldn't be a very smart idea.

So, essentially, as we acquire miners, you'll tend to find that pricing will be very focused on the infrastructure value as opposed to the miners that are installed, unless, of course, they have state-of-the-art miners installed at which point you can value them at their replacement cost.

But I think typically, most publicly-traded miners have valuations, which exceed essentially the cost to rebuild that infrastructure and it comes down to a question of time to revenues. And what is it worth for you to acquire a miner that has capacity running and miners installed versus building it yourself? And how much extra do you want to pay for that time to market?

Robert Samuels

Thanks Fred. Our next question comes from [Indiscernible] Yu, who asks what's the status of your open ATM? And do you think this is the reason the MARA has not been tracking the price of Bitcoin. Salman, I think this one is for you.

Salman Khan

Thank you for asking the question, [Indiscernible]. In Q1, there was a general rotation out of miners and into the recently launched ETFs. We believe the top-performing miners will see price appreciation as the investors see the results.

Similar to other industries like oil and gold, ETFs have their own position in the value chain while all and gold companies create value for their stockholders and generally track the commodity price with premium on top of the commodity price.

In terms of the ATM as of March 31st, 2024, we have not accessed the new ATM. And subsequently, we raised about $200 million. As a reminder, the ATM gives us no cost of capital to invest in accretive acquisitions or grow the company as we continue to use Bitcoin to fund our operating costs and G&A.

Robert Samuels

Thanks, Salman. I think the next one is for you as well. Orlando CX, what's your current breakeven for Bitcoin. Do you want to take that one?

Salman Khan

Great question, Orlando. There seems to be a lot of diversity in the industry in terms of how the companies report their costs and where is it part and all that stuff. So it's a difficult question to answer in terms of apples-to-apples comparison.

So, with that in mind, you -- typically, you could look at multiple ways. One is marginal cost of revenue without depreciation, which is cost of revenue minus depreciation, non-cash items. And that's one way of doing it.

The other way of doing it is to look at cost per hash, which we believe is a better representation in this industry. So cost for Petahash, as we talked about previously in our prepared remarks, we have improved about 16%. And as we fully integrate these recently announced acquisitions, as Fred had mentioned, some of those acquisitions can save up to 20% on our costs. All these costs will continue to show up in the future quarters as the synergies kick in and we integrate these acquisitions completely.

As a reminder, our mining fleet remains the industry is one of the most efficient which will even get better and more efficient as we progress with time and we hit the 50 exahash as towards the end of the year.

And that larger scale of exahash, it will allow us to spread the fixed cost across the larger pool, which on a unit basis, will make us even more efficient. Moreover, just a quick reminder, our G&A has or coin remains one of the lowest in the sector, and that shows how efficiently the company has operated historically.

Robert Samuels

Thanks Salman. Our next question comes from Tarik P who asks, what are your plans for increasing efficiency and reducing the recent downtime at several Bitcoin mining facilities. Fred?

Fred Thiel

Yes. Great question, Tarik. So, if you think about what happened in Q1, as I mentioned in my prior remarks, we had transformer issues at third-party hosted sites, and we had a utility line maintenance that was done that shut down one of our sites for a short period of time. And then we had weather events. All of these are exogenous factors.

If you think about when you own and operate sites, you look to do things like standardized equipment across sites. So, you have standard operating procedures, you also have spare parts for everything you're doing. One of the challenges with the Ellendale site were transformer issues where some of the transformers that were installed could not operate at their stated spec.

And so as those transformers started to fail, they had to be replaced and were modified. And had we built that site, we most probably would not have used Chinese transformers, but rather transformative of higher quality that would operate within spec.

So, again, over time, as more and more of the sites that we operate at come under our own control, I think we'll see uptime continue to tick up, and we'll see performance improve.

When you think about just operating efficiencies, again, stripping out the third-party hosting provider dramatically impacts your cost because you're stripping out some of these built-in margin. And we also began deploying our immersion technology.

The 2PIC immersion technology does a number of things. For one thing, it increases the -- essentially the lifespan of miners because these miners that traditionally would be air-cooled in many sites essentially have to be serviced every 30 days, they have to be clean, filters have to be changed, fans have to be replaced, and the mechanical load at the sites is higher.

Using 2 phase immersion, you don't have a lot of those issues. We have immersion systems that have run for months without having to be serviced at all. And so that reduces the overhead at the site, which reduces your operating cost, it makes you more efficient, increases uptime.

And the other advantage with 2PIC immersion is that you become fairly immune from heat waves because at the end of the day, the liquid in this tank is boiling, which is that it's likely to be hotter in the tank than the ambient temperature would be. So that makes heat much less of an issue, especially in places like Texas and in UAE, for example.

And if you look at our site in UAE, that site operates with 99.8% uptime. And this is in an environment where the ambient temperature is over 100 degrees and humidity is well into the 90% range. So, I think that's a great example of how our sites operate more efficiently and more effectively when they're under our control.

Robert Samuels

Thanks, Fred. In the interest of time, I think we'll have to wrap up this section of the Q&A. And again, we really appreciate the questions and interest.

I'm now going to turn the call back to our operator to open the line to questions from our covering analysts. Alicia, back to you.

Operator

Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]

Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Lucas Pipes with B. Riley Securities. Please proceed with your question.

Lucas Pipes

Thank you very much, operator. Good afternoon, everyone. Fred, my first question is on the pool performance you mentioned. I think you said 44% better. To what extent was this chance versus you being able to pick off kind of above-average rewards? Thank you very much for that.

Fred Thiel

Yes. So, over the past week period, which that number comes from, it's about 40 point something percent, not 44%. But there were certain transactions that had very high fees. And at the end of the day, you have to win the block to get paid the transactions. But what Slipstream enables us to do is essentially generate additional fees on top of the standard fees that the pool otherwise would earn.

And so even if you look over longer periods of time, whether it's October through May, October of last year through May, MARA Pool has performed amongst the top pools from an average fee structure.

A way to look at it is if you were to optimally fill a block with the highest value transactions, that would be an index of zero. And then how does a pool perform against that with blocks? And most of the FPPS pools operate at a minus 1% to 2%, sometimes 3% below the optimum where MARA Pool Slipstream has been performing above that.

And for the period, really for the early part of this year, to date, it's been almost 6%, 7% and sometimes higher than FPPS pools that it competes against. So, this is an advantage that over time may decline as more people start trying to leverage the types of technologies that we built into our pool.

But this is the whole reason why having a vertically integrated tech stack is so important. It allows us to do things that you can't -- when you're just buying best-of-breed technologies and putting it together, an analogy some people use when describing what we're doing is it's kind of the difference between the PC industry and the Apple ecosystem.

Apple is all vertically integrated from their own chips through their own software, their own cloud services, et cetera. whereas the rest of the industry uses microprocessors from one vendor, operating system from another vendor, graphics, et cetera, from other vendors.

So, we believe a very tightly integrated tech stack allows you to operate large-scale digital asset compute in a much more efficient and optimized manner than just buying third-party services and leveraging third-party pools.

Lucas Pipes

I appreciate that. Thank you, Fred. And from a modeling perspective, would it be too early to guide on an additional revenue on that? Or would you--?

Fred Thiel

Yes, I think you could definitely work with Rob to look at the data, and you can actually just see this in mempool.space [ph]. You used to run reports for different periods of time, and you can see how our pool fees have averaged compared to others.

But I think that over time, percent would be a conservative estimate to use for modeling purposes and then there'll be times where it's higher and there may be times where we operate the same FPPS tools. But 2%, 3% on average should be fine, which, over time, becomes quite a large number.

Lucas Pipes

Thank you, Fred. And turning quickly to M&A. I know this has come up before, but where are you spending your energies right now? And are there kind of more opportunities like the ones you've executed on recently in front of you, I would appreciate your thoughts on that?

Fred Thiel

Sure. So, with the acquisitions we've already done, we have capacity to get to our 50 x a hash goal by the end of this year. And we obviously have the miners inbound to fill that available capacity. So as we look at acquisitions going forward, we believe that, as I've said before, there's a mix of kind of third-party hosting sites that may be attractive.

There's a mix potentially of sites where somebody has tied up power but hasn't fully built out the infrastructure. And then there are true greenfield where you're out talking to energy companies, solar project developers, wind project developers and trying to negotiate power deals and then having to build infrastructure from the ground up.

So, we're looking across all three of those buckets. -- pretty equally. We believe that this period post having now is going to be quite rich when it comes to M&A opportunities. And we believe that there'll be some great opportunities to acquire more capacity. We don't think that there will be a shortage of compute. We look at pricing in the marketplace. And what we're seeing is more efficient, rigs coming to market at essentially the same prices as they are now. And we don't see an additional buying wave now post-Havy of compute.

So, we think that, that market will likely remain fairly stable with relatively easy access to be able to buy more rigs. And we continue to think that capacity, in other words, sites are kind of the shortage, and there's a lead-time if you're going to build sites also.

So we think that as we look towards 2025 expansion because obviously, we're not going to stop at 50 exahash, and we look at 26, 27 and towards the Havy 28. We think that companies like Marathon, where you have very large scale, utility-scale mining, if you would, combined with energy harvesting and technology sales provides you with a really robust and resilient business where you can weather ups and downs and then also get the leverage of being able to continually operate a little bit better than everybody else. That's the goal. These are most efficient, most optimized operator out there.

Lucas Pipes

This is helpful. I want to turn it over Fred to you and the team. Best of luck.

Fred Thiel

Thanks.

Operator

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Flynn with Compass Point Research. Please proceed with your question.

Joe Flynn

Hi guys. Thanks for the question. I had a question regarding the Generate Capital acquisitions. I was wondering how many megawatts of capacity were currently hosted by legacy customers. Maybe if you could provide more color on ultimately the time lines of that freeing up that capacity and transitioning it to self-mining that would be helpful?

Fred Thiel

Yes. So about 390 megawatts of total capacity, which we already had somewhere around 180-ish megawatts that we were using. There's about 75 or 80 megawatts, which will be vacated by the end of June and then the balance, we think, shortly thereafter. So, we think we'll have 100% utilization of that site for our own miners in Q3.

Joe Flynn

Great. And then a follow-up on kind of the power costs. The hash costs look to be impacted just due to the uptime. But just going forward, how should we think about maybe just power cost from a cost per kilowatt hour basis. And ultimately, how owning your own infrastructure can layer in to lower those costs? And how much improvement can we can see in kind of the second half as you install more efficient machines?

Fred Thiel

Sure. So, if you look at the sites in Texas where we can take advantage of a variety of programs to monetize energy, when we were using sites that were operated by a third party, we didn't get the benefit of economic curtailment and power trading, which is something we now have the benefit of. And we have actually reaped some very material gains already in the first quarter from some of that activity.

But that's very opportunistic. It depends on temperature spikes, things that happen in the market that allowed you to really benefit from that. The big difference, rather, with owning sites versus using third-party sites, as you strip out this kind of upwards of $0.02 a kilowatt-hour that the hosting provider was charging you, which was their way of covering their infrastructure costs, their operating costs, et cetera.

We believe we can operate sites that we own for somewhere between $0.005 and $0.01 per kilowatt hour. It kind of depends on where and what type of technology. The more immersion technology we have, the lower the cost to operate the site as an example.

When it comes to power prices, there's some wide ranges from PPAs that are in the sub $0.03 range to things that run upwards of $0.04. So somewhere in that range across the different sites. But the key savings from the shift from asset-light to owned and operated is stripping out that margin in the third-party hosted providers. So, you can imagine $0.01 to $0.015 a kilowatt hour reduction in your cost to mine is pretty significant.

Joe Flynn

Great. Thanks. That's all from me.

Operator

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Dede with H.C. Wainwright. Please proceed with your question.

Kevin Dede

Good afternoon Fred, Salman. Thanks for having me on. Could you, Fred, maybe peel the onion back a little bit on power? I know you moved some rigs from Ellendale. Could you give us your thinking on when you might be able to move rigs back and how you plan on building or filling out? I think you have available capacity at the old generate capital sites. Just give us some feeling for where you're going with power and how you'll be able to support 50 exahash this year?

Fred Thiel

So, let me see if I understood your question properly. So, from a capacity perspective, we'll be filling out a lot of the existing capacity over Q3 and a little bit into Q4 as well. As I said earlier, to somebody's prior question, we should be seeing most of the hosted customers vacated, most -- the majority of the capacity really by end of this quarter and leading into a little bit into Q3. And we have a whole slew of miners coming in to plug in that are all state-of-the-art S21 class machines.

Within the case of Ellendale, Power has -- we've been able to bring the site back up partially right now, it's operating at about 60%, 65% of its max capacity. And each week, a little bit more comes online as transformer fixes are made by Applied on that site. And so far, we've been ahead of schedule there. So, we miners ready to go to plug in there.

We moved 9,500 miners from Ellendale, to Garden City just as a way to -- we have the capacity. It was easy to make the move from the miners. And so it made sense to do that.

As Ellendale continues to come back online, we have machines ready to go -- to plug in to take up those empty slots. So no change in power cost, if that's what you were asking for in regards to power or if that was more related to energization, but essentially, the only site that we're really seeing a challenge at from an energization perspective is just what's left to do at Ellendale, but that's progressing on a weekly basis, as I mentioned, and that will be all back up over the balance of the next coming months.

Kevin Dede

Well, the subtext of the question, Fred, apologies for not making it clear was -- I thought that the -- two sites that came to generate capital, offered you flexibility and adding capacity, power capacity. And I was just wondering how you were thinking about that and whether or not you thought you might need it this year to reach 50%.

Fred Thiel

No, we don't need to expand capacity at any site. The capacity that we have that is energizable, if you would. So, no need for additional expansion covers us to 50 exahash. So anything at the generate sites that would be an increase in site capacity would be additive and think of that as more a 2025 growth target.

Kevin Dede

One more if you let me, Fred, could you add a little color, please, to your energy harvesting theme and your heat you've seen -- you mentioned a couple of things on calls, but not a ton of detail.

Fred Thiel

Yes. So Again, energy harvesting is taking essentially wasted or stranded energy, and that can come in multiple forms, right? It can come in the form of methane coming off of landfills and we've talked about the pilots that we have running in Utah in that regard. You can also capture methane flare gas from oilfields, for example, and there is methane coming out of a variety of agricultural processes.

Obviously, dairy farming generates a lot of manure. You can take a lot of these things such as biowaste, think of food processing plant essentially the waste that comes out of that, the stuff that comes out of ethanol and ethanol manufacturing, which is all agricultural product base. You can take those base products and through anaerobic digesters generate electricity with them. You then use Bitcoin miners to consume that electricity and then the heat generated by the miners can be fed back into the industrial process. So in the case of ethanol and methanol manufacturing, you need to preheat the biomass that you're using to make ethanol, alcohol, for example, manufacturing, experts, beer, et cetera.

You have to do similar things for the fermentation math. And in the case of agriculture, you'll find there's a lot of biowaste that can be used, and then you can generate heat and feed that back into things like greenhouses or shrimp farms, et cetera. So heat reuse is very important. You also have the simple use case of just heating buildings. You can take electricity that normally is going to power a boiler, and you can replace that boiler with our 2PIC technology with miners in it and you can generate hot water, just the same. Same amount of energy generates same type of water at similar cost.

And so if for the building owner, if it's cost neutral to them or even a cost savings to them, to deploy our solution versus traditional boilers or heating or even more importantly, if they're transitioning to electric heat from natural gas or oil as part of the energy transition, then they can get the benefit of having potential cost savings, and we essentially get a situation where our cost to mine Bitcoin is free. And long term, the benefit of energy harvesting is that the processing of the waste material and the sale of the heat back into an industrial process should hopefully mitigate 100% of your energy cost. And so the mining of Bitcoin is done for free.

Now granted, these are smaller scale sites, but some of these sites potentially are 5 to 20 megawatts in size. And you have the additional benefit that eventually, if transmission lines were available, you could just sell the electricity you're generating. So we believe that as a way to diversify our business, lower our costs, decentralize the mining of Bitcoin and this is an important factor because with the having, you're going to see more and more concentration of Bitcoin mining amongst the big miners.

It's very important that you start to develop this long tail of Bitcoin mining that I've talked about, where you essentially have hundreds of thousands, if not millions of things out there that are leveraging energy to mine Bitcoin, all to secure the Bitcoin blockchain and process transactions because over time, large utility-scale miners will eventually come into a place where you can't get energy at utility scale at a lower cost than its cost to produce in those cases.

And if Bitcoin price trends upward, but not at an accelerated pace, then over the next four to eight years, potentially utility scale mining will become potentially a more challenging business. And so the combination of technology, the combination of using alternative energy sources, all these things become really important to optimizing your operations. And our goal is to remain one of the lowest cost operators when we get to the next Havy and be positioned to really continue to lead the industry well beyond the point where the block subsidies are the primary driver of revenues for bitcoin miners.

Operator

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Todaro with Needham & Company. Please proceed with your question.

John Todaro

Great. Thanks. Thanks for taking my questions here. I guess two, if you could just kind of remind us through the cadence of getting to 5x by the end of 2024? And then second question, do you anticipate G&A to kind of stay mostly flat from here? It sounded like there was still some hires you needed to do. But just wondering if we could reminder that a bit more?

Fred Thiel

So I'll let Salman answer the G&A question. But relative to the cadence of deployment, as I said before, capacity, the site starts freeing up really at the end of this quarter and the early part of Q3, we have a large number of miners inbound to fill that capacity.

And then the balance of capacity growth will happen over the latter part of Q3 and into Q4 as we continue to get Ellendale back online fully and fill out the little looks and cans of capacity that exists out there.

We're, at the same time, also upgrading some of the sites that we acquired from air to immersion and doing things which will increase efficiencies and increase uptime. And this is all before we start talking about the benefits of topic immersion and what it can do from an over-clock perspective with minimal impacts to efficiency.

So I think longer term, these types of technologies are going to become really important because if you can over-clock S21 to the tune of 50% or 60%, and you can do it with a de minimis loss of efficiency, then you can save a lot of CapEx plus have the flexibility to over-clock, under clock, all depending on energy costs and vice price. It gives you a lot more flexibility and potentially saves a lot of capital. So we're very excited about kind of the impact of that on the longer term, especially as we grow well beyond 50 exahash has at the end of this year.

Salman Khan

On the G&A, if you think about it from a cash G&A standpoint, excluding stock compensation, which is a non-cash item, we expect it to be flattish on a quarter-over-quarter basis going forward from here. It's a quick reminder that on a unit basis, we continue to improve from here as we deploy more exahash in the company and spread that across the larger exaction.

John Todaro

Got it. Thanks guys. Appreciate it.

Salman Khan

Thank you.

Operator

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Flynn with Compass Point Research. Please proceed with your question.

Joe Flynn

Hi. I had a question. I was wondering what the progress is on Auradine and also, Brad, when you talk about the Kevin's latest and greatest 21, are you referring to 17.5 joules per terahash the most recent Pro version, where it's 15 joules per terahash? Thanks.

Fred Thiel

Yes. So on Auradine, I'm not going to comment specifically on all the company's achievements, because I'll let the management team do that. But what I will say is we are in the process of -- we'll be deploying Auradine in our 2-phase immersion tanks will have essentially the ability to put almost 800 kilowatts of mining capacity in a 8-foot container, which is a huge power density factor, and you can essentially take a -- what is today a -- if you look at our UAE sites, we have essentially each 40-foot container is about 1 megawatt. Well, we can retrofit that container to dual-phase immersion and end up with 3.2 megawatts in that same form factor at fairly low cost for the upgrade. Same miners, just more of them and the ability to consume more power, more power is available.

So we believe that that's going to be a big differentiator going forward. The advantage with Auradine miners for us is a lot of the intelligence that's built into them regarding fleet management. And like any fabless semiconductor company, Auradine is building wafer capacity with their vendors and continue to grow supply. And we'll continue to buy product from them as the supply chain increases.

In regards to the Bitmain question, yes, there's a mix of pros and the 17 joules per terahash. The immersion version of the 2021 does not come in, in a Pro version. But the immersion version operates more efficiently than the air version. So it kind of mitigates the two. Hopefully, that answers your question.

Joe Flynn

Yes. Appreciate the color. Thanks.

Operator

And that's where Ecolab Inc. (ECL) shines - their area of expertise is providing essential cleaning, water treatment, and infection prevention solutions that are always in demand, whether times are good or bad.

The numbers speak for themselves. The global infection control market is expected to grow from $51 billion in 2024 to a whopping $69.2 billion by 2029. That is some serious growth, driven by the increasing need for top-notch sterilization and disinfection across various industries, especially healthcare.

Looking at the bottom line, analysts expect Ecolab's earnings per share (EPS) to jump by 25% this fiscal year, with double-digit growth expected next year, too. They've also been remarkably consistent with their dividends, increasing these shareholder payouts for over 30 years - establishing their status as an ultra-reliable Dividend Aristocrat.

Here's a closer look at why Wall Street analysts consider this stock a top pick, and whether it's a good buy for dividend investors aiming to leverage the ongoing growth and resilience of the essential services sector.

Ecolab Stock: Priced for Growth

Ecolab Inc. (ECL) operates with a niche market business model, focusing on delivering specialized solutions to industries such as food service, healthcare, and oil and gas. This strategic focus has allowed Ecolab to create substantial value for its customers, which in turn drives earnings growth.

In the past year, Ecolab's stock has been a standout, even as investors have shown a significant preference for Big Tech stocks over passive income plays. ECL is up 35% over the past 52 weeks, and the stock has gained 17.7% on a YTD basis - outpacing the performance of the broader S&P 500 Index ($SPX) over both time frames.

With a market capitalization of approximately $65.04 billion and a forward P/E ratio of 34.81, ECL is priced at a premium to some of its peers in the materials sector. The said, the current multiple represents a slight discount to its historical average P/E of 37.9, and the same is true of Ecolab's PEG ratio of 2.5.

In fact, if the company is valued at a premium to its materials sector peers, it's likely because Ecolab's multiples are reflecting significantly higher expectations for future earnings and revenue growth in comparison.

Plus, Ecolab's dedication to returning value to shareholders is evident through its dividend history. The company has increased its dividends for 32 consecutive years, showcasing remarkable financial health and stability. Over the past decade, ECL has grown its dividends at a CAGR of 8.1%, and the quarterly cash payment now stands at $0.57 per share.

With a current dividend yield of approximately 0.98% and a payout ratio of 38.5%, these dividends are well-covered by earnings, and Ecolab demonstrates a balanced approach to growth and shareholder returns. This makes ECL stock a compelling choice for those seeking both growth and income.

Ecolab Beats on Q1 Earnings

For the first quarter of 2024, Ecolab reported EPS of $1.34, which narrowly surpassed analysts' expectations. The company's revenue for the period was $3.75 billion, in line with estimates. Management attributed the Q1 beat to 5% organic sales growth and a 400 basis point expansion in organic operating income margin.

Cash flow from operating activities totaled $649 million during Q1, while free cash flow rose to $448 million from $423 million in the year-ago quarter.

Ecolab also hiked its EPS forecast for the full fiscal year, and now anticipates $6.40 to $6.70 for fiscal 2024, compared to its prior guidance of $6.10 to $6.50.

Ecolab's recent strategic initiatives could help drive sustainable growth. The inauguration of the wastewater treatment plant on Jurong Island is a prime example. This facility - located on the site of a sizable new M&A deal between Shell (SHEL) and Glencore (GLNCY) - is designed to handle variable bio-treater wastewater with advanced ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis processes, can treat up to 24,000 cubic meters of water per month.

Additionally, Ecolab's achievement of sourcing 100% renewable electricity for its European operations marks a significant milestone. By utilizing the Mörknässkogen wind farm in Finland, Ecolab now powers all its European sites sustainably, contributing to an 80% global renewable electricity sourcing level. This commitment to renewable energy not only reduces operational costs over time, but also positions Ecolab as a forward-thinking investment in the eyes of environmentally conscious investors.

What Do Analysts Expect for ECL?

Analyst sentiment around Ecolab is overwhelmingly positive. Out of 23 analysts covering the stock, 7 recommend a ""strong buy,"" 2 suggest a ""moderate buy,"" and 14 advise a ""hold,"" for a consensus rating of ""moderate buy.""

The mean price target is $242.06, implying expected upside of 3.6% from Thursday's close. The Street-high price target of $260 - shared by analysts at Barclays, Mizuho, RBC Capital, and Piper Sandler - is about 11.3% overhead.

Ecolab Makes a Compelling Investment Case

Wrapping up, Ecolab's performance in 2024 has been nothing short of impressive. With its strategic moves in sustainability, solid financials, and the backing of a confident analyst community, it's clear why growth-minded investors are keeping a keen eye on this Dividend Aristocrat. For those looking to add a mix of growth, resilience, and environmental stewardship to their portfolio, Ecolab seems to tick all the right boxes.

Fortum has announced plans for a hydrogen pilot plant near to its Loviisa nuclear power plant, while OKG has signed a contract with Hynion to supply surplus hydrogen from operations at the Oskarshamn plant to its hydrogen filling stations.

Uniper-owned OKG has used electricity produced by the Oskarshamn nuclear power plant in Finland to produce hydrogen through electrolysis of water since 1992. This hydrogen was initially produced to meet the nuclear power plant's own needs: the hydrogen was added to the reactor coolant of the plant's three boiling water reactors in order to reduce the risk of stress corrosion cracking of the reactor piping by reducing the amount of free oxygen in the coolant.

The hydrogen produced at Oskarshamn is now only required for use in unit 3 of the nuclear power plant following the permanent closure of units 1 and 2 in June 2017 and December 2016, respectively, leaving an overcapacity. OKG has modernised the hydrogen plant to expand operations and signed its first contract to supply fossil-free hydrogen from the plant to industrial gases company Linde in 2022.

All businesses in Uniper's portfolio have two main tasks: to ensure a secure energy supply and to drive the energy transition, and the company is playing an important role in the establishment of Europe's hydrogen economy and the development of a significant business in renewable energy, OKG CEO Johan Lundberg said. ""It's fantastic that the surplus production we sell can help Hynion with hydrogen to their hydrogen filling stations so that together we can contribute to reducing carbon dioxide emissions.""

Hynion said the partnership represents an important part of its strategy to reduce dependence on individual suppliers as it prepares for increasing hydrogen-powered traffic in Sweden. ""We need stable producers who, together with us at Hynion, want to contribute to the energy transition and a carbon-free future. The hydrogen delivery from OKG is an important step to secure the supply of hydrogen at our stations,"" said Hynion AS CEO Slavica Djuric.

In a separate announcement, Finnish utility Fortum said it will build a hydrogen production pilot plant in in the Källa area near the company's Loviisa nuclear power plant. Construction of the test centre, on land already owned by the company, will begin this summer, and the plant is scheduled to be commissioned in late 2025.

Hydrogen will be produced by electrolysers with a capacity of around 2 MW, using electricity from the main grid and local domestic water supplies in Loviisa. A filling station will be built in connection with the plant for the delivery of hydrogen to industrial customers. The Källa test centre is expected to be in operation for around two years, and the total R&D cost of the pilot project is around EUR17 million (USD18.3 million). The test centre is being funded entirely from Fortum's research and development funds.

""Testing hydrogen production at the Kalla test centre on a megawatt scale will provide valuable information not only in terms of the design and operation of potential larger plants, but also of the business opportunities provided by green hydrogen and hydrogen derivatives,"" said Satu Sipola, vice president of Power-to-X at Fortum. ""The pilot project is the first step towards possible future projects and investments.""

""Fortum has a strong position in clean energy production, and we strive to find solutions to help our industrial customers decarbonise their operations. We work to drive the development of clean hydrogen in the Nordic countries, and we engage in active research cooperation with companies in the forest, steel and chemical industries and the transport sector, for example,"" Sipola said.",world-nuclear-news.org,news,World Nuclear News (WNN),,0.2,452965352,9,,eng-9549982

-Astypalaea, Halki, Tilos and Syros pave the way for sustainable tourism, waste management and technology

Astypalaea, Halki and Tilos. You may not have heard of these small, remote Greek islands in the South Aegean, but they all share something in common: ambitious goals despite their small size.

For decades, islands like these have been considered merely remote stops on ferry routes that had to be supported by state subsidies - no business wants to operate at a loss. They were considered unprofitable compared to the big islands like Santorini and Mykonos, which attract large numbers of visitors.

Today, however, these islands are attracting global attention for their green prospects and innovation-focused initiatives. The trio is adopting a range of measures of environmental conservation, sustainability and innovation, some of which are shining examples of best practice.

Central and northern European countries, such as Austria, Finland and Denmark, have long had high scores for eco-innovation, while Greece has lagged behind. Today, the south-eastern European country is demonstrating how sustainability can be achieved and innovation implemented using smart technology, integrated systems and innovative narratives.

Greece is blessed with unparalleled natural beauty, yet over the last decade, Greece has faced a number of complex challenges related to the environment, energy, natural resources, cultural preservation, agriculture and tourism. Climate change is of particular concern, with scientists noting that the region is warming 20% faster than the global average. In May 2022, Greece passed its first climate law, which outlines specific targets to combat climate change and calls for the phasing out of the use of coal for electricity generation by 2028. Under the legislation, the authorities aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030 and 80% by 2040, before achieving zero net emissions by 2050.

State, regional and local authorities, with the support of the private sector, have tacitly joined forces in recent years to find solutions that strike a balance between preserving the character of islands, reducing emissions and implementing 21st century technological advances.

The three islands are joined by Rhodes and Syros, the capitals of the Dodecanese and Cyclades respectively. Together, they play a key role in shaping the future of the South Aegean and Greece as a whole. These islands create a blueprint that can be shared with the rest of the country and possibly with other countries.

These initiatives are not only aimed at improving the quality of life of local residents, but these islands will certainly prove to be particularly attractive to eco-minded travellers, who are increasingly choosing destinations based on sustainability factors.

Astypalaia: A pioneer in smart technology and green energy

The butterfly-shaped island of Astypalea in the Dodecanese, with an area of 97 square kilometres and 1,334 inhabitants, is taking important steps to become the first smart and sustainable island in the Mediterranean.

A public-private partnership involving the Greek state, the South Aegean Region and the Volkswagen Group, supported by EU funding, is implementing a pioneering project to transform the island into a model for e-mobility, smart mobility and renewable energy.

Four pillars are at the heart of this green energy-focused initiative, namely vehicle electrification, smart mobility, charging and energy and autonomous driving.

Since its launch in 2020, measures taken include the upgrading of the island's energy network and infrastructure, the installation of free public charging stations for electric vehicles and the introduction of e-mobility services. Residents can apply for subsidies for the purchase of an electric vehicle.

The introduction of on-demand buses and car-sharing services has proved to be very successful. Through the Astybus mobile app, residents and visitors can call an e-bus, which is gradually replacing conventional municipal buses, to pick them up from a virtual bus stop. In its first 150 days of operation, AstyBus made 24,370 trips. If you prefer your own means of transport, the AstyMove app allows you to book and pick up an e-car, e-bike or e-scooter for personal use.

At the same time, local authorities hope that by 2026, a hybrid energy system consisting of a photovoltaic station and batteries will cover 80% of the island's total energy needs.

Halki

A model for net zero carbon emissions on the west coast of Rhodes, the hilly Halki bears the title of Greece's first eco-island. Launched in 2021, the national initiative revolves around a circular economy initiative focused on decarbonisation and the transition to green energy. The key objectives are to increase the use of renewable energy sources, sustainable water and waste management, the introduction of e-mobility and the transformation of the agricultural and tourism sectors into ""green"" sectors. What is particularly impressive is that, through the GR-eco islands programme, the island is one of the few places in the whole world that have achieved a zero carbon footprint. That is, the amount of greenhouse gas emissions is offset by an equivalent amount. This is not only a critical step forward for the region, but also a bold challenge for the country and the world at large.

A 1MW photovoltaic power plant has been installed in Halki, allowing virtual net metering and offsetting of energy costs for residents and businesses, who are part of an energy community. Many have seen significant reductions in their electricity bills and some have even received credits.

Smart street and architectural lighting, electric vehicles and mobile device charging through a smart counter are among the aspects of the program. Residents are offered incentives to replace conventional vehicles with electric ones and have access to telemedicine services.

Halki is an example of what can be achieved when local communities and the private sector work together to find solutions to critical issues through the adoption of new technologies and low-carbon energy applications.

Tilos: certified for zero waste

With an area of just 63 square metres, the pristine Tilos may be tiny, but the rocky island of the Dodecanese is leading the way in the region by adopting a circular economy mentality. In July 2023, it was declared the first island in the world with zero waste certification. In just two years, Tilos has reduced its landfill disposal rate from 87% to zero.

Just Go Zero Tilos, a pioneering integrated waste management programme, was launched in December 2021 and includes the closure of the island's landfill. The programme is being implemented by the Municipality of Tilos in collaboration with Polygreen and the South Aegean Region, with the aim of making the island waste-free.

Through the programme, all waste is collected and, based on the principles of the circular economy, reused in order to eliminate its environmental footprint. Residents and business owners sort their waste into bins which are collected from their doorstep on specific days and taken to the Centre for Circular Innovation. There, recyclables are separated and packaged and non-recyclables are sent for waste-to-energy conversion. Organic waste is converted into fertilizer.

Locals can even track recycling efforts through a mobile phone app. Visitors are also required to follow the rules. They are provided with instructions on how to sort their waste. Old clothes, appliances and furniture find new life at the Creative Recycling Center.

The island's 780 inhabitants have achieved an astonishing 90% waste recycling rate, more than double the EU average of around 40%. According to the South Aegean Region, Tilos has the highest recycling rate of any municipality in the world. Tilos aims to produce 20% less waste, use 30% less plastic and recover 90% more waste by 2025. The pilot system is complemented by a hybrid solar and wind power generation system, with energy storage in batteries, which meets the needs of the port city of Livadia, home to around 500 people.

Polygreen was so successful in Tilos that it is now implementing a similar programme in Abu Dhabi.

Rhodes: paving the way for sustainable tourism

The rapid growth of the Greek tourism industry over the last decade has led to issues such as overcrowding in popular destinations and locations and pressure on public infrastructure. Fully aware of these challenges, the South Aegean Region has taken the initiative to research, design and implement measures to make sustainable tourism a present-day reality rather than a distant utopia.

In early 2022, the region signed a strategic partnership agreement with leading tour operator TUI and the TUI Care Foundation to create The Rhodes Co-Lab. The aim was to bring together tourism industry stakeholders to find solutions and create a holistic sustainable business model for travel destinations worldwide. Its three main pillars focus on regenerating the natural environment, enhancing social development and cultural heritage and promoting inclusive economic growth in tourism. Within these pillars there are six strategic priorities and 26 measures aimed at making Rhodes climate neutral in 2030, 20 years ahead of the national target.

A comprehensive, progressive plan designed to focus on green growth and address vital issues such as quality of life, infrastructure development, biodiversity restoration, social cohesion and prosperity is already underway. Among the initial priorities, which will be supported with European and national funding, are reforestation, pollution reduction and the introduction of environmental education programmes for children. The key to a favourable outcome is the active involvement of the community in the consultations. Plans include the creation of an international centre for sustainable tourism development, whose main role will be to create and implement best practices and policies for sustainable tourism worldwide.

Syros: creating a new technology and innovation hub

In January 2023, Syros welcomed the Aegean Neorion Innovation Centre (ANIC), a collaboration between the South Aegean Region, Onex Group & Technologies, Cisco and the University of the Aegean. The centre was created for several reasons: primarily to research, design and implement innovative solutions to the challenges faced by local communities. ANIC is a dynamic, modern technology and innovation ecosystem, whose aim is to act as a key hub for the development of value-added technological solutions at regional and national level.

It was established to provide local businesses with innovative solutions and help them in their digital transformation, while bringing new technologies to areas such as education, health and the environment.

ANIC's first project involved the transformation of Syros General Hospital into a safe, green and smart facility. Tablets and mobile phones have eliminated the use of forms, while sensors track the number of visitors and prevent overcrowding. Smart meters monitor environmental parameters and help reduce energy consumption.

Tilos, Halki and Astypalaia are at the forefront of Greece's efforts towards sustainability and innovation and are proof that small can certainly be powerful. At the same time, Rhodes and Syros are becoming incubators and think tanks for sustainable tourism and technology, respectively, whose impact could well be global.

Contact with visitors from near and distant shores over the centuries has meant that islanders have always been receptive to change, progress and development. This open-minded spirit and willingness to adapt potentially points to a very bright future for the South Aegean and Greece as a whole.",money-tourism.gr,news,ΧΡΗΜΑ & ΤΟΥΡΙΣΜΟΣ money-tourism.gr,,0.388235294117647,452950074,5,https://money-tourism.gr/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/N-AIGAIO-XT-311_02.jpg,

The new law identifies two lists of materials -- 34 critical and 17 strategic -- that are crucial for the green transition. Lithium is one of a small group of highly significant critical raw materials.

Lithium has been classified as a key component in the EU's quest to ditch fossil fuels and switch to clean energy as the mineral is set to see increased demand for the massive production of batteries needed for electric vehicles and energy storage systems under the EU's energy transition plan, which pledges to slash greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030, below 1990 levels.

The International Energy Agency estimates that demand for lithium will grow globally 42-fold by 2040 compared to last year.

""It's mainly the cars, the buses and the the trucks in the future that will eat up all the lithium,"" Peter Tom Jones, director at KU Leuven Institute for Sustainable Metals & Minerals told Euronews.

An exceptionally light mineral, lithium plays a crucial role in facilitating the green and digital transition by providing a means to store and utilise clean energy efficiently in both stationary and mobile applications. Energy storage plays a crucial role in the climate transition by helping to address the intermittency of renewable energy sources like solar and wind power.

""More and more companies will have renewable electricity production and they will store that in a large stationary battery so that they can use it as a smart system where they either store the electricity or they give the electricity back to the grid,"" Jones added.

Lithium can be extracted from hard rocks (lithium carbonate) or from liquids (lithium hydroxide). As regards the lithium brines, scientists make a ""clear distinction"" between geothermal lithium brines and the so-called salars which are found in Chile, Argentina and Bolivia, but not in Europe, where Jones only sees real potential in the hard-rock deposits.

""Trying to recover lithium from geothermal brines is still largely unproven technology, it's not a commercial product,"" said Jones.

European industry is mostly looking for lithium carbonate, which is suitable for the production of lithium-ion batteries together with a cathode material based on nickel, manganese and cobalt -- other key raw materials under the CRMA.

Processed lithium is primarily imported from Chile (79%), Switzerland (7%), Argentina (6%), the US (5%), and the remainder from China, Andreas Bittner, executive director of European Lithium Institute, told Euronews, noting the EU is currently importing 81% of extracted lithium and 100% of processed lithium.

While this raw material is now exclusively produced outside the EU, 27 deposits have been identified in Europe -- in Czechia, Finland, France, Ireland, Germany, Portugal, Serbia, Spain and the UK -- and around ten of those have a realistic scenario of exploitation, the largest being the Jadar deposit in Serbia, according to Jones.

Taking into account current and feasible development of these ten sites, geologist Wouter Heijlen believes that -- by 2030 -- EU self-sufficiency for lithium from mines could reach 50% of the bloc's demand. Deposits vary in depth and are often deep underground, but the sole working European mine -- in Portugal -- is open-cast.

""Only Portugal is currently producing lithium in Europe (except the UK) from hard rock deposits, while the largest resources are accounted in Germany,"" said Bittner, though the mined lithium is currently only used for ceramics rather than batteries.

Despite the EU's CRMA speeding up permits for extraction and refining, mining processes entail infamous challenging red tape for permits and construction. Other issues may delay lithium projects in Europe. Social acceptance, for example, has been a challenge in Portugal and Serbia.

A recent scientific study of lithium projects under development in four countries published by Material Proceedings, claimed that the Portuguese open pit mine Mina do Barroso project, owned by Savannah Resources, was the only business venture facing strong opposition by the local population. Ongoing projects in France, Finland and in the UK ""seem to be favoured by the local population, as no signs of controversies or disputes have been reported"".

Whether projects are green-field or brown-field may play a key role, since locals living in the latter are accustomed to a history of mining, where the entire economy is dependent on mining projects. Green-field projects face increased opposition due to the absence of mines in the area before.

""The biggest issue I see, especially for arid regions like Portugal and Spain, is the water consumption,"" said Jones, adding he is involved in two EU-funded lithium projects focusing on how to reduce water consumption levels by 90% when compared to benchmark approaches.

Another uncertainty about lithium is the potential breakthrough of sodium ions batteries, which could replace lithium demand in the long-term. ""The big advantage is that you would not have to mine large volumes of critical metals, such as lithium and cobalt, which is a critical metal, whereas sodium is very abundant and it can be extracted from the sea,"" said Jones, noting this scenario remains ""extremely uncertain"".

The feasibility of having all the projects in the pipeline coming to fruition by 2030 is another ""big question mark"" which could hamper the EU goals.

Several trade partnerships have been forged by the EU with countries that either have lithium production or identified reserves with projects in the pipeline. These include Argentina, Canada, Chile, Democratic Republic of Congo, Greenland, Namibia, Norway, Rwanda and Uzbekistan. The bloc also reinforced transatlantic cooperation on critical raw materials by forging a partnership with the US last month with a view to ""diversifying global critical minerals supply chains"".",euronews.com,news,Euronews English,,0.2,452934261,13,https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/08/42/36/24/1200x675_cmsv2_7d18d6f1-7b94-53bf-96e7-97b25af40b8a-8423624.jpg,eng-9543034

Cargill Inn and Asia Society for Social Improvement and Sustainable Transformation (ASSIST), a foreign non-governmental organisation, on May 8 announced their partnership and the launch of Green Aqua project which aims to reduce water pollution through promoting the application of sustainable aquaculture practices in the Mekong Delta region.

The project will be implemented until July 2026, initially in Ca Mau province. It aims to provide training for more than 300 shrimp farmers on farming practices towards the Aquaculture Stewardship Council (ASC) standards on responsible aquaculture, as well as animal feed, waste management, and biodiversity preservation.

Ten outstanding trainees will have a chance to attend intensive training, enabling them to transfer farming techniques to their fellows in the following periods.

At the same time, a shrimp farming cooperative will have the opportunity to receive an ASC certificate, while three pilot farms will strive to reduce wastewater by 30% and cut nitrogen and phosphorus emissions by 20% by 2025.

The southernmost province of Ca Mau is the largest shrimp production hub in the country with a total farming area of 280,000 hectares.

During the two years of pilot implementation, the project will focus on supporting shrimp farms and creating a positive impact on the shrimp farming area across the province, while building local farmers' capacity to adapt to climate change.

The project is expected to contribute to coping with climate change challenges, improving the environment quality through promoting and strengthening processes to sustainably use water resources and treating waste in the aquaculture sector of Ca Mau in particular and the Mekong Delta region in general./.

Canada regards Vietnam as gateway to the Indo-Pacific

Quebec always considers Vietnam a gateway to the Indo-Pacific - a rapidly growing and dynamic region, according to Director of the Federation of Chambers of Commerce of Quebec Florent Favrel.

After the successful trip to Vietnam and Malaysia by the Canadian trade delegation, led by Minister of International Trade Mary Ng, Ottawa is actively targeting this region with activities to prepare for the Northern American country's businesses to invest and do business successfully in the Indo-Pacific.

The recent ""Gateway to the Indo-Pacific"" event was jointly organized by the Canadian Chamber of Commerce and the Export Development Canada (EDC) serving as a forum to help Canadian businesses get a deeper insight into business prospects as well as necessary solutions to achieve success in the region that is considered dynamic and extremely rapidly developing.

Vice President of Strategic Policy & Global Partnerships at the Canadian Chamber of Commerce Catherine Fortin LeFaivre highlighted the event ""Gateway to the Indo-Pacific"" held in Montreal as an opportunity for businesses to better understand opportunities in this region, through experts from businesses and research organizations and people with practical experience.

This will help enterprises outline more direction to consider expanding their business activities in the Indo-Pacific.

Canada is currently accelerating the implementation of the Indo-Pacific Strategy, whereby the country has invested around US$2 billion focusing on the trade sector to build more links and strengthen its presence in the region.

In this strategy, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is considered by Canada to play a central role and the two sides have seen significant development in all aspects of the relationship.

Asia-Pacific Foundation of Canada President and CEO Jeff Nankivell commented that one of the elements of the Indo-Pacific Strategy is to organize field trips for Canadian trade delegations, where brings together both government and business representatives.

Canada's trade delegation recently visited Malaysia and Vietnam and is expected to visit Indonesia and the Philippines later this year.

According to Jeff Nankivell, Canada is also opening offices to carry out tasks such as the Ministry of Agriculture in the Philippines, which serves as a center for agricultural products and agri-food products in the region. Vietnam will also play an important role in these activities as it boasts the greatest potential for expanding relationships.

In addition to the Philippines, Canada also has a Southeast Asia Trade Office in Singapore, and an Innovation Office which is about to open in Vietnam. The country is negotiating a free trade agreement with Indonesia in particular and ASEAN as a whole, he said.

According to Olivia Lee, Chief Representative, Southeast Asia at Export Development Canada, this region offers great potential for Canadian firms, especially in three growth areas: infrastructure, farm produce and progressive manufacturing fields.

One of the main things the agency sees in Vietnam at present is the energy transition, including increased development of wind and solar energy, Lee stated.

Nankivell said that Canadian public opinion currently shows a very high level of interest in developing and expanding relations with Vietnam.

Canadian universities and colleges are seeking to attract more students from Vietnam, while Canadian businesses are looking to invest in the Southeast Asian nation and also want to attract Vietnamese investment in a certain new field.

In the agriculture and agri-food sector, potential has also been identified for Canadian businesses and vice versa. With more than 30 years of experience working in the field of Canada - Asia relations, he believes that both sides have the best conditions in the relationship in all aspects.

Director of the Federation of Chambers of Commerce of Quebec Florent Favrel described ""Gateway to the Indo-Pacific"" as an extremely useful event which provided a lot of information about the potential of the Indo-Pacific region, especially Vietnam.

Vietnam is one of the first doors that Quebec businesses should open because of great potential that the nation can bring to them, he added.

Cooperatives urged to focus on branding to expand exports of organic teas

Cooperatives have been advised to focus on branding and improving product quality to expand tea exports to highly-demanding markets, especially organic tea products.

A report by the Center for Digital Transformation and Agricultural Statistics showed that the organic tea cultivation areas remain modest in Việt Nam, estimated at around 8,000ha or 6 per cent of the country's total tea growing area.

In Thái Nguyên Province which is home to the country's largest tea growing area of nearly 23,000ha, there are only 100ha certified organic.

Tea growing area certified organic by the EU is only at 2,500ha.

To expand exports to demanding markets with strict requirements of food hygiene and safety, getting organic certifications is critical.

Trần Thị Bình, director of Thành Đạt Organic Agricultural Cooperative in Thái Nguyên Province, said that they want support to improve product quality and expand exports.

Đào Thanh Vân, Deputy President of Việt Nam Organic Agriculture Association, said Việt Nam has around 100,000ha of tea growing area but the tea export price at US$1.6 per kg is very low.

Phạm Văn Tiến from Cao Sơn Tea Cooperative said that the market remains the biggest difficulty to cooperatives producing organic teas. Another problem is the weak linkage between farmers and enterprises in establishing tea value chains, he said.

Meanwhile, climate change is significantly affecting tea cultivation.

Currently, Việt Nam ranks fifth in the world in terms of tea export but it is mainly exported in raw forms with a lack of originality, making it difficult to compete in the global market so the added value for tea growers and cooperatives remains modest.

According to David Lyons, director at Australian Tea Cultural Society, the focus should be on building brands for Vietnamese tea products to expand exports to strict markets like Australia.

Impressive brands are important to develop loyalty customers, he said, adding that attention should also be paid to packaging.

Thân Dy Ngữ from Hiệp Thành Limited Company said that cooperatives and farmers should connect with each other to increase output and ensure quality for domestic production and exports.

Statistics showed that Việt Nam exported 28,000 tonnes of tea in the first three months of this year, worth $45 million, an increase of 30 per cent and 27.2 per cent, respectively, over the same period last year.

In 2023, tea export was estimated at 121,000 tonnes, worth $211 million, dropping by 16.9 per cent in volume and 10.9 per cent in value over 2022, on falling consumption demand in the global market.

HCM City works to put Metro Line No. 1 into operation soon

Ho Chi Minh City's Metro Line No. 1 (Ben Thanh-Suoi Tien) is close to the finish line but is facing some difficulties, thus the local administration and the investor are making efforts to remove obstacles so that the it can start commercial operation soon.

According to HCM City's Management Authority for Urban Railways (MAUR), 98% of the workload on the project has been completed.

Training for the operation of the metro line and preparation for acceptance work are underway. However, there are problems between contractors and project consultants.

According to the project's investor, contractors and consultants for Metro Line No. 1 have not agreed on the early handover of equipment and infrastructure for training, acceptance, and trial operation, resulting in a possibility that the metro line could not start commercial operations by the end of this year as scheduled.

Earlier in March, the municipal People's Committees set up a task group to settle difficulties related to the project. To date, the task group has held three meetings on the issue.

Chairman of the municipal People's Committee Phan Van Mai also sent a letter to the Japanese Ambassador to Vietnam, in which he affirmed that the city will consider the Japanese side's proposal to resolve disputes through the Dispute Adjudication Board (DAB). The city also asked the Japanese side to pool all resources so that contractor Hitachi can complete the trial operation of bidding package CP3 in May and the handover of a number of carriages and equipment required for the NJPT Consortium, the general consultant of the project, to conduct practical training.

The investor, general consultant and contractor have coordinated with the Fire Prevention and Fighting Police Department to conduct fire prevention inspection and acceptance for each item and the entire project.

Regarding personnel training, training work at Ho Chi Minh City Urban Railways No. 1 Company Limited, which is responsible for operating and managing the metro line, will be finished by the end of third quarter.

The Ben Thanh-Suoi Tien metro line runs 19.7km between District 1's Ben Thanh Market and Thu Duc city's Long Thanh Depot with three underground stations and 11 elevated stations. Work on the metro project started in 2012 and has gone through various delays. Its costs have risen to over 43.7 trillion VND (1.71 billion USD)./.

Appropriate policies needed for harmonized interests between farmers, businesses

For the development of the government's large paddy field in the Mekong Delta, harmonized benefits between farmers and businesses are important; therefore, it needs appropriate policies and other factors.

The workshop on developing sustainable links in the rice value chain was jointly held by the Coordination Office for Agriculture and Rural Affairs in the Mekong Delta under the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, the School of Public Policy - Rural Development and the People's Committee in Can Tho City today in Can Tho City.

Deputy Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development Tran Thanh Nam, representatives from the Vietnam Rice Sector Association; businesses and organizations in the rice industry chain in the Mekong Delta.

According to the Vietnam Rice Industry Association, policies, scientific and technical advances, and capital directly and indirectly affect the purchase of rice in the Mekong Delta and the relationship between farmers, cooperatives, traders, enterprises, distributors and consumers also have an impact on the benefits of farmers and businesses.

Farmers' rice will be distributed through the distribution channel. Accordingly, traders will help sell 49 percent of total rice in the region, while cooperatives 32 percent, milling factories more than 12 percent and rice processing and export enterprises more than 6.5 percent. Meanwhile, the direct consumption channels of cooperatives include businesses accounting for nearly 61 percent, milling factories accounting for more than 22 percent and traders accounting for more than 16 percent.

At the workshop, engineer Vo Quoc Trung from the Agricultural Extension Center in Soc Trang Province talked about the results of the investigation on the role of traders in the rice consumption chain. Accordingly, no farmers have so far contacted businesses directly but brokers. Specifically, rice growers sell rice through consumption channels including agricultural cooperatives (accounting for 5-7 percent) and local brokers (90-93 percent). Agricultural cooperatives and intermediaries will directly work with businesses for export and domestic consumption. Farmers also sell their rice to drying or milling establishments but traders also help farmers connect with these establishments which sell rice for domestic buyers.

Traders act as a bridge, an indispensable link in the current consumption chain, said engineer Trung. Without traders, the province's 2.1 million tons of rice is hardly consumed quickly. Currently, the project of large fields is at risk of destruction as farmers take advantage of sowing seeds and have the mentality of selling early when rice prices are high.

Businesses need to consider maintaining contracts signed with farmers when rice prices increase or decrease, each party bears 50 percent in this part. It is necessary to harmonize the interests of farmers and businesses to develop large fields, said engineer Vo Quoc Trung.

Chairman Huynh Van Thon of the Board of Directors of Loc Troi Group agreed with engineer Vo Quoc Trung's opinion, especially in the context of implementing the project 'Sustainable development of 1 million hectares specializing in high-quality rice cultivation and low emissions associated with green growth in the Mekong Delta until 2030'

Vice Principal Tran Minh Hai of the School of Public Policy and Rural Development said that the present rice chain in the Mekong Delta has seen the participation of many intermediaries. Among them, traders or barn owners, are people who clearly understand the chain. Businesses prefer to buy rice through traders because it helps businesses feel less stressed about spending capital because they do not have to advance money to farmers for a long time (2-3 months) while farmers prefer to sell to traders because they can get money immediately after sell their agricultural products.

The government or responsible agencies should encourage traders to voluntarily gather into groups and clubs to exchange experiences and access training content and technical guidance in preservation, transportation, and processing with the aim of ensuring quality, food safety and hygiene, said Vice Principal Tran Minh Hai.

According to Director Le Duc Thinh of the Department of Cooperative Economics under the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, rice value chain links have improved, with more diverse models and more sustainable models. However, the scale of area, output, and number of farmer households participating in the association are still small. The scale of association of businesses and cooperatives is not as large as expected while not many cooperatives and businesses have linked. Worse, linkage between cooperatives and businesses is not sustainable resulting breach of contracts.

Carbon credit export from rice, coconut production

In 2023, Vietnam achieved its first sale of 10.3 million forest carbon credits (equivalent to 10.3 million tons of CO2), generating around US$51.5 million (VND1.25 trillion).

The development of the carbon market has spurred the growth of green and circular economies while providing substantial financial gains for the nation. The Mekong Delta region, notably, has been identified as having significant potential in this market.

With over 143,000 hectares of forest and forestry land, Ca Mau province possesses significant potential and advantages in the formation and development of the carbon market. Since 2020, the provincial authorities have organized meetings for residents, forest owners, and businesses to hear expert talks and receive advice on carbon market-related issues. According to experts, forest carbon credits stem from greenhouse gas emission reduction projects, reducing deforestation and forest degradation, promoting forest planting, care, protection, and development, and encouraging vegetation regeneration. Forest owners can convert the amount of CO2 absorbed from managed forest areas into carbon credits for trading on the market.

Mr. Le Van Su, Deputy Chairman of the People's Committee of Ca Mau Province, assessed that implementing forest carbon absorption and storage services would provide a significant and sustainable financial source for the locality each year. This funding will support effective forest management, planting, care, protection, and development, reducing pressure on the State-budget-funded investment into the forestry sector. However, the implementation of this activity faces challenges due to the lack of a legal framework and detailed technical guidelines on transfer, benefit sharing, and determining carbon credit prices. Therefore, he hopes that the central government will soon complete the legal framework regarding carbon credit counting, certification, and trading, enabling Ca Mau and other localities to effectively tap into the potential of the forestry economy.

In Kien Giang, the representative from the VnSAT Project Management Board in Kien Giang Province announced that in 2024, Kien Giang would participate with 60,000 hectares of rice cultivation in the Sustainable Development of One Million Hectares of High Quality and Low-Emission Rice Associated with Green Growth in the Mekong River Delta by 2030. Accordingly, they plan to sell carbon credits for approximately 30,000 hectares. By 2025, the province aims to expand the area of high-quality, low-emission rice cultivation to 100,000 hectares, with an estimated sale of carbon credits for around 40,000 hectares.

Analyzing the benefits of carbon exploitation in rice production, Mr. Huynh Van Thon, Chairman of Loc Troi Group, highlighted that rice production currently contributes to approximately 50 percent of greenhouse gas emissions. Vietnam is actively addressing this issue to achieve zero net emissions, as committed. Furthermore, Vietnam is establishing a sustainable rice production ecosystem with internationally recognized farming practices. Specifically, the government has initiated the Sustainable Development of One Million Hectares of High Quality and Low-Emission Rice Associated with Green Growth in the Mekong River Delta by 2030. While the processes and direction are already established, the remaining challenge lies in how managers can effectively organize and mobilize farmers to align with these objectives. By accomplishing this, the utilization of carbon credits in rice production will yield significant future benefits.

According to the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development of Ben Tre Province, there are approximately 78,000 hectares of coconut trees in the province. This presents a favorable opportunity for selling carbon credits derived from these ""coconut fields."" In July 2024, Ben Tre will host a workshop focusing on the establishment and development of the carbon market for coconut trees. While the carbon credit market holds great potential, Vietnamese enterprises encounter various obstacles and financial challenges in entering this market. Therefore, Vietnam needs to strategize and implement solutions to overcome these barriers effectively.

As per the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, to exploit and sell carbon credits from rice production, the rice production region in the Sustainable Development Project for 1 million hectares of high-quality rice cultivation in the Mekong Delta must ensure specific production conditions. These conditions entail reducing rice seed usage to 80kg per hectare, cutting chemical fertilizer application by 30 percent, minimizing chemical plant protection products by 40 percent, and decreasing irrigation water consumption by over 30 percent. Furthermore, the adoption rate of Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) and equivalent practices must reach 100 percent, while the incorporation of advanced technology and digital solutions should exceed 50 percent. Greenhouse gas emissions should be curtailed by over 20 percent, and the collection and utilization of rice straw, covering 100 percent of harvested areas, is imperative.

Banks strengthen information security systems

Banks have implemented many new technology solutions to ensure information security in the context that digital transformation in the banking industry has been promoted strongly.

Phan Việt Linh, director of CDNetworks Vietnam, said the speed of digital transformation in the finance and banking sector in Việt Nam is growing quickly and strongly. At the same time, banks often face attacks from high-tech criminals to steal customer data to conduct property appropriation fraud. Therefore, banks must strengthen defence measures to ensure safety and security in their systems.

Nguyễn Văn Minh, deputy general director of KienlongBank, said KienlongBank has always focused and invested in information security. As a pioneer bank in digital transformation, KienlongBank has deployed technology solutions and modern application systems to handle huge amounts of customer information and transactions. Investment in technology and security systems is a top priority for KienlongBank.

To strengthen solutions ensuring information security and safety, Minh said KienlongBank has proactively strengthened network security systems and built strict information security processes. In the first three months of 2024, KienlongBank has coordinated with experienced partners in the field of security and cybersecurity, such as Viettel Cyber Security, VNPT Information Technology Company, FPT Telecommunications Joint Stock Company, Ernst & Young Vietnam Co., Ltd., and SafeGate Smart Network Security Joint Stock Company, organise system penetration testing to proactively ensure information security.

According to Orient Commercial Joint Stock Bank (OCB), as fraud in the banking and finance sector is on the rise, OCB also continuously implements internal and systematic evaluation and review methods to detect and absolutely prevent customer information being stolen.

Trần Quang Hưng, deputy director of the Ministry of Information and Communications' Information Security Department said information security in the banking system plays an important role. With a large amount of bank and customer data, the security of customer information in particular and banking data in general is mandatory for all credit institutions. Therefore, banks need to be equipped with modern technology and constantly strengthen their capacity as well as invest in security.

The State Bank of Vietnam has also issued many regulations to request credit institutions to implement measures to ensure security and safety in operations, including Directive 02/CT-NHNN on promoting digital transformation and ensuring information security and safety in banking activities.

Central beach city to lure investment from potential partners

The central city's People's Committee has officially issued an investment promotion programme for 2024 aiming to diversify partners and investment flows for new development.

The city said the programme will focus on calling potential domestic investors in hi-tech industries, semiconductor, information technology as well as giant technology companies from the the Europe Union, the US, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, India, and Taiwan (China).

It said the central hub will welcome all investors with planning for investment expansion or fund flow moves in the region.

Đà Nẵng has mapped out its Master Plan in 2021-30 with a vision to 2050, opening smooth options for domestic and foreign partners in line with the city's strategic development plan for the next decades.

In boosting promotion events with partners, the city will seek collaboration with organisations including - the Việt Nam Chamber of Commerce and Industry (VCCI), Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO), the Korean Chamber of Business in Việt Nam (KOCHAM), the American Chamber of Commerce in Việt Nam (AMCHAM), Indian Business Chamber in Việt Nam (Incham); the European Chamber of Commerce in Việt Nam (EuroCham) and the German Chamber of Commerce Abroad in Việt Nam (AHK) - in hosting investment studies and market access research as well as business links.

The investment promotion programme will also include support and positive solutions in clearing barriers in investment procedure for investors.

It also emphasised the importance of building investment links and friendship ties with the US, Australia, the EU, Finland, the UK and Denmark, speeding up possible key investment projects in Đà Nẵng.

The central city signed Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) for comprehensive and sustainable development in the Master Plan 2021-30, vision 2050, at Meet Đà Nẵng 2024.

Đà Nẵng's Semiconductor and AI Centre (DSAC) was also debuted early this year, setting up a foundation for investment flow of semiconductor industry from the US, Taiwan (China), Japan and the EU.

The beach city has been in discussions with TheCityUK, the industry-led body representing UK-based financial and related professional services, in building an international financial centre (IFC).

The National Assembly of Việt Nam has agreed on the pilot project developing Đà Nẵng Free Trade Zone.

To date, the city has attracted 1,016 FDI projects worth US$4.2 billion.

Forecasts upbeat for banks' 2024 profits

Vietnam's banking sector is projecting a period of robust growth and profitability, underpinned by strong first-quarter performances and optimistic forecasts for economic recovery and credit expansion.

At SHB's 2024 AGM last week, CEO Ngo Thu Ha unveiled a pre-tax profit target of approximately $470.25 million, a 22.2 per cent increase over the previous year's performance. Despite global economic uncertainties, Ha is confident in achieving these goals, citing an already robust profit of over $166.67 million by March.

Elsewhere, Nguyen Hoang Linh, CEO of MSB, reported significant growth at the close of the first quarter, with total assets reaching about $11.67 billion, marking over a 4 per cent increase.

""MSB saw a credit growth of over 5 per cent in a slowing sector, with customer loans and deposits growing by 4.7 and 4.1 per cent respectively. MSB's pre-tax profit stood at more than $63.75 million, fulfilling 22.5 per cent of its yearly target,"" Linh shared.

At TPBank, CEO Nguyen Hung announced a 2024 pre-tax profit goal of roughly $312.5 million, a 34 per cent on-year increase. With first-quarter profit of approximately $76.21 million and projected earnings surpassing $104.17 million by April's end, TPBank's targets are within reach.

VIB also showed a strong performance, with a first-quarter pre-tax profit exceeding $104.17 million; SeABank's first-quarter results saw consolidated pre-tax profit of $62.75 million, a nearly 41 per cent increase from the previous year; and VPBank recorded nearly $174.58 million in consolidated pre-tax profit in the period, a 66 per cent increase over the prior quarter and 64 per cent on-year.

LPBank stood out with a first-quarter pre-tax profit of $120.25 million, completing 27.5 per cent of its annual goal and achieving an 84.4 per cent increase on-year. An LPBank executive cited a fourfold increase in net service income from the same period in 2023, alongside strong net interest earnings and efficient cost management as key growth drivers.

These performances highlight a departure from the cautious outlook depicted in earlier surveys by the State Bank of Vietnam, with many banks now pushing aggressively to boost service income to compensate for slower credit growth. For example, TPBank's securities investments and MSB's foreign exchange operations have contributed significantly to their profits.

While some banks like BAC A BANK showed modest growth and others like PGBank experienced declines, the overall trend suggests a positive shift in the banking sector's performance.

Tran Thi Khanh Hien, head of Research at MB Securities (MBS), reported significant early-year advances within the Vietnamese banking sector, leading to notably higher industry valuations.

""Currently, the sector's price-to-book ratio stands at 1.66, marking a 6.7 per cent increase over the annual average, albeit remaining 8.7 per cent below the three-year average,"" she told VIR.

Dr. Can Van Luc, chief economist at BIDV Training School, provided an optimistic forecast, anticipating stronger profits based on the modest growth foundations set in 2023.

""Performance will vary among institutions, with differentiation driven by factors such as financial capacity, approved credit growth plans, asset quality, and fee-based income,"" he said. ""Notably, smaller banks may struggle to accelerate growth and could face deceleration due to competitive challenges in attracting low-interest deposits.""

""Next year's economic recovery is poised to spur credit growth rates to between 14-15 per cent, eclipsing those seen in 2023, thereby bolstering income from core credit services as well as ancillary financial offerings such as payment solutions, digital banking, and foreign exchange activities,"" Luc added.

Despite these positive indicators, Luc cautioned that several challenges could temper growth prospects, including rising risk provisioning in response to bad debts, and potential declines or persistently low values of secured assets. He also pointed out that major revenue streams from previous stages, such as bancassurance and off-balance sheet debt collection, might not quickly rebound.

""Additionally, operational costs are expected to rise owing to investments in technology and increasing salary expenses driven by government guidelines and the need to remain competitive in talent acquisition,"" Luc stated.

Hien of MBS emphasised that certain banks are likely to outperform the industry average. She argued that banks that can maintain a resilient net interest margin, even amid interest rate cuts aimed at fostering competitive credit growth, would likely fare well. These banks typically benefit from a low cost of funds and strong CASA ratios.

""Banks with a stable and expanding credit portfolio, anchored by a loyal customer base, and those that have significantly enhanced their asset quality with substantial provisioning in 2023 are likely to experience reduced provisioning pressures in 2024. This will notably enhance their after-tax profits relative to the broader industry,"" Hien said.

Financial barriers still remain for true industrial symbiosis

Despite having great potential for implementing industrial innovation, Vietnam lacks financial incentives for businesses in executing industrial symbiosis model and preventing them from taping into a circular community.

According to Lien Nguyen, a freelance consultant in renewable energy, the government should have clear and stable policies to support university and research institution engagement with renewable energy ventures.

""Policies for promotion of the recycling industry remain insufficient,"" Nguyen said at a conference on advancing the circular economy in Vietnam's industrial parks (IPs), held in mid-April in Ho Chi Minh City by the Ministry of Planning and Investment and the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO).

""In addition to that, the procedures for reuse and recycling of waste, particularly waste being sent outside companies, as well as market for exchangeable secondary materials and by-products, are all in a shortage,"" Nguyen said.

Industrial symbiosis is a must for an eco-IPs and an integrated part of the circular business model. A subset of industrial ecology, it describes how a network of diverse organisations can foster eco-innovation and long-term culture change, create and share mutually profitability, and improve business and technical processes.

According to Nguyen, the model requires the collaboration of government, universities, research institutions, and industries in upscaling the circular economy.

""Businesses should be guided to use material flow analysis tools in developing strategies to foster the circular economy, including industrial symbiosis,"" Nguyen said.

Vietnam has great potential in this area as it has around 420 IPs throughout the country. It also boasts diverse types of industries in selected IPs and a fast growth of disruptive technologies.

According to Christian Susan, manager of UNIDO's Global Eco-IP Programme, industrial symbiosis is a form that helps companies gain a competitive advantage through sharing services with other companies or with surrounding areas. ""They can also cooperate to exchange specific products, energy, water, and by-products with other companies or regions, thereby promoting comprehensive and sustainable development,"" said Susan.

""IPs with a large concentration of businesses become ideal platforms for promoting business synergy approaches. Symbiotic relationships between businesses help reduce the resource demand and can sustain resource use over longer periods of time and for multiple purposes, thereby promoting circularity,"" Susan added.

Pham Hong Diep, chairman of the board of Shinec, the investor of Nam Cau Kien IP located in thê northern port city of Haiphong, said that industrial symbiosis chains in the IP are implemented with a circular economic model, including metallurgy, mechanical engineering, plastic products, and electrical and electronic accessories. ""Within this year we will move towards zero waste through applying this model,"" Diep told VIR.

In the past, steel slag at the IP had to be processed, and the manufacturer had to pay over $200 million per tonne, but now it can save this fee instead. The purchaser will process steel slag at high temperatures and separate it into other materials to sell to factories that use it to produce magnets and additives for cement production.

Steel scrap is also produced into auxiliary products and components for the electrical industry, including assembling electronic components and equipment for the automobile industry and cable companies.

""Such an example shows that waste becomes a resource through symbiotic waste resources of businesses, and the output is secondary finished products. This also helps create a larger market for recycled raw materials and materials with reliability and high-quality standards,"" Diep said.

With this closed process and circular production, discarded items that previously had no value are now important raw materials, increasing revenues for businesses.

""Thanks to this benefit, Nam Cau Kien IP has occupancy of more than 80 per cent, even though the land rental price here is higher than other parks,"" Diep said.

Rooftop solar power puts IPs on the map

Transferring to renewable energy through installing rooftop solar power systems is set to help foster competitive capacity and further the sustainable development of businesses.

The growth rate of the rooftop solar market in Vietnam is considered one of the fastest-growing segments in terms of new installed capacity in the next 10 years.

With that, the Vietnamese government is promulgating policies to encourage the installation of rooftop solar power systems in industrial parks (IPs). After a meeting on the issue on April 10, Deputy Prime Minister Tran Hong Ha assigned the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MoIT) to coordinate with the Ministry of Justice and relevant agencies to develop a decree stipulating policies to encourage rooftop solar development, to be installed in homes, offices, and IPs.

The MoIT is also assigned to coordinate with relevant ministries and sectors as well as Vietnam Electricity to develop a set of model documents that specifically stipulate standards, technical regulations, and state management requirements in encouraging the development of rooftop solar power. The mechanism is expected to be implemented in the spirit of transparency and openness.

Apple supplier Foxconn is on the journey to install a rooftop solar power system for its factories with a total capacity of 32MWp, accounting for 20 per cent of Foxconn's current factory roof area in Vietnam. From June 2023, it has successfully operated 19MWp of rooftop solar capacity for its factories in the northern province of Bac Giang.

Several global manufacturing giants such as Samsung and LG are following Foxconn's path and plan to announce specific energy transition plans in Vietnam. Additionally, other outsourcing manufacturers for Adidas, Nike, and other apparel and footwear brands have also recently actively switched to rooftop solar.

Chung Dieu Tuan, CEO of foreign-invested enterprise CME Solar, said, ""The main market driver is the increased demand for rooftop solar installations in the manufacturing sectors of foreign-invested enterprises in Vietnam, especially the electronics/ semiconductor and textile industries. As part of the global effort to commit to net-zero emissions, international brands and manufacturers in Vietnam must meet the energy transition requirement to renewable sources.""

CME currently boasts rooftop solar power systems for a series of domestic and foreign-invested groups, such as Hwaseung Vina, an Adidas research and development centre, CJ Vietnam, Puratos Grand-Place Vietnam, Nam Dinh Vu Industrial Park, and Song Hong Garment JSC, among others.

These moves are expected to help realise the target that by 2050, 80 per cent of factories will install rooftop solar power systems, and the ratio for houses and office buildings is 20 per cent.

A Savills 2022 report stated that the total industrial and commercial roof area is about 80,000 hectares and the estimated annual growth rate is 10 per cent, while the total roof area used for the production of solar energy accounts for only 8 per cent.

Statistics from the Vietnam Energy Partnership Group show that as of June 2023, the total installed capacity of solar farms and rooftop solar power is estimated at 8GW, much higher than the 1GW witnessed at the end of 2020.

The market demand for low-emission products is both a pressure and a driving force pushing IPs and tenants to change and shift towards a circular economy, towards sustainable development. Thus, currently, businesses in various industries are in dire need of incentives and procedures to develop rooftop solar power.

Truong Van Cam, vice president of the Vietnam Textile and Apparel Association, said, ""Installing rooftop solar power is in line with the state's policy of reducing energy from fossil fuels, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and implementing the net-zero commitment by 2050. In addition, it also meets requirements in many other garment and textile markets, which require products with a green origin and using renewable energy.""

The textile and garment industry has around 1,200 businesses with over 600,000 workers located in IPs. Currently, about 30-50 per cent of businesses depending on the region have installed rooftop solar power, Cam said.

""Besides the problem of disposing of solar panels, there is also the problem of waste treatment and how to recycle it so as not to be a burden on the environment. Thus, there will soon need to be specific regulations on purchasing and using rooftop electricity in IPs and economic zones,"" he added.

According to Deputy Minister of Planning and Investment Nguyen Thi Bich Ngoc at a forum on promoting the sustainable development of IPs in mid-April, the transition towards green energy is a key factor in increasing competitiveness and ensuring sustainable development for each IP, locality, and the overall economy.

In Vietnam's 16 free trade agreements and negotiation of several others, requirements on clean and green production stages are critical so that businesses can participate in demanding markets. Additionally, the goal of sustainable industrial development has been included in the United Nations' sustainable development commitments.

Retail sales, services revenue up 8.5% in four months

Retail sales and services revenue in the first four months of this year totaled 2.06 quadrillion VND (81.06 billion VND), up 8.5% year-on-year, the General Statistics Office (GSO) said.

In April alone, the value was 522.1 trillion VND, a rise of 9% from the same period last year, with food and foodstuff sales up 10.3%, household utensils 12.9%, garment 12.7%, lodging and catering services 19.1%, and tourism 57.6%.

In the four months, retail sales reached some 1.59 quadrillion VND, up 7.1% year-on-year (up 4.4% if the price factor is excluded).

Sales of food and foodstuffs rose by 11.8%, household appliances 14.9%, garment 10.3%, vehicles (except cars) 0.1%, and cultural and educational products 17.8%. Revenue from accommodation and catering services was estimated at 237.3 trillion VND, up 15.3% year-on-year.

The office said favourable visa policies and tourism stimulus programmes have proven effective, helping lure nearly 1.6 million international visitors in April, up 58.2% year-on-year, and 6.2 million in the four months, up 68.3%.

Tourism revenue in the period was 19.4 trillion VND, representing an increase of 49.3% from the corresponding time last year.

Meanwhile, revenue from other services stood at 211.1 trillion VND, a year-on-year rise of 9.4%.

To ensure the supply of essential goods and boost the domestic market in the remaining months, the GSO suggested the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MoIT) further review, amend and perfect legal documents regarding state management of the domestic market.

The MoIT should continue its coordination with other ministries, agencies and localities in monitoring market developments, and providing consultations in price management, it said.

In an effort to promote consumption demand, Minister of Finance Ho Duc Phoc, authorised by the Prime Minister, submitted a proposal to the National Assembly for extending the cut in value-added tax (VAT) from 10% to 8% on specific groups of goods and services from July 1 until the end of the year./.

PM sets major goals for banking sector in digital transformation

Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh has set three major digital transformation targets for the banking sector, including creating the most favourable conditions for people, businesses and agencies to access banking services.

At an event on digital transformation in the banking industry held by the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) in Hanoi on May 8, the PM said digital transformation should contribute to reducing time and compliance cost for people, businesses and agencies and the banking system itself, while helping control risks and prevent corruption.

The Government leader requested the banking sector to focus on strengthening the perfection of institutions and mechanisms, creating a full legal corridor for the development, expansion and diversification of modern banking services meeting international standards, and promoting the development of the digital banking ecosystem, meeting the growing requirements of the economy.

Alongside, it is necessary to boost electronic payment infrastructure, diversifying banking products and services, creating an important foundation for the development of the digital banking ecosystem and digital economy, while speeding up digital transformation to support banking inspection and supervision, thus enhancing publicity, transparency, and preventing corruption and money laundering.

At the same time, the PM also underlined the need to develop digital human resources in the banking industry, especially high-quality human resources to meet the development needs of the industry and international cooperation activities, along with the enhancement of security and safety in payment, protection of personal data and application of new security standards, ensuring fast, safe, convenient payment at reasonable cost.

PM Chinh emphasised that the banking sector should effectively implement tasks and solutions stated in the national digital transformation strategy, the strategy for banking sector's development, the digital transformation plan in the banking industry, and Directive 18 on strengthening data connections and sharing serving the development of e-commerce, preventing tax loss and ensuring monetary security.

According to the SBV, after three years of implementing the digital transformation plan for the banking sector until 2025 with a vision to 2030, the sector has reaped fruitful results.

To date, more than 87% of adults have payment accounts at banks and many banks have over 95% of transactions processed on digital channels. The average growth in the number of payment transactions via mobile devices and QR code from 2017 to 2023 reached over 100% per year.

Banking technology infrastructure has been upgraded and developed, ensuring continuous, smooth and safe operations. New digital technologies have also been strongly applied to develop new products and services, meeting the increasing needs of people and businesses. Vietnam has completed cross-border payment connections via QR codes with Thailand, Cambodia, and is connecting with Laos, and expectedly with countries inside and outside the ASEAN region, the SBV said.

The banking sector has closely coordinated with the Ministry of Public Security in crime prevention and control and in using residential data to serve customer information data cleaning, authenticating customers' identification, supporting lending activities.

To date, 58 credit institutions have been implementing applications to authenticate customers with chip-embedded ID cards via devices at the counter, and 14 credit institutions are piloting the use of the identification and authentication app (VNeID) in some of their services.

Positive results have also been seen in cashless payment activities. In the first 4 months of 2024, cashless payment transactions increased 56.57% in number and 31.35% in value, the SBV reported./.",vietnamnet.vn,news,VietNamNet News,,0.3333333333333333,452924975,17,https://static-images.vnncdn.net/vps_images_publish/000001/00000Q/2024/5/9/vietnam-business-news-may-92024-2bee1e414c4842cab6de6ca895ee235f-1032.jpg?width=0&s=yLED9ImHwNDnEXRwcLq2Lg,

The K-Lataus' charging network will grow by over a hundred DC charging points at vital commercial locations for Kesko and along the main roads.

The retailer opted for Kempower chargers capable of delivering 400 kW, depending on the vehicle. Kempower solutions support 800 volts, just like the rest of K-Lataus's network.

""As the total power of each new charging hub is at least 1600kW, we are able to guarantee fast charging even for large customer flows,"" says Iiro Määttänen from K-Auto, responsible for the K-Lataus charging network.

The latter will see an expansion at four existing charging hubs, each growing by 18 new DC charging points from the current setup.

For over a decade, he has poured his energy into the construction of the country's biggest onshore wind farm, Sopi-Tootsi, which he affectionately calls his ""little baby"". For Ulm, this project isn't just about generating electricity. He aims to foster a sustainable future for Estonia.

""When I started working on wind farms, they were seen as outdated relics of an old subsidy scheme, and it wasn't popular to develop them,"" he says. ""Now this is changing, and our project is the best example of that.""

The Sopi-Tootsi project started in 2012, when a peat mine shut down in Põhja-Pärnumaa, a municipality in southeast Estonia. Local officials and Eesti Energia saw this as an opportunity for change. They envisioned repurposing the area for renewable energy. With 38 turbines Sopi-Tootsi is set to be the most powerful wind farm in the Baltic region. Upon completion, the wind farm will be capable of powering over 197,000 households annually.

""The farm will provide green electricity to almost a tenth of Estonia's electricity consumers,"" Ulimi says.

The European Investment Bank is supporting Enefit Green with €180 million financing agreement signed in September 2023. That's just one of many investments in Estonia by the European Union's financing arm. Last year, we invested €540 million in Estonia, which is equal to almost 1.4% of the country's gross domestic product -- a higher proportion than in any other EU country.

According to a statement from Yuon, heating represents the largest portion of energy usage in EU households, making up 64.4 per cent of residential energy consumption in 2021.

As the push for sustainable heating solutions gains traction, driven by regulations aiming for net-zero emissions, there's an increasing emphasis on improving energy efficiency and optimisation to reduce CO2 emissions.

Yuon CEO and co-founder, Dr. Sebastian Hersberger, says, ""Over the last few years, there has been a lot of focus on optimising electricity networks, now is the time to optimise heating systems.""

""We aim to revolutionise heating control systems by providing software to operate district heating networks efficiently. This will not only have a direct impact on reducing CO2 emissions but also boost our transition to net-zero.""

Youn's software equips utility providers with tools to optimise their grid operations, resulting in improved performance, lower CO2 emissions, reduced costs, and informed decision-making.

Their advanced heating control system is predictive and designed specifically for optimising district heating networks. It creates a real-time, automated digital model of the grid and connected buildings to ensure efficient management of the heating system.

The company was established in 2020 by Lorin Mühlebach and Josef Jenni. In 2023, Dr. Sebastian Hersberger joined the founding team, expanding their expertise and capabilities.

Yuon will use the funds to speed up the adoption of its predictive heating control software. The software aims to enhance the efficiency of district heating networks.

The company says, ""Our primary focus for market development lies within Switzerland; however, we've already initiated preliminary steps toward expanding into Germany have already been initiated.""",siliconcanals.com,news,Silicon Canals,,0.4039215686274509,452848383,1,https://siliconcanals.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Image-credit-Yuon-Control-1024x536.jpg,eng-9548742

Outokumpu, the global leader in sustainable stainless steel, is partnering with Tetra Pak, a world leading food processing and packaging solutions company. Outokumpu Circle Green®, with up to 93% lower carbon footprint than the global industry average*, will be used in the production of Tetra Pak's homogenizers. The low-emission stainless steel will be available as an option for all models in Tetra Pak's homogenizer line in Europe from June 2024. This strategic collaboration marks the beginning of a partnership to explore other applications of Circle Green across the Tetra Pak equipment portfolio, helping to further align food and beverage manufacturers with the EU's Green Deal.

""The future of low-emission solutions is heavily dependent on sustainable stainless steel. The global demand for steel is increasing while the steel industry as a whole is responsible for 7-9% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Stainless steel plays a pivotal role in accelerating the green transition, and the food and beverage industry is a good example of where low-emission steel can have a significant impact. We are proud to partner up with Tetra Pak on this transformative initiative and look forward to delivering and developing more sustainable solutions that facilitate the decarbonization across the value chain. The cooperation with Tetra Pak is yet another concrete action towards a better future"", says Niklas Wass, Executive Vice President for Stainless Europe, at Outokumpu.

Circle Green is produced at Outokumpu's plant in Tornio, Finland, and then delivered to Tetra Pak's homogenizer body suppliers in Denmark and Sweden. After manufacturing, the bodies are then delivered to Lund, Sweden, where many of Tetra Pak's homogenizers are assembled. By using Circle Green, Tetra Pak is generating a more sustainable offer for the climate-cautious partners in its value chain, and the machines with low-emission bodies made of stainless steel can be delivered globally to customers.

Stainless steel as an essential material - ensuring durability and hygiene

Food systems are responsible for over one third of the global greenhouse gas emissions**. In this sector, everything from dairy beverages to table sauces relies on homogenization as part of its production process. For example, when processing milk, the homogenizer breaks down fat globules in milk into smaller fragments, resulting in a more stable solution - preventing creaming, and improving texture, flavor and shelf-life. Stainless steel used for homogenizers not only reduces emissions but also stands out as an essential material for the food processing industry because of its exceptional resistance to corrosion, its smooth surface, and its easy-to-clean nature, ensuring durability and hygiene - two indispensable qualities in food processing.

""Innovation sits at the heart of our philosophy as a business and our approach to sustainability. The incorporation of Circle Green into our product portfolio is an important step in leveraging the latest innovations to improve our upstream emission.Working together to help both Tetra Pak and our customers to reach our individual sustainability goals is fundamental to our promise to protect what's good"", says Fiona Liebehenz, Vice President of Key Components Plant Solutions and Channel Management, at Tetra Pak.

Circle Green production was the first of its kind globally, as no other stainless steel manufacturer has been able to produce stainless steel with such low emission levels when taking into account all the climate emissions from raw material extraction throughout the whole production chain. To produce Circle Green and to reach up to a 93% lower carbon footprint, Outokumpu uses 100% low-carbon electricity, low-carbon raw materials, such as recycled steel, and optimized production processes.

Producing all the world's stainless steel with the same methods used for Circle Green would cut global carbon emissions by 364 million tonnes per year. This equals to over 900 million one-way flights of one passenger across the Atlantic Ocean from London to New York.

*) Global average CO₂emissions (2023): 7 kg CO₂e per kg of stainless steel (Outokumpu's calculation based on data provided by CRU, worldstainless and Kobolde & Partners AB). Outokumpu Circle Green CO₂emissions: down to 0.5 kilos of CO₂e per kg of stainless steel.

This first-of-its-kind facility represents a significant leap in manufacturing, enabling continuous and sustainable production at scale.

Featuring the world's first continuous production line of up to 10,000 tons of MCC annually, the facility was designed to ensure quality and purity in MCC production. It also prioritizes environmental sustainability by producing zero solid waste and using only a fraction of the chemicals, water, and electricity compared to traditional MCC production processes. Furthermore, based on the findings of an independent third-party study, the process achieves a significant 72% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to traditional methods.

Microcrystalline cellulose and other cellulose derivatives are valuable ingredients utilized across diverse industries, enriching product properties and performance. Moreover, the use of cellulosic materials fosters environmental sustainability by replacing non-sustainable and potentially harmful substances in a range of applications such as bioplastics, concrete, paints, textiles, glues, and insulation.

As the purest and most versatile form of cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose has been used in a range of industries for decades - from pharmaceuticals and food supplements to food ingredients, cosmetics, and skincare. The global demand for MCC is high, and the market is projected to grow exponentially by 2030.

""The world was changed when crude oil was discovered, and now it is time to revolutionize the world with cellulose-based materials! Our goal is to bring ground-breaking solutions to the market that don't cause negative environmental impact. This factory is a big investment in the green transition, and we would like to invite all companies to join us in thinking about how can we ensure that the planet survives for the next generation. We can't do it alone, but our mass production facility for cellulosic products, like MCC, is a good start,"" says Olli Kähkönen, CEO and co-founder of Nordic Bioproducts Group.

Lappeenranta was chosen as the location due to its closeness to six existing pulp manufacturing plants, local supply, and short access to seaports, ensuring supply chain security. Additionally, all ingredients come from FSC-certified, traceable, sustainably managed forests. The factory has been built to meet modern standards, being people-centric and enforcing employee satisfaction.

The first production phase started in March 2024, and now, the factory is gearing up to its full production capacity of up to 10,000 tons of MCC produced annually. The factory is expected to create 40 million euros in revenue in the first full operating year, aiming to triple the revenue in the following three years. The new factory employs 20 people and intends to double that number in the near future.

Nordic Bioproducts Group already has ongoing partnerships globally, including collaborations with Asian corporations Marubeni and Thailand's PTT MCC. With the full production capacity now operational, the company is poised to welcome clients from various industries and countries.

""Our innovative product meets the future needs of the market and the most strict ExciPact certificate requirements. Already today we have ongoing cooperation with leading pharmaceutical, bioplastics, and nutraceutical companies and distributors. We welcome all to test and try our MCC and other derived cellulose products to see the full potential,"" concludes Kähkönen.

A spinoff from Aalto University, Nordic Bioproducts Group was founded in 2019 by Professor Olli Dahl and then Senior Commercial Officer Olli Kähkönen in cooperation with the Aalto University School of Chemical Engineering.

""Obviously when you look at the war in Ukraine, Russia has been all the time using their long-range precision-guided munitions against the capital, Kyiv, key population centers, electricity infrastructure, [and] grain storage ports,"" Jarmo Lindberg, former Finnish chief of defense and current parliamentarian, told Breaking Defense in an interview Monday, adding that the target list also logically includes Ukrainian military facilities.

Lindberg, who sits on Finland's foreign affairs committee, said that as he's retired from the Finnish armed forces, he can't speak for why it made the storage decision, but he said you ""don't have to be an operational planner -- like me -- [to] figure it out yourself. So, Russia is capable of doing that, then maybe you need to have some of your capabilities a bit further away from the Russian border.""

On Monday the Financial Times quoted Finland's deputy chief for armaments and logistics, Lt. Gen. Mikko Heiskanen, revealing the move to cache equipment in Norway and future plans to store more in Sweden and others further afield.

""We are planning that we would store equipment in other countries. It's a security of supply issue, dispersing the stocks. We have partially started it already. We plan to do it especially with Sweden and Norway, but also with further-away countries. It's equipment and ammunition and maybe spare parts,"" Heiskanen is quoted as saying.

Heiskanen's announcement came as Finland completed a test of its ability to execute a war economy, a sprawling effort that included the theoretical use of private firms cooperating with the government to reorient their work towards defense, should the time come.

Lindberg told Breaking Defense that groundwork had been laid for such an international storage arrangement with Norway as far back as the mid-2000s when the two signed an agreement regarding logistical cooperation. But, he said, there's an ""extremely important"" difference now: Finland is a fellow NATO member, meaning it's much simpler to make ""holistic operational plans.""

Or, as chief of Finnish defense policy Janne Kuusela put it, NATO membership allows the Nordic nations to just ""do what's wise.""

""We figured out some years ago already that [storing equipment abroad] would be wise to do, say in the north, in the Arctic region, High North -- Sweden, Norway, but we have lots of restrictions,"" he said in a talk at the US Embassy in Helsinki arranged by the Kaplan Public Service Foundation. (Breaking Defense accepted accommodation from KPSF.) Kuusela listed obstacles like domestic political considerations and questions about how classified information could be handled between the nations.

""Now, all of that is lifted. Now we can actually do what's wise,"" he said. ""So now we have much more strategic depth, now, in our cooperation and we can kind of plan things Nordic-wide, in a unified way.""

Having backups in other nations is fitting for Finland, which prizes preparation for potential conflict over all else in its defense policy -- a lesson learned from centuries of warfare, much of it with its larger Russian neighbor. And though Finnish officials made clear the nation would always be prepared to fight on its own, Helsinki is beginning to take advantage of new opportunities that come with NATO membership.

""The Nordic countries, we have a long tradition of Nordic cooperation with especially Sweden and Norway, but now when we are all NATO, the focus is totally new,"" Kuusela said. ""Now we can focus, on how can we as a pack fortify NATO defensive areas in northeastern Europe, and how can we act seamlessly?""",breakingdefense.sites.breakingmedia.com,news,Breaking Defense,Lee Ferran,0.1372549019607843,452776380,21,https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/finland_soldier-scaled-1024x576.jpg,eng-9549008

SRV and University Properties of Finland Ltd have signed a project management contract for the new Research Hub building to be constructed in the Hervanta campus area of the University of Tampere, at the current Sähkötalo, and for the renovation projects of the linked parts of the building. The total value of the contract for SRV is approximately EUR 47 million. The order will be recognised in SRV's order backlog in May.

The Research Hub is a university building with demanding laboratory facilities, and the main user will be the University of Tampere. The new building will be located between the existing buildings of Sähkötalo, and old parts of Sähkötalo will be demolished from under the new building. The new building will centralise the university's experimental research environments, creating functional and spatial synergies as well as building services benefits, and supporting the multidisciplinarity potential between different actors.

""We have been working on the project in close cooperation with both the university and other project stakeholders for quite some time. The project will enable a functional entity that supports the university's research activities and provides a new operating environment for users of the facilities to benefit from. The Sähkötalo Research Hub is one of the most demanding projects we have implemented. We trust SRV as the project contractor and are confident that they have the ambition to implement the project so that the end result meets our objectives,"" comments Sanna Sianoja, CEO of University Properties of Finland Ltd.

Demanding laboratory facilities and building services

The new building will include several laboratories and ancillary facilities, so the amount of building services work in the contract will be large and the implementation challenging. Construction will also be challenged by the location in the tightly-built campus area, where some of the spaces will be in use during the renovation.

""The basic renovation of Sähkötalo and the Research Hub require multidisciplinary expertise in technically demanding spaces. We bring to the project a wealth of experience from several projects in hospitals and laboratories, as well as from office and laboratory facilities implemented for the Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority of Finland. In this project management contract, we also get to utilize our experience in cooperative project management projects, as several qualitative and functional goals have been set for the project. The project focuses on open information flow and interaction between different parties at all levels of the project. The facilities will be of high quality and adaptable to support the university's current and future cutting-edge research,"" says SRV's Regional Director Tero Karislahti.

SRV implemented business premises for the Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority (STUK) that were completed in Jokiniemi, Vantaa in 2020. In addition to office space suitable for complex specialist tasks, the project included exceptionally demanding laboratory facilities related to radiation safety, which placed high demands on the construction.

The work will be completed in stages between 2025-2027

The size of the new building will be approximately 8,800 gross square metres and the renovated part approximately 6,900 gross square metres. In addition, around 12,000 gross square metres of the old property will be demolished. The project will start with basic renovation work in summer 2024, and this phase will last about a year. Construction work in the new section will start in autumn 2024, and the Research Hub will be completed in summer 2026. The final building demolitions and yard work will be completed in spring 2027.

The demolition phase will be carried out in accordance with the Green Deal. In the name of resource efficiency, 70% of construction and demolition waste will be recovered as something other than energy or fuel.

The new building and the basic renovation will focus on the energy efficiency and energy recovery of the property. Part of the building's electricity and lighting needs will be met by a 20-kilowatt peak photovoltaic system on the roof of the new section. In addition, provision will be made for the connection of a 140-kilowatt peak photovoltaic system. BREEAM environmental certification with a target rating of Excellent will be sought for the new building, and Very Good for the basic renovation section.

Tung (童子賢) to extend the life of two nuclear power plants to cut the cost of electricity.

Tung has been known as a DPP supporter, serving as vice chair of the New Frontier Foundation headed by President-elect Lai Ching-te (賴清德). The DPP leader reportedly considered appointing Tung as premier, though former party leader Cho Jung-tai (卓榮泰) was designated to head the Cabinet starting May 20.

In a recent interview, Tung said Taiwan's second and third nuclear plants should continue to operate, and the site of the fourth plant, which was never used, should be converted to a pressurized water reactor modeled on the OL3 nuclear plant in Finland. The business leader's suggestions went against the official DPP policy to turn Taiwan into a nuclear-free homeland next year.

Commenting on Tung's ideas, lawmakers from the ruling party rejected the theory that Tung was trying to pave the way for a U-turn by the government on nuclear policies. DPP legislators said the country's nuclear policy could not be decided by one person, per Radio Taiwan International (RTI).

They emphasized the importance of reaching a social consensus on nuclear safety and finding a safe way to dispose of nuclear waste.

Tung defended his ideas by saying that if nuclear power supplied 30% to 32% of energy, it could cut the cost of electricity by 30% and help the government achieve its carbon-free target in 2050, per CNA.

The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) has been campaigning for legal amendments allowing nuclear power plants to continue functioning beyond 2025, while environmental activists have protested against the proposals.

This could potentially reduce heating costs to a significant extent, the ministry says.

A ground source heat pump or geothermal heat pump is a heating/cooling system for buildings which transfers heat to or from the ground, taking advantage of the relative constancy of temperatures of the earth through the seasons.

The arrangement can be both vertical ie. drilling deep down, or lateral, where the pump is installed at a shallower depth.

One fly in the ointment in Estonia is that drilling is very expensive here, more so than in neighboring Finland, as the subsoil and earth's crust in Estonia is of a different complexity.

Installing a ground source heat pump can cost tens of thousands of euros up front as a result, meaning support measures would likely be required in the case of most households and cooperatives, though at present no new such measure has been reported.

Head of the mineral resources department at the Ministry of Climate Ene Jürjens said that while initial tests are still underway, more comprehensive research could take three to four years or more.

Alvar Soesoo, adjunct professor at Tallinn University of Technology (TalTech), meanwhile said: ""We are currently in a learning phase, and I believe that in ten years, it will definitely be used more extensively in Estonia, yet we wouldn't need a geology like Iceland's.""

""If we had a crust similar to that in Iceland, we could also generate electricity. In Estonia, however, we certainly cannot produce electricity, but we can reduce our heating and cooling costs, two- to three-fold,"" Soesoo went on.

Using geothermal heat for heating homes is not a new concept in Estonia, but it is still relatively uncommon, Soesoo added

He said: ""There are no very clear statistics, but we are talking about borehole-based usage. Over 2,500 installations have been installed, while groundwater is used at another 100-150 sites.""

Soesoo's educated guess was that there are around 10,000 such installations in Estonia, with a population of around 1.3 million, which use horizontally installed underground pipes (see image), though this would not be comparable to the situation with neighbors to the north.

For example, in Sweden, population 10.5 million, 650,000 households use ground heat pumps, while for Finland, population 5.6 million, the figure is 200,000.

In short, the issue is not that the ground is ""too cold,"" Soesoo said, though a lack of knowledge is also something which needs addressing.

Ene Jürjens at the Ministry of Climate said the state has begun researching vertical ground source heat pumps, which are drilled deep into the earth.

""We have even completed the first pilot project, a solution for an apartment building in Tiskre (just outside Tallinn - ed.) where we bored a 505-meter-deep hole, put in place a U-tube and some sensors, and now we are testing it out within the building's heating system,"" she outlined.

Ultimately the goal remains as one of determining, for example, to what depth it would be rational to drill, and how to use geothermal heat most effectively in Estonia.

""Using geothermal energy for energy production in this way is considered over twice as efficient as using air source heat pumps. It can save over half - up to 60 percent - on heating costs,"" Jürjens reiterated.

The method does not require burning anything to heat buildings, at least for as long as there is electricity available.

""In my view - and I am speaking as a geologist - this system is the most environmentally friendly solution available,"" Jürjens went on.

Other issues may include regional variations inside Estonia, and considerations over permission to drill below certain levels, for instance due to groundwater concerns.

The thermal properties of the ground near the surface is usually divided into three layers, the surface layer (down to around a meter, most susceptible to changes in weather and sunlight), the shallow layer (anything from 8 to 20 meters in depth and which behind the surface temperature, so that the peak temperature comes about six months after the surface peak temperature) and the deep layer, where temperatures are more constant and where geothermal energy plays a role.""",news.err.ee,news,ERR,Joakim Klementi,0.1058823529411765,452759706,13,https://s.err.ee/photo/crop/2024/05/07/2382393he386t24.jpg,

Our standard of living in the West is as high as it is because we worked out how to use oil and gas as a feedstock for so many things, some essential, some perhaps less so. It's the range of products from pharmaceuticals to smart phones that has given oil and gas such importance, not just fuels.

Yet, here we are nearly 175 years after the first major oil discoveries in the USA and 2,600 years since it was first found in China, trying our best to wipe this massive and once highly revered industry off the face of the earth as fast as we can.

So why so ungrateful? It's simple, it's the awful impact that the burning of oil and gas and its emissions has had on climate change and the real danger that holds for all of us. We're scared and rightfully so.

Not all the fault of oil and gas of course. The burning of coal kicked off the process but oil and gas have been the chief culprit - particularly in the West - since the middle of the 20th century.

By the way, coal is still an issue with our ""friends"" in China. The Global Energy Monitor in the USA and the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air in Finland found China is building six times more new coal plants than other countries and one of their excuses for doing this is the damage climate change has done to Chinese hydropower capacity. Words fail really.

But the fact remains that the need to transition from oil and gas to other forms of energy is indisputable and we have to get used to that idea.

However, that the oil and gas industry has potentially a major role to play in that transition is also indisputable.

What surprises me though is that very few oil and gas operators seem to have realised that yet or if they have, not yet developed a strategy for it.

What surprises me even more is that some who have made at least a partial move into sectors such as wind are openly talking about reeling back on their involvement due to shareholder concerns. In short, they're not making as much money out of renewables as they do with oil and gas.

So I'm afraid they are once again putting shareholders first and the planet second. This is not clever politics and very short-termism. The impact on a workforce that's been underpinning the industry for decades will be catastrophic.

I dread to think what the job market in north-east Scotland is going to be like in 20 years time.

With the electrify everything lobbyists and political parties such as the Greens objecting to the use of hydrogen because - in part - they say they don't like the fact that currently the main source of hydrogen is reformed natural gas produced by those nasty oil and gas companies, the industry is already up against it.

In my humble opinion, it is also incredibly cynical of the oil and gas industry to promote the use of offshore wind to ""decarbonise"" their production.

Frankly, nobody with an IQ greater than 1 could see that as anything other than ""greenwashing"". Now if they said it would enable them to carry on global production of oil and gas as a feedstock for all the ""stuff"" I mentioned above, but we're going to stop burning it, the proposal would have some credibility - but that's not what's happening.

So whilst we should be thankful to the oil and gas industry for all that it has brought us, we shouldn't be nervous about ensuring that it understands it could be doing more to achieve the so-called just transition, and indeed its shareholders should be thinking like that as well if they want the industry to still be around in 50 to 100 years time.

Currently though, they're having rings run around them by a whole host of new and more agile players ranging from electric and hydrogen car builders to wind turbine, solar panel manufacturers and others.

Some oil and gas companies are tinkering around the edges of these new technologies but it's the electricity supply companies who are driving the use of technologies such as heat pumps, albeit for them it's a great way of selling more electricity.

I can't help but think that with very few exceptions, the oil and gas upstream sector has lost its ability to genuinely innovate not just technologically but in its thinking.

The supply chain though is showing signs of having seen the light. I was - for example - mightily impressed by Baker Hughes' recent decision to buy a large stake in the Estonian fuel cell and electrolyser company Elcogen. Hydrasun has invested in hydrogen fuel cells.

The ""OGA Plan"" is to be based on the revised North Sea Transition Authority strategy that ""places an obligation on the oil and gas industry to assist the Secretary of State in meeting the net zero carbon by 2050 target.""

So far that seems to mean a focus on reducing emissions from UKCS production facilities.

I'd prefer they adopt the Danish Energy Authority plan which has just issued its largest offshore wind tender for up to 10 GW of new capacity and is making plans to use some of that for green H2 and e-fuels.

That is the oil and gas industry's real future. I'm just not sure they realise it yet but time may not be on their side.

Shell is now producing bio-LNG in Germany but it's not enough. Others are already eating their lunch. Let's show our gratitude for what the industry has done for us by urging them on and occasionally planting a boot where it hurts.",energyvoice.com,news,Energy Voice,Amy Smith,-0.07450980392156858,452757849,5,https://www.energyvoice.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/04/shutterstock_1010722066-1eokw7ddn.jpg,eng-9536087

January-March 2024

The information presented in this business review concerns the development of Componenta Group in January-March 2024 and in the corresponding period in 2023, unless otherwise stated.

This is not an interim report in accordance with IAS 34. The company complies with the semiannual reporting in accordance with the Finnish Securities Markets Act and discloses business reviews for the first three and first nine months of the year, which present key information regarding the company's financial position and development.

The financial information presented in this business review have not been audited.

Componenta's guidance for 2024

Componenta expects the Group's net sales and EBITDA to improve from the previous year. The Group's net sales in 2023 were EUR 101.8 million, and its EBITDA was EUR 5.3 million. It is expected that the emphasis of the improvement in annualized net sales and EBITDA will be clearly taking place on the second half of the year.

The development of customers' sales volumes, poor availability of raw materials, increases in the prices of raw materials and electricity, and the general economic and labour situation and competitive climate may affect business outlooks. In addition, the development of sales and profitability involves uncertainties because of geopolitical situation. An unfavourable development of the geopolitical situation may also have a negative impact on the financial market, sales volumes, the availability and price development of raw materials and electricity, and the availability of foreign labour, all of which increase forecasting uncertainty.

Sami Sivuranta, President and CEO:

""In the first quarter of the year, volume and order book growth were well below expectations as a result of continued low demand. High interest rates and the development of inflation in the market environment have affected the demand for main customers' end products, which also had a negative impact on Componenta's volumes and order book in the first quarter. Net sales were also affected by the lower level of price indices as a result of lower costs, which is why net sales and EBITDA decreased from 2023. In addition to the low utilisation rate, the volume products that were ramped up for serial production in the Karkkila and Pori foundries had a negative impact on production efficiency and quality levels, which contributed to weaker profitability. Profitability was also burdened by the impact of the strikes earlier in the year. However, liquidity remained at a good level during the first quarter.

We have adjusted our operations to meet the temporarily lower volume and order book levels. However, we expect volumes in the second half of the year to be better than in the first half. The ongoing ramp-up of serial products will have a positive impact on the result as deliveries return to their normal level.

We were able to maintain good service capability across the Group despite the challenging operating environment. The general availability of raw materials and other materials is currently at a good level. We are actively monitoring market developments and ensuring that our own supply chains continue to work effectively. There are currently no signs of significant near-term risks to the availability of electricity. However, there is still significant variation in electricity prices on a daily basis.

While there are differences in order books between customers and sectors, the outlook for 2024 as a whole remains generally positive. With the start of serial production of new volume product lines from the second quarter onwards, and thanks to Componenta's growing market shares, we expect our total production volumes to develop favourably during 2024.

We have updated our strategy for 2024-2026. In this strategy period, we will continue to seek growth in net sales and profitability through systematically implemented measures. By the end of the strategy period, we aim to achieve annual net sales of EUR 150 million through organic growth and EUR 200 million in total, including M&A, and to improve our profitability from the current level. Sustainability has become a focus area in the strategy, emphasised in internal measures and customers' expectations and requirements. We are currently preparing for regulatory changes that will be implemented in the near future, as well as preparing our long-term sustainability targets and the related measures. As a contract manufacturer, we will continue to actively pursue measures to strengthen market position, and we are working to be the preferred sustainable total supplier to our customers, with a wide offering.""

Financial development during the review period

Sales volumes decreased in the first quarter of 2024. Componenta Group's net sales decreased by 23.3% during the review period and were EUR 23.6 million (EUR 30.7 million). EBITDA was EUR -0.2 million (EUR 2.8 million) and operating profit EUR -1.5 million (EUR 1.4 million). Lower sales volumes in the review period caused about half of the decline in EBITDA compared to last year. The temporary efficiency and quality, which was improved from last year, but still momentarily weaker than normal, caused by the ramped-up volume products of new serial production, as well as the strikes at the beginning of the year and the index development of electricity and main raw materials caused the second half of the EBITDA to weaken.

The result after financial items was EUR -2.3 million (EUR 0.9 million). Due to the working capital loan of 4 million euros in total withdrawn in December 2022 and March 2023 and the revolving credit facility in use during the review period, financing costs were EUR -0.1 million higher than during the comparison period. Market interest rates remained at a high level during the review period.

At the end of the review period, the Group's cash and cash equivalents totalled EUR 4.3 million (EUR 9.7 million). The Group's liquidity remained at a good level throughout the whole review period. Componenta had unused binding revolving credit facilities of EUR 3.0 million (EUR 4.0 million) at the end of the review period. In addition, Componenta had a share subscription facility with the unused portion of USD 7.5 million. Componenta paid off the EUR 1.0 million portion of the revolving credit facility that was in use at the end of the review period in April 2024, after which the amount of unused binding credit facilities were again EUR 4.0 million. In addition, Componenta agreed and withdrew a new working capital loan of EUR 2.0 million after the end of the review period.

Cash flow from operating activities during the review period was EUR -0.8 million (EUR 0.7 million). The change in cash flow is mainly due to weaker EBITDA than in the comparison period. At the end of the review period, working capital (incl. inventories and accounts receivables less trade payable) was EUR 7.5 million (EUR 6.2 million). The change was mainly due to the fact that decreasing volumes and the timing of material deliveries caused trade payables to be lower than in the end of the comparison period.

Componenta's equity ratio at the end of the review period was 42.8% (40.2%). The increase in the equity ratio was mainly due to the lower amount of non-interest-bearing liabilities and the positive result for 2023. At the end of the review period, interest-bearing net debt was EUR 10.5 million (EUR 5.4 million) and net gearing was 41.9% (21.7%). Change in interest-bearing net debt and in net gearing was due to lower cash position than in the comparison period.

Long-term interest-bearing debt totalled EUR 11.7 million (EUR 11.7 million) and short-term interest-bearing debt totalled EUR 3.1 million (EUR 3.4 million) at the end of the review period. In total interest-bearing debt included EUR 4.2 million (EUR 5.0 million) loans from external financial institutions. Other interest-bearing debt of the Group consisted mainly of working capital items and lease and hire purchase liabilities.

Risks and business-related uncertainties

The most significant risks related to Componenta's business operations are risks associated with the operating environment (competitive situation, prices, commodities and the environment), risks related to business operations (customers, suppliers, productivity, production processes, labour market disruptions, contracts, product liability, personnel and information security) and financing risks (availability, liquidity, currency, interest rate and credit).

The availability of certain raw materials such as recycled steel, pig iron, structural steel, aluminium and energy at competitive prices, as well as the uninterrupted supply of energy, is essential for the Group's business operations. The average market prices of electricity remained at a fairly high level during the review period, and daily and hourly price fluctuations were very high. Because of the geopolitical situation, the availability of raw materials and other materials continues to involve uncertainties in Componenta's operational activities. In addition, global challenges with the availability of certain components for customers may lead to production disruptions in our end customers' plants and thereby affect Componenta's sales volumes in the short term.

To ensure the availability of raw materials and other materials, Componenta actively engages in discussions with its suppliers, continuously updates its needs forecast and optimises its inventory levels to meet longer-term demand, closely monitors the situation of its suppliers and market changes, and responds to these changes as necessary.

According to Componenta's estimate, the Group has no significant and immediate risk concentrations related to Russia or Ukraine among its customers or suppliers of goods. Componenta has no operations of its own in Russia or Ukraine. The Russian attack has had an impact on the general price development and availability of raw materials such as structural steel and pig iron, and on the development of energy prices. The war has had an indirect impact on the supply chains of Componenta's manufacturers of steel materials and wholesalers through the price development and availability of iron ore and coal, for example.

A prolonged war and unfavourable developments in the geopolitical situation may continue to have a negative impact on the financial market, sales volumes, the availability and price development of raw materials and energy, and the availability of foreign labour, which increases forecasting uncertainty.

The cost risk associated with raw materials is mainly managed through index-based price agreements, based on which the sales prices of products are updated in response to changes in the prices of raw materials for the next quarter. An increase in raw material prices may employ more working capital than expected. In terms of commercial risks, future volumes may be weakened by customers switching to cheaper alternatives due to price competition.

Componenta's business operations depend on the reliability of production plants, supply and delivery chains and the related processes and systems. Componenta also closely monitors the labour market situation. The quality, accuracy and availability of information are extremely important, as information technology plays a significant role in the operations of Componenta and its suppliers and customers. If materialised, IT and cybersecurity risks may expose Componenta to disruptions and interruptions in operations and the loss or distortion of data, which may lead to interruptions in product availability. Componenta pays close attention to cybersecurity risks and monitors its customers' situations and notifications.

Componenta continuously monitors the liquidity risk. The Group also finances its operations through factoring arrangements for receivables. Componenta's current committed credit facilities will need to be renewed in September 2025. Any termination or non-renewal of factoring arrangements or credit facilities could create uncertainties for Componenta's liquidity. The Group's liquidity was at a good level at the end of the review period. At the end of the review period, Componenta also had EUR 3.0 million in unused committed credit facilities and a USD 7.5 million unused portion of its USD 8.0 million share subscription facility from GCF, an investor based in the United States. The share subscription facility is valid until June 2024. Componenta paid off the EUR 1.0 million portion of the revolving credit facility that was in use at the end of the review period in April 2024. In addition, Componenta agreed and withdrew a new working capital loan of EUR 2.0 million. Componenta's revolving credit facilities and working capital loans include the following financial covenant conditions: interest-bearing net debt / rolling 12-month EBITDA are a maximum of 3.0 and the equity ratio is at least 25%. In accordance with the agreed terms, the covenants are reviewed every six months. Unfavorable EBITDA development during a rolling 12-month period may cause the covenants to be breached.

Resolutions of Annual General Meeting and decisions of the Board of Directors

Componenta Corporation's Annual General Meeting was held 10 April 2024, in Vantaa. The AGM adopted the company's financial statements and consolidated financial statements and discharged the members of the Board of Directors and the President and CEO from liability for the financial period of 1 Jan-31 Dec, 2023. In accordance with the proposal by the Board of Directors, the AGM decided that no dividends will be distributed on the basis of the balance sheet established for the financial year that ended on 31 December 2023.

The AGM decided the number of members of the Board of Directors to be five (5). The AGM re-elected the current members of the Board of Directors Tomas Hedenborg, Anne Koutonen, Harri Suutari and Petteri Walldén. In addition, The AGM elected Lars Wrebo as a new member of the Board of Directors. In accordance with the proposal by the Shareholders' Nomination Board, the AGM resolved that the annual remuneration payable to the Chairman of the Board shall be EUR 50,000 and the annual remuneration payable to other members of the Board of Directors shall be EUR 30,000. Members of possible committees of the Board of Directors will be paid an annual remuneration of EUR 5,000. In addition, a meeting specific fee of EUR 1,000 will be paid to a Board member who lives outside Finland and travels to Finland for a meeting.

The Board of Directors elected Harri Suutari as Chairman of the Board and Anne Koutonen as Vice-Chairman at the organizational meeting held after the AGM. The AGM elected the audit firm PricewaterhouseCoopers Oy as the Auditor with Ylva Eriksson, APA as the responsible auditor. The AGM selected BDO Oy as the Sustainability Reporting Assurer with APA, Authorised Sustainability Auditor Laura Castrén as the principal sustainability reporting assurer.

The AGM authorised the Board of Directors to decide on share issues in one or several tranches as follows: The issuance of shares may be carried out by offering new shares or transferring treasury shares held by the company. The total number of shares to be issued or transferred under the authorisation may not exceed 961 563 shares, which corresponds to approximately 9.9 per cent of all the shares in the company. The new shares may be issued and the treasury shares held by the company may be transferred for consideration or without consideration.

The Board of Directors decides on all terms and conditions for the issue of new shares and the transfer of the company's own shares. Based on the authorisation, the Board of Directors may decide on a share issue in deviation of the pre-emptive subscription right of the shareholders (directed issue) subject to conditions mentioned in the Finnish Limited Liability Companies Act. The authorisation also includes the right to decide on issuing new shares to the company itself without consideration. For example, the Board of Directors may use the authorisation as compensation in acquisitions, to develop capital structure, to broaden the ownership base, to acquire assets related to the company's business or to finance or carry out other business transactions, or for other purposes decided by the Board of Directors. However, the authorisation may not be used for the implementation of incentive programs of the company's management or key personnel.

The authorisation is valid until the end of the next Annual General Meeting, but no longer than until 30 June 2025 at the latest. For the sake of clarity, the authorisation does not revoke the authorisation granted to the Board of Directors at the Annual General Meeting on 13 April 2023 to decide on the issue of shares and special rights entitling to shares for incentive schemes, under which a maximum of 400 000 shares may be issued. However, this authorisation revokes other previous non-utilised authorisations to decide on share issuance.

The AGM decided to amend the Articles of Association by adding a new Article 8 on the Sustainability Reporting Assurer to the Articles of Association. As a result of the amendment, the numbering of the current Articles 8, 9 and 10 of the Articles of Association will be changed accordingly to Articles 9, 10 and 11. The AGM decided, that the future Article 11 of the Articles of Association concerning the matters to be handled at the Annual General Meeting be supplemented by adding a new sub-item 10 on the election of the Sustainability Reporting Assurer and by adding to sub-item 6 a mention of the fee and the reimbursement criteria for travel expenses of the auditor and the sustainability assurer.

The minutes of the General Meeting are available in full at the Componenta's website.

These endeavours aim to assist the underprivileged and guide them out of poverty towards economic empowerment. But as implementation begins, it is crucial to address key aspects like budget allocation, beneficiary identification, efficient disbursement and broader impact.

When President Joko 'Jokowi' Widodo came to power in 2014, Indonesia witnessed transformative social protection initiatives. This included providing targeted cash assistance to low-income households, offering grants and scholarships for students from underprivileged families and covering health insurance premiums for 97 million individuals. The second term of Jokowi's cabinet in 2019 ushered in the Kartu Prakerja Program, to enhance workforce competence and foster entrepreneurship.

Indonesia has steadfastly committed to social protection, allocating an average of 16 per cent of the state budget from 2013-23. In 2024, with a total state budget of US$216 billion, approximately 15 per cent has been earmarked for social protection programs. This sustained investment has contributed to remarkable progress in poverty alleviation, with the extreme poverty rate decreasing from 7.3 per cent in 2013 to 1.5 per cent by 2023. Indonesia's ambitious target of eradicating extreme poverty by 2024 reflects its dedication to fostering inclusive growth.

The largest portion of the budget allocated to social protection is directed towards energy subsidies -- totalling US$12 billion -- equivalent to 38 per cent of the allocated social protection budget. These subsidies encompass essential needs such as fuel, cooking gas and electricity. The remaining funding is allocated to other programs, including non-energy subsidies, national health insurance, food assistance and conditional cash transfers.

Indonesia has made significant strides in advancing its social protection disbursement, through integrating the social welfare database with the national identification database, targeting the bottom 40 per cent of the population to identify and reach those in need. The country has also embraced the digital transformation in its social protection disbursement, transitioning from cash to savings accounts and from in-kind to e-vouchers, improving efficiency and transparency.

Incoming Indonesian leaders are set to launch the free lunch program, providing complimentary meals to school students, children under five years of age and pregnant women. The primary goal is to address stunting by providing nutritious meals and to ease the financial burden on low-income households by covering meal costs. The program also aims to stimulate economic opportunities by supporting small-scale farmers and local food producers to improve food security. The expansion in the food sector is expected to create more job opportunities, contributing to overall economic development.

To provide meals for 82.9 million school children at full scale, this program will necessitate 6.7 million tons of rice, 1.2 million tons of chicken, 500 thousand tons of beef, 1 million tons of fish, various vegetables, fruits and 4 million kilolitres of fresh milk. Sustaining this initiative could require up to US$28.5 billion annually. To kick-start operations in its inaugural year, initial funding of up to US$7.6 billion -- equivalent to 3.5 per cent of the state budget in 2024 -- is required.

Free school lunch programs have been implemented in 76 countries, benefitting 418 million children worldwide by providing essential meals. The impact extends beyond sustenance, acting as a catalyst for positive change. It stimulates agricultural production, bolstering local economies and creating millions of jobs, especially for women in roles such as cooking and catering. These programs also enhance education outcomes, evidenced by increased student enrolment, improved attendance rates and enhanced student retention.

Finland led the charge in 1943 by introducing free school meals. Central to its success is the collaborative spirit and trust shared among authorities, municipalities and schools. Financed through taxes, the responsibility of meal provision rests with local communities. With a sophisticated kitchen management system, Finland ensures compliance with nutritional and financial standards. Students are empowered to provide feedback on the meals served, ensuring continuous improvement and responsiveness to their needs.

Lessons from other nations, especially developing countries, show that limited resources, infrastructure and competing priorities hinder program success and sustainability. Corruption and mismanagement also impede progress, exacerbating the situation. Geographical barriers -- like remote locations -- create logistical challenges in accessing food provisions, while diverse cultural nuances and dietary preferences require careful consideration in program design. Inadequate public awareness and advocacy worsen these challenges -- highlighting the need for comprehensive strategies.

Indonesia may not face a substantial obstacle in initiating the program's budget, given that discussions concerning budget allocation have already started in Jakarta. But effective disbursement will necessitate integrated strategies and collaboration among various stakeholders. Drawing from the experiences of other countries and tailoring approaches to Indonesia's context could enhance the design and implementation of this initiative.

As Indonesia embarks on the next phase of its social protection journey, it is crucial to recognise the transformative potential of these programs beyond poverty alleviation. The time has come to view social protection as a contributor to economic growth, not just a safety net for the vulnerable. The next cabinet has a historic opportunity to redefine the role of social protection in Indonesia's development agenda.",lowyinstitute.org,news,Lowy Institute for International Policy,,0.2549019607843137,452743586,5,https://www.lowyinstitute.org/sites/default/files/2022-08/Lowy_DefaultImage_new.jpg,

Progress in digital banking has helped to keep costs under control. It has led to increased customer drift from conventional banks to Shariah-compliant institutions, particularly among the younger generation. Retail banking remains a cornerstone of most IFIs, but many are strengthening their commercial banking products.

Despite rising interest rates over the past few years, which has in the past been challenging for Islamic banks, most IFIs were able to widen their margins in 2023 through better repricing of financing assets. The Islamic banking sector enjoyed better return on assets in 2023, rising to 1.8% from 1.6% in 2022.

Islamic banks' balance sheets advanced by around 8% last year, slightly below the prior year's growth, but remaining higher than conventional banks' asset growth. The overall health of Islamic banks remains very good, with an average capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 19% and nonperforming loan ratio around 3%.

The winners of Global Finance's 2024 World's Best Islamic Financial Institution Awards are banks that have excelled in product innovation, range and service quality; recorded good financial results, with sound balance sheets and have good governance. Award winners continue to innovate in delivery and access, strengthening their franchise and market position.

Global Finance's World's Best Islamic Financial Institution for 2024 is Kuwait Finance House. KFH is the second-largest Islamic bank globally, active in the Middle East, Asia and Europe. Last year was KFH's first full year of integration following its 2022 acquisition of Ahli United Bank. In 2023, KFH launched Tam Digital Bank, Kuwait's first Shariah-compliant digital bank. AbdulWahab Al-Roshood, acting CEO at KFH, says,

""Expanding our customer base and market share in the retail banking sector, KFH is moving forward with its digital transformation strategy, launching innovative digital financial solutions.""

Our winner for the Middle East is Al Rajhi Bank, the largest Islamic bank globally. Al Rajhi Bank has posted consistently strong performance, supported by leading-edge technology and a strong brand. Loan growth was very good in 2023. Abdullah bin Sulaiman Al Rajhi, chairman of the bank's board of directors, says, ""The bank continued its selective growth across businesses to achieve its strategic goals while maintaining its lead in customer experience and best-in-class digital solutions.""

Malaysia's Maybank Islamic Bank wins the award for the best IFI in Asia. With a strong capital base and good returns, Maybank is frequently a first mover in bringing innovative Shariah-compliant financial products to the market. In its home market of Malaysia, it controls one-third of Islamic assets, but its activities extend across other Asian countries.

Kuwait Finance House (KFH) earned its recognition as Best Islamic Financial Institution worldwide thanks to innovation in Islamic financing, a wide geographical footprint and strong operations. KFH is the second-largest Islamic bank globally, providing services to customers in the Middle East, Asia and Europe through extensive distribution channels. It has subsidiaries in Kuwait, Turkey, Egypt, Bahrain, Iraq, Malaysia, the UK and Germany.

Last year was KFH's first full year of integration following its 2022 acquisition of Ahli United Bank of Bahrain. Total assets stood at $124 billion at end 2023 as net profit jumped to $2.2 billion from $1.4 billion, for a return on average assets of 1.8%. The firm's overall financial profile is solid, supported by good capitalization and liquidity. Its Islamic banking products and services cover commercial, retail and corporate banking as well as real estate, trade finance and investments.

During 2023, KFH launched Tam Digital Bank, Kuwait's first shariah-compliant digital bank. It was also at the forefront in launching several digital services, including detecting biometric facial features in branches, instant printing for all types of cards, its Zaheb digital platform and KFHonline for corporates, digital portfolios to facilitate e-payment and a D-POS device for instant opening of bank accounts.

KFH maintains a leading position in Islamic corporate banking. Last year, the group successfully led and arranged sukuk issuances exceeding $4 billion for a diversified issuer clientele, embracing sovereign and corporate offerings across multiple sectors and geographies. Highlights included a $3 billion club financing deal for Saudi Electricity Company and a syndicated transaction for Ras Laffan Petrochemicals Company totaling $4.4 billion. KFH also participated in a $1.6 billion syndicated transaction for Dubai Aerospace Enterprise Funding.

KFH Treasury chalked up $38 billion worth of foreign exchange transactions in 2023 and onboarded several new corporate clients; the bank is also active in FX spot and Islamic derivatives hedging instruments. The group treasury executed sukuk transactions worth more than $13 billion during the year.

Al Rajhi Bank is a pioneer in provision of Islamic retail banking services, offering significant expertise in shariah consumer banking. It takes the award for Best Islamic Retail Bank based on its strong retail performance and innovation and the size of its retail franchise.

Al Rajhi is the world's largest Islamic bank globally, with $216 billion in assets and equity of $28 billion. Along with its base in Saudi Arabia, it has operations in Jordan, Kuwait and Malaysia. It remains a profitable institution, with a 2.1% return on assets and 16.1% return on equity. It dominates the retail financing market in Saudi Arabia with a 41% share, handling over 800 million transactions and the largest share of remittances per month. Also rolled out in 2023 were new mobile applications, giving non-Al Rajhi Bank customers the ability to access its digital services as guests.

Boubyan Bank distinguishes itself for the breadth of its commitment to corporate social responsibility; rather than applying a set of CSR performance standards to one or two departments or branches, all parts of the bank are considered key participants.

Areas of focus in 2023 included significant staff training, human capital management, customer advocacy, client empowerment, and the safety and wellbeing of all stakeholders. Social initiatives include youth development, female-focused product development, and embedding of social KPIs in employee performance evaluations. The bank is active in humanitarian and charitable causes, including initiatives such as the Noor Boubyan Campaign, which has succeeded in restoring the eyesight of thousands in many African countries. Domestically, the bank runs a successful e-waste collection operation.

ADIB maintained its MSCI ESG (environmental, social and governance) rating of ""A"" in 2023, retained its position on the MSCI ESG Leaders index, and earned an upgrade to its Sustainalytics ESG risk score. As one of the world's leading Islamic financial institutions, it continued to play a crucial role in boosting sustainable finance in the Persian Gulf region, facilitating some $1.5 billion of sustainable projects in 2023.

Qatar's Dukhan Bank's Private Banking proposition emphasizes innovative customer-focused services supported by robust technology across an end-to-end portfolio of financing, banking and investment products and services for high-net-worth and ultrahigh-net-worth individuals. The bank's focus on enhanced digital transformation is targeted particularly at capturing a larger and younger generation of clients.

Wealth management assets grew by 17% last year and helped Dukhan increase its market share in the local market, where it is the third-largest bank. It launched online/mobile access modules for the wealth management last year and continued to enhance product sourcing capabilities.

Leading the league tables for both global sukuk and ASEAN local currency bonds, Malaysia's CIMB is also actively integrating sustainability practices into its business. The bank commands a nearly 13% market share in global sukuk and a 28% market share in ringgit sukuk. Last year, it successfully launched the largest US-dollar sukuk issue by an Asian sovereign. It also achieved the tightest five- and 10-year spreads at issuance by an ASEAN sovereign for the second year in a row.

CIMB also led the pack as the largest Malaysian ringgit sukuk arranger in 2023. Notable issues in which it played a role included a $2 billion global sukuk for the Republic of Indonesia that included a $1 billion green tranche; a $750 million sukuk issued by Khazanah Nasional that was over six times oversubscribed; and a RM1.5 billion state guaranteed sukuk for Johor Corporation, the first-ever state-guaranteed transaction in the Malaysian ringgit debt capital market.

Based in Bahrain, GFH Financial Group stands out for its product development and placement, registering a string of successful deals in 2023, including a placement for the Healian regional health-care platform. Funds include GCC Logistics and US Opportunistic, the latter focused on inflation-hedged commercial real estate, REITs and structured equity in the US.

GFH expanded its global presence significantly last year. Its acquisition of Big Sky Asset Management, a major player in US health-care real estate, exemplifies GFH's thematic focus on attractive and defensive markets. Big Sky marked the third international asset manager that GFH has acquired in recent years, after Roebuck Asset Management and SQ Asset Management, which capitalize on strong opportunities in European logistics and US student housing, respectively.

GFH also partnered last year with UK-based investment manager Equitix to invest in Aurora Infrastructure, which operates two major electricity networks in Finland. The investment was in line with several global new-energy-economy megatrends, including electrification, national grid infrastructure revitalization, and energy diversification. Complementing its Aurora Infrastructure stake, GFH co-invested in Saber Power, a profitable, high-growth supplier of electrical infrastructure services based in Houston.

A leading alternative Shariah-compliant asset manager, Saudi Arabia's Sidra Capital launched a series of new enterprises in 2023, including its maiden Singapore-domiciled variable capital company, Sidra Asian Opportunities. The VCC focuses on facilitating cross-border commodity supply chains via fully funded irrevocable letters of credit, specifically targeting high demand for solid fuel produced by select Indonesian producers.

At home, Sidra Capital specializes in creating innovative private-finance investment solutions; its portfolio includes a range of Shariah-compliant private finance investment products. Last year, it acquired the Eurocap industrial and trade park in northern France, a property adjacent to the Eurotunnel rail terminus and comprising 23 buildings on a 130-acre site, providing a wide range of property options for occupiers. Sidra also acquired London Square, an office building in Guildford, UK, for just over £40 million.

Malaysia's Maybank Islamic offers a ""halal ecosystem"" for small to midsize enterprises (SMEs), delivered through a digital, values-driven platform. It supports business growth via Islamic supply chain solutions that meet the needs of principal customers as well as their suppliers and buyers. The bank launched a Digital Supplier Financing Program in the fall to facilitate financing access for suppliers in the ecosystem and promote business growth abroad.

Maybank's SME financing, as a result, has grown solidly over the past few years. Income uplift has occurred through Halal4wards, a Shariah-compliant financial solution that bundles product solutions for SME and business banking customers within targeted halal sectors. The bank also recently introduced a bespoke term fund for nonretail clients.

Al Rajhi Capital has exploited its link with parent company Al Rajhi Bank to establish a dominant position by value and market share as a trader in Saudi Arabia's main stock market (Tadawul) as well as its alternative market (Nomu). In 2023, Tadawul chose it as the first market maker in the main stock market.

Al Rajhi REIT Fund made the largest secondary offering in Saudi Arabia last year, and its parent also plays a crucial role in issuance of sustainable Sukuk bonds. It offers a range of innovative investment solutions across all major asset classes including equities, real estate, money market, fixed income and multi-asset. The firm is also expanding its global outreach, which now encompasses 38 markets worldwide.

Maybank Islamic's trade finance business provides leading products for both SME and corporate trade finance clients. This includes both import- and export-focused products, from standard letters of credit to onshore foreign currency financing and export credit refinancing. The bank has achieved good expansion: Islamic financing grew 7% last year and trade financing volumes further expanded. Maybank Islamic has formulated its own Sustainable Product Framework to enable greater development of green, social and sustainable products; it is committed to mobilizing around $16 billion in sustainable finance by 2025, of which trade finance will be an important element.

A unit of Maybank Group, Etiqa Islamic Berhad offers a range of general and family Takaful plans across multiple distribution channels in Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines, Indonesia and Cambodia. It reports over 11 million customers, gross written premium assets of around $2 billion and total assets of $11 billion. Last year, Etiqa became the first insurance and Takaful company in Malaysia to become a signatory of the UN Principles for Sustainable Insurance.

Locally, KFH acts as lead arranger on many syndicated project finance transactions, but it continues to expand its trade relations with core corporate clients in all sectors and throughout the MENA region for both SMEs and large companies. Besides last year's club financing for Saudi Electricity Company, other major deals that KFH participated in included a $4 billion-plus syndicated offer for Ras Laffan Petrochemicals Company that will fund construction, development and operations of a petrochemicals project in Qatar and a $1.6 billion syndicated transaction for Dubai Aerospace Enterprise Funding.

With $73 billion in assets and a financing portfolio of $56 billion, Maybank Islamic is the largest Islamic bank in ASEAN and the fifth-biggest globally. With a strong capital base and good returns, it is frequently a first mover in bringing innovative Shariah-compliant financial products to the market. In its home market of Malaysia, it controls one-third of Islamic assets and 29% of the important Malaysian Islamic banking market. Its activities extend across other Asian countries; it ranks fourth in the global sukuk market, and its share of financing in Maybank Group's consolidated loan portfolio continues to rise.

A key player in Islamic banking, Al Rajhi Bank has posted consistently strong performance, supported by good management, a clear strategy and leading-edge technology. The largest Islamic bank worldwide by both assets and market capitalization and with a strong brand image, Al Rajhi ranks No. 1 in Saudi Arabia for remittances, transactions and customers. It also offers the largest distribution network in the Middle East, ranked by number of branches, POS, ATMs and remittance centers.

A subsidiary of Arab Banking Corporation, Bank ABC Islamic provides a wide portfolio of Shariah-compliant products and services, supported by good technology and the backing of its parent.

Jordan Islamic Bank, which already controls nearly half of the kingdom's Islamic banking market, boasts a growing 9% of Jordan's total banking sector assets. Loans and deposits grew last year, along with accounts, supported by a high capital adequacy ratio. Islami Digital, JIB's digital self-service offering, expanded in 2023, and the bank carried out further development and modernization in areas of banking technology. JIB continued to expand its menu of new services through its channels and platforms, including via mobile phone.

Focused on retail banking and technology, Boubyan Bank is increasing its market share against both conventional and Islamic banks in Kuwait, aided by its focus on creating innovative digital products and services for its customers. Widely regarded as an innovator with a strong brand and excellent customer service, it has established itself as a leader in catering to the under-30 bracket. That helped the $27 billion-in-assets institution to boost net profits by 44% to $254 million last year. It continues to look for new ways to tap its information resources; Boubyan's data group in 2023 augmented its ability to merge external and internal customer data through the App Store sentiment analysis dashboard, leveraging customer feedback from In-App, iOS Store, and Google Play Store.

Maybank Islamic is Malaysia's flagship Islamic institution, with a market share of 30% in assets and loans. Product innovation is strong, including its ""myImpact Card"" -- the first card in the market that enables a tangible, positive impact through responsible and ESG-friendly spending. It also incorporates a built-in Carbon Footprint tracker and provides the ability to offset carbon footprints. It also launched Malaysia's first EV financing solution. In nearly all Islamic financing areas, it holds a dominant market position.

Established in 2017, Umnia was Morocco's first Islamic bank. Shareholders include Qatar International Islamic Bank, CIH Bank (Credit Immobilier et Hotelier) and CDG (Caisse de depot et de gestion).

Payment apps were introduced last year, including Apple Pay.

The fastest-growing Islamic bank in Oman, Bank Nizwa's expansion in retail and corporate banking is supported by product innovation and its use of electronic channels. The bank recently launched a suite of Islamic green financing solutions for home, automotive and personal finance. Bank Nizwa also enhanced its retail platform by teaming up with Avanza Unison Ace and tapping its state-of-the-art digital platform. Net profit increased to $44 million in 2023 and total assets reached $4.1 billion, giving Bank Nizwa an approximately 25% share of the sultanate's Islamic banking sector.

With an asset base of $11 billion, Meezan is Pakistan's largest Islamic bank. Its range of products and services targeted at the retail sector and mid-tier and premium banking customers helped it to nearly double its net profit last year to $306 million.

Founded in 2009, Amana Bank was the first licensed commercial bank in Sri Lanka to conduct all its operations under the principles of Islamic banking. Today, while still a small player in the island's financial landscape, it is growing on the back of a full spectrum of retail, SME and corporate banking, and treasury and trade finance services.

A unit of Bahrain's Al Baraka Banking Group, Al Baraka Bank Tunisia offers a range of Islamic banking products and services in the North African country, including the Masken Al Baraka (a savings product for home financing), Sayarat Al Baraka (car financing), and Yasmine Pack (designed for Tunisians residing abroad).

The largest Islamic bank in Turkey with $24 billion in assets and $1.8 billion in equity, KTKB operates throughout the country, supported by a relatively large branch network. An office in Bahrain serves as a bridge between Turkey and the Gulf Cooperation Council states, supported by parent bank KFH. KTKB also operates an Islamic bank in Germany under the label KT Bank. Net profit rose by 37% in 2023 to $1.3 billion and return on average assets was a very high 5.2%.

ADIB's digital drive enabled it to grow market share by attracting over 200,000 new customers last year, helping boost total assets to $53 billion, and digital remains at the heart of the bank's 2025 strategy. The bank's contingent of digitally active customers increased steadily in 2023, and currently 80% are digitally active. Its mobile app is very well regarded, and 50 new features were added last year.

All of which helped ADIB post robust 2023 financial results. Net profit jumped 45% to $1.4 billion on the back of strong revenue growth, an increase in transaction volumes and improved margins, while return on equity reached a very high 27%.",gfmag.com,news,Global Finance Magazine,,0.7176470588235293,452724082,9,https://s44650.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/best-Islamic-banks-2024.jpg,

And, accordingly, Finland decided to occupy this niche,"" he added.Stefanovich argued that Finland was rushing to begin building work on the plant in order to secure a foothold in the market for the long term.Asked how NATO was likely to react to the Finnish initiative, the expert suggested that the North Atlantic alliance would welcome the decision -- even though the new factory would be within the reach of Russian missiles.TNT, one of the earliest-discovered and most stable high explosives, is used in artillery and mortar shells -- making it indispensable for the Kiev regime and its Western enablers amidst the ongoing Ukraine conflict.Currently, the EU's sole TNT plant is in Poland. That factory's production capacity is deemed inadequate to meet the demands of the Ukrainian armed forces and NATO's European member states.Finland signaled its readiness to produce the explosives just after just after its NATO membership bid was approved, the researcher noted, adding that the nation's leadership was trying to justify its usefulness for the military bloc. On the other hand, Helsinki is seeking to capitalize as much as possible on its new status, according to Stefanovich.Russia has already warned Finland that its accession to NATO and sabre-rattling are fraught with risk of a conflict between Moscow and the military bloc, especially given that Russia and Finland share a 1,300-km (800-mile) border. In the wake of Finland's accession, Russia began strengthening its military capacity in its west and northwest in order to ensure security of its borders.Russo-Finnish economic relations have also deteriorated dramatically. According to Helsingin Sanomat, Finnish companies lost over €4 billion after withdrawing from the Russian market between February 2022 and March 2023.The European Union's embargo on Russian energy exports also hurt the Nordic nation's businesses and industries. Without Russian supplies of electricity, oil and gas, Finland's energy system has become vulnerable.In January 2024 the Bank of Finland signaled that the Finnish economy was in recession, forecasting that the nation's gross domestic product (GDP) will continue to contract through 2024.

Input and engagement is instrumental in shaping the future of the project and ensuring that it aligns with local needs and aspirations, the company added.

WaveRoller technology harnesses the power of ocean waves to produce clean and renewable electricity, offering a promising solution to local energy needs while mitigating the environmental impact.

AW-Energy is a pioneer in the green economy and is the global leader in wave-energy technology. Its flagship product, WaveRoller, is a submerged wave energy converter based on a hinged panel that is attached to the sea bed in the near shore area. It generates electricity from the surge phenomenon in the movement of the waves, and is connected to an electric grid onshore.

The company is based in Finland and operates in multiple continents, cooperating with strong industrial partners. Kaoko Green Energy Solutions and AW-Energy enlisted the services of I.N.K Enviro Consultants to conduct a comprehensive assessment for the wave energy pilot project in November last year.

Strategically positioned between Swakopmund and Henties Bay, the pilot project deployed five WaveRoller-X devices to harness the power of ocean waves, generating approximately 200 megawatt hours (MWh) of clean and affordable energy annually, according to the companies.

This clean energy will directly benefit coastal communities in the Erongo Region, contributing to regional development and economic growth, they added.

Concurrently, alongside a social impact assessment, an environmental impact assessment is underway for a subdivision of a 20-hectare plot located within a kilometre of the shoreline, where the WaveRoller units will be installed. Kaoko Green Energy Solutions envisions wave energy as a prominent pillar of Namibia's renewable energy landscape, paving the way for the establishment of numerous green hydrogen production plants.

GOTHENBURG, Sweden, May 6, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- FlagshipTWO, Sweden's second large-scale production facility of green electrofuel (eMethanol), has received the environmental permit for its planned operations in Sundsvall, Sweden. The facility is developed by Liquid Wind and is one of the largest industrial investments to date in Sundsvall, expected to be ready for production in 2027.

The Land and Environmental Court in Östersund has granted an environmental permit for FlagshipTWO, Liquid Wind's second eFuel project, for the production of eMethanol. The facility, located at Sundsvall Energi's Korstaverket, has been granted approval to produce up to 130,000 tons of eMethanol annually by applying its innovative Carbon Capture and Utilization (CCU) technology. Liquid Wind aims for FlagshipTWO to become a leading player in the industrialization of CCU, both in Sweden and internationally.

Claes Fredriksson, CEO and founder of Liquid Wind, comments:

""We have reached yet another milestone on Liquid Wind's journey and ambition to reduce dependency on fossil fuel in hard-to-abate sectors, such as long-distance shipping. We are very pleased with this confirmation, which means that FlagshipTWO will become Europe's largest production facility of eFuels and further support the green transition.""

Anders Jonsson, CEO of Sundsvall Energi, adds:

""We congratulate Liquid Wind on the received environmental permit, and we will continue to investigate the possibility of establishing Sundsvall as a hub for the production of future fuels.""

FlagshipTWO and Liquid Wind's project pipeline of an additional 10 facilities by 2027 will be key contributors to the decarbonization of the maritime sector, and will help secure Swedish production to meet an accelerating demand for green fuels globally.

Established without much fanfare, according to HS, power giant Eaton's Vantaa factory manufactures what's known as uninterruptible power supply products (UPS) that can maintain power in the event of a failure.

The global cloud service market -- now also needed for an AI boom -- requires continuous electricity supply, and these devices are being assembled in Vantaa.

Already employing around 400 people, Eaton hired 50 workers in Finland this year and plans to hire as many more. Only five percent of Eaton's equipment stays in Finland, the rest is for export. Vantaa also serves as the headquarters for the company's backup power system business in Europe, where product development is carried out in collaboration with units located in the US and China.

Ilta-Sanomat warns of potential spot electricity price hikes this week as all three Olkiluoto reactors will probably undergo service at the same time.

This news follows last week's spot price jump triggered by low wind power, as well as two of Olkiluoto's reactors getting their annual maintenance.

The completion of Olkiluoto 3's first annual checkup is over a month behind schedule, IS writes.

Finnish Energy, the energy sector's trade association, has said consumers could expect significant daily and monthly electricity price fluctuations in the future.

Iltalehti reports on a significant increase in parking surveillance in Helsinki over the past two years, along with increased fines following a 2022 report highlighting inspector negligence.

Helsingin Sanomat was the first to report on consulting firm Valor's survey which revealed that parking inspectors in the capital region were largely neglecting their duties.

The report from spring 2022 observed that employees conducted inspections in places where parking is impossible, like the Kulosaari bridge and major road intersections. Certain locations received excessive supervision, while others were neglected. Breaks and non-work activities consumed significant portions of some inspectors' days.

Kaija Kossila, Helsinki's head of parking enforcement and services, told IL that the findings prompted immediate action from the city to address the issues and improve effectiveness.

Measures included reducing unnecessary meetings, improving work supervision, and tightening time management practices.

Since the report's publication, there has been a noticeable turnaround.

There were some 230,000 checks by Helsinki parking inspectors between January and March two years ago. This year, during the same period, there have been around 480,000.

The number of parking fines has also grown. Kossila told IL that the City of Helsinki issued over 24,000 more parking fines last year than in 2022, bringing the total up to nearly 160,000.",yle.fi,news,Yle.fi,,-0.02745098039215688,452672806,17,"https://images.cdn.yle.fi/image/upload/c_crop,x_0,y_250,w_4854,h_2730/w_1200,ar_1.91,c_fill/q_auto:eco,f_auto,fl_lossy/v1714974269/39-4998515b5812019e88a",

A vast subsea nuclear graveyard planned to hold Britain's burgeoning piles of radioactive waste is set to become the biggest, longest-lasting and most expensive infrastructure project ever undertaken in the UK.

The scheme has been delayed for so long that Britain now needs to excavate tunnels through 36 square kilometres of rock to create the massive underground caverns that will hold radioactive waste accumulated through seven decades of civil nuclear power.

The project is now predicted to take more than 150 years to complete with lifetime costs of £66bn in today's money, according to the latest estimates from scientists at Nuclear Waste Services (NWS), the government-owned company designing the project.

That price puts it at or close to the top of the table for giant UK infrastructure projects. It compares with £46bn for Hinkley Point C nuclear power station and about £60bn for the HS2 London-Birmingham rail line - the UK's two biggest construction projects to date.

Neil Hyatt, NWS's chief scientific advisor said: ""We've had 70 years of nuclear activities in the UK, mainly civil nuclear but also defence and industrial nuclear. That's generated a lot of waste - forecast to be 750,000 cubic metres by the time the store is built. So yes, it's going to be big.""

The Royal Albert Hall's volume is 100,000 cubic metres - so the waste alone will need space equivalent to at least eight Albert Halls.

The caverns will also have to be bigger than the waste - and the tunnels will be extra - so the UK will need to dig out maybe double that volume of rock.

The waste itself includes 110,000 tonnes of uranium, 6,000 tonnes of spent nuclear fuels and about 120 tonnes of plutonium - mostly stored at the Sellafield nuclear site in Cumbria.

The final tally will be bigger because those estimates exclude much of the waste that will be generated by the next generation of nuclear power stations now being planned by the Government.

The costs come without any decision on where the UK's Geological Disposal Facility (GDF) might be built but after five decades of ministerial prevarication, the sites have at least been whittled down to two.

One lies off the coast of Lincolnshire, near the renowned seaside resort of Mablethorpe. The other is off the coast of Cumbria around Copeland - another coastal tourist area.

In both spots the idea is to sink a massive shaft on land - up to 3,500 feet deep - and then dig horizontal tunnels several miles out under the sea.

There, huge vaults would be excavated in the impermeable clays and mudstones that scientists hope could provide a last resting place for Britain's nuclear legacy. Once filled with nuclear waste they would be backfilled with cement and then sealed forever.

The UK is having to go to such extreme measures partly because of the nature of radioactivity. Not only is it lethal but it lasts a long time. Plutonium for example, takes 24,000 years for its radioactivity to decline by just half, while Uranium-238 takes 4.5 billion years.

It means that, whatever is done with it, the UK's nuclear waste will remain deadly well after our civilisation has disappeared.

Hyatt suggests we need to protect it from future generations for about 300,000 years - as long as humans have actually existed.

He said: ""We're talking about a piece of infrastructure that's going to go with us on a journey into the future, for as far forward [in time] as homo sapiens has existed, because our species is itself about 300,000 years old.""

Hyatt points out that the sheer scale of the operation - locking away a huge volume of waste and making it secure for eons - was never going to be cheap. For most of this century successive ministers were claiming the GDF could be built for around £12bn.

Then, in 2017, just after Hinkley Point C had been commissioned, NWS were allowed to publish their revised estimates - with a new upper limit of £53bn.

Inflation since 2017 totals 26pc, suggesting a final cost of £66bn in today's money. That includes 150 years of operational costs, as well as construction.

British infrastructure projects are, however, scarily unpredictable beasts. The HS2 rail line to Manchester went from £37.5bn to more than £100bn before it was cut back last year.

Similarly, Hinkley Point C nuclear power station, also under construction, was costed at £9bn in 2007 and the latest £46bn figure is unlikely to be the last price hike.

Steve Thomas, emeritus professor of energy policy at Greenwich University, an expert in nuclear economics and policy, points out that we have built lots of rail lines and power stations - but never a giant nuclear waste site thousands of feet below the sea.

""The volume of the GDF would be equivalent to Wembley Stadium but we have to build it up to 1,000 metres below ground - that's a lot of rock to shift. These estimates are no more than a wild guess,"" he said.

Nuclear waste management has, however, been a recognised problem for decades.

In 1976 a review by the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution, now known as the Flowers Report, concluded that the UK was accumulating nuclear waste so fast that it should stop building reactors till it had a solution.

It said: ""There should be no commitment to a large programme of nuclear fission until a method exists to ensure the safe containment of long-lived highly radioactive waste for the indefinite future.""

Politicians ignored the recommendation, commissioning the Sizewell B power station in Suffolk soon after, but in 1982 they did set up Nirex, tasked to find a geological depository.

It spent 25 futile years without making any progress and in 2007 was merged into the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) where the job passed to the NDA's subsidiary, Nuclear Waste Services. It still remains at least 15 years away from starting work on a GDF.

Claire Corkhill, professor of radioactive waste management at Bristol University, who is also a member of the Government's advisory Committee on Radioactive Waste Management said that without a geological repository for its waste the nuclear industry could not call itself ""sustainable"".

She said: ""To be termed 'sustainable', any energy source must do no significant harm to the environment. We owe it to future generations to ensure that we have a solution for the radioactive waste generated from new nuclear power stations before we start producing it.""

She said the GDF would also represent good value for taxpayers because otherwise the waste would have to be maintained above ground for thousands of centuries - with incalculable costs and risks.

""It is imperative for the UK to find a site for the disposal of radioactive waste. Without a GDF, the completion of nuclear decommissioning operations at numerous sites in the UK, like Sellafield, will be delayed at a significant cost to the taxpayer.""

The nuclear industry shares the ambition, arguing that nuclear power generates relatively little waste compared to the electricity generated.

Tom Greatrex, Chief Executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, said: ""Nuclear produces a tiny amount of waste for the power it generates. After more than 65 years of nuclear power generation there is a dishwasher tablet worth of high-level waste for everyone in the UK.

""Geological disposal is the best strategy for the long-term, safe and secure disposal of higher-activity radioactive waste. Countries like Sweden and Finland, where GDFs are progressing, are seeing the benefits.""

For the communities asked to consider hosting a GDF, however, the perspective is different with protest groups springing up as the threat radicalises once-sleepy villages.

Guardians of the East Coast, based around Mablethorpe, has organised demonstrations on its beaches. In Cumbria, South Copeland Against GDF is organising petitions and more protests.

Nuclear Free Local Authorities recently wrote to nuclear minister Andrew Bowie warning that both sites were ""wholly unsuitable location for a Geological Disposal Facility"".

Richard Outram, the group's secretary said both areas relied on tourism that would disappear if they were turned into nuclear waste sites. Theddlethorpe alone saw 4.5m tourist visits in 2022.

""Mablethorpe is a traditional English seaside town with a beautiful beach, sand dunes and a nature reserve, surrounded by other historic villages.

She said: ""To be termed 'sustainable', any energy source must do no significant harm to the environment. We owe it to future generations to ensure that we have a solution for the radioactive waste generated from new nuclear power stations before we start producing it.""

She said the GDF would also represent good value for taxpayers because otherwise the waste would have to be maintained above ground for thousands of centuries - with incalculable costs and risks.

""It is imperative for the UK to find a site for the disposal of radioactive waste. Without a GDF, the completion of nuclear decommissioning operations at numerous sites in the UK, like Sellafield, will be delayed at a significant cost to the taxpayer.""

The nuclear industry shares the ambition, arguing that nuclear power generates relatively little waste compared to the electricity generated.

Tom Greatrex, Chief Executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, said: ""Nuclear produces a tiny amount of waste for the power it generates. After more than 65 years of nuclear power generation there is a dishwasher tablet worth of high-level waste for everyone in the UK.

""Geological disposal is the best strategy for the long-term, safe and secure disposal of higher-activity radioactive waste. Countries like Sweden and Finland, where GDFs are progressing, are seeing the benefits.""

For the communities asked to consider hosting a GDF, however, the perspective is different with protest groups springing up as the threat radicalises once-sleepy villages.

Guardians of the East Coast, based around Mablethorpe, has organised demonstrations on its beaches. In Cumbria, South Copeland Against GDF is organising petitions and more protests.

Nuclear Free Local Authorities recently wrote to nuclear minister Andrew Bowie warning that both sites were ""wholly unsuitable location for a Geological Disposal Facility"".

Richard Outram, the group's secretary said both areas relied on tourism that would disappear if they were turned into nuclear waste sites. Theddlethorpe alone saw 4.5m tourist visits in 2022.

""Mablethorpe is a traditional English seaside town with a beautiful beach, sand dunes and a nature reserve, surrounded by other historic villages.

""A nuclear waste dump would disrupt residents, damage the local environment and devastate tourism. Who will want to holiday on a 'nuclear waste coast'.""",uk.finance.yahoo.com,news,Yahoo!
