""Romgaz's 'BBB-' rating benefits from a one-notch uplift from its 'bb+' Standalone Credit Profile (SCP) for state support, as per our Government-Related Entities (GRE) Rating Criteria,"" Fitch Ratings said in a statement on Tuesday.

The gas producer's SCP rating reflects its dominant position on the Romanian natural gas market as well as its upstream production growth potential thanks to the Neptun Deep and Caragele reservoir developments. Romgaz also benefits from a conservative financial policy, Fitch Ratings said. However, a comparatively modest production scale, lack of geographic diversification due to its sole focus on Romania, the aging nature of its legacy gas assets, large capex and manageable execution risk represent the key risks affecting the company's rating.

Romgaz is planning a eurobond issuance worth 1.5 billion euro ($1.63 billion) in order to finance its Neptun Deep reservoir project, local news outlet ZF.ro reported last week.

In the first quarter of 2024, Romgaz boosted its net profit by an annual 94% to 1.245 billion lei ($271.4 million/250.3 million euro), it said in a financial report filed with the Bucharest Stock Exchange last week.

Romgaz shares changed hands 0.18% higher at 55.2 lei as at 1008 CET on Friday on the Bucharest bourse.

""KEY RATING DRIVERS

Large Capex Plans: Romgaz has ambitious plans to develop Neptun Deep, a deepwater offshore project in the Romanian Black Sea. Romgaz acquired a 50% stake in the project from Exxon Mobil for EUR1 billion in 2022 and is partners with OMV Petrom, Neptun Deep's operator. The development plan includes infrastructure of 10 wells and an offshore platform, with production expected to start in 2027, reaching a gross plateau production of approximately 8 billion cubic metres (bcm) annually. Romgaz and OMV Petrom will invest up to EUR4 billion in the project.

Transformational Project: We view Neptun Deep as a transformational project for Romgaz. It will allow Romgaz to increase natural gas production by half to around 150 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (kboe/d) from 83 kboe/d in 2023, halting a declining production trend from existing mature reservoirs. The project will also secure Romania's energy independence and position the country as the EU's largest natural gas producer from domestic resources. We view execution risk as manageable given the partner's experience in development of oil and gas projects.

Leverage to Temporarily Spike: Romgaz has historically operated with a net cash position, reflecting its prudent financial management. We forecast EBITDA net leverage will rise through 2026 due to significant capex, particularly on Neptun Deep development. However, we expect net leverage to decline from 2027 as new projects contribute to EBITDA. Romgaz's financial policy assumes EBITDA net leverage below 2.0x across economic cycles, supporting the company's 'bb+' SCP.

'Very Strong' Decision-Making and Oversight: Romanian government exercises significant control over Romgaz's decision-making, including its operational activities, financial performance, funding structure, and investment plans. This control is evident through the government's 70% ownership stake, and its oversight is robust, with Romgaz being subjected to frequent, periodic reporting on key operating and financial indicators. We therefore view the score for decision-making and oversight as 'Very Strong'.

Preservation of Government Policy Role: We assess the Preservation of Government Policy Role as 'Strong' due to Romgaz's pivotal role in energy self-sufficiency and security for Romania. Romgaz's natural gas production, ownership of Romanian gas storage network and electricity generation are integral to the national economy, and its default would impact the continued provision of a key public service. Moreover, Romgaz is involved in strategic projects like Neptun Deep, which further underscores its importance to the country's energy landscape.

Bottom-up Plus One Approach: We view Precedents of Support and Contagion Risk as 'Not strong enough'. We therefore calculate Romgaz's GRE score at 22.5 points. Combined with the 'bb+' SCP, this leads to the SCP plus one notch rating approach, resulting in the 'BBB-' rating.

Strategy Focused on Higher Production: Romgaz's 2021-2030 strategy focuses on enhancing the value of its core activities, natural gas production and trading, while pursuing decarbonisation. Key strategic goals include reducing carbon and methane by at least 10%, limiting annual natural gas production decline from legacy assets to below 2.5%, maintaining an EBITDA margin of 25-40%, and achieving a return on average capital employed of 12% or higher. Romgaz also plans to reach net zero CO2 emissions by 2050.

Generous Dividend Payments: Romanian state-owned enterprises have historically been required to distribute at least 50% of net profits as dividends. For 2023, Romgaz was authorised by the government to allocate only 20% of its profits for dividends in 2024 due to anticipated large capex, which is in line with exemptions from dividend policy for state-owned companies realising major energy projects. We expect that Romgaz will return to its standard, higher dividend distributions in 2025. However, the extension of lower dividend payments during Neptun Deep development cannot be ruled out and would represent an upside to our forecasts.

Regulated Gas Prices: In response to the Russia-Ukraine war, the Romanian government implemented regulations to protect consumers in the gas supply market that expire in March 2025. In 2023, 87% of Romgaz's gas sales were at regulated prices of RON150 per megawatt hour (MWh) or USD9.6 per thousand cubic feet (mcf). From April 2024, the capped price reduced to RON120/MWh. Sales at these regulated prices are exempt from windfall taxes, and royalties are based on capped prices. We assume the measures will not be extended, but the impact of an alternative scenario on Romgaz's financials would be positive due to lower taxation from regulated prices.

CCGT Plant in Construction: Romgaz is advancing construction of the Iernut combined-cycle gas turbine (CCGT) power plant, with RON344 million capex, to be completed by December 2024. Romgaz plans to benefit from sales of electricity on the balancing market, which is expected to increase in importance as renewable electricity generation increases with its inherent output volatility. We expect Iernut CCGT to constitute around 7% of Romgaz's EBITDA in 2027 increasing the company's business diversification, albeit with the upstream segment still the dominant cash flow contributor.

DERIVATION SUMMARY

Energean plc (BB-/Stable) is Romgaz's closest peer, although Romgaz has a more diversified profile with its gas storage and electricity generation, as opposed to Energean's focus on upstream operations. Despite Energean being larger in scale, with production expected to increase from over 100 kboe/d to approximately 185 kboe/d by 2025, it has lower realised prices in the Israeli gas market, compared with Romgaz's European gas price environment. However, Energean has a more favourable cost of production before royalties and is subject to a more advantageous tax regime, although this is counterbalanced by security concerns in light of the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas.

Historically, Romgaz has maintained a strong financial profile with a net cash position, but this is anticipated to change as growth capital expenditures for Neptun Deep ramp-up. In contrast, Energean is currently in a deleveraging phase as it transitions from growth capex to the production phase of greenfield projects.

KEY ASSUMPTIONS

Fitch's Key Assumptions within the Rating Case for the Issuer:

- Natural gas production evolution in line with management guidance

- Title transfer facility (TTF) gas prices at USD10/mcf in 2024, USD10/mcf in 2023, USD8/mcf in 2026, USD7/mcf in 2027 and USD5/mcf after

- Oil prices at USD80/bbl in 2024, USD70/bbl in 2025, USD65/bbl in 2026-2027 and USD60/bbl after

- Capex in line with management guidance

- Dividends at around 50% of previous year net income from 2025

RATING SENSITIVITIES

Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action/Upgrade

- An upgrade is unlikely at least in the short term unless there is a material improvement in Romgaz's business profile through diversification, or a significant increase in upstream production beyond the currently forecast level after Neptun Deep and Caragele development while maintaining a conservative financial profile

Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action/Downgrade

- Negative rating action on Romania's sovereign rating

- Weaker ties with the sovereign

- Problems in development of new upstream assets or EBITDA net leverage well above 2.0x after the capex-intensive period would be negative for the SCP and the IDR

LIQUIDITY AND DEBT STRUCTURE

Satisfactory Liquidity: Romgaz's liquidity needs for 2024 are covered through cash on balance sheet. Beyond 2024, we expect Romgaz to raise debt to fund its increased capex.

ISSUER PROFILE

Romgaz is 70% state-owned and 30% publicly traded on the Bucharest Stock Exchange and carries out operations in oil and gas upstream, gas storage and supply and electricity generation. Romgaz's 2023 production amounted to 83kboe/d, while Fitch adjusted EBITDA totalled RON5.6 billion.

Q1 2024 Business Update,"LONDON, May 22, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--This release includes business updates and unaudited financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2024 (""Q1"", ""Q1 2024"" or the ""Quarter"") of Cool Company Ltd. (""CoolCo"" or the ""Company"") (NYSE:CLCO / CLCO.OL).

Q1 Highlights and Subsequent Events

Richard Tyrrell, CEO, commented:

""The first quarter was a transitional quarter for both the market and CoolCo after the winter season in northern hemisphere ended early and two of CoolCo's vessels delivered into new charters. While one of the vessels delivered into a higher rate charter, the other was off-hire for a handful of days before delivery and this, combined with lower rates on our single variable rate contract reduced our overall fleet TCE to $77,200 per day.

Energy security concerns continue to support the price of LNG at above $9/MMBTU, which is supportive of shipping as average cargo values now exceed $30 million. Our next available vessels are well spaced and do not come open before the second half of 2024, when the market is anticipated to be in a seasonal upswing. Additionally, following two atypically warm winters in the northern hemisphere, during which China and India relied heavily upon significant coal inventories, we expect to see longer voyage distances in the second half of 2024 as greater volumes of LNG head east.

Subsequent to the first quarter, CoolCo was pleased to announce a long-term charter for one of its two state-of-the-art Newbuilds and looks forward to securing employment for its second Newbuild. The 14-year long-term charter takes CoolCo's firm revenue backlog to more than $1.2 billion and total revenue backlog including extensions to almost $1.9 billion as of March 31, 2024, and underscores the significant gap between the prevailing spot market and the long-term employment prospects for the high-quality, fuel-efficient LNG carriers.""

Financial Highlights

The table below sets forth certain key financial information for Q1 2024, Q4 2023 and Q1 2023.

LNG Market Review

The average Japan/Korea Marker gas price (""JKM"") for the Quarter was $9.43/MMBtu compared to $15.82/MMBtu for Q4 2023; with average JKM for Q2 2024 at $9.96/MMBtu as of May 14, 2024. The Quarter commenced with Dutch Title Transfer Facility gas price (""TTF"") at $10.31/MMBtu and quoted TFDE headline spot rates of $78,750 per day. The Quarter concluded with TTF at $8.76/MMBtu and quoted TFDE headline spot rates of $39,500 per day. The TFDE headline spot rate has subsequently stabilized at around this level and is quoted at $39,000 per day as of May 14, 2024.

Most LNG has continued to trade within its basin of origin, reducing the number of long-distance inter-basin voyages and limiting the effect of the Panama and Suez Canal closures. While demand for gas in Europe has dropped, the price of LNG is supported by concerns over energy security and the potential for a further decrease in gas from Russia whether in gas or liquid form. The high value of the cargos delivered into Europe is supportive of LNG shipping even though the distances involved are shorter.

The volatility of LNG markets is expected to increase as the winter heating season approaches. Onshore storage in Europe could fill up, resulting in more cargoes heading east and a return to using LNG carriers for storage - both of which would be positive for CoolCo's vessels.

Operational Review

CoolCo's fleet continued to perform well with a Q1 fleet utilization of 95% compared to 97% for Q4 2023, with the difference primarily reflecting 51 off-hire days due to time lost between charterhire as Kool Husky transitioned to its new charter in early March. While there were no drydocks during Q1 2024, one drydock has commenced in the second quarter, with a further three vessels scheduled to start their drydocks during the third quarter of 2024. The average cost of these drydocks is estimated to be at approximately $6.5 million per vessel, plus up to 30 days off-hire. One of the drydocks scheduled for the third quarter will also include the upgrade of a vessel to LNGe specification through the retrofit of a sub-cooler with high liquefaction capacity and other performance enhancements at an estimated cost of an additional $15.0 million and an additional 20 days off-hire.

Business Development

The chartering of one of CoolCo's two Newbuilds sets a strong precedent for the second Newbuild and CoolCo continues to be in discussions with potential charterers regarding its employment. CoolCo is also developing leads for its other two vessels redelivering in the second half of 2024, both of which are earmarked for an upgrade to LNGe specification during their scheduled drydocks during the first half of 2025.

Financing and Liquidity

During the Quarter, the Company closed on the upsize of the existing $520 million term loan facility maturing in May 2029 in anticipation of the maturity of the two existing sale & leaseback facilities (Kool Ice and Kool Kelvin) during the first quarter of 2025. As previously disclosed, the $200 million upsize will be available on a delayed drawdown basis, at our option.

As of March 31, 2024, CoolCo had cash and cash equivalents of $105.8 million and total short and long-term debt, net of deferred finance charges, amounting to $1,042.6 million. In addition, CoolCo has approximately $49 million remaining undrawn capacity under its Newbuild Vessel pre-delivery facility. Total Contractual Debt stood at $1,145.9 million, which is comprised of $475.8 million in respect of the $570 million bank facility maturing in March 2027, $461.9 million in respect of the $520 million term loan facility maturing in May 2029, $168.2 million of sale and leaseback financing in respect of the two vessels maturing in the first quarter of 2025 (Kool Ice and Kool Kelvin) and $40.0 million in respect of the Newbuilds' financing (Kool Tiger and Kool Panther).

In February 2024, lender approval was obtained for an amendment of financial covenants under the $570 million bank facility including a relaxation of the minimum cash covenant and a reduction in the minimum value clause. The new financial ratios include minimum net worth, maximum net debt to total assets and a minimum free cash restriction.

In March 2024, the Company and a group of lenders under the $520 million term loan facility maturing in May 2029, signed an amendment for a $200 million upsize of this facility (on a delayed drawdown basis) in anticipation of the maturity of the two existing sale and leaseback facilities during the first quarter of 2025. The amendment also includes a reduction in minimum free cash restriction.

Overall, the Company's interest rate on its debt is currently fixed or hedged for approximately 80% of the notional amount of net debt, adjusting for existing cash on hand.

Corporate and Other Matters

As of March 31, 2024, CoolCo had 53,702,846 shares issued and outstanding. Of these, 31,254,390 shares (58.2%) were owned by EPS Ventures Ltd (""EPS"") and 22,448,456 (41.8%) were owned by other public investors.

In line with the Company's variable dividend policy, the Board has declared a Q1 dividend of $0.41 per common share. The record date is May 31, 2024 and the dividend will be distributed to DTC-registered shareholders on or around June 10, 2024, while due to the implementation of the Central Securities Depositories Regulation in Norway, the dividend will be distributed to Euronext VPS-registered shareholders on or around June 13, 2024.

Outlook

In the near term, the spot LNG carrier market is likely to remain substantially detached from prospects for either multi-year secondhand employment or very long-term charters for newbuilds. Charterer comfort levels have been buoyed by two consecutive mild winters in the northern hemisphere and delays to commissioning and startup of very late-stage liquefaction facilities, resulting in both an enlarged pool of vessels available for short-term employment and an increased willingness of charterers to rely upon the availability of such temporary tonnage. As evidenced by the dislocation between the spot market and longer-term charter markets, current prevailing spot rates are more indicative of a market in a holding pattern than a longer-term call on overall market direction.

As anticipated, the imposition of a carbon pricing scheme and increasingly stringent environmental regulations are increasingly disadvantaging older steam turbine vessels in mainstream LNG trades. As such, that portion of the fleet, representing approximately 30% of the global LNG carriers, is experiencing both increased idleness and reduced charter rates relative to more modern, fuel-efficient vessels. Additionally, as has been seen in other shipping sectors in recent years, an increasing number of older steam turbine vessels have begun transitioning out of mainstream trades via sales to owners based primarily in Asia. This phenomenon has served as a dampener on anticipated scrapping levels for those older, less efficient ships, but nevertheless removes them from direct competition for primary business in a way that is likely to be sticky.

Moving beyond the short-term, liquefaction projects that have already reached FID (""Final Investment Decision"") remain set to increase the total volume of LNG on the water by more than 50% in the years ahead, with a particularly heavy concentration for commissioning in 2025, for which charterers will need to secure tonnage. Even against the backdrop of a sizable orderbook and relatively limited scrapping of older steam turbine vessels, the charter market is positioned to tighten considerably as these new volumes come online. Furthermore, even a typical winter season has the potential to absorb significant incremental tonnage. In that scenario, the prospect of being short transportation capacity is likely to reorient charterers away from their recent complacency in the spot market and back towards the risk-averse, energy security focus they have historically been willing to pay a premium for in the multi-year charter market.

Total Contractual Debt2 stood at $1,145.9 million, which is comprised of $475.8 million in respect of the $570 million bank facility maturing in March 2027, $461.9 million in respect of the $520 million term loan facility maturing in May 2029, $168.2 million of sale and leaseback financing in respect of the two vessels maturing in the first quarter of 2025 (Kool Ice and Kool Kelvin) and $40.0 million in respect of the Newbuilds' financing (Kool Tiger and Kool Panther).

In February 2024, lender approval was obtained for an amendment of financial covenants under the $570 million bank facility including a relaxation of the minimum cash covenant and a reduction in the minimum value clause. The new financial ratios include minimum net worth, maximum net debt to total assets and a minimum free cash restriction.

In March 2024, the Company and a group of lenders under the $520 million term loan facility maturing in May 2029, signed an amendment for a $200 million upsize of this facility (on a delayed drawdown basis) in anticipation of the maturity of the two existing sale and leaseback facilities during the first quarter of 2025. The amendment also includes a reduction in minimum free cash restriction.

Overall, the Company's interest rate on its debt is currently fixed or hedged for approximately 80% of the notional amount of net debt, adjusting for existing cash on hand.

Corporate and Other Matters

As of March 31, 2024, CoolCo had 53,702,846 shares issued and outstanding. Of these, 31,254,390 shares (58.2%) were owned by EPS Ventures Ltd (""EPS"") and 22,448,456 (41.8%) were owned by other public investors.

In line with the Company's variable dividend policy, the Board has declared a Q1 dividend of $0.41 per common share. The record date is May 31, 2024 and the dividend will be distributed to DTC-registered shareholders on or around June 10, 2024, while due to the implementation of the Central Securities Depositories Regulation in Norway, the dividend will be distributed to Euronext VPS-registered shareholders on or around June 13, 2024.

Outlook

In the near term, the spot LNG carrier market is likely to remain substantially detached from prospects for either multi-year secondhand employment or very long-term charters for newbuilds. Charterer comfort levels have been buoyed by two consecutive mild winters in the northern hemisphere and delays to commissioning and startup of very late-stage liquefaction facilities, resulting in both an enlarged pool of vessels available for short-term employment and an increased willingness of charterers to rely upon the availability of such temporary tonnage. As evidenced by the dislocation between the spot market and longer-term charter markets, current prevailing spot rates are more indicative of a market in a holding pattern than a longer-term call on overall market direction.

As anticipated, the imposition of a carbon pricing scheme and increasingly stringent environmental regulations are increasingly disadvantaging older steam turbine vessels in mainstream LNG trades. As such, that portion of the fleet, representing approximately 30% of the global LNG carriers, is experiencing both increased idleness and reduced charter rates relative to more modern, fuel-efficient vessels. Additionally, as has been seen in other shipping sectors in recent years, an increasing number of older steam turbine vessels have begun transitioning out of mainstream trades via sales to owners based primarily in Asia. This phenomenon has served as a dampener on anticipated scrapping levels for those older, less efficient ships, but nevertheless removes them from direct competition for primary business in a way that is likely to be sticky.

Moving beyond the short-term, liquefaction projects that have already reached FID (Final Investment Decision) remain set to increase the total volume of LNG on the water by more than 50% in the years ahead, with a particularly heavy concentration for commissioning in 2025, for which charterers will need to secure tonnage. Even against the backdrop of a sizable orderbook and relatively limited scrapping of older steam turbine vessels, the charter market is positioned to tighten considerably as these new volumes come online. Furthermore, even a typical winter season has the potential to absorb significant incremental tonnage. In that scenario, the prospect of being short transportation capacity is likely to reorient charterers away from their recent complacency in the spot market and back towards the risk-averse, energy security focus they have historically been willing to pay a premium for in the multi-year charter market.

Q1 2024 Business Update By Investing.com,"LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--This release includes business updates and unaudited financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2024 (""Q1"", ""Q1 2024"" or the ""Quarter"") of Cool Company Ltd. (""CoolCo"" or the ""Company"") (NYSE:CLCO / CLCO.OL).

This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240521645435/en/

The first quarter was a transitional quarter for both the market and CoolCo after the winter season in northern hemisphere ended early and two of CoolCo's vessels delivered into new charters. While one of the vessels delivered into a higher rate charter, the other was off-hire for a handful of days before delivery and this, combined with lower rates on our single variable rate contract reduced our overall fleet TCE to $77,200 per day.

Energy security concerns continue to support the price of LNG at above $9/MMBTU, which is supportive of shipping as average cargo values now exceed $30 million. Our next available vessels are well spaced and do not come open before the second half of 2024, when the market is anticipated to be in a seasonal upswing. Additionally, following two atypically warm winters in the northern hemisphere, during which China and India relied heavily upon significant coal inventories, we expect to see longer voyage distances in the second half of 2024 as greater volumes of LNG head east.

Subsequent to the first quarter, CoolCo was pleased to announce a long-term charter for one of its two state-of-the-art Newbuilds and looks forward to securing employment for its second Newbuild. The 14-year long-term charter takes CoolCo's firm revenue backlog to more than $1.2 billion and total revenue backlog including extensions to almost $1.9 billion as of March 31, 2024, and underscores the significant gap between the prevailing spot market and the long-term employment prospects for the high-quality, fuel-efficient LNG carriers.""

Financial Highlights

The table below sets forth certain key financial information for Q1 2024, Q4 2023 and Q1 2023.

LNG Market Review

The average Japan/Korea Marker gas price (""JKM"") for the Quarter was $9.43/MMBtu compared to $15.82/MMBtu for Q4 2023; with average JKM for Q2 2024 at $9.96/MMBtu as of May 14, 2024. The Quarter commenced with Dutch Title Transfer Facility gas price (""TTF"") at $10.31/MMBtu and quoted TFDE headline spot rates of $78,750 per day. The Quarter concluded with TTF at $8.76/MMBtu and quoted TFDE headline spot rates of $39,500 per day. The TFDE headline spot rate has subsequently stabilized at around this level and is quoted at $39,000 per day as of May 14, 2024.

Most LNG has continued to trade within its basin of origin, reducing the number of long-distance inter-basin voyages and limiting the effect of the Panama and Suez Canal closures. While demand for gas in Europe has dropped, the price of LNG is supported by concerns over energy security and the potential for a further decrease in gas from Russia whether in gas or liquid form. The high value of the cargos delivered into Europe is supportive of LNG shipping even though the distances involved are shorter.

The volatility of LNG markets is expected to increase as the winter heating season approaches. Onshore storage in Europe could fill up, resulting in more cargoes heading east and a return to using LNG carriers for storage "" both of which would be positive for CoolCo's vessels.

Operational Review

CoolCo's fleet continued to perform well with a Q1 fleet utilization of 95% compared to 97% for Q4 2023, with the difference primarily reflecting 51 off-hire days due to time lost between charterhire as Kool Husky transitioned to its new charter in early March. While there were no drydocks during Q1 2024, one drydock has commenced in the second quarter, with a further three vessels scheduled to start their drydocks during the third quarter of 2024. The average cost of these drydocks is estimated to be at approximately $6.5 million per vessel, plus up to 30 days off-hire. One of the drydocks scheduled for the third quarter will also include the upgrade of a vessel to LNGe specification through the retrofit of a sub-cooler with high liquefaction capacity and other performance enhancements at an estimated cost of an additional $15.0 million and an additional 20 days off-hire.

Business Development

The chartering of one of CoolCo's two Newbuilds sets a strong precedent for the second Newbuild and CoolCo continues to be in discussions with potential charterers regarding its employment. CoolCo is also developing leads for its other two vessels redelivering in the second half of 2024, both of which are earmarked for an upgrade to LNGe specification during their scheduled drydocks during the first half of 2025.

Financing and Liquidity

During the Quarter, the Company closed on the upsize of the existing $520 million term loan facility maturing in May 2029 in anticipation of the maturity of the two existing sale & leaseback facilities (Kool Ice and Kool Kelvin) during the first quarter of 2025. As previously disclosed, the $200 million upsize will be available on a delayed drawdown basis, at our option.

As of March 31, 2024, CoolCo had cash and cash equivalents of $105.8 million and total short and long-term debt, net of deferred finance charges, amounting to $1,042.6 million. In addition, CoolCo has approximately $49 million remaining undrawn capacity under its Newbuild Vessel pre-delivery facility. Total Contractual Debt2 stood at $1,145.9 million, which is comprised of $475.8 million in respect of the $570 million bank facility maturing in March 2027, $461.9 million in respect of the $520 million term loan facility maturing in May 2029, $168.2 million of sale and leaseback financing in respect of the two vessels maturing in the first quarter of 2025 (Kool Ice and Kool Kelvin) and $40.0 million in respect of the Newbuilds' financing (Kool Tiger and Kool Panther).

In February 2024, lender approval was obtained for an amendment of financial covenants under the $570 million bank facility including a relaxation of the minimum cash covenant and a reduction in the minimum value clause. The new financial ratios include minimum net worth, maximum net debt to total assets and a minimum free cash restriction.

Overall, the Company's interest rate on its debt is currently fixed or hedged for approximately 80% of the notional amount of net debt, adjusting for existing cash on hand.

Corporate and Other Matters

As of March 31, 2024, CoolCo had 53,702,846 shares issued and outstanding. Of these, 31,254,390 shares (58.2%) were owned by EPS Ventures Ltd (""EPS"") and 22,448,456 (41.8%) were owned by other public investors.

In line with the Company's variable dividend policy, the Board has declared a Q1 dividend of $0.41 per common share. The record date is May 31, 2024 and the dividend will be distributed to DTC-registered shareholders on or around June 10, 2024, while due to the implementation of the Central Securities Depositories Regulation in Norway, the dividend will be distributed to Euronext VPS-registered shareholders on or around June 13, 2024.

LNG Market Review

The average Japan/Korea Marker gas price (""JKM"") for the Quarter was $9.43/MMBtu compared to $15.82/MMBtu for Q4 2023; with average JKM for Q2 2024 at $9.96/MMBtu as of May 14, 2024. The Quarter commenced with Dutch Title Transfer Facility gas price (""TTF"") at $10.31/MMBtu and quoted TFDE headline spot rates of $78,750 per day. The Quarter concluded with TTF at $8.76/MMBtu and quoted TFDE headline spot rates of $39,500 per day. The TFDE headline spot rate has subsequently stabilized at around this level and is quoted at $39,000 per day as of May 14, 2024.

Most LNG has continued to trade within its basin of origin, reducing the number of long-distance inter-basin voyages and limiting the effect of the Panama and Suez Canal closures. While demand for gas in Europe has dropped, the price of LNG is supported by concerns over energy security and the potential for a further decrease in gas from Russia whether in gas or liquid form. The high value of the cargos delivered into Europe is supportive of LNG shipping even though the distances involved are shorter.

CoolCo's fleet continued to perform well with a Q1 fleet utilization of 95% compared to 97% for Q4 2023, with the difference primarily reflecting 51 off-hire days due to time lost between charterhire as Kool Husky transitioned to its new charter in early March. While there were no drydocks during Q1 2024, one drydock has commenced in the second quarter, with a further three vessels scheduled to start their drydocks during the third quarter of 2024. The average cost of these drydocks is estimated to be at approximately $6.5 million per vessel, plus up to 30 days off-hire. One of the drydocks scheduled for the third quarter will also include the upgrade of a vessel to LNGe specification through the retrofit of a sub-cooler with high liquefaction capacity and other performance enhancements at an estimated cost of an additional $15.0 million and an additional 20 days off-hire.

Business Development

The chartering of one of CoolCo's two Newbuilds sets a strong precedent for the second Newbuild and CoolCo continues to be in discussions with potential charterers regarding its employment. CoolCo is also developing leads for its other two vessels redelivering in the second half of 2024, both of which are earmarked for an upgrade to LNGe specification during their scheduled drydocks during the first half of 2025.

Financing and Liquidity

During the Quarter, the Company closed on the upsize of the existing $520 million term loan facility maturing in May 2029 in anticipation of the maturity of the two existing sale & leaseback facilities ( Kool Ice and Kool Kelvin ) during the first quarter of 2025. As previously disclosed, the $200 million upsize will be available on a delayed drawdown basis, at our option.

As of March 31, 2024, CoolCo had cash and cash equivalents of $105.8 million and total short and long-term debt, net of deferred finance charges, amounting to $1,042.6 million. In addition, CoolCo has approximately $49 million remaining undrawn capacity under its Newbuild Vessel pre-delivery facility. Total Contractual Debt 2 stood at $1,145.9 million, which is comprised of $475.8 million in respect of the $570 million bank facility maturing in March 2027, $461.9 million in respect of the $520 million term loan facility maturing in May 2029, $168.2 million of sale and leaseback financing in respect of the two vessels maturing in the first quarter of 2025 ( Kool Ice and Kool Kelvin ) and $40.0 million in respect of the Newbuilds' financing ( Kool Tiger and Kool Panther ).

In February 2024, lender approval was obtained for an amendment of financial covenants under the $570 million bank facility including a relaxation of the minimum cash covenant and a reduction in the minimum value clause. The new financial ratios include minimum net worth, maximum net debt to total assets and a minimum free cash restriction.

In March 2024, the Company and a group of lenders under the $520 million term loan facility maturing in May 2029, signed an amendment for a $200 million upsize of this facility (on a delayed drawdown basis) in anticipation of the maturity of the two existing sale and leaseback facilities during the first quarter of 2025. The amendment also includes a reduction in minimum free cash restriction.

Overall, the Company's interest rate on its debt is currently fixed or hedged for approximately 80% of the notional amount of net debt, adjusting for existing cash on hand.

Corporate and Other Matters

As of March 31, 2024, CoolCo had 53,702,846 shares issued and outstanding. Of these, 31,254,390 shares (58.2%) were owned by EPS Ventures Ltd (""EPS"") and 22,448,456 (41.8%) were owned by other public investors.

In line with the Company's variable dividend policy, the Board has declared a Q1 dividend of $0.41 per common share. The record date is May 31, 2024 and the dividend will be distributed to DTC-registered shareholders on or around June 10, 2024, while due to the implementation of the Central Securities Depositories Regulation in Norway, the dividend will be distributed to Euronext VPS-registered shareholders on or around June 13, 2024.

Outlook

In the near term, the spot LNG carrier market is likely to remain substantially detached from prospects for either multi-year secondhand employment or very long-term charters for newbuilds. Charterer comfort levels have been buoyed by two consecutive mild winters in the northern hemisphere and delays to commissioning and startup of very late-stage liquefaction facilities, resulting in both an enlarged pool of vessels available for short-term employment and an increased willingness of charterers to rely upon the availability of such temporary tonnage. As evidenced by the dislocation between the spot market and longer-term charter markets, current prevailing spot rates are more indicative of a market in a holding pattern than a longer-term call on overall market direction.

As anticipated, the imposition of a carbon pricing scheme and increasingly stringent environmental regulations are increasingly disadvantaging older steam turbine vessels in mainstream LNG trades. As such, that portion of the fleet, representing approximately 30% of the global LNG carriers, is experiencing both increased idleness and reduced charter rates relative to more modern, fuel-efficient vessels. Additionally, as has been seen in other shipping sectors in recent years, an increasing number of older steam turbine vessels have begun transitioning out of mainstream trades via sales to owners based primarily in Asia. This phenomenon has served as a dampener on anticipated scrapping levels for those older, less efficient ships, but nevertheless removes them from direct competition for primary business in a way that is likely to be sticky.

Moving beyond the short-term, liquefaction projects that have already reached FID (""Final Investment Decision"") remain set to increase the total volume of LNG on the water by more than 50% in the years ahead, with a particularly heavy concentration for commissioning in 2025, for which charterers will need to secure tonnage. Even against the backdrop of a sizable orderbook and relatively limited scrapping of older steam turbine vessels, the charter market is positioned to tighten considerably as these new volumes come online. Furthermore, even a typical winter season has the potential to absorb significant incremental tonnage. In that scenario, the prospect of being short transportation capacity is likely to reorient charterers away from their recent complacency in the spot market and back towards the risk-averse, energy security focus they have historically been willing to pay a premium for in the multi-year charter market.

1 Net income for Q1 2024 includes a mark-to market gain on interest rate swaps amounting to $11.3 million, of which $8.1 million was unrealized gain.

Appendix A - Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Definitions

Non-GAAP Financial Metrics Arising from How Management Monitors the Business

In addition to disclosing financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (US GAAP), this earnings release and the associated investor presentation and discussion contain references to the non-GAAP financial measures which are included in the table below. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business and measuring our performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with US GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with US GAAP. Non-GAAP measures are not uniformly defined by all companies, and may not be comparable with similar titles, measures and disclosures used by other companies. The reconciliations from these results should be carefully evaluated.

+/- Other non-operating income

+/- Net financial expense, representing: Interest income, Interest expense, Gains/(Losses) on derivative instruments and Other financial items, net

+/- Income taxes, net

+ Depreciation and amortization

- Amortization of intangible assets and liabilities - charter agreements, net

Increases the comparability of total business performance from period to period and against the performance of other companies by removing the impact of other non-operating income, depreciation, amortization of intangible assets and liabilities -charter agreements, net, financing and tax items.

Average daily TCE

Time and voyage charter revenues

- Voyage, charter hire and commission expenses, net

The above total is then divided by calendar days less scheduled off-hire days.

Measure of the average daily net revenue performance of a vessel.

Standard shipping industry performance measure used primarily to compare period-to-period changes in the vessel's net revenue performance despite changes in the mix of charter types (i.e. spot charters, time charters and bareboat charters) under which the vessel may be employed between the periods.

Assists management in making decisions regarding the deployment and utilization of its fleet and in evaluating financial performance.

Liquidity measures

Total Contractual Debt

Total debt (current and non-current), net of deferred finance charges

+ VIE Consolidation and fair value adjustments upon acquisition

+ Deferred Finance Charges

We consolidate two lessor VIEs for our sale and leaseback facilities (for the vessels Ice and Kelvin ). This means that on consolidation, our contractual debt is eliminated and replaced with the Lessor VIEs' debt.

Contractual debt represents our actual debt obligations under our various financing arrangements before consolidating the Lessor VIEs.

The measure enables investors and users of our financial statements to assess our liquidity and the split of our debt (current and non-current) based on our underlying contractual obligations.

Total Company Cash

CoolCo cash based on GAAP measures:

+ Cash and cash equivalents

+ Restricted cash and short-term deposits (current and non-current)

- VIE restricted cash and short-term deposits (current and non-current)

We consolidate two lessor VIEs for our sale and leaseback facilities. This means that on consolidation, we include restricted cash held by the lessor VIEs.

Total Company Cash represents our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and short-term deposits (current and non-current) before consolidating the lessor VIEs.

Management believes that this measure enables investors and users of our financial statements to assess our liquidity and aids comparability with our competitors.

Other definitions

Contracted Revenue Backlog

Contracted revenue backlog is defined as the contracted daily charter rate for each vessel multiplied by the number of scheduled hire days for the remaining contract term.

Q1 Highlights and Subsequent Events

Generated total operating revenues of $88.1 million in Q1, compared to $97.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 (""Q4"" or ""Q4 2023"") primarily related to brief off-hire on the Kool Husky as it transitioned to a new charter and a lower floating rate on another vessel; Net income of $36.81 million in Q1, compared to $22.41 million for Q4 with the increase primarily related to unrealized mark-to-market gains on our interest rate swaps; Achieved average Time Charter Equivalent Earnings (""TCE"")2 of $77,200 per day for Q1, compared to $87,300 per day for Q4; Adjusted EBITDA2 of $58.5 million for Q1, compared to $69.4 million for Q4; Upsized the $520 million term loan facility by $200 million, pushing out the first debt maturity to February 2027; Secured a 14-year charter with GAIL (India) Limited during Q2 2024 for one of the two state-of-the-art MEGA LNG carriers currently under order at Hyundai-Samho (the ""Newbuilds""), expected to be delivered towards the end of 2024; Commenced drydock cycle with one vessel during Q2 2024, with a further three vessels scheduled to follow in Q3 2024; Declared a quarterly dividend of $0.41 per share, payable to shareholders of record on May 31, 2024.

Richard Tyrrell, CEO, commented:

""The first quarter was a transitional quarter for both the market and CoolCo after the winter season in northern hemisphere ended early and two of CoolCo's vessels delivered into new charters. While one of the vessels delivered into a higher rate charter, the other was off-hire for a handful of days before delivery and this, combined with lower rates on our single variable rate contract reduced our overall fleet TCE to $77,200 per day.

Energy security concerns continue to support the price of LNG at above $9/MMBTU, which is supportive of shipping as average cargo values now exceed $30 million. Our next available vessels are well spaced and do not come open before the second half of 2024, when the market is anticipated to be in a seasonal upswing. Additionally, following two atypically warm winters in the northern hemisphere, during which China and India relied heavily upon significant coal inventories, we expect to see longer voyage distances in the second half of 2024 as greater volumes of LNG head east.

Subsequent to the first quarter, CoolCo was pleased to announce a long-term charter for one of its two state-of-the-art Newbuilds and looks forward to securing employment for its second Newbuild. The 14-year long-term charter takes CoolCo's firm revenue backlog to more than $1.2 billion and total revenue backlog including extensions to almost $1.9 billion as of March 31, 2024, and underscores the significant gap between the prevailing spot market and the long-term employment prospects for the high-quality, fuel-efficient LNG carriers.""

LNG Market Review

The average Japan/Korea Marker gas price (""JKM"") for the Quarter was $9.43/MMBtu compared to $15.82/MMBtu for Q4 2023; with average JKM for Q2 2024 at $9.96/MMBtu as of May 14, 2024. The Quarter commenced with Dutch Title Transfer Facility gas price (""TTF"") at $10.31/MMBtu and quoted TFDE headline spot rates of $78,750 per day. The Quarter concluded with TTF at $8.76/MMBtu and quoted TFDE headline spot rates of $39,500 per day. The TFDE headline spot rate has subsequently stabilized at around this level and is quoted at $39,000 per day as of May 14, 2024.

Most LNG has continued to trade within its basin of origin, reducing the number of long-distance inter-basin voyages and limiting the effect of the Panama and Suez Canal closures. While demand for gas in Europe has dropped, the price of LNG is supported by concerns over energy security and the potential for a further decrease in gas from Russia whether in gas or liquid form. The high value of the cargos delivered into Europe is supportive of LNG shipping even though the distances involved are shorter.

The volatility of LNG markets is expected to increase as the winter heating season approaches. Onshore storage in Europe could fill up, resulting in more cargoes heading east and a return to using LNG carriers for storage both of which would be positive for CoolCo's vessels.

Operational Review

CoolCo's fleet continued to perform well with a Q1 fleet utilization of 95% compared to 97% for Q4 2023, with the difference primarily reflecting 51 off-hire days due to time lost between charterhire as Kool Husky transitioned to its new charter in early March. While there were no drydocks during Q1 2024, one drydock has commenced in the second quarter, with a further three vessels scheduled to start their drydocks during the third quarter of 2024. The average cost of these drydocks is estimated to be at approximately $6.5 million per vessel, plus up to 30 days off-hire. One of the drydocks scheduled for the third quarter will also include the upgrade of a vessel to LNGe specification through the retrofit of a sub-cooler with high liquefaction capacity and other performance enhancements at an estimated cost of an additional $15.0 million and an additional 20 days off-hire.

Business Development

The chartering of one of CoolCo's two Newbuilds sets a strong precedent for the second Newbuild and CoolCo continues to be in discussions with potential charterers regarding its employment. CoolCo is also developing leads for its other two vessels redelivering in the second half of 2024, both of which are earmarked for an upgrade to LNGe specification during their scheduled drydocks during the first half of 2025.

Financing and Liquidity

During the Quarter, the Company closed on the upsize of the existing $520 million term loan facility maturing in May 2029 in anticipation of the maturity of the two existing sale leaseback facilities (Kool Ice and Kool Kelvin) during the first quarter of 2025. As previously disclosed, the $200 million upsize will be available on a delayed drawdown basis, at our option.

As of March 31, 2024, CoolCo had cash and cash equivalents of $105.8 million and total short and long-term debt, net of deferred finance charges, amounting to $1,042.6 million. In addition, CoolCo has approximately $49 million remaining undrawn capacity under its Newbuild Vessel pre-delivery facility. Total Contractual Debt2 stood at $1,145.9 million, which is comprised of $475.8 million in respect of the $570 million bank facility maturing in March 2027, $461.9 million in respect of the $520 million term loan facility maturing in May 2029, $168.2 million of sale and leaseback financing in respect of the two vessels maturing in the first quarter of 2025 (Kool Ice and Kool Kelvin) and $40.0 million in respect of the Newbuilds' financing (Kool Tiger and Kool Panther

In February 2024, lender approval was obtained for an amendment of financial covenants under the $570 million bank facility including a relaxation of the minimum cash covenant and a reduction in the minimum value clause. The new financial ratios include minimum net worth, maximum net debt to total assets and a minimum free cash restriction.

In March 2024, the Company and a group of lenders under the $520 million term loan facility maturing in May 2029, signed an amendment for a $200 million upsize of this facility (on a delayed drawdown basis) in anticipation of the maturity of the two existing sale and leaseback facilities during the first quarter of 2025. The amendment also includes a reduction in minimum free cash restriction.

Overall, the Company's interest rate on its debt is currently fixed or hedged for approximately 80% of the notional amount of net debt, adjusting for existing cash on hand.

Corporate and Other Matters

As of March 31, 2024, CoolCo had 53,702,846 shares issued and outstanding. Of these, 31,254,390 shares (58.2%) were owned by EPS Ventures Ltd (""EPS"") and 22,448,456 (41.8%) were owned by other public investors.

In line with the Company's variable dividend policy, the Board has declared a Q1 dividend of $0.41 per common share. The record date is May 31, 2024 and the dividend will be distributed to DTC-registered shareholders on or around June 10, 2024, while due to the implementation of the Central Securities Depositories Regulation in Norway, the dividend will be distributed to Euronext VPS-registered shareholders on or around June 13, 2024.

Outlook

In the near term, the spot LNG carrier market is likely to remain substantially detached from prospects for either multi-year secondhand employment or very long-term charters for newbuilds. Charterer comfort levels have been buoyed by two consecutive mild winters in the northern hemisphere and delays to commissioning and startup of very late-stage liquefaction facilities, resulting in both an enlarged pool of vessels available for short-term employment and an increased willingness of charterers to rely upon the availability of such temporary tonnage. As evidenced by the dislocation between the spot market and longer-term charter markets, current prevailing spot rates are more indicative of a market in a holding pattern than a longer-term call on overall market direction.

As anticipated, the imposition of a carbon pricing scheme and increasingly stringent environmental regulations are increasingly disadvantaging older steam turbine vessels in mainstream LNG trades. As such, that portion of the fleet, representing approximately 30% of the global LNG carriers, is experiencing both increased idleness and reduced charter rates relative to more modern, fuel-efficient vessels. Additionally, as has been seen in other shipping sectors in recent years, an increasing number of older steam turbine vessels have begun transitioning out of mainstream trades via sales to owners based primarily in Asia. This phenomenon has served as a dampener on anticipated scrapping levels for those older, less efficient ships, but nevertheless removes them from direct competition for primary business in a way that is likely to be sticky.

Moving beyond the short-term, liquefaction projects that have already reached FID (""Final Investment Decision"") remain set to increase the total volume of LNG on the water by more than 50% in the years ahead, with a particularly heavy concentration for commissioning in 2025, for which charterers will need to secure tonnage. Even against the backdrop of a sizable orderbook and relatively limited scrapping of older steam turbine vessels, the charter market is positioned to tighten considerably as these new volumes come online. Furthermore, even a typical winter season has the potential to absorb significant incremental tonnage. In that scenario, the prospect of being short transportation capacity is likely to reorient charterers away from their recent complacency in the spot market and back towards the risk-averse, energy security focus they have historically been willing to pay a premium for in the multi-year charter market.

1 Net income for Q1 2024 includes a mark-to market gain on interest rate swaps amounting to $11.3 million, of which $8.1 million was unrealized gain.

Appendix A Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Definitions

Non-GAAP Financial Metrics Arising from How Management Monitors the Business

In addition to disclosing financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (US GAAP), this earnings release and the associated investor presentation and discussion contain references to the non-GAAP financial measures which are included in the table below. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business and measuring our performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with US GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with US GAAP. Non-GAAP measures are not uniformly defined by all companies, and may not be comparable with similar titles, measures and disclosures used by other companies. The reconciliations from these results should be carefully evaluated.

Measure of the average daily net revenue performance of a vessel.

Standard shipping industry performance measure used primarily to compare period-to-period changes in the vessel's net revenue performance despite changes in the mix of charter types (i.e. spot charters, time charters and bareboat charters) under which the vessel may be employed between the periods.

Assists management in making decisions regarding the deployment and utilization of its fleet and in evaluating financial performance.

Liquidity measures

Total Contractual Debt

Total debt (current and non-current), net of deferred finance charges

VIE Consolidation and fair value adjustments upon acquisition

Deferred Finance Charges

We consolidate two lessor VIEs for our sale and leaseback facilities (for the vessels Ice and Kelvin). This means that on consolidation, our contractual debt is eliminated and replaced with the Lessor VIEs' debt.

Contractual debt represents our actual debt obligations under our various financing arrangements before consolidating the Lessor VIEs.

The measure enables investors and users of our financial statements to assess our liquidity and the split of our debt (current and non-current) based on our underlying contractual obligations.

Total Company Cash

CoolCo cash based on GAAP measures:

Cash and cash equivalents

Restricted cash and short-term deposits (current and non-current)

VIE restricted cash and short-term deposits (current and non-current)

We consolidate two lessor VIEs for our sale and leaseback facilities. This means that on consolidation, we include restricted cash held by the lessor VIEs.

Total Company Cash represents our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and short-term deposits (current and non-current) before consolidating the lessor VIEs.

Management believes that this measure enables investors and users of our financial statements to assess our liquidity and aids comparability with our competitors.

Q1 2024 Business Update,"This release includes business updates and unaudited financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2024 (""Q1"", ""Q1 2024"" or the ""Quarter"") of Cool Company Ltd. (""CoolCo"" or the ""Company"") (NYSE:CLCO / CLCO.OL).

This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240521645435/en/

""The first quarter was a transitional quarter for both the market and CoolCo after the winter season in northern hemisphere ended early and two of CoolCo's vessels delivered into new charters. While one of the vessels delivered into a higher rate charter, the other was off-hire for a handful of days before delivery and this, combined with lower rates on our single variable rate contract reduced our overall fleet TCE to $77,200 per day.

Energy security concerns continue to support the price of LNG at above $9/MMBTU, which is supportive of shipping as average cargo values now exceed $30 million. Our next available vessels are well spaced and do not come open before the second half of 2024, when the market is anticipated to be in a seasonal upswing. Additionally, following two atypically warm winters in the northern hemisphere, during which China and India relied heavily upon significant coal inventories, we expect to see longer voyage distances in the second half of 2024 as greater volumes of LNG head east.

Subsequent to the first quarter, CoolCo was pleased to announce a long-term charter for one of its two state-of-the-art Newbuilds and looks forward to securing employment for its second Newbuild. The 14-year long-term charter takes CoolCo's firm revenue backlog to more than $1.2 billion and total revenue backlog including extensions to almost $1.9 billion as of March 31, 2024, and underscores the significant gap between the prevailing spot market and the long-term employment prospects for the high-quality, fuel-efficient LNG carriers.""

Financial Highlights

The table below sets forth certain key financial information for Q1 2024, Q4 2023 and Q1 2023.

LNG Market Review

The average Japan/Korea Marker gas price (""JKM"") for the Quarter was $9.43/MMBtu compared to $15.82/MMBtu for Q4 2023; with average JKM for Q2 2024 at $9.96/MMBtu as of May 14, 2024. The Quarter commenced with Dutch Title Transfer Facility gas price (""TTF"") at $10.31/MMBtu and quoted TFDE headline spot rates of $78,750 per day. The Quarter concluded with TTF at $8.76/MMBtu and quoted TFDE headline spot rates of $39,500 per day. The TFDE headline spot rate has subsequently stabilized at around this level and is quoted at $39,000 per day as of May 14, 2024.

Most LNG has continued to trade within its basin of origin, reducing the number of long-distance inter-basin voyages and limiting the effect of the Panama and Suez Canal closures. While demand for gas in Europe has dropped, the price of LNG is supported by concerns over energy security and the potential for a further decrease in gas from Russia whether in gas or liquid form. The high value of the cargos delivered into Europe is supportive of LNG shipping even though the distances involved are shorter.

The volatility of LNG markets is expected to increase as the winter heating season approaches. Onshore storage in Europe could fill up, resulting in more cargoes heading east and a return to using LNG carriers for storage - both of which would be positive for CoolCo's vessels.

Operational Review

CoolCo's fleet continued to perform well with a Q1 fleet utilization of 95% compared to 97% for Q4 2023, with the difference primarily reflecting 51 off-hire days due to time lost between charterhire as Kool Husky transitioned to its new charter in early March. While there were no drydocks during Q1 2024, one drydock has commenced in the second quarter, with a further three vessels scheduled to start their drydocks during the third quarter of 2024. The average cost of these drydocks is estimated to be at approximately $6.5 million per vessel, plus up to 30 days off-hire. One of the drydocks scheduled for the third quarter will also include the upgrade of a vessel to LNGe specification through the retrofit of a sub-cooler with high liquefaction capacity and other performance enhancements at an estimated cost of an additional $15.0 million and an additional 20 days off-hire.

Business Development

The chartering of one of CoolCo's two Newbuilds sets a strong precedent for the second Newbuild and CoolCo continues to be in discussions with potential charterers regarding its employment. CoolCo is also developing leads for its other two vessels redelivering in the second half of 2024, both of which are earmarked for an upgrade to LNGe specification during their scheduled drydocks during the first half of 2025.

Financing and Liquidity

During the Quarter, the Company closed on the upsize of the existing $520 million term loan facility maturing in May 2029 in anticipation of the maturity of the two existing sale & leaseback facilities (Kool Ice and Kool Kelvin) during the first quarter of 2025. As previously disclosed, the $200 million upsize will be available on a delayed drawdown basis, at our option.

As of March 31, 2024, CoolCo had cash and cash equivalents of $105.8 million and total short and long-term debt, net of deferred finance charges, amounting to $1,042.6 million. In addition, CoolCo has approximately $49 million remaining undrawn capacity under its Newbuild Vessel pre-delivery facility. Total Contractual Debt stood at $1,145.9 million, which is comprised of $475.8 million in respect of the $570 million bank facility maturing in March 2027, $461.9 million in respect of the $520 million term loan facility maturing in May 2029, $168.2 million of sale and leaseback financing in respect of the two vessels maturing in the first quarter of 2025 (Kool Ice and Kool Kelvin) and $40.0 million in respect of the Newbuilds' financing (Kool Tiger and Kool Panther).

In February 2024, lender approval was obtained for an amendment of financial covenants under the $570 million bank facility including a relaxation of the minimum cash covenant and a reduction in the minimum value clause. The new financial ratios include minimum net worth, maximum net debt to total assets and a minimum free cash restriction.

In March 2024, the Company and a group of lenders under the $520 million term loan facility maturing in May 2029, signed an amendment for a $200 million upsize of this facility (on a delayed drawdown basis) in anticipation of the maturity of the two existing sale and leaseback facilities during the first quarter of 2025. The amendment also includes a reduction in minimum free cash restriction.

Overall, the Company's interest rate on its debt is currently fixed or hedged for approximately 80% of the notional amount of net debt, adjusting for existing cash on hand.

Corporate and Other Matters

As of March 31, 2024, CoolCo had 53,702,846 shares issued and outstanding. Of these, 31,254,390 shares (58.2%) were owned by EPS Ventures Ltd (""EPS"") and 22,448,456 (41.8%) were owned by other public investors.

In line with the Company's variable dividend policy, the Board has declared a Q1 dividend of $0.41 per common share. The record date is May 31, 2024 and the dividend will be distributed to DTC-registered shareholders on or around June 10, 2024, while due to the implementation of the Central Securities Depositories Regulation in Norway, the dividend will be distributed to Euronext VPS-registered shareholders on or around June 13, 2024.

Outlook

In the near term, the spot LNG carrier market is likely to remain substantially detached from prospects for either multi-year secondhand employment or very long-term charters for newbuilds. Charterer comfort levels have been buoyed by two consecutive mild winters in the northern hemisphere and delays to commissioning and startup of very late-stage liquefaction facilities, resulting in both an enlarged pool of vessels available for short-term employment and an increased willingness of charterers to rely upon the availability of such temporary tonnage. As evidenced by the dislocation between the spot market and longer-term charter markets, current prevailing spot rates are more indicative of a market in a holding pattern than a longer-term call on overall market direction.

As anticipated, the imposition of a carbon pricing scheme and increasingly stringent environmental regulations are increasingly disadvantaging older steam turbine vessels in mainstream LNG trades. As such, that portion of the fleet, representing approximately 30% of the global LNG carriers, is experiencing both increased idleness and reduced charter rates relative to more modern, fuel-efficient vessels. Additionally, as has been seen in other shipping sectors in recent years, an increasing number of older steam turbine vessels have begun transitioning out of mainstream trades via sales to owners based primarily in Asia. This phenomenon has served as a dampener on anticipated scrapping levels for those older, less efficient ships, but nevertheless removes them from direct competition for primary business in a way that is likely to be sticky.

Moving beyond the short-term, liquefaction projects that have already reached FID (""Final Investment Decision"") remain set to increase the total volume of LNG on the water by more than 50% in the years ahead, with a particularly heavy concentration for commissioning in 2025, for which charterers will need to secure tonnage. Even against the backdrop of a sizable orderbook and relatively limited scrapping of older steam turbine vessels, the charter market is positioned to tighten considerably as these new volumes come online. Furthermore, even a typical winter season has the potential to absorb significant incremental tonnage. In that scenario, the prospect of being short transportation capacity is likely to reorient charterers away from their recent complacency in the spot market and back towards the risk-averse, energy security focus they have historically been willing to pay a premium for in the multi-year charter market.

This phenomenon has served as a dampener on anticipated scrapping levels for those older, less efficient ships, but nevertheless removes them from direct competition for primary business in a way that is likely to be sticky.

Moving beyond the short-term, liquefaction projects that have already reached FID (""Final Investment Decision"") remain set to increase the total volume of LNG on the water by more than 50% in the years ahead, with a particularly heavy concentration for commissioning in 2025, for which charterers will need to secure tonnage. Even against the backdrop of a sizable orderbook and relatively limited scrapping of older steam turbine vessels, the charter market is positioned to tighten considerably as these new volumes come online. Furthermore, even a typical winter season has the potential to absorb significant incremental tonnage. In that scenario, the prospect of being short transportation capacity is likely to reorient charterers away from their recent complacency in the spot market and back towards the risk-averse, energy security focus they have historically been willing to pay a premium for in the multi-year charter market.

Moreover, recent producer cuts, maintenance events, and Freeport LNG's normalization of gas demand post-outage have contributed to this rise. Cheniere's announcement of no heavy maintenance for its liquefaction trains this year also supports higher prices.

In a Thursday note, Goldman Sachs strategists said the return of gas prices above $2/mmBtu aligns with their expectations, as production curtailments ""would ultimately lead to lower storage congestion risks for this summer.""

""That said, we see only limited further upside from current levels, with stronger gas prices risking a return of congestion concerns,"" they added.

Goldman notes that prices above $2/mmBtu reduce gas competitiveness compared to coal, with a $0.50/mmBtu increase potentially cutting gas demand by 1 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d), especially in shoulder months.

Moreover, higher prices may prompt the restart of previously shut-in wells.

The oil price selloff appears to have run out of steam with oil prices finding a floor over the past week. Brent crude for June delivery was trading at $82.44 per barrel in Wednesday's intraday session, a sharp decline from $90.10 a month ago while the corresponding WTI contract was trading at $78.17 per barrel down from $85.41 over the timeframe. Demand concerns coupled with softening geopolitical risk premium have been blamed for the pullback, with commodity analysts at Citi warning that oil prices could fall to the 70s range in the third quarter. Meanwhile, the oil futures markets have turned decidedly bearish, with money-managers moving sharply towards the short side in oil.

Unfortunately, oil and gas producers in the U.S. Shale Patch might find themselves in dire straits if Citi's predictions come true thanks to the majority having little or no price protection. Commodity analysts at Standard Chartered have revealed that hedge ratios for 2024 output remain well below long-term averages, at 20.9% for oil and 35.7% for gas, good for 0.8ppt lower y/y for oil and 7.5ppt y/y lower for gas. Hedge ratios for 2025 are even lower at just 5.9% for oil and 22.0% for gas. StanChart has noted that current hedge ratios are just a third of their pre-pandemic peak, when the hedge ratio exceeded 60% in 2018.

Thankfully, StanChart says that producers with protection have hedged at higher prices compared to previous years, meaning that oil prices would have to fall really low for them to get hurt. According to the analysts, the average swap (on a rolling four-quarters forward basis) in the latest survey has clocked in at $74.40 per barrel, the highest across the 33 quarters of StanChart's sample and over $17/bbl higher than in 2018. The average two-way WTI collar for 2024 output has a floor of $65.58/bbl and a ceiling of $85.67/bbl. StanChart has also revealed that the steepest part of the 2024 put options distribution lies in the $64-67/bbl range for WTI, low enough to avoid potential negative gamma effects at current oil price levels.

Whereas demand concerns have emerged as the biggest headwind for oil prices, the major energy agencies have only done minor revisions in demand/supply estimates in recent weeks. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) has revised its 2024 oil demand growth lower by 24 kb/d to 920k b/d and 2025 growth higher by 71 kb/d to 1.471 kb/d while the OPEC Secretariat has left its forecast unchanged at 2.247 mb/d in 2024 and 1.847 mb/d in 2025. Meanwhile, the EIA has revised its forecast for U.S. crude oil supply growth lower by 3 kb/d to 277 kb/d in 2024 and higher by 12 kb/d to 522 kb/d in 2025, the OPEC Secretariat forecast has climbed by 10 kb/d to 300 kb/d in 2024 and but unchanged at 290 kb/d in 2025 while StanChart's forecast stands at 218 kb/d growth in 2024 and 157 kb/d in 2025.

In contrast to oil markets, natural gas markets have turned bullish amid forecasts for hotter weather in parts of the northern hemisphere coupled with mounting concerns over rebuilding fuel inventories for the coming winter. Henry Hub prices have jumped 40.8% over the past 30 days to trade at $2.38/MMBtu while Dutch Title Transfer Facility (TTF) prices are hovering at €30/MWh, a 33% increase from February levels. The temporary hiatus in Europe's inventory injection over the past month has combined with a series of supply outages and maintenance, as well as heightened concerns on the stability of the remaining Russian flows into Europe, have been driving the rally. However, Europe's gas inventories remain high, standing at 75.60 billion cubic meters (bcm) on 12 May according to the latest Gas Infrastructure Europe (GIE) data. That marks a 2.44 bcm Y/Y increase and 17.21 bcm above the five-year average. The surplus relative to the five-year average has also been climbing, breaking a run of 25 consecutive decreases relative to the average. The w/w net injection rate stands at a four-week high of 1.944 bcm but still lags the equivalent period last year (2.259 bcm) and the five-year average (2.589 bcm).

That price decline came despite a big reduction in output in recent months due to relatively low prices and an increase in gas flows to liquefied natural gas (LNG) export plants following the return to near full service of Freeport LNG's plant in Texas after a maintenance outage.

Front-month gas futures for June delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell 3.4 cents, or 1.4%, to $2.347 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) at 7:48 a.m. EDT (1148 GMT). On Monday, the contract closed at its highest since Jan. 29.

Despite Tuesday's price decline, the contract remained in technically overbought territory for a seventh day in a row for the first time since April 2022.

In the spot market, gas prices at the Waha hub in West Texas averaged below zero for Tuesday for the fourth time this month and the 17th time since March as pipeline maintenance trapped gas in the Permian Shale in West Texas amid low demand for energy.

Financial firm LSEG said gas output in the Lower 48 U.S. states fell to an average of 97.2 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) so far in May, down from 98.2 bcfd in April. That compares with a monthly record high of 105.5 bcfd in December 2023.

On a daily basis, output slid about 1.5 bcfd over the past two days to a preliminary 96.5 bcfd on Tuesday.

That put U.S. gas production down about 9% so far in 2024 after several energy firms, including EQT and Chesapeake Energy, delayed well completions and cut back on other drilling activities after prices fell to 3-1/2-year lows in February and March.

EQT is the biggest U.S. gas producer and Chesapeake is on track to become the biggest producer after its merger with Southwestern Energy.

Meteorologists projected weather across the Lower 48 states would remain mostly near normal through May 29, except for several warmer-than-normal days from May 17-24.

LSEG forecast gas demand in the Lower 48, including exports, would rise from 91.5 bcfd this week to 92.6 bcfd next week. Those forecast were lower than LSEG's outlook on Monday.

Gas flows to the seven big U.S. LNG export plants rose from an average of 11.9 bcfd in April to 12.7 bcfd so far in May with the return of the 2.1-bcfd Freeport LNG's plant in Texas. That compares with a monthly record high of 14.7 bcfd in December.

The U.S. became the world's biggest LNG supplier in 2023, ahead of recent leaders Australia and Qatar, as much higher global prices fed demand for more exports due in part to supply disruptions and sanctions linked to Russia's war in Ukraine.

Gas was trading around $10 per mmBtu at both the Dutch Title Transfer Facility (TTF) benchmark in Europe and the Japan Korea Marker (JKM) benchmark in Asia.

Other factors also kept prices in check, including a bullish increase in the amount of gas flowing to liquefied natural gas (LNG) export plants with the return to near full service of Freeport LNG's plant in Texas and the bearish extreme oversupply of gas still in storage.

Analysts forecast the amount of gas in storage was around 31% above normal levels for this time of year.

With gas prices up about 40% over the past two weeks, speculators last week switched their futures and options positions on the New York Mercantile and Intercontinental Exchanges from net short to net long for the first time since mid-January, according to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission's Commitments of Traders report.

SUPPLY AND DEMAND

Financial firm LSEG said gas output in the Lower 48 U.S. states fell to an average of 97.2 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) so far in May, down from 98.1 bcfd in April. That compares with a monthly record high of 105.5 bcfd in December 2023.

On a daily basis, however, output rose about 1.9 bcfd over the past five days to a four-week high of 98.0 bcfd on Sunday with the return from maintenance of some gas pipes in Texas from a 15-week low of 96.1 bcfd on May 7.

Despite the output increase over the weekend, U.S. gas production was still down about 8% so far in 2024 after several energy firms, including EQT EQT.N and Chesapeake Energy CHK.O, delayed well completions and cut back on other drilling activities after prices fell to 3-1/2-year lows in February and March.

EQT is currently the biggest U.S. gas producer and Chesapeake is on track to become the biggest producer after its merger with Southwestern Energy SWN.N.

Meteorologists projected weather across the Lower 48 states would remain mostly near normal through May 28, except for some warmer-than-normal days from May 18-22.

LSEG forecast gas demand in the Lower 48, including exports, would rise from 92.1 bcfd this week to 92.9 bcfd next week. The forecast for next week was higher than LSEG's outlook on Friday.

Gas flows to the seven big U.S. LNG export plants rose from an average of 11.9 bcfd in April to 12.7 bcfd so far in May with the return of the 2.1-bcfd Freeport plant in Texas. That compares with a monthly record high of 14.7 bcfd in December.

The U.S. became the world's biggest LNG supplier in 2023, ahead of recent leaders Australia and Qatar, as much higher global prices fed demand for more exports due in part to supply disruptions and sanctions linked to Russia's war in Ukraine.

Gas was trading around $9 per mmBtu at the Dutch Title Transfer Facility (TTF) benchmark in Europe TRNLTTFMc1 and $10 at the Japan Korea Marker (JKM) benchmark in Asia.

Oil prices have pulled back sharply in the month of May with prices posting their steepest weekly loss in three months. The front-month contract plunged to an eight-week low of $82.41 per barrel in intra-day in early trading on 7 May, good for a $5.07/bbl w/w decline while Brent for July delivery fell by $3.87/bbl w/w to a settlement of $83.33/bbl.

The oil price selloff appears to have been triggered by a return of demand pessimism thanks to last week's report by the EIA that showed a 7.3M-barrel build in U.S. crude stocks, the largest weekly increase since February, as well as the recent revelation by the United Arab Emirates saying it had raised production capacity.

When the UAE ""brings 200,000 barrels extra to the table, that raises their baseline,"" Mizuho's Robert Yawger has told Dow Jones. ""It's no coincidence they pushed that number out there a month before the meeting.""

Commodity analysts at Standard Chartered have argued that these demand fears are overblown, especially considering that oil prices are trading below the levels that most OPEC ministers would consider indicative of a balanced market, meaning we are likely to see a rollover of OPEC+ production cuts for at least another month. StanChart says that traders are betting that OPEC+ will maintain the current levels of production restraint due to deteriorating fundamentals rather than a proactive decision to tighten balances. However, the analysts have pointed out that the current set of oil balance forecasts from the main agencies would not seem to support the extreme pessimism.

StanChart claims to have conducted a highly unscientific straw poll of traders that has revealed very little consistency between these concerns. Some traders are bearish due to a growing number of potentially negative economic outcomes; others believe the Middle East conflict will end up being bearish for oil, while others think that current supply-and-demand market data is concealing significant surpluses. The commodity experts, however, have conceded that weak U.S. transportation fuel demand appears to be a more prominent thread. Last week, The EIA estimated that U.S. gasoline demand declined 4.4% Y/Y in April, triggering a rapid pivot by speculative funds towards the short side of the market. However, StanChart has pointed out that there appears to be a systemic downwards bias in estimates of U.S. fuel demand, with actual gasoline demand exceeding estimates in 22 of the past 24 months, while distillate demand (mainly diesel) has been revised higher in all of the past 24 months. StanChart believes the latest EIA estimate for April gasoline demand is too low with actual demand likely to surprise to the upside.

Room For OPEC Cuts

Standard Chartered has also speculated that traders could be worried that OPEC+ has very limited scope for any cuts at the moment, and that any additional production such as UAE's as well as schedules for payback of past over-target output volunteered by Iraq and Kazakhstan could end up upsetting the market balance. StanChart has, however, previously argued that OPEC+ has room to increase output by over 1 mb/d in Q3 without increasing global inventories, meaning global markets could still be in a position to absorb the UAE's production increase of 200,000 barrels per day.

StanChart's machine-learning oil price model known as SCORPIO indicates that the downdraft in oil prices could drag on, with Brent prices falling $1.15/bbl over the next seven days with a negative volatility to price relationship playing a particularly marked role. Oil futures markets remain bearish, too.

StanChart has reported that the ICE Brent contract saw 17.29 mb of net buying over the past week, while the ICE WTI contract saw 10.77 mb of net selling. However, money managers are overall short oil, with the positioning indices for the main oil product contracts all negative. Thankfully, the limited extent of that short suggests that the bearishness is far from being overextended.

Another bullish catalyst: India's oil demand remains healthy. Data by the Government of India's Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell (PPAC) shows that India's oil demand in April averaged 5.295 mb/d, good for 6.3% Y/Y growth. Fuel demand growth was mixed, with gasoline demand jumping 14.1% Y/Y while diesel demand grew at a more sluggish 1.4% clip. StanChart has predicted that India's oil demand will expand by 265 kb/d Y/Y in 2024, slower than April's 313,000 Y/Y increase but significantly faster than the International Energy Agency's (IEA's) forecast of 180 kb/d growth.

Meanwhile, the natural gas rally appears to have lost some steam, with Henry Hub prices pulling back from a three-month peak of $2.20/MMBtu on May 5 to $2.18 on Wednesday's intraday session. Henry Hub prices have jumped 35.4% since April 26 on the prospects of Europe cutting off more Russian gas and predictions for increased cooling demand in the U.S. Dutch Title Transfer Facility (TTF) prices have also risen strongly over the past week, reversing almost all the YTD decline. TTF for June delivery rose EUR 3.738 per megawatt hour (MWh) to settle at EUR 31.801/MWh on 6 May.

However, it's doubtful whether these gains in gas prices will hold with European weather having reverted to a more normal pattern after the recent cold snap, and the gas injection season resuming. According to Gas Infrastructure Europe (GIE), EU gas inventories stood at 73.65 billion cubic meters (bcm) on 5 May, 17.85 bcm above the five-year average.",oilprice.com,news,OilPrice.com,,-0.04313725490196074,452901693,1,https://d32r1sh890xpii.cloudfront.net/article/718x300/2024-05-08_yh1hwaot9l.jpg,

Analysts forecast gas stockpiles were about 34% above normal for this time of year. Prices eased despite another decline in output, forecasts for higher demand over the next two weeks than previously expected, an increase in the amount of gas flowing to liquefied natural gas (LNG) export plants and as hot weather in Texas boosted the amount of gas power generators burn to keep air conditioners humming. Front-month gas futures for June delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell 2.0 cents, or 0.9%, to settle at $2.187 per million British thermal units (mmBtu). On Tuesday, the contract closed at its highest since Jan. 29. The front-month remained in technically overbought territory for a fourth day in a row for the first time since January. Traders noted that if U.S. crude prices continue to decline - crude futures were down about 9% over the past five weeks - some drillers could cut back on oil production in shale basins that also produce a lot of associated gas, like the Permian in Texas and New Mexico and the Bakken in North Dakota. Any reduction in associated gas could cause overall gas output to decline since high crude prices enable energy firms to keep making money by drilling for oil even when gas prices are negative like they have been at the Waha hub in West Texas in recent days. In Texas, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) issued a Weather Watch for Wednesday ""due to unseasonably high temperatures, high levels of expected maintenance outages during the spring shoulder months, and the potential for lower reserves."" That heat caused next-day power prices at the ERCOT North hub , which includes Dallas, to soar to an eight-month high of $400 per megawatt hour for Wednesday, up from $37 for Tuesday. SUPPLY AND DEMAND Financial firm LSEG said gas output in the Lower 48 U.S. states fell to an average of 96.8 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) so far in May, down from 98.1 bcfd in April. That compares with a monthly record of 105.5 bcfd in December 2023. On a daily basis, output was on track to drop by around 3.5 bcfd over the past four days to a preliminary 16-week low of 94.3 bcfd on Wednesday. LSEG forecast gas demand in the Lower 48, including exports, would slide from 93.7 bcfd this week to 90.9 bcfd next week. Those forecasts were higher than LSEG's outlook on Tuesday. Gas flows to the seven big U.S. LNG export plants rose from an average of 11.9 bcfd in April to 12.4 bcfd so far in May with the return of Freeport LNG's plant in Texas from maintenance and inspection work. That compares with a monthly record of 14.7 bcfd in December. The amount of gas flowing to the 2.1-bcfd Freeport plant was on track to hold near a two-month high of 1.4 bcfd for a fourth day in a row on Wednesday, up from an average of 0.4 bcfd in April. U.S. energy company New Fortress Energy said it expects to produce first LNG at its Altamira export plant in Mexico, which will source much of its gas from the U.S., later in May and export the first cargo in June.

Front-month gas futures for June delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange remained unchanged to $2.199 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) at 9:47 a.m. EDT (1347 GMT). On Monday, the contract closed at its highest since Jan. 29 for a second day in a row. That kept the front-month in technically oversold territory for a third straight day for the first time since January 2024. U.S. gas production was down about 11% so far in 2024 after several energy firms, including EQT and Chesapeake Energy , delayed well completions and cut back on other drilling activities after prices fell to 3-1/2-year lows in February and March. EQT is currently the biggest U.S. gas producer and Chesapeake is on track to become the biggest producer after its merger with Southwestern Energy. In the spot market, meanwhile, U.S. power and gas prices turned negative in Texas, California and Arizona as pipeline maintenance trapped gas in the Permian Shale in West Texas amid low demand for energy and ample hydropower in the West. SUPPLY AND DEMAND Financial firm LSEG said gas output in the Lower 48 U.S. states fell to an average of 96.9 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) so far in May, down from 98.1 bcfd in April. That compares with a monthly record of 105.5 bcfd in December 2023. On a daily basis, output was on track to drop by around 3.1 bcfd over the past four days to a preliminary 15-week low of 94.7 bcfd on Tuesday. Meteorologists projected weather across the Lower 48 states would go from mostly near normal now through May 14 to warmer than normal from May 15-22. LSEG forecast gas demand in the Lower 48, including exports, would slide from 92.6 bcfd this week to 90.4 bcfd next week. Those forecasts were lower than LSEG's outlook on Monday. Gas flows to the seven big U.S. LNG export plants rose from an average of 11.9 bcfd in April to 12.4 bcfd so far in May with the return of Freeport in Texas from maintenance and inspection work. That compares with a monthly record of 14.7 bcfd in December. The amount of gas flowing to the 2.1-bcfd Freeport plant was on track to hold near a two-month high of 1.4 bcfd for a third day in a row on Tuesday, up from an average of 0.4 bcfd in April. The U.S. became the world's biggest LNG supplier in 2023, ahead of recent leaders Australia and Qatar, as much higher global prices fed demand for more exports due in part to supply disruptions and sanctions linked to Russia's war in Ukraine. Gas was trading around $10 per mmBtu at both the Dutch Title Transfer Facility (TTF) benchmark in Europe and the Japan Korea Marker (JKM) benchmark in Asia.

Prices were also supported by an ongoing decline in output.

Front-month gas futures for June delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose 5.3 cents, or 2.5%, to settle at $2.195 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), the highest close since Jan. 29 for a second day in a row.

U.S. gas production was down about 9% so far in 2024 after several energy firms, including EQT and Chesapeake Energy, delayed well completions and cut back on other drilling activities after prices fell to 3-1/2-year lows in February and March.

EQT is currently the biggest U.S. gas producer and Chesapeake is on track to become the biggest producer after its merger with Southwestern Energy.

In the spot market, meanwhile, analysts said upcoming gas pipeline maintenance on U.S. energy company Kinder Morgan's Permian Highway Pipeline from May 7-12 and Gulf Coast Express from May 14-21 could push average next-day gas prices at the Waha Hub in West Texas back into negative territory for the first time since mid-April.

Reductions on those and other pipes in Texas over the past month or so trapped gas in the Permian Shale and helped push Waha prices below zero for several days last month.

Financial firm LSEG said gas output in the Lower 48 U.S. states fell to an average of 96.9 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) so far in May, down from 98.1 bcfd in April. That compares with a monthly record of 105.5 bcfd in December 2023.

Meteorologists projected weather across the Lower 48 states would go from warmer than normal from May 6-9 to near-normal from May 10-17 before switching back to warmer than normal from May 18-21.

LSEG forecast gas demand in the Lower 48, including exports, would slide from 93.4 bcfd this week to 91.0 bcfd next week. Those forecasts were higher than LSEG's outlook on Friday.

Gas flows to the seven big U.S. LNG export plants rose from an average of 11.9 bcfd in April to 12.4 bcfd so far in May with the slow return of Freeport. That compares with a monthly record of 14.7 bcfd in December.

The amount of gas flowing to the 2.1-bcfd Freeport hit a two-month high of 1.4 bcfd on Sunday, up from 1.2 bcfd on Saturday and an average of 0.4 bcfd in April.

The U.S. became the world's biggest LNG supplier in 2023, ahead of recent leaders Australia and Qatar, as much higher global prices fed demand for more exports due in part to supply disruptions and sanctions linked to Russia's war in Ukraine.

Gas was trading around $10 per mmBtu at both the Dutch Title Transfer Facility (TTF) benchmark in Europe and the Japan Korea Marker (JKM) benchmark in Asia.
