The Second World War is a project of the global financial oligarchy, the Anglo-American masters of money. It was they, relying on institutions such as the US Federal Reserve System and the Bank of England, who immediately after the end of the First World War began preparing for the next armed conflict on a global scale. And the plan for a new war was directed against the USSR.

Important milestones in this preparation were the Dawes Plan and the Young Plan, the creation of the Bank for International Settlements, Germany's announcement of the cessation of reparation payments under the Paris Peace Treaty and the tacit consent of Russia's former allies with this decision, powerful infusions of foreign investment and loans into the economy of the Third Reich, the militarization of the German economy in violation of the terms of the Paris Peace Treaty.

The key figures in the behind-the-scenes operation of the Anglo-American money owners were the Rockefeller and Morgan families, Montague Norman (Director of the Bank of England), Hjalmar Schacht (Director of the Reichsbank, Minister of Economics of the Third Reich). The strategic plan of the Rockefellers and Morgans was to economically subjugate Europe, and with the help of Germany, pumped up with foreign loans and investments, deal a crushing blow to the Soviet Russia, returning it to the fold of the world capitalist system as a colony.

Montague Norman (1871-1950) played an important intermediary role between American financial capital and German political and business circles. Hjalmar Schacht was put on the role of the organizer of the military economy of fascist Germany. The functions of covering up the backstage operation of the money owners were carried out by politicians such as Franklin Roosevelt, Neville Chamberlain and Winston Churchill. In Germany the plans were carried out by Hitler and Hjalmar Schacht. It is noteworthy that some historians say Hjalmar Schacht played a more important role than Hitler, but Schacht simply kept out of the spotlight.

The Dawes Plan, adopted in 1924 at the initiative of Anglo-American bankers, provided for the reduction of Germany's reparations burden (which was extremely painful for France, which received more than half of all reparations) and the provision of financial assistance to Germany from the United States and England in the form of loans, allegedly for the restoration of the economy and the subsequent restoration of reparations payments in full. In 1924-1929, Germany received $2.5 billion from the United States under the Dawes Plan, and $1.5 billion from England. At the current exchange rate, this is equivalent to an astronomical amount of about $1 trillion. Hjalmar Schacht, as one of the co-authors and executors of the Dawes Plan, summing up the results of the implementation of this plan in 1929, noted with satisfaction that 'Germany received as many foreign loans in 5 years as America received in the 40 years preceding the First World War' (1). As a result, Germany, defeated in the war, already in 1929 came in second place in the world in terms of industrial production, surpassing England.

In the 1930s, the process of pumping the German economy with investments and loans continued. For this purpose, in accordance with the Young Plan, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) was established in Switzerland (Basel) in 1930. The official purpose of the BIS was to pay reparations to Germany in favor of the victorious countries. In fact, through the BIS, the movement of money went in the opposite direction - from the United States and England to Germany. By the early 1930s, most of the strategically important companies in Germany belonged to American capital or were partially controlled by it. Some of the capital belonged to British investors. For example, the German oil refining industry and the production of synthetic gasoline from coal belonged to the American corporation Standard Oil (Rockefellers). The core of the German chemical industry was I.G. Farbenindustrie, which came under the control of the Morgan banking house. 40% of the German telephone network and 30% of the shares of the Focke-Wulf aircraft manufacturer belonged to the American company ITT. The core of the German radio and electrical industry was the A.E.G., Siemens, and Osram concerns; they came under the control of the American company General Electric. Both I.T.T. and General Electric were part of the Morgan financial empire. Finally, 100% of the shares of the Volkswagen concern were under the control of the American automobile corporation Ford.

By the time Hitler came to power, all strategically important branches of German industry - oil refining and the production of synthetic fuel, chemical, automotive, aviation, electrical engineering and radio instrumentation, a significant part of mechanical engineering (a total of 278 firms and concerns) were under the full control of American financial capital. In addition, the leading German banks - Deutsche Bank, Dresdner Bank, Donat Bank and a number of others - fell under the control of American capital (2).

***

On January 30, 1933, Hitler became Reich Chancellor. Before that, his candidacy was carefully studied by American bankers. In the autumn of 1930, the chairman of the Reichsbank, J. Schacht, travelled across the ocean in order to discuss with his American counterparts the details of the plan to bring Hitler to power. After Hitler's candidacy and the plan for his political promotion were finally approved at a secret meeting of bankers in the United States, Schacht returned to Germany. Throughout 1932 he worked with German bankers and industrialists to get their full support for Hitler. And such support was received. In mid-November 1932, 17 major bankers and industrialists sent a letter to President Hindenburg demanding the appointment of Hitler as Reich Chancellor. The last working meeting of German financiers before the elections was held on January 4, 1933, at the villa of the well-known German banker Kurt von Schröder near Cologne.

After the National Socialists came to power, Germany's financial, credit, trade and economic relations with the Anglo-Saxon world reached a qualitatively new level. Hitler immediately makes a loud announcement that he refuses to pay reparations. This, naturally, called into question the ability of England and France to repay their debts to the United States on loans from the First World War, but across the ocean they accepted Hitler's statement without any objections. In May 1933, H. Schacht made another visit to the USA. There he meets with US President F. Roosevelt and major bankers and signs an agreement to receive American loans totaling $1 billion. In June of the same year, H. Schacht travels to London and negotiates with M. Norman. Everything happens like in a fairy tale: the British agree to provide the Third Reich with a loan in the amount of $2 billion and at the same time do not object to the suspension of payments for servicing and repayment of British loans previously received by Germany. Some historians believe that an important reason for such accommodating American and British bankers was that the USSR completed the first five-year plan in 1932, which, unexpectedly for the West, led to a sharp strengthening of the economic positions of the Soviet power. Several thousand enterprises were built and put into operation, mainly in heavy industry. The USSR's dependence on imports of machinery and equipment decreased sharply over several years. The prospects of economic strangulation of the Soviet Union had practically disappeared. The bet was placed on war, and the unbridled militarization of Germany began.

The ease of obtaining American loans is also explained by the fact that almost simultaneously with Hitler coming to power in Germany, President Franklin Roosevelt came to power in the United States. He was supported by the same American bankers who supported Hitler in the fall of 1931. The newly elected president could not help but approve of the generous loan gesture in favor of the new regime in Berlin. By the way, many noted the great similarity between Roosevelt's ""new economic course"" in the USA and the economic policy of the Third Reich in Germany. There is nothing surprising about this. The same people, mainly from American financial circles, acted as consultants and developers of economic policy in both countries.

However, the ""new economic course"" of Roosevelt soon began to falter. In 1937, America was again in the abyss of the crisis, and in 1939, industrial capacity utilization in the USA was 33% (at the height of the crisis, 1929-1933 was 19%). Evaluating the situation in the USA in 1939, one of Roosevelt's closest advisors, P. Taguell, wrote: ""In 1939, the government could not achieve any success. Ahead lay the open sea until the day when Hitler invaded Poland. The mist could dispel only the mighty wind of war. Any other measures that were in the hands of Roosevelt would have yielded no results ""(3).

Under these conditions, only world war could become the only salvation for American capitalism. In 1939, the owners of money, using all the levers they had, began to put pressure on Hitler, demanding that he immediately start a big war in the East.

The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) became an important instrument for the policy of the owners of money during the Second World War. It was created as an outpost of American capital in Europe and served as a link between Anglo-Saxon and German capital, a kind of offshore cosmopolitan capital, providing it with protection from various political winds, wars, sanctions, etc. Although the BIS was founded as a commercial public bank, its immunity from government interference and even taxation in both peace and war was guaranteed by an international treaty signed in 1930 in The Hague.

The main initiators of the creation of the BIS were the bankers of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York from Morgan's inner circle, the director of the Bank of England Montagu Norman, the German financiers Hjalmar Schacht, Walther Funk (later replaced H. Schacht as president of the Reichsbank), and Emil Puhl.

The central banks of England, France, Italy, Germany, Belgium, and a number of private banks became the founders of the BIS, which signed the Charter of the Bank. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which actively participated in the creation of the BIS, was not included in the list of founders for political reasons. The United States Charter of the BIS was signed by the First National Bank of New York private banks, ""D. P. Morgan and Company ""and"" First National Bank of Chicago ""- they all belonged to the Morgan Empire. Japan was also represented in the BIS by private banks. In 1931-1932 19 central banks of European countries have joined the Bank for International Settlements. The first president of the BIS was the Rockefeller banker Gates McGarrah. In 1933, he left this post. He was replaced by an American, Leon Frazer, a protégé of the Morgans. During the Second World War, the president of the bank was again the American Thomas Harrington McKitrick.

The Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which actively participated in the creation of the BIS, was not included in the founders for political reasons. On behalf of the United States, the Charter of the BIS was signed by the private banks First National Bank of New York, D. P.

In 1931-1932, 19 central banks of European countries joined the Bank for International Settlements. The first president of the BIS was a banker from the Rockefeller clan, Gates McGarrah. In 1933, he left this post. He was replaced by the American Leon Fraser, a protégé of the Morgans. During the Second World War, the president of the bank was again an American, Thomas Harrington McKittrick.

Much has been written about how the BIS worked in the interests of the Third Reich (4). During the war years, the BIS carried out the calculations of Germany for the supply of goods from different countries, including those for which Germany was a military adversary. After Pearl Harbor, during all the war years, the BIS was still mentioned in all official reference books as a correspondent bank of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. During the war years, the BIS was under the control of the Nazis, but the American Thomas Harrington McKitrick was president of this bank. While soldiers were killed on the fronts, the BIS leadership meetings were held in Basel with the participation of bankers from Germany, Japan, Italy, Belgium, England and the United States. Here, in the Swiss ""banking offshore"", mutual understanding reigned, here there was an intense joint work of representatives of the countries opposing the war.

In an atmosphere of war, the BIS became the place where the gold stolen by Germany in various European countries flowed. In March, 1938, after the Nazis entered Vienna, most of the Austrian gold they had stolen moved to the BIS safes. The same fate befell the gold reserves of the Czech National Bank - 48 million dollars. This was before the start of World War II. After its unleashing, gold flowed into the Bank for International Settlements, which the Third Reich mined in concentration camps and as a result of various raids to rob civilians in the occupied countries (jewelry, gold crowns, cigarette cases, dishes, etc.). This is the so-called Nazi gold. It was usually processed from primary raw materials into standard ingots and sent to the BIS, other Swiss banks or outside Europe. After Pearl Harbor, that is, after the US entered the war, the Bank of International Settlements, according to the data of the American researcher C. Khayem, deposited gold from the Nazis for the sum of $ 378 million.

The history of the seizure of Czech gold by the Third Reich with the help of the BIS is worth saying in a little more detail. The details of this operation became clear after the Bank of England declassified part of its archives in 2012 (5). In March 1939, Hitler's troops captured Prague. The Nazis, threatening with weapons, demanded the surrender of the country's national treasure - gold reserves, estimated at 48 million dollars. Frightened members of the bank's board reported that the gold had already been transferred to the Bank for International Settlements. As it turned out later, the gold from Basel then migrated to the vault of the Bank of England. On command from Berlin, the gold was transferred to the account of the Reichsbank in the BIS, and physically it remained in the Bank of England. Further, the Bank of England began to carry out various operations with gold on commands that went from Berlin (from the Reichsbank) to the BIS, and then were relayed to London. A criminal conspiracy arose between three parties: the Reichsbank of Nazi Germany, the Bank for International Settlements and the Bank of England. By the way, in England in 1939, a real scandal began, since the Bank of England carried out transactions with Czech gold on orders that came from Berlin and Basel, and not from the Czech government. In particular, in June 1939, three months before the declaration of war between Great Britain and Germany, the Bank of England helped the Germans sell 440 thousand pounds sterling worth of gold and transfer part of the German gold reserves to New York (the Germans were sure that in the event of their invasion of Poland, the United States would not declare war). The Bank of England carried out illegal transactions with Czech gold with the tacit consent of the British government, which was aware of the matter. Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, Chancellor of the Exchequer John Simon, and other high-ranking officials were spinning like snakes in a frying pan, resorting to outright lies (they say, the gold was returned to its rightful owner or was not transferred to the Reichsbank at all). Only the recently discovered secret archives of the Bank of England confirm that the top officials of the state lied, covering for themselves, the Bank of England and the Bank for International Settlements. It was convenient to coordinate the joint criminal activities of the Bank of England and the BIS due to the fact that the chairman of the latter throughout the war was Montagu Norman, the director of the Bank of England, who did not hide his fascist sympathies at all.

In 1944, at an international conference in Bretton Woods (USA), where plans for the future world financial order were discussed, the question of the unseemly role of the BIS in the world war and its work for Nazi Germany suddenly surfaced. Omitting many details, I note that at the conference, with great difficulty, it was possible to adopt a resolution to close the BIS (a number of delegates and observers from the United States tried to prevent the adoption of such a resolution). However, the owners of the money ignored the decision of the international conference. And all compromising information related to the activities of the BIS during wartime was classified (6). This also helps today to falsify the history of World War II.

Finally, a few words about the banker and financier Hjalmar Schacht (1877-1970). He was the key figure controlling the economic machine of the Third Reich, the extraordinary and authorized representative of the Anglo-American capital in Germany. In 1945, Schacht was brought to justice by the International Military Tribunal in Nuremberg, but on October 1, 1946 was acquitted. Schacht went unscathed, as did Hitler, who, for inexplicable reasons, was not on the list of top war criminals in 1945. Moreover, Schacht, as if nothing had happened, returned to the German banking sector, founded and headed the Schacht GmbH banking house in Dusseldorf. It would seem that the detail is not worthy of attention, but this fact once again helps to understand that the Second World War was being prepared and partly summed up by the Anglo-American money owners and their authorized representatives in Germany. These same owners of money today want not only to rewrite the history of the Second World War, but also to replay its results.

Finally, a few words about the banker and financier Hjalmar Schacht (1877-1970). He was a key figure in control of the economic machine of the Third Reich, the extraordinary and plenipotentiary representative of Anglo-American capital in Germany. In 1945, Schacht was tried by the International Military Tribunal in Nuremberg, but was acquitted on October 1, 1946. Schacht got away with it just like Hitler, who for inexplicable reasons was not on the list of major war criminals in 1945. Moreover, Schacht returned to the German banking industry as if nothing had happened, founded and headed the banking house Schacht GmbH in Düsseldorf. It would seem that this detail does not deserve attention, but this fact once again helps to understand that the Second World War was prepared and partly summed up by the Anglo-American owners of money and their authorized representatives in Germany. These same owners of money today want not only to rewrite the history of World War II, but also to replay its results.

On January 30, 1933, Hitler became Reich Chancellor. Before that, his candidacy was carefully studied by American bankers. In the autumn of 1930, the chairman of the Reichsbank, J.

In March, 1938, after the Nazis entered Vienna, most of the Austrian gold they had stolen moved to the BIS safes. The same fate befell the gold reserves of the Czech National Bank - 48 million dollars. This was before the start of World War II. After its unleashing, gold flowed into the Bank for International Settlements, which the Third Reich mined in concentration camps and as a result of various raids to rob civilians in the occupied countries (jewelry, gold crowns, cigarette cases, dishes, etc.). This is the so-called Nazi gold. It was usually processed from primary raw materials into standard ingots and sent to the BIS, other Swiss banks or outside Europe. After Pearl Harbor, that is, after the US entered the war, the Bank of International Settlements, according to the data of the American researcher C. Khayem, deposited gold from the Nazis for the sum of $ 378 million.

The history of the seizure of Czech gold by the Third Reich with the help of the BIS is worth saying in a little more detail. The details of this operation became clear after the Bank of England declassified part of its archives in 2012 (5). In March 1939, Hitler's troops captured Prague. The Nazis, threatening with weapons, demanded the surrender of the country's national treasure - gold reserves, estimated at 48 million dollars. Frightened members of the bank's board reported that the gold had already been transferred to the Bank for International Settlements. As it turned out later, the gold from Basel then migrated to the vault of the Bank of England. On command from Berlin, the gold was transferred to the account of the Reichsbank in the BIS, and physically it remained in the Bank of England. Further, the Bank of England began to carry out various operations with gold on commands that went from Berlin (from the Reichsbank) to the BIS, and then were relayed to London. A criminal conspiracy arose between three parties: the Reichsbank of Nazi Germany, the Bank for International Settlements and the Bank of England. By the way, in England in 1939, a real scandal began, since the Bank of England carried out transactions with Czech gold on orders that came from Berlin and Basel, and not from the Czech government. In particular, in June 1939, three months before the declaration of war between Great Britain and Germany, the Bank of England helped the Germans sell 440 thousand pounds sterling worth of gold and transfer part of the German gold reserves to New York (the Germans were sure that in the event of their invasion of Poland, the United States would not declare war). The Bank of England carried out illegal transactions with Czech gold with the tacit consent of the British government, which was aware of the matter. Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, Chancellor of the Exchequer John Simon, and other high-ranking officials were spinning like snakes in a frying pan, resorting to outright lies (they say, the gold was returned to its rightful owner or was not transferred to the Reichsbank at all). Only the recently discovered secret archives of the Bank of England confirm that the top officials of the state lied, covering for themselves, the Bank of England and the Bank for International Settlements. It was convenient to coordinate the joint criminal activities of the Bank of England and the BIS due to the fact that the chairman of the latter throughout the war was Montagu Norman, the director of the Bank of England, who did not hide his fascist sympathies at all.

In 1944, at an international conference in Bretton Woods (USA), where plans for the future world financial order were discussed, the question of the unseemly role of the BIS in the world war and its work for Nazi Germany suddenly surfaced. Omitting many details, I note that at the conference, with great difficulty, it was possible to adopt a resolution to close the BIS (a number of delegates and observers from the United States tried to prevent the adoption of such a resolution). However, the owners of the money ignored the decision of the international conference. And all compromising information related to the activities of the BIS during wartime was classified (6). This also helps today to falsify the history of World War II.

Finally, a few words about the banker and financier Hjalmar Schacht (1877-1970). He was the key figure controlling the economic machine of the Third Reich, the extraordinary and authorized representative of the Anglo-American capital in Germany. In 1945, Schacht was brought to justice by the International Military Tribunal in Nuremberg, but on October 1, 1946 was acquitted. Schacht went unscathed, as did Hitler, who, for inexplicable reasons, was not on the list of top war criminals in 1945. Moreover, Schacht, as if nothing had happened, returned to the German banking sector, founded and headed the Schacht GmbH banking house in Dusseldorf. It would seem that the detail is not worthy of attention, but this fact once again helps to understand that the Second World War was being prepared and partly summed up by the Anglo-American money owners and their authorized representatives in Germany. These same owners of money today want not only to rewrite the history of the Second World War, but also to replay its results.

Finally, a few words about the banker and financier Hjalmar Schacht (1877-1970). He was a key figure in control of the economic machine of the Third Reich, the extraordinary and plenipotentiary representative of Anglo-American capital in Germany. In 1945, Schacht was tried by the International Military Tribunal in Nuremberg, but was acquitted on October 1, 1946. Schacht got away with it just like Hitler, who for inexplicable reasons was not on the list of major war criminals in 1945. Moreover, Schacht returned to the German banking industry as if nothing had happened, founded and headed the banking house Schacht GmbH in Düsseldorf. It would seem that this detail does not deserve attention, but this fact once again helps to understand that the Second World War was prepared and partly summed up by the Anglo-American owners of money and their authorized representatives in Germany. These same owners of money today want not only to rewrite the history of World War II, but also to replay its results.

It's odd how in an instant things can transform. Slipping out of balance into freefall. (The stock market is now down 23%). This is happening people. Where there are so few certainties...

Oh Canada!! their time has come Argentina have done it! One more Messi moment! Beyond glorious! Messi magic once again This is it...the stage is set That's what they came for!! And it is spectacular!! >> Another live look at 10 downing street in london, england, where today we learned U.K. residents will be heading to the polls this summer. British prime minister rishi sunak delivering the statement outside 10 downing just moments ago, we announced a general election will be held july, the 4th. Joining me now is tom brooks, a policy adviser and durham university professor of law and government professor, thanks very much for joining us. There had been speculation that it will later in the year election. Is this a surprise this? >> I think surprised if there is was that there was figures today about government borrowing levels, which meant that there governments hopes of of announcing some of the tax cuts looked like that was not going to happen. Small boat arrivals have been at a record level. This of the government has made a big planter stopping the boats across the english channel and and removing people pending asylum to rwanda and so on. It's happened going to to plan. And I think that might just must have been made. I know that these things are going to be any better over the next couple months. And so they called it now, things wouldn't be any worse. They might be a couple months ended with them too, to catch out of their own labour party, scottish nationalists and others. Maybe hoping their work prepared for this moment, but I suspect it's the worst secret in everyone because it had to happen this year and happen fairly soon anyway. So a surprise of sorts. >> The conservatives are trailing in the polls as soon as himself a within the party is having some issues can that what do they have to do to even have a hope of winning? >> I think it's, it's a very tall order for them to and I think one of the calculations they must get done is think about how much more terrible the result might be if they waited another couple months. Interest rates have gotten a bit better, but they're much higher than they were a few years ago as living standards and the U.K. are worse now than they were 14 years ago. People in my county county, durham right now don't have access to nhs dentist survey forced to go private. They want to access a dentist. You've got the constituency areas the police are not investigating were burglaries and where the place up and judge has been told not to sentence people because of overcrowding in the presence of a lot of things aren't going very well. And I think again, the judge has probably it's a good now to the polls. It's that off. Things aren't as bad as they might with the where there might be small, more small boats, people thing, higher and so on and so forth. I suspect it's a it's a damage limitation rather march to some so you think trait remembered something interesting about this prime minister is that no one's everybody for him, he's never let his party in a general election. He also lost the conservative party leadership contest to the stress. It was the shortest

serving prime minister need the following boris johnson's. There's a nation. So we've got somebody is says not even when his own parties members from kind of leaving it to only a few more months anyway, to call a general election. So yeah, I think he looked at that, the winds blowing and thought now was was better than any later than it did so we'll find out shortly. >> What kind of we're like the scottish party be your party's not consider the 2 main street. >> Yeah, I think that they could be a factor of sorts. I think that the, the main rees, the main factor, the scottish national party. I have this at the the in scotland did incredibly well winning virtually all its most in that that's in westminster did incredibly well. The problem for the s&p is that they want a lot of these by a narrow margin to next. And the honourable and wears later had a very the there and let them know that there's been a kind of political crisis of a very popular leader in scotland resigned her husband rested. It's been a number of things going on in s and the politics thanks to the north of the border. I think that. The s&p fortunes will make a difference. But I think that the difference will be looking for it's how many seats labour can win. Often the conservatives have not done particularly well in scotland for some time that I would not expect them to do now, but they could help make a real difference to weather. Keir starmer labour been outright majority or that we have a hung parliament. >> Ok professor, thank you very much for your analysis. Appreciation. Thom brooks as a policy adviser you know, the university professor of law and government. Norway, spain and ireland have announced their intention to formally recognize a palestinian state. A declaration that would go into effect on tuesday. >> I've spoken with a number of of the heaters and counterparts. I'm confident that for other countries will join us and taking this important step in the coming weeks. >> Leaders from the 3 countries say they hope the move brings new momentum toward a two-state solution. Adding it's not a decision against israel or one in favour of hamas, but instead it is in support of peace. Israel, they're angry reaction here, calling the decision distorted. And israel has now recalled its ambassadors to ireland, norway and spain. Some of their envoys hamas. Meantime, welcome the move and is calling on other nations to follow suit. Joining me now is michael lynk, former un special rapporteur for the situation of human rights in the palestinian territory from 2016 2 2022 michael, thank you very much for joining us. Thank you, roger, for having me. Does this is this a surprise move, your reaction to this? Are we expecting something like this? >> Well, I think there have been signals for some time that some european countries are going to do this. I think there had been a push for the eu as a to recognize the palestine as a we already have a handful of european countries have done this, this move today by norway, spain and ireland. I think will that will start much bigger snowball going down the mountain. We're expecting bill jim slovakia's. So the source will to probably to make a similar declaration the next couple days. And there may will be others. So who will soon follow them? So I think there's a recognition that same, we recognize palestine as a state does not bring a vote palestine as a state. But it does show, I think that world's increasing impatience with israel and its blockage of avenue or any path for the palestinians to achieve statehood. Now with this. >> Break help convince israel that maybe they need to find a peace accord or is this going to drive them further into the corner? >> Will be we know that the israeli current israeli government says it will never be a palestinian state under its watch. That's that's a fairly broad consensus among a number of the centre and the right there's really not politics, even if they say they accept a palestinian state, they don't accept a palestinian state on the 1967 boundaries, which is what international law would wind up demanding. So my sense is israel right now is overstepping its feet and quite angry. Its recalled its ambassadors from norway and spain and ireland. But I don't think there's much reversal that's in the courage that israel would have any effect on in changing minds with regards to this. And I think it's going to leave it increasingly even more isolated

than it is already. And probably drinking along united states with it. Now opponents of said this rewards terrorism. Your thoughts on that. Well, I I think irish knows the norwegian prime minister or foreign affairs minister said today this is a reward with respect to hamas and terrorism. It is a a slap in the face to israel. It's a recognition of something of that that's been long that international law and international diplomacy has long accepted that there has to be a palestinian state in the hope is, I guess is that by recognizing a palestinian state, a long time demand of the palestinian authority. It will give more legitimacy to the palestinian authority and take away some of the legitimacy that hamas has gained in taking on israel over the last 7 months. Now internally, though, is that is there any hope of a palestinian state? >> If if it's the palestinian authority running it. And hamas has pushed out. >> O we'll have to see where the with the dust settles out at the end of the war on gaza. Hamas is book is going to come out of the war, likely both weaker and stronger, weaker in the sense that it's had a lot of its military capacity destroyed and that its ability to govern gaza has probably been taken away from it. But there also is, I think, a strong sentiment of palestinian popular opinion leaning simply they are seen to be standing up to israel and be like poking it in the nose in a way that the palestinians authorities seem to be much weaker in being able to confront israel and to make any meaningful change on the ground. You mentioned the U.S. earlier, where does this leave them? Increasingly isolated with israel. The united states has has taken a long time position that it will. It supports a palestinian state. It will only support a palestinian state at the end of negotiations with israel. I think what you know that the announcement today by these 3 european countries are saying there is no from a path forward for palestinian state, which we all say we support given the determination can by the current israeli government to oppose want. So it makes, I think american argument saying, well, we should support a peace process and well, we should support a palestinian state only at the end of that. Negotiations seem increasingly hollow and and on persuasive. >> And for other countries that will not acknowledge it or recognize like canada, where does that leave them? >> Well, canada up until very recently had taken the same position of the united states is that they wouldn't recognize a palestinian state unless and until it emerged from negotiations with israel. I think we're going to see some daylight between the canadian position and the american position simply because I think there's a there's a recognition of the true facts on the ground that others. Now 740,000 israeli settlers in occupied east jerusalem and the west bank that israelis government has made it very clear they're not supporting a palestinian state. So canada's now same, we reserve the option now to recognize palestine as a state sooner than what negotiations may produce. So this will put, I think, even more pressure on canada to begin to make some hard decisions on its stance towards israel and palestine. >> Okay michael, thank you very much for your insight and analysis. Roger, thanks again for having me. Michael lake is a former un special rapporteur for the situation of human rights in the palestinian territory from 2016 to 2022. The head of singapore airlines has apologized for a flight that hit severe turbulence, killing one person and injuring at least 30 others. >> On behalf of singapore airlines.

I'm really impressed with the racing would like to responded responded to the situation. >> And I'm just really glad to be reuniting families. >> Well, many of the passengers have been able to secure connecting flights home from bangkok.

What are we looking at in this one? >> Yet another victim was come forward and alleged physical and sexual abuse by sean diddy combs. And this is bad news, not just because it's going to cost them money, but it makes it even more likely that in the face criminal charges against the sunni too much pressure on prosecutors to many victims. And that video that was released on friday showing that severe physical of it is that domestic violence prosecutors are going to have to act. I think it's a matter of when you get to and I did not this. >> It is, why is that is it is it is this political pressure on them. Now. >> Well, every prosecutor in the country is either elected or appointed by someone who isn't. There's a lot of pressure on folks to bring its tax, the rich and powerful men in hollywood to justice. There's a perception that they're able to escape justice because of their financial. It's the ability to hire the best and the most expensive lawyers. But when you have victim after that, this coming forward and really raising much of the same allegation coming too much for prosecutors to ignore going forward. And let's not forget. Federal prosecutors had enough evidence to get a search warrant for 2 of that is home and miami and los angeles, where I am. And if you can rent a federal judge, those home have evidence of a crime. It's not too far removed to come in that same judge that there's enough evidence to get an arrest warrant for good. >> And with the the accusation in this in this most recent one. How does it look? Is it a strong case? >> Well, that's similar to some of the other accusations involving sexual assault and obvious that cash isn't sure

case. But by far the strongest said the longest lasting relationship with did 11 years. And she was the first in that really, it expired a me too movement after she filed her lawsuit their november, even though it was settled the following that, the minute she alleged terrible. Really sexual abuse, including in rape and sexual abuse of minors. So I think hers is by far the strongest case, even though it was settled already. >> Diddy's apology video that he released a few days ago. Will this help or hurt him? >> Well, then it too little too late. It's not for that one cat who first filed dubois came out that these were baseless and outrageous lies. And did he did post that apology on instagram on sunday, but really, it was all so now it the treatment and therapy. But again, we apologize. And 6 months later, when it was clear to the entire world, you are physically abuse in ex-girlfriend. That wasn't particularly moving in my opinion. >> So what's next? What are we looking at? >> Next is the waiting game for, did he? So obviously, there's civil cases that are pending, but really those criminal charges, I fully expect that should a drop. I wouldn't be surprised if he's charged in a rico indictment similar to our kelly. We're talking about a really a pattern of sexual abuse in the video that we saw this weekend. I expect. One of the people it kathy venture. >> Okay, we've lost him at the end there. We were just wrapping up this interview. Nima, if you can hear us. Thank you very much for joining us. We your analysis.

For working on canada's border agency says he's working on a plan to step up its game when it comes to intelligence training and tracking. As we hear from ctv's tony grace, a recently released evaluation says the program needs a major refresh. >> Batches of chemicals that could have become 2 million doses of fentanyl. And 25 million doses of ecstasy, both considered intelligence winds at canada's borders. >> In a report calling for improved training and tools it provides in it important kind of insight into hidden part of the work of canada border services agency. An internal review made public this month found insufficient access to intelligence training for officers and analysts calling it one of the major challenges that could pose risks to the agency with new recruits often working 7 months or more without formal intelligence training. Cbsa has been struggling since its creation. You know, this is now at 2 decades ago to transform it into what is often called an intelligence led organization. And intelligence expert wesley wark says that's critical because of a growing focus on spotting national security threats, including from the trove of data online that can be open sourced, but isn't always sewn together.

The investigators aren't going to jump to any conclusions. At the same time we're not going to ignore the obvious. >> Roger: toronto police are investigating after shots were fired at a jewish elementary school. >> Along the wall. Steel. Suter with a shot.

I'm roger petersen, thank you very much for joining us. Aid trucks have begun to enter gaza via southern israel, it's part of a new agreement. It was closed when israeli forces seized the palestinian size earlier this month. Egypt had refused to reopen its side until control of the gazan side was handed back to the palestinians. Under U.S. and israeli pressure, it agreed to redirect traffic through the main cargo terminal. It's unclear if humanitarian groups will be able to access the aid because of fighting in the air. >>> A frightening incident has toronto police looking at a possible hate crime or even worse. Shots were fired at a jewish elementary school. Sean leathong with details. >> Reporter: a single bullet hole marks the window of the bais chaya mushka school for girls. Police confirming multiple shots were fired at the building early this morning. Suspects arrived at the school in a vehicle, a dark-coloured vehicle. They exited the vehicle and opened fire at the school causing some damage to the front of the school. >> Reporter: according to police the shooting happened just before 5 this morning. The school is located on crestwood drive surrounded by businesses. Police spent the day going through security footage. >> You will see an increased presence not only in this neighbourhood. >> Reporter: police will not call the shooting a hate crime and say they will enter the investigation with an open mind. >> The investigation will tell us what occurred here. That's why we have hate crime involved in this investigation. We're not ignoring the obvious. >> Reporter: premier doug ford writing on ""x"" this is a gross display of anti-semitism. Every student deserves to feel safe at school. If you have any information, contact toronto police. These cowards need to be found and brought to justice. >> Reporter: reaction from the jewish centre has been swift with a statement coming from the centre for israel and jewish affairs saying we demand justice. We demand swift action. The fact a school was targeted regardless of whether kids were present or not represents a worrying escalation in the violence jewish canadians have been experiencing and from friends of simon wiesenthal, which reads in part, it's time for leaders to stop with the sympathetic words and take the actions necessary to confront the escalating hatred plaguing our communities. Jews in this country will not hide in fear in the face of this brazen cowardly act. Police say they are stepping up their visibility within the community. >> The community will see officers at other schools, high visibility at synagogues, to ensure that the public understands that community safety is number one for us. >> Reporter: police have not said how many suspects they're looking for. Sean leathong, ctv news, toronto. >> Roger: a possible showdown brewing for tomorrow at the pro palestinian encampment at the university of toronto. The demonstrators have been ordered to leave. They say they aren't going anywhere. Ctv's rahim ladhani has the story. >> Reporter: more than 170 tents continue to occupy the green space at kings college circle at the university of toronto. Pro palestinian demonstrators vowing to stay put despite being delivered trespass notices. >> To us it is shocking that u of t would rather call the police than stop investing in weapons and bombs. >> Reporter: the heightened situation can escalate further with police enforcement on monday. Toronto's mayor says she won't be involved with that decision. >> It's not up to the mayor to tell the police what to do. There's a law to enforce. It's up to the university of toronto and police and there is a very important point to make. >> Reporter: the university has given those in the encampment a new deadline and an offer. They have until 8 monday morning to vacate. If not, the notice says necessary legal steps will be taken. The university is also inviting students to present their demands to u of t's governing board of council and former working group and consider

options. >> Reporter: the administration has not agreed to allow us to appoint people to this committee. We can make recommendations under the current proposal. Recommendations need to be approved by the president. He has final say. >> The offer makes clear that the university will not end partnerships with israeli schools. Encampment organizers describe it as an inadequate ultimatum prompting demonstrators to take further action. >> A group of students have begun an indefinite hunger strike. We will continuing in the university stops aligning itself with war criminals. We won't eat. >> Reporter: the two sides will have an opportunity to find common ground when they meet again for talks on sunday at a p.m. >> There is an ongoing genocide.

Ctv's olivia o'malley has more. >> Reporter: robots are rolling around the caq convention. Social media and A.I. are topics of discussion with its eye on the future of quebec. The party says it's concerned about youth and technology. [ Speaking French ] >> Reporter: premier francois legault says platforms such as instagram and TikTok are nothing less than virtual pushers. He's offering to hold a transpartisan committee to study the effects of screens on the health and development of young people. This comes after parti quebecois leader paul st. Pierre plamondon has been calling on the network to ban certain actions for young people. The caq says studying the issue will hopefully help parents with young children. >> We don't want to substitute their role. We want to help them deal with this situation seems to be worrying a lot of parents. As you saw earlier today, a lot of youth as well. The youth today were the ones most vocal about this issue. That was impressive to me actually. >> Reporter: the heart of the debate was the caq youth links proposal to set the minimum age for accessing social media platforms to 16 years old. When it came to the debate, the proposal was watered down. In the end, legault made his offer to the opposition leaders. The government has banned cell phones in class, education minister says the commission will help him see if they should be banned further. >> I'm looking forward to this commission helping me and helping us to have a better comprehension on this particular issue. >> Reporter: caq MNAs say the commission will be formed by 2025 at the latest which could potentially bring changes. Legault says the party will continue to make for the next generation. Olivia o'malley, ctv news. >> Roger: there were rallies in cities and towns across alberta yesterday to send a message to the provincial government. >> Enough of the lies, the deception, the gaslighting. >> A lot of the decisions the ucp and people inside the party are supporting have nothing to do with science or evidence or expertise. It's all fear and pandering. >> Roger: 500 people gathered outside calgary city hall commanding transparency and accountability. Some of the major issues including the alberta pension plan and attacks on education and healthcare. In a statement, the ucp's shane getson says the party supports albertans' rights to peaceful protest. >> Police are investigating and searching after a small plane went down near squamish bc.

It is coordinating with police and the bc coroner's service. >> The death toll from that massive landslide in papua new guinea is now more than 670.

>>> The U.N. says the updated death toll follows the discovery of 100 homes buried in the debris on top of the 60 they knew had been buried. Local officials put the death toll at 100. It soared. Over 5 bodies have been recovered. The national government may ask for more international assistance. According to officials renewed heavy rains triggered flash floods in afghanistan. At least 15 people are dead there including two parents ands their 8 children in the northeast of the country. The unusually heavy seasonal rains have been wreaking havoc on all parts of the country killing hundreds of people and destroying property and crops.

It's a really bad car crash we're watching. We can prevent it. >> Syphilis now a growing problem across north and south america. New data from the world health organization shows the continents make up 42% of new cases globally. Here in canada, saskatchewan posts the highest case rates among the provinces. >> It's not like we don't know how to identify or treat syphilis. We're having trouble controlling those numbers whether it's through not enough testing, barriers to access to testing or to care. >> Reporter: researchers say a rise in substance use, lack of awareness and stigma also play a role in transmission. >> The most devastating effect of syphilis in adults is congenital syphilis from the mother to the fetus. Transmission that could result in miscarriage or developmental issues to the baby. Congenital cases jumped 600% from 2018 to 2022. An alarming surge considering provinces like manitoba went decades recording a single case.

>> We didn't see syphilis for decades. And so there's a lot of physicians and healthcare providers who don't know what congenital syphilis looks like. It's important to educate them. >> Known itself the great imitator, syphilis can look like other infections and sometimes show no symptoms at all. Experts say prenatal care and routine testing should be a top priority because if caught early, typically a simple penicillin treatment can clear it right up.

Aid trucks have begun to enter gaza via southern israel under a new agreement to bypass the rafah crossing. It was closed when israeli forces seized the palestinian side earlier this month. Egypt refused to reopen its side until control of the gazan side was handed back to the palestinians. Under U.S. and israeli pressure, it agreed to divert traffic through gaza's main cargo terminal. It's unclear if humanitarian groups will be able to access the aid because of fighting in the area. A frightening incident has toronto police looking at a possible hate crime or even worse. Shots were fired at a jewish elementary school yesterday. Sean leathong with the details. >> Reporter: a single bullet hole marks the window of the bais chaya mushka school for girls.
