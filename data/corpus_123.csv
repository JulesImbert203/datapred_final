In the third week of May, prices in most major European electricity markets registered an upward trend between Tuesday, May 14, and Friday, May 17, reaching the highest daily price of the week on that day. However, this peak was lower than the previous week's peak. Despite the aforementioned upward trend, weekly prices fell compared to the previous week. The exceptions were the N2EX market of the United Kingdom and the IPEX market of Italy, with increases of 0.2% and 5.8%, respectively. The Nord Pool market of the Nordic countries reached the largest percentage price decline, 67%. In contrast, the EPEX SPOT market of Belgium registered the smallest percentage decline, 6.9%. In the other markets analyzed at AleaSoft Energy Forecasting, prices fell between 11% in the EPEX SPOT market of the Netherlands and the MIBEL market of Spain and 27% in the EPEX SPOT market of Germany.

In the third week of May, weekly averages were below €50/MWh in most analyzed European electricity markets. The exceptions were the Dutch, British and Italian markets, with averages of €55.80/MWh, €81.80/MWh and €96.12/MWh, respectively. In contrast, the Nordic market registered the lowest weekly average, €13.18/MWh. In the rest of the analyzed markets, prices ranged from €23.68/MWh in the French market to €49.13/MWh in the German market.

Regarding hourly prices, most analyzed European markets registered negative prices on May 14 and 19.

Prices have been rising since January 2024 in Europe, following the renegotiation of gas and energy supply contracts. March 2024 saw significant developments in VAM and other petrochemical markets as downturns eased partially due to increased operation of European crackers and inventory pressures. The VAM market has largely remained bullish, with PVAc demand from adhesives, packaging, and paints gradually recovering, especially in the Netherlands, France, and Italy. However, production statistics indicate that a full recovery to pre-pandemic levels won't occur before 2025, with prices consistently remaining 38% higher than pre-pandemic levels.

European VAM prices, as assessed by ChemAnalyst, moved upwards by USD 10/MT in the second week of May 2024, marking a 23% year-to-date increase. This rise is partly attributed to increased freight charges and safety stocking by European markets to hedge against potential embargoes on methanol supply from the Middle East. However, ChemAnalyst's research concluded that rising freight charges alone do not explain the price movements.

Rising crude and gas prices by the end of February 2024 contributed to increased spot methanol and VAM prices, with inventory pressures and demand support being additional factors. Spot Dutch TTF gas prices were assessed at USD 8.9/MMBtu, which is 3.68 times higher than US gas prices for 2024 spot volumes, yet still 53% lower than the October 2022 spot peak.

Research revealed that VAM derived from gas deliveries at USD 13.36/MMBtu led to increased prices in the acetyls chain, pulling up the intermediate VAM and methanol markets by 77% from January 2023 to March 2023. This spike triggered a reduction in VAM output and demand by nearly 50%, causing a price free fall over the next three months as European suppliers held onto their inventories until June 2023. From January 2024, new gas contracts intensified inventory pressures and continuous downturns forced supply constraints.

In April 2024, despite falling freight prices across the Asia-Europe route, VAM prices remained high, partly due to the continued operation of European plants. A Pricing Analyst at ChemAnalyst identified that US suppliers had margins extending to USD 270-280/MT for methanol and around USD 370-380/MT for VAM production, while European suppliers had significantly lower margins of USD 50-150/MT for methanol and USD 200/MT for VAM. Nevertheless, European VAM margins remained positive this year, contrasting with negative margins the previous year. Supply disruptions in Texas and Louisiana due to hurricanes have affected deliveries to Europe, yet prices have not risen proportionately and are expected to increase by the end of May 2024.

VAM industrial trends and downstream PVAc and end-use industry trend studies suggest that VAM prices are set to ease by the end of the third quarter when gas prices are expected to rise due to heating requirements and annual plant maintenance. Prices are expected to ease off as the intermediate value chain builds up strong inventories.",chemanalyst.com,news,chemanalyst.com,,0.04313725490196085,453978487,1,,

These three markets continued the downward trend for the second consecutive week. On the other hand, the Portuguese and Belgian markets had declines of 2.0% in both cases. In the Belgian market, it is the third consecutive week with this trend. Most of the declines in demand are related to the celebration of the Ascension Day on May 9 in Germany, Belgium, France and the Netherlands. The United Kingdom celebrated the Early May bank holiday on Monday, May 6.

On the other hand, the markets of Italy, Spain and Germany registered increases in demand of 6.8%, 1.7% and 0.1%, respectively. The increases in demand in the markets of Italy, Spain and Germany during the second week of May were mainly related to the recovery in demand after the May 1 holiday, International Workers' Day.

On the other hand, the less cold average temperatures registered in a large part of the markets favored the decrease in demand. In Italy, France, Spain, Great Britain and Portugal average temperatures increased between 1.6 °C and 3.8 °C. In Belgium the increase was smaller, 0.9 °C. The Netherlands and Germany were the exception, where average temperatures decreased by 0.3 °C and 2.1 °C, respectively.

In contrast, the N2EX market of the United Kingdom registered the smallest percentage increase, 1.4%. In the other markets analyzed at AleaSoft Energy Forecasting, prices rose between 2.1% in the EPEX SPOT market of the Netherlands and 11% in the MIBEL market of Portugal.

In the second week of May, despite the price increases, weekly averages remained below €65/MWh in most analyzed European electricity markets. The exceptions were the German market, the British market and the IPEX market of Italy, with averages of €67.33/MWh, €81.65/MWh and €90.86/MWh, respectively. On the other hand, the French market registered the lowest weekly average, €28.06/MWh, thus breaking the streak that the MIBEL market had been on by reaching the lowest prices for thirteen consecutive weeks. In the rest of the analyzed markets, prices ranged from €30.81/MWh in the Spanish market to €62.81/MWh in the Dutch market.

Regarding hourly prices, most analyzed European markets registered negative prices on May 11 and 12. The exceptions were the British and Italian markets, where there were no negative prices, and the Portuguese market, which only registered negative prices on the 11. On the other hand, the Nordic market also reached negative prices on Thursday, May 9. The rest of the analyzed markets, in addition to these three days, registered negative hourly prices on Monday, May 13. The Dutch market reached the lowest hourly price again, ?€200.00/MWh, on Sunday, May 12, from 13:00 to 14:00.

During the week of May 6, the fall in wind energy production and the increase in the average price of gas and CO emission allowances had an upward influence on European electricity market prices. In addition, electricity demand increased in the German, Spanish and Italian markets. The previous week's public holiday on May 1 led to a decrease in demand and prices on that day in almost all markets. The Italian market also registered a decrease in solar energy production.

AleaSoft Energy Forecasting's price forecasts indicate that prices of the analyzed European electricity markets might fall in the third week of May, influenced by the increase in wind energy production in most markets.

After the price drop in the first week of May, the settlement prices of Brent oil futures for the Front?Month in the ICE market remained below $85/bbl during the second week of May. On Thursday, May 9, these futures reached their weekly maximum settlement price, $83.88/bbl. This price was 0.3% higher than the previous Thursday. On the other hand, on Friday, May 10, these futures registered their weekly minimum settlement price, $82.79/bbl. According to data analyzed at AleaSoft Energy Forecasting, this price was 0.2% lower than the previous Friday and the lowest since March 13.

In the second week of May, concerns about global economic evolution counterbalanced the upward influence caused by instability in the Middle East and the possibility that OPEC+ will maintain its production cuts in the second half of 2024. As a result, Brent oil futures prices remained stable.

As for TTF gas futures in the ICE market for the Front?Month, on Monday, May 6, they reached their weekly maximum settlement price, €32.14/MWh. According to data analyzed at AleaSoft Energy Forecasting, this price was 15% higher than the previous Monday and the highest since April 19. Subsequently, settlement prices declined, but they remained above €30/MWh. On Friday, May 10, these futures reached their weekly minimum settlement price, €30.03/MWh. This price was 1.6% lower than the previous Friday.

In the second week of May, concerns about supply to refill reserves for the coming winter drove TTF gas futures prices higher. LNG supply decreased in April due to higher prices in Asian markets. In addition, next winter might be colder than normal. However, still high European reserve levels continued to limit price increases.

As for CO emission allowances futures in the EEX market for the reference contract of December 2024, settlement prices remained above €70/t during the second week of May. On Tuesday, May 7, these futures reached their weekly minimum settlement price, €70.98/t. According to data analyzed at AleaSoft Energy Forecasting, this price was still 3.6% higher than the previous Tuesday. In contrast, on Thursday, May 9, these futures registered their weekly maximum settlement price, €73.26/t. This price was 1.0% higher than the previous Thursday and the highest since April 17. In the last session of the second week of May, the settlement price was €71.90/t.

Since late March, Ukrainian energy infrastructure increasingly has come under attack from Russian military forces, with gas facilities and underground storage units hit several times by missile and drone strikes.

Russian attacks on Ukrainian gas infrastructure are a part of broader series of assaults on oil, gas and power facilities between the two nations, initiated by Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, with an attack on Russia's Salavat refinery by Ukrainian drones May 9 being the latest development

""It is just too sudden and unpredictable for me,"" a Netherlands-based trader said, reflecting on the risk of a rapid deterioration of the situation in Ukraine.

""We sadly watched a series of attacks on our energy infrastructure and were forced to respond,"" Russia's president Vladimir Putin said during a meeting April 11 with Belarus' president.

Similar to the country's gas storage infrastructure, Ukrainian gas production facilities were also subjects of shelling and power cuts, but Naftogaz's upstream arm, UkrGazVydobuvannya, posted 12% year-on-year gains in Q1 2024.

""The risk is too high,"" a European gas trader said. ""We have considered [using Ukrainian storage], but it's too hard to put the case together because it's impossible to know Russia's next moves.""

Ukrainian storage capacity benefits from customs warehouse regime

In a report published May 7, analysts at S&P Global Commodity Insights revised their projections and now consider it ""more likely than not"" that Russian gas flows through Ukraine will cease by 2025.

This development has prompted Europe to look at several flexibility and contingency options. For the Central and Eastern European, or CEE, markets, an option is to utilize Ukrainian gas storage facilities under the country's customs warehouse regime. The Ukrainian customs warehouse regime has more storage capacity than any other EU country, a legacy of the high volumes of Russian gas exported through the country.

The regime bundles all Ukrainian storage facilities as one, meaning if one facility is hit, participants can continue to withdraw gas from other facilities. Moreover, UkrTransGaz also offers custom duty exemptions for three years, meaning gas can easily be reimported back into the EU.

Up to 10 Bcm of capacity was on offer under the customs warehouse regime, according to Agneta Kutselim, UkrTransGaz head of commercial.

By comparison, German storage's working gas volume stands at roughly 25 Bcm, with the country boasting the EU's largest underground storage capacity, data from Gas Infrastructure Europe shows.

A Hungary-based trader wondered who would ultimately take the financial hit for the gas lost due to infrastructure attacks.

""Domestic players or foreign companies?"" the source asked, pointing out that the current replacement arrangement would cause operational problems but is ""is doable until a certain level"" of infrastructure damage.

The prior mentioned analytics report forecasts that, based on current gas storage levels and continued injections throughout summer 2024, 2.5 Bcm of gas would be available for withdrawals during the winter season.

Winter premiums remain weak

Market participants continued to see the seasonal spreads as currently unfavorable in pushing enough injections into Ukrainian storage by the end of summer.

""I do not think that the current spreads between summer contracts and winter will incentivize a lot of players to fill storage beyond the EU into Ukraine"" a UK-based gas analyst said, ""If there is less gas in Ukrainian storage, or if they become less available [due to attacks], the gas system in winter will be much tighter, and Eastern European countries will have to also rely more on imports from Northwest Europe.""

Platts, part of S&P Global Commodity Insights, assessed the Winter 2024 premium to the month-ahead at Europe's bellwether Dutch TTF hub at Eur5.32/MWh May 11, with the spread having averaged around Eur5.325/MWh since the summer season began.

In comparison, Platts had assessed the TTF Winter 2023 premium to the month-ahead at Eur20.075/MWh as of May 11, 2023. This spread would then reach a peak of Eur20.6/MWh by May 24, remaining between the Eur15-20/MWh for much of the previous summer season.

European gas market participants have highlighted persistent concerns surrounding risks of further escalation alongside unfavorable pricing dynamics.

""The spreads are the driver,"" a Switzerland-based trader said. ""If the spreads were Eur10-12/MWh, which was a decent level for last year, would a trader inject in light of these new attacks?""

Another European gas trader said: ""It is about portfolio management and risk appetite. Personally, I would not use any Ukrainian source as long as Russia is active in the field. ... My opinion now is that the market isn't focused on this.""

""If storage infrastructure is damaged, it may cause a reactive price spike but shouldn't have a long-term effect on prices because they are not being utilized in the market,"" the same source said.

ANNOUNCES Q1 2024 RESULTS,"CALGARY, AB , May 8, 2024 /CNW/ - Tenaz Energy Corp. (""Tenaz"", ""We"", ""Our"", ""Us"" or the ""Company"") (TSX: TNZ) is pleased to announce its financial and operating results for the three months ended March 31 , 2024.

The unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements and related management's discussion and analysis (""MD&A"") are available on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca and on Tenaz's website at www.tenazenergy.com . Select financial and operating information for the three months ended March 31, 2024 appear below and should be read in conjunction with the related financial statements and MD&A.

A webcast presentation to accompany this release is available on Tenaz's website at www.tenazenergy.com .

Production volumes averaged 2,887 boe/d(1) in Q1 2024, down 8% from Q4 2023, due to natural decline in Leduc-Woodbend (""LWB"") wells drilled in 2023 and Netherlands downtime. Production increased 24% over Q1 2023 due to LWB drilling and the acquisition of additional interest in the Netherlands in July 2023 .

Funds flow from operations (""FFO"")(2) for the first quarter was $7.0 million , down 47% from Q4 2023 and 3% from Q1 2023. Lower FFO versus Q4 2023 resulted primarily from lower production levels. In the year-over-year comparison lower prices in Q1 2024 were largely offset by higher production levels.

Q1 2024 capital expenditures (""CAPEX"") were $3.8 million . Most of the CAPEX was in the Netherlands for well stimulation activities. The bulk of our 2024 CAPEX will occur in the second half of the year, with Canadian drilling planned for Q3. Free cash flow(2) in Q1 2024 was $3.2 million .

During Q1, we executed a definitive agreement to acquire a gas plant and proximal oil and gas leasehold assets from a private company for expected consideration at close of $2.8 million , net to Tenaz. We posted cash into escrow to fund this purchase during Q1. The acquisition is conditional on approval of the Alberta Energy Regulator (""AER"") and is expected to close during Q2 2024. After closing, Tenaz will own 100% of the gas plant and 87.5% of the acquired leasehold assets.

The acquisition provides us with ownership and operating control of the gas plant and pipeline infrastructure that processes our gas production from the LWB field. In addition, the plant generates processing revenue from third-party gas volumes, with significant unused capacity to process more gas. The leasehold assets have minor current production, but contain several potential drilling opportunities in the Rex Member and Ellerslie Formation of the Mannville Group.

An independent evaluation by McDaniel and Associates with an effective date of January 1, 2024 has estimated an after-tax NPV10 of $9.3 million for the plant and developed portion of the leasehold. In addition, we have identified multiple undeveloped horizontal drilling opportunities in the Ellerslie Formation providing further upside to the acquisition.

Net loss for Q1 2024 was $0.6 million , as compared to net income of $3.5 million in Q4 2023 and $2.9 million in Q1 2023. Lower income compared to Q4 2023 resulted primarily from lower production, decreased natural gas prices, and higher Netherlands operating expense due to higher field activity.

We ended the quarter with positive adjusted working capital(2) of $48.7 million , little changed from year-end 2023 and up substantially from Q1 2023, primarily due to the Netherlands XTO acquisition in Q3 2023.

Our Normal Course Issuer Bid (""NCIB"") program retired 0.2 million common shares at an average cost of $3.67 per share during Q1 2024. As of the end of April 2024 , we have retired 2.0 million shares at an average cost of $2.77 per share (7.0% of basic common shares) through the NCIB. _________________________________

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE

We are pleased to provide our results for the first quarter of 2024. From an operating perspective, the quarter unfolded largely as we expected, with production 8% lower than Q4 2023, and up 24% from the year-ago quarter. Canadian production was down modestly from Q4 2023, as the four LWB wells we drilled last year continued their strong performance but began to decline during Q1. Netherlands production was also moderately lower than in Q4 2023 due to a combination of planned and unplanned downtime. The production increase over Q1 2023 was driven by Canadian drilling in the second half of 2023 and the second of our two non-operated acquisitions in the Netherlands , which closed in Q3 2023. We generated FFO of $7.0 million in Q1 2024, which was coupled with modest seasonal CAPEX of $3.8 million . As a result, our positive adjusted working capital (negative net debt)3 was little changed at $48.7 million , including the effect of our NCIB program.

Our main focus remains international acquisitions. At the same time, we continue to build on our valuable and growing asset at Leduc-Woodbend in Alberta with small value-adding acquisitions. During Q1, we executed a definitive agreement to purchase the Watelet gas plant, relevant pipelines, and proximal oil and gas properties from a private company, with an effective date of January 1, 2024 . The gas plant is adjacent to our LWB field and processes all of our produced gas. Tenaz' net expected consideration at closing is $2.8 million , with the exact amount depending on final accounting adjustments for interim cash flows and other customary items. The purchase is being funded from our cash balances with $3.45 million placed in escrow for the purchase during Q1 2024. The deposit included our partner's 12.5% share of the purchase price. After closing, Tenaz will own 87.5% of the leasehold assets and 100% of the gas plant. The acquisition is conditional upon approval of the AER, which is expected during Q2 2024.

With its existing processing and compressor configuration, the Watelet plant has a throughput capacity of 7.5 MMcf/d. Current throughput is about 75% of this existing capacity, with Tenaz gas volumes comprising approximately three-quarters of current throughput. Capacity can be expanded to approximately 12 MMcf/d with reactivation of an idle compressor unit. Although our LWB gas production is sweet, the gas plant is licensed for sour service, with a licensed capacity of 20 MMcf/d. We expect to increase throughput of proprietary gas from continued development of the LWB field. In addition, we may expand processing of third-party volumes from other operators in the area. As owner and operator of the Watelet plant and associated pipeline infrastructure, Tenaz will gain control of gas egress and processing for LWB, providing greater security for our long-term development plans, as well as the ability to maximize runtime and operating efficiency of the plant.

The oil and gas properties acquired with the plant include eight proved developed wells with minor production. An independent evaluation by McDaniel and Associates with an effective date of January 1, 2024 has estimated an after-tax NPV10 of $9.3 million for the plant and developed portion of the leasehold. In addition, we have identified multiple undeveloped horizontal drilling opportunities in the Ellerslie Formation providing further upside to the acquisition.

The LWB field continues to produce as expected, with first quarter production 5% lower than in Q4 2023 due to natural declines and the absence of initial flush production from our most recent wells. We expect to commence our 2024 drilling program during Q3, with production contributions from the program expected later in the second half of 2024. While the new wells can be brought online within our overall existing facility capacity, part of our 2024 CAPEX will go toward localized facility modifications to optimize production operations and enhance long-term fluid processing capabilities at LWB.

Our non-operated natural gas asset in the Netherlands also produced at rates consistent with our annual production guidance. Q1 2024 production was 13% lower than Q4 2023, mainly due to a combination of planned and unplanned downtime. During the quarter, operator Neptune Energy Netherlands B.V. (""Neptune"") successfully stimulated two wells (both with 12.3% Tenaz working interest). After stimulation, the wells were brought on production at the beginning of April at gross rates of 2.0 to 2.5 MMcf/d per well.

Neptune and its partners in the L10 field continue to study the technical merits and assess the commercial viability of carbon capture and storage (""CCS"") in the L10 reservoir. If commercially viable, the CCS project has the potential to store 96 million tonnes (""mt"") of CO2 (10.9 mt net to Tenaz) with contemplated annual capacity of up to 5 mt. The proximity of the planned Aramis CCS pipeline to L10 creates an opportunity for collaboration with other potential CCS operators to improve economies of scale for the L10 project.

Despite continued volatility in commodity prices, our realized prices remain at levels that generate free cash and provide strong project returns. Spot price for TTF gas is currently $13.33 /Mcf1 , with a forward price for the remainder of 2024 at $14.31 /Mcf1 and calendar 2025 at $15.29 /Mcf1 .

We have physically fixed approximately 20% of our Q2 and Q3 2024 TTF gas at $14.58 /Mcf. In addition, we have physically fixed approximately 20% of our winter 2024-2025 TTF exposure at a price of $14.00 per Mcf, and collared an additional 20% for the same period within a range of $13.74 to $17.49 per Mcf.

WCS oil is also a significant product for Tenaz. With prompt WTI currently at approximately US$79.25 /bbl1 and WCS differentials contracting to under US$12.00 /bbl during line fill of the TMX pipeline, WCS crude has a current value of approximately $92 /bbl. Our LWB crude sells as WCS without the addition of diluent. Though WTI prices are now off the recent highs of March 2024 , we view the market backdrop for both global crude and local WCS differentials as generally positive. We remain unhedged for our oil exposure.

While Canadian natural gas is a less-significant product in our mix, AECO remains a challenged product with spot AECO at $1.30 /Mcf1 and the balance of 2024 forward at $1.96 /Mcf1 . We have fixed approximately 25% of our winter 2024-2025 AECO exposure at a price of $3.28 /Mcf.

With respect to our organization, we continue to expand our capabilities with the appointment of Brian Giang to the position of Vice-President of Finance, reporting to Bradley Bennett , our CFO. Mr. Giang brings significant international oil and gas accounting and finance experience to our team. He joins Tenaz after thirteen years at Vermilion Energy where he most recently was Director of Finance. Prior to that, Mr. Giang worked for Deloitte Canada for four years, predominantly in audit with an emphasis on oil and gas companies. He has a Bachelor of Commerce from the University of Alberta and holds a Chartered Professional Accountant designation in Alberta . We are excited that Mr. Giang has joined our team and view his appointment as another key step in building the capabilities to support our business model.

As stated in our previous communications, we plan to expand our asset base in our regions of interest by executing additional value-adding transactions. We pursue these M&A investments in an oil and gas asset market that is well-populated with projects that are aligned with our strategy. We are optimistic about our transaction pipeline, as we have been able to maintain and advance those projects which are closest to fruition, while at the same time bringing additional high-quality prospective transactions into our long-term mix.

As we have also stated before, we make no guarantees with respect to timing, but are confident that our business model and transaction pipeline will produce value-adding acquisitions for our existing shareholders. Our ongoing organizational strengthening reflects this confidence and illustrates our readiness to execute such transactions. Finally, the management and Board of Directors of Tenaz remain aligned with the rest of our shareholders through our growing ownership of Tenaz shares.

This press release contains references to measures used in the oil and natural gas industry such as ""funds flow from operations"", ""funds flow from operations per share"", ""funds flow from operations per boe"", ""adjusted working capital (net debt)"", ""free cash flow"", ""midstream income"" and ""operating netback"". The data presented in this press release is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards (""IFRS"") as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board and sometimes referred to in this press release as Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (""GAAP""). These reported non-GAAP measures and their underlying calculations are not necessarily comparable or calculated in an identical manner to a similarly titled measure of other companies where similar terminology is used. Where these measures are used, they should be given careful consideration by the reader.

Funds flow from operations (""FFO"")

Tenaz considers funds flow from operations to be a key measure of performance as it demonstrates the Company's ability to generate the necessary funds for sustaining capital, future growth through capital investment, and settling liabilities. Funds flow from operations is calculated as cash flow from operating activities plus income from associate and before changes in non-cash operating working capital and decommissioning liabilities settled. Funds flow from operations is not intended to represent cash flows from operating activities calculated in accordance with IFRS. A summary of the reconciliation of cash flow from operating activities to funds flow from operations, is set forth below:

Funds flow from operations per share is calculated using basic and diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding in the period.

Funds flow from operations per boe is calculated as funds flow from operations divided by total production sold in the period.

Capital Expenditures

Tenaz considers capital expenditures to be a useful measure of the Company's investment in its existing asset base calculated as the sum of drilling and development costs and exploration and evaluation costs. Exploration and evaluation asset additions (being exploration and evaluation costs) and property, plant and equipment additions (being drilling and development costs) from the consolidated statements of cash flows that is most directly comparable to cash flows used in investing activities. The reconciliation to primary financial statement measures is set forth below:

Tenaz considers free cash flow to be a key measure of performance as it demonstrates the Company's excess funds generated after capital expenditures for potential shareholder returns, acquisitions, or growth in available liquidity. FCF is a non-GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to cash flows used in investing activities and is comprised of funds flow from operations less capital expenditures. A summary of the reconciliation of the measure, is set forth below:

Tenaz considers midstream income an integral part of determining operating netback. Operating netbacks assists management and investors with evaluating operating performance. Tenaz's midstream income consists of the income from its associate, Noordtgastransport B.V. and excludes the amortization of fair value increment of NGT that is included in the equity investment on the balance sheet. Under IFRS, investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Income from associate is Tenaz's share of the investee's net income and comprehensive income. Operating netback is disclosed in the ""Operating Netback"" section below.

Plus: Amortization of fair value increment of NGT

Management views adjusted working capital (net debt) as a key industry benchmark and measure to assess the Company's financial position and liquidity. Adjusted working capital (net debt) is calculated as current assets less current liabilities, excluding the fair value of derivative instruments. Tenaz's adjusted working capital (net debt) as at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 is summarized as follows:

Tenaz calculates operating netback on a dollar and per boe basis, as petroleum and natural gas sales less royalties, operating costs and transportation costs. Operating netback is a key industry benchmark and a measure of performance for Tenaz that provides investors with information that is commonly used by other crude oil and natural gas producers. The measurement on a per boe basis assists management and investors with evaluating operating performance on a comparable basis. Tenaz's operating netback is disclosed in the ""Financial and Operational Summary"" section of this press release.

Barrels of Oil Equivalent

The term barrels of oil equivalent (""boe"") may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. Per boe amounts have been calculated by using the conversion ratio of six thousand cubic feet (6 mcf) of natural gas to one barrel (1 bbl) of crude oil. The boe conversion ratio of 6 mcf to 1 bbl is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. Given that the value ratio based on the current price of crude oil as compared to natural gas is significantly different from the energy equivalent of 6:1, utilizing a conversion on a 6:1 basis may be misleading as an indication of value.

HIGHLIGHTS

First Quarter Operating and Financial Results

Production volumes averaged 2,887 boe/d(1) in Q1 2024, down 8% from Q4 2023, due to natural decline in Leduc-Woodbend (""LWB"") wells drilled in 2023 and Netherlands downtime. Production increased 24% over Q1 2023 due to LWB drilling and the acquisition of additional interest in the Netherlands in July 2023.

Funds flow from operations (""FFO"")(2) for the first quarter was $7.0 million, down 47% from Q4 2023 and 3% from Q1 2023. Lower FFO versus Q4 2023 resulted primarily from lower production levels. In the year-over-year comparison lower prices in Q1 2024 were largely offset by higher production levels.

Q1 2024 capital expenditures (""CAPEX"") were $3.8 million. Most of the CAPEX was in the Netherlands for well stimulation activities. The bulk of our 2024 CAPEX will occur in the second half of the year, with Canadian drilling planned for Q3. Free cash flow(2) in Q1 2024 was $3.2 million.

During Q1, we executed a definitive agreement to acquire a gas plant and proximal oil and gas leasehold assets from a private company for expected consideration at close of $2.8 million, net to Tenaz. We posted cash into escrow to fund this purchase during Q1. The acquisition is conditional on approval of the Alberta Energy Regulator (""AER"") and is expected to close during Q2 2024. After closing, Tenaz will own 100% of the gas plant and 87.5% of the acquired leasehold assets.

The acquisition provides us with ownership and operating control of the gas plant and pipeline infrastructure that processes our gas production from the LWB field. In addition, the plant generates processing revenue from third-party gas volumes, with significant unused capacity to process more gas. The leasehold assets have minor current production, but contain several potential drilling opportunities in the Rex Member and Ellerslie Formation of the Mannville Group.

An independent evaluation by McDaniel and Associates with an effective date of January 1, 2024 has estimated an after-tax NPV10 of $9.3 million for the plant and developed portion of the leasehold. In addition, we have identified multiple undeveloped horizontal drilling opportunities in the Ellerslie Formation providing further upside to the acquisition.

Net loss for Q1 2024 was $0.6 million, as compared to net income of $3.5 million in Q4 2023 and $2.9 million in Q1 2023. Lower income compared to Q4 2023 resulted primarily from lower production, decreased natural gas prices, and higher Netherlands operating expense due to higher field activity.

We ended the quarter with positive adjusted working capital(2) of $48.7 million, little changed from year-end 2023 and up substantially from Q1 2023, primarily due to the Netherlands XTO acquisition in Q3 2023.

Our Normal Course Issuer Bid (""NCIB"") program retired 0.2 million common shares at an average cost of $3.67 per share during Q1 2024. As of the end of April 2024, we have retired 2.0 million shares at an average cost of $2.77 per share (7.0% of basic common shares) through the NCIB.

Budget and Outlook

Annual guidance for capital expenditures remains unchanged at $26 to $28 million, with Canadian drilling activity slated for the second half of the year.Annual production guidance of 2,700 to 2,900 boe/d remains unchanged.

FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL SUMMARY

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE

We are pleased to provide our results for the first quarter of 2024. From an operating perspective, the quarter unfolded largely as we expected, with production 8% lower than Q4 2023, and up 24% from the year-ago quarter. Canadian production was down modestly from Q4 2023, as the four LWB wells we drilled last year continued their strong performance but began to decline during Q1. Netherlands production was also moderately lower than in Q4 2023 due to a combination of planned and unplanned downtime. The production increase over Q1 2023 was driven by Canadian drilling in the second half of 2023 and the second of our two non-operated acquisitions in the Netherlands, which closed in Q3 2023. We generated FFO of $7.0 million in Q1 2024, which was coupled with modest seasonal CAPEX of $3.8 million. As a result, our positive adjusted working capital (negative net debt)3 was little changed at $48.7 million, including the effect of our NCIB program.

Our main focus remains international acquisitions. At the same time, we continue to build on our valuable and growing asset at Leduc-Woodbend in Alberta with small value-adding acquisitions. During Q1, we executed a definitive agreement to purchase the Watelet gas plant, relevant pipelines, and proximal oil and gas properties from a private company, with an effective date of January 1, 2024. The gas plant is adjacent to our LWB field and processes all of our produced gas. Tenaz' net expected consideration at closing is $2.8 million, with the exact amount depending on final accounting adjustments for interim cash flows and other customary items. The purchase is being funded from our cash balances with $3.45 million placed in escrow for the purchase during Q1 2024. The deposit included our partner's 12.5% share of the purchase price. After closing, Tenaz will own 87.5% of the leasehold assets and 100% of the gas plant. The acquisition is conditional upon approval of the AER, which is expected during Q2 2024.

With its existing processing and compressor configuration, the Watelet plant has a throughput capacity of 7.5 MMcf/d. Current throughput is about 75% of this existing capacity, with Tenaz gas volumes comprising approximately three-quarters of current throughput. Capacity can be expanded to approximately 12 MMcf/d with reactivation of an idle compressor unit. Although our LWB gas production is sweet, the gas plant is licensed for sour service, with a licensed capacity of 20 MMcf/d. We expect to increase throughput of proprietary gas from continued development of the LWB field. In addition, we may expand processing of third-party volumes from other operators in the area. As owner and operator of the Watelet plant and associated pipeline infrastructure, Tenaz will gain control of gas egress and processing for LWB, providing greater security for our long-term development plans, as well as the ability to maximize runtime and operating efficiency of the plant.

The oil and gas properties acquired with the plant include eight proved developed wells with minor production. An independent evaluation by McDaniel and Associates with an effective date of January 1, 2024 has estimated an after-tax NPV10 of $9.3 million for the plant and developed portion of the leasehold. In addition, we have identified multiple undeveloped horizontal drilling opportunities in the Ellerslie Formation providing further upside to the acquisition.

The LWB field continues to produce as expected, with first quarter production 5% lower than in Q4 2023 due to natural declines and the absence of initial flush production from our most recent wells. We expect to commence our 2024 drilling program during Q3, with production contributions from the program expected later in the second half of 2024. While the new wells can be brought online within our overall existing facility capacity, part of our 2024 CAPEX will go toward localized facility modifications to optimize production operations and enhance long-term fluid processing capabilities at LWB.

Our non-operated natural gas asset in the Netherlands also produced at rates consistent with our annual production guidance. Q1 2024 production was 13% lower than Q4 2023, mainly due to a combination of planned and unplanned downtime. During the quarter, operator Neptune Energy Netherlands B.V. (""Neptune"") successfully stimulated two wells (both with 12.3% Tenaz working interest). After stimulation, the wells were brought on production at the beginning of April at gross rates of 2.0 to 2.5 MMcf/d per well.

Neptune and its partners in the L10 field continue to study the technical merits and assess the commercial viability of carbon capture and storage (""CCS"") in the L10 reservoir. If commercially viable, the CCS project has the potential to store 96 million tonnes (""mt"") of CO2 (10.9 mt net to Tenaz) with contemplated annual capacity of up to 5 mt. The proximity of the planned Aramis CCS pipeline to L10 creates an opportunity for collaboration with other potential CCS operators to improve economies of scale for the L10 project.

Despite continued volatility in commodity prices, our realized prices remain at levels that generate free cash and provide strong project returns. Spot price for TTF gas is currently $13.33/Mcf1, with a forward price for the remainder of 2024 at $14.31/Mcf1 and calendar 2025 at $15.29/Mcf1.

We have physically fixed approximately 20% of our Q2 and Q3 2024 TTF gas at $14.58/Mcf. In addition, we have physically fixed approximately 20% of our winter 2024-2025 TTF exposure at a price of $14.00 per Mcf, and collared an additional 20% for the same period within a range of $13.74 to $17.49 per Mcf.

WCS oil is also a significant product for Tenaz. With prompt WTI currently at approximately US$79.25/bbl1 and WCS differentials contracting to under US$12.00/bbl during line fill of the TMX pipeline, WCS crude has a current value of approximately $92/bbl. Our LWB crude sells as WCS without the addition of diluent. Though WTI prices are now off the recent highs of March 2024, we view the market backdrop for both global crude and local WCS differentials as generally positive. We remain unhedged for our oil exposure.

While Canadian natural gas is a less-significant product in our mix, AECO remains a challenged product with spot AECO at $1.30/Mcf1 and the balance of 2024 forward at $1.96/Mcf1. We have fixed approximately 25% of our winter 2024-2025 AECO exposure at a price of $3.28/Mcf.

With respect to our organization, we continue to expand our capabilities with the appointment of Brian Giang to the position of Vice-President of Finance, reporting to Bradley Bennett, our CFO. Mr. Giang brings significant international oil and gas accounting and finance experience to our team. He joins Tenaz after thirteen years at Vermilion Energy where he most recently was Director of Finance. Prior to that, Mr. Giang worked for Deloitte Canada for four years, predominantly in audit with an emphasis on oil and gas companies. He has a Bachelor of Commerce from the University of Alberta and holds a Chartered Professional Accountant designation in Alberta. We are excited that Mr. Giang has joined our team and view his appointment as another key step in building the capabilities to support our business model.

As stated in our previous communications, we plan to expand our asset base in our regions of interest by executing additional value-adding transactions. We pursue these M&A investments in an oil and gas asset market that is well-populated with projects that are aligned with our strategy. We are optimistic about our transaction pipeline, as we have been able to maintain and advance those projects which are closest to fruition, while at the same time bringing additional high-quality prospective transactions into our long-term mix.

As we have also stated before, we make no guarantees with respect to timing, but are confident that our business model and transaction pipeline will produce value-adding acquisitions for our existing shareholders. Our ongoing organizational strengthening reflects this confidence and illustrates our readiness to execute such transactions. Finally, the management and Board of Directors of Tenaz remain aligned with the rest of our shareholders through our growing ownership of Tenaz shares.

ADVISORIES

Non‐GAAP and Other Financial Measures

This press release contains references to measures used in the oil and natural gas industry such as ""funds flow from operations"", ""funds flow from operations per share"", ""funds flow from operations per boe"", ""adjusted working capital (net debt)"", ""free cash flow"", ""midstream income"" and ""operating netback"". The data presented in this press release is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards (""IFRS"") as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board and sometimes referred to in this press release as Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (""GAAP""). These reported non-GAAP measures and their underlying calculations are not necessarily comparable or calculated in an identical manner to a similarly titled measure of other companies where similar terminology is used. Where these measures are used, they should be given careful consideration by the reader.

Funds flow from operations (""FFO"")

Tenaz considers funds flow from operations to be a key measure of performance as it demonstrates the Company's ability to generate the necessary funds for sustaining capital, future growth through capital investment, and settling liabilities. Funds flow from operations is calculated as cash flow from operating activities plus income from associate and before changes in non-cash operating working capital and decommissioning liabilities settled. Funds flow from operations is not intended to represent cash flows from operating activities calculated in accordance with IFRS. A summary of the reconciliation of cash flow from operating activities to funds flow from operations, is set forth below:

Funds flow from operations per share is calculated using basic and diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding in the period.

Funds flow from operations per boe is calculated as funds flow from operations divided by total production sold in the period.

Capital Expenditures

Tenaz considers capital expenditures to be a useful measure of the Company's investment in its existing asset base calculated as the sum of drilling and development costs and exploration and evaluation costs. Exploration and evaluation asset additions (being exploration and evaluation costs) and property, plant and equipment additions (being drilling and development costs) from the consolidated statements of cash flows that is most directly comparable to cash flows used in investing activities. The reconciliation to primary financial statement measures is set forth below:

Free Cash Flow (""FCF"")

Tenaz considers free cash flow to be a key measure of performance as it demonstrates the Company's excess funds generated after capital expenditures for potential shareholder returns, acquisitions, or growth in available liquidity. FCF is a non-GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to cash flows used in investing activities and is comprised of funds flow from operations less capital expenditures. A summary of the reconciliation of the measure, is set forth below:

Midstream Income

Tenaz considers midstream income an integral part of determining operating netback. Operating netbacks assists management and investors with evaluating operating performance. Tenaz's midstream income consists of the income from its associate, Noordtgastransport B.V. and excludes the amortization of fair value increment of NGT that is included in the equity investment on the balance sheet. Under IFRS, investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Income from associate is Tenaz's share of the investee's net income and comprehensive income. Operating netback is disclosed in the ""Operating Netback"" section below.

Adjusted working capital (net debt)

Management views adjusted working capital (net debt) as a key industry benchmark and measure to assess the Company's financial position and liquidity. Adjusted working capital (net debt) is calculated as current assets less current liabilities, excluding the fair value of derivative instruments. Tenaz's adjusted working capital (net debt) as at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 is summarized as follows:

Operating Netback

Tenaz calculates operating netback on a dollar and per boe basis, as petroleum and natural gas sales less royalties, operating costs and transportation costs. Operating netback is a key industry benchmark and a measure of performance for Tenaz that provides investors with information that is commonly used by other crude oil and natural gas producers. The measurement on a per boe basis assists management and investors with evaluating operating performance on a comparable basis. Tenaz's operating netback is disclosed in the ""Financial and Operational Summary"" section of this press release.

Barrels of Oil Equivalent

The term barrels of oil equivalent (""boe"") may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. Per boe amounts have been calculated by using the conversion ratio of six thousand cubic feet (6 mcf) of natural gas to one barrel (1 bbl) of crude oil. The boe conversion ratio of 6 mcf to 1 bbl is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead.

LNG imports into Northwest Europe -- France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and the UK -- totaled 5.21 million mt in April, down 27.6% year on year, but up 7% month on month, according to S&P Global Commodity Insights data May 3.

France continued to hold the top spot in terms of destination markets for the third consecutive month, accounting for 40% of the total imports, followed by the Netherlands (30%) and Belgium (13%).

On the supply side, the US accounted for 57% of total imports into Northwest Europe, followed by Russia (17%) and Algeria (11%).

The year-on-year decline was spearheaded by the UK and Belgium, down 83% and 37% respectively, while other countries saw an average growth of 6.3%.

The region has been clouded by low demand, with higher-than-average gas inventory levels adding to the bearishness. Moreover, over April the region also had to compete with demand from Asia and other atypical demand regions like Egypt and Latin America, which swung cargoes away from Northwest Europe.

""It seems that all of Europe is short,"" an Atlantic-based trader said.

Dutch imports highest since 2012

Netherlands imported 1.55 million mt LNG in April, making it the strongest April for the country since 2012. These levels were rangebound year on year but up 37% month on month.

The robustness of imports into Netherlands comes on account of the competitiveness that the gas hub has displayed versus other premium markets in Europe, such as Italy and the Baltics.

""Netherlands can compete with the other premium markets like Italy, Finland or Poland,"" a trader said. ""But other gas hubs are priced out, even France and Spain.""

The region was particularly well supported in the second half of April when colder temperatures pushed the EU into net withdrawals and enabled the Netherlands to attract more cargoes.

""[The Netherlands] didn't receive gas from [the Norwegian Continental Shelf] for five days, which coincided with the cold snap in the market, so the TTF reacted and pulled cargoes into the region and reduced pipeline exports to other markets,"" David Lewis, LNG analyst at S&P Global said.

UK April imports hit 16-year low

The UK imported 392,000 mt of LNG in April, the lowest level recorded for April since 2008, when imports amounted to 56,000 mt. Imports were down 82% year on year and 22% month on month.

The low appetite of LNG into UK is a result of the weakness in the gas hub, making it uneconomical for the country to rely on LNG.

""For some companies the last actual import into the UK was last October,"" the second trader said. ""The NBP/TTF spread kept dropping and there was no demand, so all the cargoes are diverted away.""

The variable cost in the UK is also relatively higher, the trader said.

The low imports into the UK could be here to stay while providing more leeway to other areas of Northwest Europe, according to S&P Global analysts.

Exports from the UK along the IUK and BBL pipeline dropped 90% year on year to 3.4 MMcm/d in the first four months of 2024, Lewis said. ""France has overtaken the UK to become the preferred destination for LNG to enter the western Europe network,"" he said. ""The tighter global LNG market combined with expanded regasification capacity on the continent has reduced the role of the UK and could impact LNG demand into the UK throughout the summer months.""

Rest of Northwest Europe

Belgian imports in April also dropped sharply, falling 28% month on month and 37% year on year to 694,000 mt.

""Belgium also has very low demand because ZTP doesn't make sense,"" the second trader said.
