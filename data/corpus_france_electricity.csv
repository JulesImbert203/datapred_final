Editorial credit: Wafa

In the early morning of Friday 12 April, an incident occurred in the occupied West Bank. Benjamin Achimeir, a 14-year-old Israeli teenager, went missing while tending to a flock of sheep near his family's illegal settlement, the 2015-established ""Malachei Hashalom"". [1]

The disappearance of the boy, which was initially suspected to be a kidnapping, prompted an extensive search involving Israeli authorities, the military, and numerous settlers.

However, it took 24 hours before Achimeir's body was discovered near the ""outpost"", signalling the start of a sequence of events that would lead to a deadly escalation of violence. [2]

WhatsApp used to co-ordinate ""collective punishment""

Israeli authorities state that Achimeir was killed on that particular morning, although it took some time for his body to be found. They inaccurately concluded that he was killed in a ""terror attack"". [1]

Simultaneously, disturbing messages started circulating within settler WhatsApp groups, encouraging retaliatory attacks on neighbouring Palestinian villages.

These messages, originating from individuals with extreme views, promoted activities such as obstructing villages, conducting house-to-house searches, and imposing collective penalties on Palestinians.

One such message, attributed to the terrorist Elisha Yered -- a former spokesman for MP Limor Son Har-Melech and extreme settler suspected in the murder of a Palestinian man last August -- called for ""crowning"" nearby Palestinian villages. [3]

In addition, he urged fellow occupiers to conduct ""home to home searches,"" and impose ""collective punishment against the murderous Arab population."" [3]

This message contained a list of meeting points, some of which were marked with fire emojis, indicating potential targets for violence. [4]

Achimeir's death taken as basis for mass killings and destruction

The response to Achimeir's death was immediate and brutal.

In the following days, settlers carried out shooting and arson attacks against Palestinian neighbourhoods. Homes were set ablaze, cars were set on fire, and lives were lost.

According to Palestinian officials and witnesses, the attacks were highly organised and targeted specific individuals and groups near the illegal settler community.

In al-Mughayyir village, which is close to Achimeir's ""outpost"", residents said they were pelted with stones, burned cars, and shot at by armed settlers as they tried to defend their homes. [3]

A BBC report noted that construction worker Abdellatif Abu Aliya's house was stormed by settlers. They damaged his property and killed his cousin, Jihad.

''The settlers cut the electricity to the house and drained the property's water tanks by shooting them.

""Jihad, who had come to defend the house, threw rocks back from the roof towards the settlers. But the settlers returned gunfire, killing Jihad with a shot to the head.'' [3]

In other villages, similar scenes played out, with innocent Palestinian families caught in the middle of settler reprisals.

50-year-old Shehade Abu Rasheed's family suffered attacks on their home. His daughter, Noor, was shot twice in the legs while seeking refuge with her wounded mother. [3]

Another young villager, 17-year-old Yaqoub Nasan, was shot multiple times in the neck while he was unarmed. [3]

According to the Palestinian Health Ministry, 32 people in al-Mughayyir were wounded by gunfire. By Saturday afternoon, after the body of Achimeir was discovered, two more Palestinians had been killed. In property damage, more than 20 houses and 100 vehicles had been set ablaze. [3]

Zionist forces aided settler attacks with protection, intelligence, and active support

In the wake of the violence, lives were lost, houses were destroyed, and entire communities were traumatised.

At the same time, the Israeli regime came under criticism for its failure to prevent the violence and to hold the perpetrators of the attacks accountable. In addition, some of the attacks were unsurprisingly carried out by soldiers of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). [5]

According to one family's video, armed settlers were seen walking around their property before the attack began. At least two of them were wearing what appear to be IDF uniforms.

Abu Aliya said,

""They worked in groups and were following orders from two men, one in uniform and one not. They covered their faces, then one group came forward to throw rocks and set fire to the cars.

""Another group stood at the edge of the property with pistols. Behind them was a group with M16s who fired at the house from the olive groves."" [3]

The involvement of soldiers in some of the attacks, which were witnessed by the villagers and recorded on video, has added to the complexity of the situation.

But as the dust begins to settle in the wake of these terrible events, it is essential that the voices of the victims must not be silenced.

The Palestinian villagers who have suffered the most from settler violence deserve recognition and assistance as they begin to rebuild their lives after what they have endured.

Similarly, justice and human rights advocates who are fighting for peace and reconciliation must continue to stand up against Israel's terrorism against the Palestinian people.

Analysis ANALYSIS Shaheer Choudhury Head of Editorial

Pay attention to the entire Palestinian cause!

Over the past (nearly) eight months, the world has taken a painstaking amount of time to recognise the true situation in the Gaza Strip.

In that time, the Zionist entity has been unleashing untold mayhem upon the Palestinians, with tens of thousands of women and children killed under the pretext of eliminating Hamas.

Arguably, this is one of the most foolish positions that an authoritarian, oppressive, occupying power has ever held in recent history. One cannot simply eradicate the hearts and minds that yearn to resist occupation and that understand defeat is not in the least in the loss of people or property.

Imagine if the situation was reversed

Our role as Muslims in the West must be to continue to speak out about the situation of the whole of Palestine, all of the occupied territories, all of those who we know to be languishing behind bars, and all of those who have gone missing.

Illegal settlers -- such as those who responded with barbarism to the death of one boy -- question why Palestinian resistance fighters are determined to protect their homeland, but they will never see how the situation is many times worse for them.

It is not right that Benjamin Achimeir has been killed -- according to Israeli sources, by a Palestinian hand -- but this level of response is a microcosm of what the Zionist regime has been doing in Gaza.

And this is while vast parts of Palestine are illegally occupied, have been occupied, and more areas are being stolen as we speak. The international community recognises the illegality, and yet barely anything is mentioned about such cases.

Meanwhile, Blue Capsule has signed a partnership agreement with the French Alternative Energies & Atomic Energy Commission, from which it was spun off, for the development of its small modular reactor.

Thorizon - a spin-off from NRG, which operates the High Flux Reactor in Petten - is developing a 250 MWt/100 MWe molten salt reactor (MSR), targeted at large industrial customers and utilities. Thorizon aims to construct a pilot reactor system before 2035.

MSRs use molten fluoride salts as primary coolant, at low pressure. They may operate with epithermal or fast neutron spectrums, and with a variety of fuels. Much of the interest today in reviving the MSR concept relates to using thorium (to breed fissile uranium-233), where an initial source of fissile material such as plutonium-239 needs to be provided. There are a number of different MSR design concepts, and a number of interesting challenges in the commercialisation of many, especially with thorium.

The molten salt fuel adopted by Thorizon uses a combination of long-lived elements from reprocessed used nuclear fuel and thorium. The reactor will be able to recycle long-lived waste from existing nuclear facilities. The Thorizon One concept is unique in that the core is composed of a set of cartridges that is replaced every five to ten years. This, the company says, overcomes two molten salt design obstacles: material corrosion and handling of used fuel volumes.

Under the new agreement, EDF R&D will review Thorizon's neutronic core calculations and conduct scenario analyses to determine how the Thorizon One could help to close the fuel cycle in the European reactor fleet.

Thorizon said it will ""benefit from EDF's expertise as the French leader in electricity production, and in particular from the recognised skills of its R&D researchers"".

""The R&D team covers all disciplines from neutronics and fuel to safety and construction,"" said Bernard Salha, EDF R&D Director and EDF Group Chief Technical Officer. ""We are actively supporting several start-ups in the France 2030 programme. The cartridge-based approach of Thorizon is interesting and promising.""

""It is a pleasure to work with the EDF team which has more experience in nuclear than any company across the globe,"" added Thorizon CEO Kiki Lauwers. ""Thanks to EDF R&D, start-ups like us benefit from access to unique industry experts that can very quickly spot the strengths and areas for improvements in our design. We hope we can continue to work with the EDF R&D team on the realisation of our technology in the future. We believe all solutions are needed to empower the energy transition and the Thorizon One can be a great compliment to the existing and planned nuclear fleet.""

Horizon says its ambition is to develop an MSR that ""can be realised rapidly and smartly, is 'walk-away' safe, and takes a first step towards circularity by using long-lived nuclear waste as a fuel source"". The company aims to build a non-nuclear molten salt demonstrator in the short-term and finalise the detailed design to start building a first-of-a-kind Thorizon One reactor by 2030.

Decarbonising industry

Blue Capsule - a spin-off from France's Alternative Energies & Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) - has announced the signing of a partnership agreement with the CEA for the development of its small modular reactor (SMR) that will supply heat and power to industry.

Aix-en-Provence-based Blue Capsule is developing a sodium-cooled, high-temperature SMR which can provide 150 MW of heat at 700°C, along with high-temperature steam and electricity. The company aims to decarbonise industrial sites used for ammonia and soda ash production, with subterranean capsules co-located onsite, close to demand.

Under the new agreement - with financial support from French public investment bank Bpifrance - CEA's support for Blue Capsule will extend to fields such as equipment and components, materials, calculation codes and TRISO-based fuel.

""France's leadership in the fields of nuclear energy and low-carbon solutions is creating big opportunities for industry right across the country,"" said Blue Capsule's reactor architect Domnin Erard. ""And for Blue Capsule, collaboration with the French nuclear sector is front and centre of our strategy.

""This vital partnership with the CEA means that Blue Capsule benefits from world-class expertise across the board. It lays the foundations for our future industrial cooperation with the French nuclear supply chain, for manufacturing and assembling Blue Capsule units.

""It all comes down to cutting industrial CO2 emissions and of course the re-industrialisation of communities in France and beyond. For our part, we'll do everything we can to help achieve that objective.""

Blue Capsule is planning to build a proof-of-concept sodium loop and a non-nuclear prototype by 2030. The company's first-of-a-kind SMR is scheduled for construction by 2035 and is set to be built in France.",world-nuclear-news.org,news,World Nuclear News (WNN),,0.1372549019607843,454689557,1,,

Chinese universities have been gaining popularity among African students thanks to the offering of scholarships as well as China's growing reputation in technology and development.30 Therefore, as Figure 4 shows, China is the second-most popular destination for Africans seeking higher education abroad, with roughly 81,600 students; France is the most popular (126,300 students) and the United States is the third-most popular (48,300 students). However, China's immigration policy is much tighter than the policies in European and North American countries. Therefore, most Africans studying in China tend to return home upon the completion of their studies instead of staying abroad, significantly reducing the prospects of ""brain drain"" for Africa.

China-Africa educational institutions are also maintaining strong collaboration. Sixty-one Confucius Institutes and forty-eight programs have been established in forty-eight African countries as of 2021. Additionally, China has supported over thirty African universities to set up departments or programs to study Chinese language. Luban Workshops in Djibouti, Egypt, Kenya, and South Africa have provided Chinese-style vocational training to African technicians, even when international travel has been restricted due to the COVID pandemic. Conversely, universities in China have added new courses for African languages, such as Amharic, Malagasy, and Zulu. Furthermore, the Plan for China-Africa Cooperation on Talent Development, announced in August 2023, has pledged to train 500 principals and high-calibre teachers of vocational colleges every year, as well as 10,000 technical personnel with both Chinese language and vocational skills for Africa. The number of cooperating Chinese and African universities will be increased from 20+20 to 50+50. However, there are occasionally reports about African students' complaints related to Chinese teachers' English proficiency, internship and employment opportunities, as well as administrative services. If the education quality does not improve, the quantitative growth in cooperating universities may not be sustainable.

Media and cultural exchanges between African countries and China have increased since the start of the pandemic, largely due to the use of digital technologies. The Chinese cable television operator StarTimes provided 13 million subscribers in Africa with programs in eleven languages as of November 2021. TikTok, cell phone maker Transsion, and other Chinese internet companies greatly boost the formation of Africa's mobile media sphere. Chinese and African entertainment industries have been deepening their collaboration as well, with the joint production and broadcasting of movies and television series. Two notable series, Welcome to Milele Village (2023) and Ebola Fighters (2021), depicted Chinese medical teams in Africa and gained popularity among Chinese audiences. Soccer players from Angola, Cameroon, Ghana, and Nigeria have joined clubs in China's Premier league and A-level league. Chinese tourists are now also interested in taking historical tours and immersing themselves in African culture, as well as exploring the country's natural landscape. A number of African countries, including most recently Egypt, Mauritius, Morocco, and Tunisia, have been providing visa-free or visa-on-arrival entries to Chinese visitors to foster tourism. Echoing the movement, China's Ministry of Culture and Tourism has listed thirty-four African countries as destinations for group tours.

Conclusion

China's economic growth is slowing from the double digits of previous decades as policymakers steer the economy toward a more high-tech, consumption-oriented, and environmentally sustainable growth model with reduced exposure to geopolitical shocks. And this economic transition will increasingly have implications for China's international economic relations with the rest of the world. As discussed above, across the five domains of China's economic engagement with Africa -- trade, investment, fiscal stabilization, RMB internationalization, and people-to-people ties -- both strong continuities and changes are evident. But this engagement is not happening in a vacuum. Policy directions within African countries and third parties such as the United States will greatly shape how these changes in the China-Africa relationship continue to unfold.

The changing patterns of trade between African countries and China will be shaped by policies in both advanced economies and African countries themselves. Rising barriers to market access in advanced economies are likely to push African countries further into the embrace of China. Between 2021 and 2024, the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden has suspended a record eight African countries from the U.S. trade preference program, the African Growth and Opportunity Act. Meanwhile, the European Union's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, which began its initial transitional phase in October 2023, could make it even more difficult for African manufacturers to export to the European market and reduce the continent's GDP by up to $25 billion. Although individual European countries like France seek to expand their trade with Anglophone African countries, for instance, and the United Kingdom recently signed a trade deal with Kenya, this may not be sufficient to offset the wide-ranging impacts of market-restricting policies like the CBAM. Furthermore, growing China-Africa trade volumes will continue to be characterized by trade deficits. To address these deficits, African countries need to make a concerted effort to diversify their exports to China. Important steps to take include implementing the AfCFTA to create regional value chains, utilizing trade preference programs particularly the green lanes initiative -- as Kenya and Namibia are doing -- to export semi-processed agriculture produce to China and emulating the Indonesian approach to pressure Chinese companies to invest in the refining and processing of minerals in African countries.

As Chinese investments in Africa shift from infrastructure-oriented projects toward industrialization-oriented projects, African policy responses and the ability of Western countries to fill infrastructure financing gaps will be crucial. Chinese FDI flows for processing and manufacturing in various sectors -- whether related to agriculture, minerals and metals, construction material, or apparel -- are contingent on requirements in the domestic business environment that are within the remit of African governments. Basic requirements include the availability of affordable and reliable electricity, good transportation networks, skilled local workers, security, and the ability to compel Chinese companies to enter into joint ventures with local African firms for technology transfer. Whether the United States and its allies in Europe and Japan can step into the space being vacated by Chinese policy banks to provide infrastructure financing in Africa is an open question. Implementation of the Lobito Corridor project, a signature initiative of the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII), will test the G7's commitment to the scaling up of infrastructure investments in Africa. Whether the United States continues to prioritize the PGII by ensuring the program's continuity or incorporating new infrastructure projects remains to be seen -- especially if a new U.S. administration comes into office in January 2025.

Expansion of China's rescue-lending efforts and internationalization of the RMB in Africa are significantly dependent on African countries' own demand for and uptake of these initiatives. Will a growing number of African countries look to China, as an alternative to the IMF, for emergency liquidity support as their ability to finance imports diminish due to fiscal crises? Will there be a growing appetite among African countries for more central bank currency swap lines with the PBOC, and will there be increased drawdowns of yuan reserves? As African countries struggle to find scarce foreign exchange resources to settle and invoice their trade, will they follow the trend among some Asian countries in using the RMB for their bilateral trade with China? The answer to these questions may lie largely in whether the United States and its allies in Europe will provide sufficient measures to support African countries to overcome the latest bout of debt distress and fiscal crises.

Finally, China's loosening of pandemic-era travel restrictions and the phenomenon of digitalization will accelerate the increasing trend of people-to-people exchanges with African countries in higher education, media, and culture. Developments in China's immigration policy will be important to track as it begins to roll out visa-free travel for a select number of European and Asian countries. The hardening of visa regimes in Canada, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the United States, and other Western countries will also be important to monitor, as it could affect these countries' historically robust people-to-people exchanges with African countries.

Chinese universities have been gaining popularity among African students thanks to the offering of scholarships as well as China's growing reputation in technology and development.30 Therefore, as Figure 4 shows, China is the second-most popular destination for Africans seeking higher education abroad, with roughly 81,600 students; France is the most popular (126,300 students) and the United States is the third-most popular (48,300 students). However, China's immigration policy is much tighter than the policies in European and North American countries. Therefore, most Africans studying in China tend to return home upon the completion of their studies instead of staying abroad, significantly reducing the prospects of ""brain drain"" for Africa.

China-Africa educational institutions are also maintaining strong collaboration. Sixty-one Confucius Institutes and forty-eight programs have been established in forty-eight African countries as of 2021. Additionally, China has supported over thirty African universities to set up departments or programs to study Chinese language. Luban Workshops in Djibouti, Egypt, Kenya, and South Africa have provided Chinese-style vocational training to African technicians, even when international travel has been restricted due to the COVID pandemic. Conversely, universities in China have added new courses for African languages, such as Amharic, Malagasy, and Zulu. Furthermore, the Plan for China-Africa Cooperation on Talent Development, announced in August 2023, has pledged to train 500 principals and high-calibre teachers of vocational colleges every year, as well as 10,000 technical personnel with both Chinese language and vocational skills for Africa. The number of cooperating Chinese and African universities will be increased from 20+20 to 50+50. However, there are occasionally reports about African students' complaints related to Chinese teachers' English proficiency, internship and employment opportunities, as well as administrative services. If the education quality does not improve, the quantitative growth in cooperating universities may not be sustainable.

Media and cultural exchanges between African countries and China have increased since the start of the pandemic, largely due to the use of digital technologies. The Chinese cable television operator StarTimes provided 13 million subscribers in Africa with programs in eleven languages as of November 2021. TikTok, cell phone maker Transsion, and other Chinese internet companies greatly boost the formation of Africa's mobile media sphere. Chinese and African entertainment industries have been deepening their collaboration as well, with the joint production and broadcasting of movies and television series. Two notable series, Welcome to Milele Village (2023) and Ebola Fighters (2021), depicted Chinese medical teams in Africa and gained popularity among Chinese audiences. Soccer players from Angola, Cameroon, Ghana, and Nigeria have joined clubs in China's Premier league and A-level league. Chinese tourists are now also interested in taking historical tours and immersing themselves in African culture, as well as exploring the country's natural landscape. A number of African countries, including most recently Egypt, Mauritius, Morocco, and Tunisia, have been providing visa-free or visa-on-arrival entries to Chinese visitors to foster tourism. Echoing the movement, China's Ministry of Culture and Tourism has listed thirty-four African countries as destinations for group tours.

Conclusion

China's economic growth is slowing from the double digits of previous decades as policymakers steer the economy toward a more high-tech, consumption-oriented, and environmentally sustainable growth model with reduced exposure to geopolitical shocks. And this economic transition will increasingly have implications for China's international economic relations with the rest of the world. As discussed above, across the five domains of China's economic engagement with Africa -- trade, investment, fiscal stabilization, RMB internationalization, and people-to-people ties -- both strong continuities and changes are evident. But this engagement is not happening in a vacuum. Policy directions within African countries and third parties such as the United States will greatly shape how these changes in the China-Africa relationship continue to unfold.

The changing patterns of trade between African countries and China will be shaped by policies in both advanced economies and African countries themselves. Rising barriers to market access in advanced economies are likely to push African countries further into the embrace of China. Between 2021 and 2024, the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden has suspended a record eight African countries from the U.S. trade preference program, the African Growth and Opportunity Act. Meanwhile, the European Union's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, which began its initial transitional phase in October 2023, could make it even more difficult for African manufacturers to export to the European market and reduce the continent's GDP by up to $25 billion. Although individual European countries like France seek to expand their trade with Anglophone African countries, for instance, and the United Kingdom recently signed a trade deal with Kenya, this may not be sufficient to offset the wide-ranging impacts of market-restricting policies like the CBAM. Furthermore, growing China-Africa trade volumes will continue to be characterized by trade deficits. To address these deficits, African countries need to make a concerted effort to diversify their exports to China. Important steps to take include implementing the AfCFTA to create regional value chains, utilizing trade preference programs particularly the green lanes initiative -- as Kenya and Namibia are doing -- to export semi-processed agriculture produce to China and emulating the Indonesian approach to pressure Chinese companies to invest in the refining and processing of minerals in African countries.

As Chinese investments in Africa shift from infrastructure-oriented projects toward industrialization-oriented projects, African policy responses and the ability of Western countries to fill infrastructure financing gaps will be crucial. Chinese FDI flows for processing and manufacturing in various sectors -- whether related to agriculture, minerals and metals, construction material, or apparel -- are contingent on requirements in the domestic business environment that are within the remit of African governments. Basic requirements include the availability of affordable and reliable electricity, good transportation networks, skilled local workers, security, and the ability to compel Chinese companies to enter into joint ventures with local African firms for technology transfer. Whether the United States and its allies in Europe and Japan can step into the space being vacated by Chinese policy banks to provide infrastructure financing in Africa is an open question. Implementation of the Lobito Corridor project, a signature initiative of the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII), will test the G7's commitment to the scaling up of infrastructure investments in Africa. Whether the United States continues to prioritize the PGII by ensuring the program's continuity or incorporating new infrastructure projects remains to be seen -- especially if a new U.S. administration comes into office in January 2025.

Expansion of China's rescue-lending efforts and internationalization of the RMB in Africa are significantly dependent on African countries' own demand for and uptake of these initiatives. Will a growing number of African countries look to China, as an alternative to the IMF, for emergency liquidity support as their ability to finance imports diminish due to fiscal crises? Will there be a growing appetite among African countries for more central bank currency swap lines with the PBOC, and will there be increased drawdowns of yuan reserves? As African countries struggle to find scarce foreign exchange resources to settle and invoice their trade, will they follow the trend among some Asian countries in using the RMB for their bilateral trade with China? The answer to these questions may lie largely in whether the United States and its allies in Europe will provide sufficient measures to support African countries to overcome the latest bout of debt distress and fiscal crises.

Finally, China's loosening of pandemic-era travel restrictions and the phenomenon of digitalization will accelerate the increasing trend of people-to-people exchanges with African countries in higher education, media, and culture. Developments in China's immigration policy will be important to track as it begins to roll out visa-free travel for a select number of European and Asian countries. The hardening of visa regimes in Canada, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the United States, and other Western countries will also be important to monitor, as it could affect these countries' historically robust people-to-people exchanges with African countries.

Whether the United States continues to prioritize the PGII by ensuring the program's continuity or incorporating new infrastructure projects remains to be seen -- especially if a new U.S. administration comes into office in January 2025.

Expansion of China's rescue-lending efforts and internationalization of the RMB in Africa are significantly dependent on African countries' own demand for and uptake of these initiatives. Will a growing number of African countries look to China, as an alternative to the IMF, for emergency liquidity support as their ability to finance imports diminish due to fiscal crises? Will there be a growing appetite among African countries for more central bank currency swap lines with the PBOC, and will there be increased drawdowns of yuan reserves? As African countries struggle to find scarce foreign exchange resources to settle and invoice their trade, will they follow the trend among some Asian countries in using the RMB for their bilateral trade with China? The answer to these questions may lie largely in whether the United States and its allies in Europe will provide sufficient measures to support African countries to overcome the latest bout of debt distress and fiscal crises.

Finally, China's loosening of pandemic-era travel restrictions and the phenomenon of digitalization will accelerate the increasing trend of people-to-people exchanges with African countries in higher education, media, and culture. Developments in China's immigration policy will be important to track as it begins to roll out visa-free travel for a select number of European and Asian countries. The hardening of visa regimes in Canada, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the United States, and other Western countries will also be important to monitor, as it could affect these countries' historically robust people-to-people exchanges with African countries.

Editorial credit: Wafa

In the early morning of Friday 12 April, an incident occurred in the occupied West Bank. Benjamin Achimeir, a 14-year-old Israeli teenager, went missing while tending to a flock of sheep near his family's illegal settlement, the 2015-established ""Malachei Hashalom"". [1]

ContentsWhatsApp used to co-ordinate ""collective punishment""Achimeir's death taken as basis for mass killings and destructionZionist forces aided settler attacks with protection, intelligence, and active supportAnalysisAlso read

The disappearance of the boy, which was initially suspected to be a kidnapping, prompted an extensive search involving Israeli authorities, the military, and numerous settlers.

However, it took 24 hours before Achimeir's body was discovered near the ""outpost"", signalling the start of a sequence of events that would lead to a deadly escalation of violence. [2]

WhatsApp used to co-ordinate ""collective punishment""

Israeli authorities state that Achimeir was killed on that particular morning, although it took some time for his body to be found. They inaccurately concluded that he was killed in a ""terror attack"". [1]

Simultaneously, disturbing messages started circulating within settler WhatsApp groups, encouraging retaliatory attacks on neighbouring Palestinian villages.

These messages, originating from individuals with extreme views, promoted activities such as obstructing villages, conducting house-to-house searches, and imposing collective penalties on Palestinians.

One such message, attributed to the terrorist Elisha Yered -- a former spokesman for MP Limor Son Har-Melech and extreme settler suspected in the murder of a Palestinian man last August -- called for ""crowning"" nearby Palestinian villages. [3]

In addition, he urged fellow occupiers to conduct ""home to home searches,"" and impose ""collective punishment against the murderous Arab population."" [3]

This message contained a list of meeting points, some of which were marked with fire emojis, indicating potential targets for violence. [4]

Achimeir's death taken as basis for mass killings and destruction

The response to Achimeir's death was immediate and brutal.

In the following days, settlers carried out shooting and arson attacks against Palestinian neighbourhoods. Homes were set ablaze, cars were set on fire, and lives were lost.

According to Palestinian officials and witnesses, the attacks were highly organised and targeted specific individuals and groups near the illegal settler community.

In al-Mughayyir village, which is close to Achimeir's ""outpost"", residents said they were pelted with stones, burned cars, and shot at by armed settlers as they tried to defend their homes. [3]

A BBC report noted that construction worker Abdellatif Abu Aliya's house was stormed by settlers. They damaged his property and killed his cousin, Jihad.

''The settlers cut the electricity to the house and drained the property's water tanks by shooting them.

""Jihad, who had come to defend the house, threw rocks back from the roof towards the settlers. But the settlers returned gunfire, killing Jihad with a shot to the head.'' [3]

In other villages, similar scenes played out, with innocent Palestinian families caught in the middle of settler reprisals.

50-year-old Shehade Abu Rasheed's family suffered attacks on their home. His daughter, Noor, was shot twice in the legs while seeking refuge with her wounded mother. [3]

Another young villager, 17-year-old Yaqoub Nasan, was shot multiple times in the neck while he was unarmed. [3]

According to the Palestinian Health Ministry, 32 people in al-Mughayyir were wounded by gunfire. By Saturday afternoon, after the body of Achimeir was discovered, two more Palestinians had been killed. In property damage, more than 20 houses and 100 vehicles had been set ablaze. [3]

Zionist forces aided settler attacks with protection, intelligence, and active support

In the wake of the violence, lives were lost, houses were destroyed, and entire communities were traumatised.

At the same time, the Israeli regime came under criticism for its failure to prevent the violence and to hold the perpetrators of the attacks accountable. In addition, some of the attacks were unsurprisingly carried out by soldiers of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). [5]

According to one family's video, armed settlers were seen walking around their property before the attack began. At least two of them were wearing what appear to be IDF uniforms.

Abu Aliya said,

""They worked in groups and were following orders from two men, one in uniform and one not. They covered their faces, then one group came forward to throw rocks and set fire to the cars.

""Another group stood at the edge of the property with pistols. Behind them was a group with M16s who fired at the house from the olive groves."" [3]

The involvement of soldiers in some of the attacks, which were witnessed by the villagers and recorded on video, has added to the complexity of the situation.

But as the dust begins to settle in the wake of these terrible events, it is essential that the voices of the victims must not be silenced.

The Palestinian villagers who have suffered the most from settler violence deserve recognition and assistance as they begin to rebuild their lives after what they have endured.

Similarly, justice and human rights advocates who are fighting for peace and reconciliation must continue to stand up against Israel's terrorism against the Palestinian people.

Analysis ANALYSIS Shaheer Choudhury Head of Editorial

Pay attention to the entire Palestinian cause!

Over the past (nearly) eight months, the world has taken a painstaking amount of time to recognise the true situation in the Gaza Strip.

In that time, the Zionist entity has been unleashing untold mayhem upon the Palestinians, with tens of thousands of women and children killed under the pretext of eliminating Hamas.

Arguably, this is one of the most foolish positions that an authoritarian, oppressive, occupying power has ever held in recent history. One cannot simply eradicate the hearts and minds that yearn to resist occupation and that understand defeat is not in the least in the loss of people or property.

Imagine if the situation was reversed

Our role as Muslims in the West must be to continue to speak out about the situation of the whole of Palestine, all of the occupied territories, all of those who we know to be languishing behind bars, and all of those who have gone missing.

Illegal settlers -- such as those who responded with barbarism to the death of one boy -- question why Palestinian resistance fighters are determined to protect their homeland, but they will never see how the situation is many times worse for them.

It is not right that Benjamin Achimeir has been killed -- according to Israeli sources, by a Palestinian hand -- but this level of response is a microcosm of what the Zionist regime has been doing in Gaza.

And this is while vast parts of Palestine are illegally occupied, have been occupied, and more areas are being stolen as we speak. The international community recognises the illegality, and yet barely anything is mentioned about such cases.

Powerful storms left a wide trail of destruction across texas, oklahoma and arkansas. The worst damage was seen in a region spanning from north of dallas to the northwest corner of arkansas. The governor of kentucky declared a state of emergency early this morning, citing multiple reports of wind damage and tornadoes. Now, forecasters say the greatest risk for weather will shift to the east today, with severe storms expected anywhere from alabama as far as new york city. Strong winds and heavy rain pounded the coastal regions of bangladesh and india as a severe cyclone made landfall. Millions of people are without electricity after a power poles fell and trees were uprooted by gusty winds. Dozens of bangladeshi villages were flooded after a flood protection. Embankments either washed away or were damaged by the storm surge. Nearly 800,000 people had been evacuated from vulnerable areas in bangladesh on sunday. The india meteorological department says the storm is likely to weaken further throughout the day, but warns heavy showers will remain over the next two days. 12 people were injured by severe turbulence on a qatar airways flight from doha to dublin.

Editorial credit: Wafa

In the early morning of Friday 12 April, an incident occurred in the occupied West Bank. Benjamin Achimeir, a 14-year-old Israeli teenager, went missing while tending to a flock of sheep near his family's illegal settlement, the 2015-established ""Malachei Hashalom"". [1]

ContentsWhatsApp used to co-ordinate ""collective punishment""Achimeir's death taken as basis for mass killings and destructionZionist forces aided settler attacks with protection, intelligence, and active supportAnalysisAlso read

The disappearance of the boy, which was initially suspected to be a kidnapping, prompted an extensive search involving Israeli authorities, the military, and numerous settlers.

However, it took 24 hours before Achimeir's body was discovered near the ""outpost"", signalling the start of a sequence of events that would lead to a deadly escalation of violence. [2]

WhatsApp used to co-ordinate ""collective punishment""

Israeli authorities state that Achimeir was killed on that particular morning, although it took some time for his body to be found. They inaccurately concluded that he was killed in a ""terror attack"". [1]

Simultaneously, disturbing messages started circulating within settler WhatsApp groups, encouraging retaliatory attacks on neighbouring Palestinian villages.

These messages, originating from individuals with extreme views, promoted activities such as obstructing villages, conducting house-to-house searches, and imposing collective penalties on Palestinians.

One such message, attributed to the terrorist Elisha Yered -- a former spokesman for MP Limor Son Har-Melech and extreme settler suspected in the murder of a Palestinian man last August -- called for ""crowning"" nearby Palestinian villages. [3]

In addition, he urged fellow occupiers to conduct ""home to home searches,"" and impose ""collective punishment against the murderous Arab population."" [3]

This message contained a list of meeting points, some of which were marked with fire emojis, indicating potential targets for violence. [4]

Achimeir's death taken as basis for mass killings and destruction

The response to Achimeir's death was immediate and brutal.

In the following days, settlers carried out shooting and arson attacks against Palestinian neighbourhoods. Homes were set ablaze, cars were set on fire, and lives were lost.

According to Palestinian officials and witnesses, the attacks were highly organised and targeted specific individuals and groups near the illegal settler community.

In al-Mughayyir village, which is close to Achimeir's ""outpost"", residents said they were pelted with stones, burned cars, and shot at by armed settlers as they tried to defend their homes. [3]

A BBC report noted that construction worker Abdellatif Abu Aliya's house was stormed by settlers. They damaged his property and killed his cousin, Jihad.

''The settlers cut the electricity to the house and drained the property's water tanks by shooting them.

""Jihad, who had come to defend the house, threw rocks back from the roof towards the settlers. But the settlers returned gunfire, killing Jihad with a shot to the head.'' [3]

In other villages, similar scenes played out, with innocent Palestinian families caught in the middle of settler reprisals.

50-year-old Shehade Abu Rasheed's family suffered attacks on their home. His daughter, Noor, was shot twice in the legs while seeking refuge with her wounded mother. [3]

Another young villager, 17-year-old Yaqoub Nasan, was shot multiple times in the neck while he was unarmed. [3]

According to the Palestinian Health Ministry, 32 people in al-Mughayyir were wounded by gunfire. By Saturday afternoon, after the body of Achimeir was discovered, two more Palestinians had been killed. In property damage, more than 20 houses and 100 vehicles had been set ablaze. [3]

Zionist forces aided settler attacks with protection, intelligence, and active support

In the wake of the violence, lives were lost, houses were destroyed, and entire communities were traumatised.

At the same time, the Israeli regime came under criticism for its failure to prevent the violence and to hold the perpetrators of the attacks accountable. In addition, some of the attacks were unsurprisingly carried out by soldiers of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). [5]

According to one family's video, armed settlers were seen walking around their property before the attack began. At least two of them were wearing what appear to be IDF uniforms.

Abu Aliya said,

""They worked in groups and were following orders from two men, one in uniform and one not. They covered their faces, then one group came forward to throw rocks and set fire to the cars.

""Another group stood at the edge of the property with pistols. Behind them was a group with M16s who fired at the house from the olive groves."" [3]

The involvement of soldiers in some of the attacks, which were witnessed by the villagers and recorded on video, has added to the complexity of the situation.

But as the dust begins to settle in the wake of these terrible events, it is essential that the voices of the victims must not be silenced.

The Palestinian villagers who have suffered the most from settler violence deserve recognition and assistance as they begin to rebuild their lives after what they have endured.

Similarly, justice and human rights advocates who are fighting for peace and reconciliation must continue to stand up against Israel's terrorism against the Palestinian people.

Analysis ANALYSIS Shaheer Choudhury Head of Editorial

Pay attention to the entire Palestinian cause!

Over the past (nearly) eight months, the world has taken a painstaking amount of time to recognise the true situation in the Gaza Strip.

In that time, the Zionist entity has been unleashing untold mayhem upon the Palestinians, with tens of thousands of women and children killed under the pretext of eliminating Hamas.

Arguably, this is one of the most foolish positions that an authoritarian, oppressive, occupying power has ever held in recent history. One cannot simply eradicate the hearts and minds that yearn to resist occupation and that understand defeat is not in the least in the loss of people or property.

Imagine if the situation was reversed

Our role as Muslims in the West must be to continue to speak out about the situation of the whole of Palestine, all of the occupied territories, all of those who we know to be languishing behind bars, and all of those who have gone missing.

Illegal settlers -- such as those who responded with barbarism to the death of one boy -- question why Palestinian resistance fighters are determined to protect their homeland, but they will never see how the situation is many times worse for them.

It is not right that Benjamin Achimeir has been killed -- according to Israeli sources, by a Palestinian hand -- but this level of response is a microcosm of what the Zionist regime has been doing in Gaza.

And this is while vast parts of Palestine are illegally occupied, have been occupied, and more areas are being stolen as we speak. The international community recognises the illegality, and yet barely anything is mentioned about such cases.

Meanwhile, Blue Capsule has signed a partnership agreement with the French Alternative Energies & Atomic Energy Commission, from which it was spun off, for the development of its small modular reactor.

Thorizon - a spin-off from NRG, which operates the High Flux Reactor in Petten - is developing a 250 MWt/100 MWe molten salt reactor (MSR), targeted at large industrial customers and utilities. Thorizon aims to construct a pilot reactor system before 2035.

MSRs use molten fluoride salts as primary coolant, at low pressure. They may operate with epithermal or fast neutron spectrums, and with a variety of fuels. Much of the interest today in reviving the MSR concept relates to using thorium (to breed fissile uranium-233), where an initial source of fissile material such as plutonium-239 needs to be provided. There are a number of different MSR design concepts, and a number of interesting challenges in the commercialisation of many, especially with thorium.

The molten salt fuel adopted by Thorizon uses a combination of long-lived elements from reprocessed used nuclear fuel and thorium. The reactor will be able to recycle long-lived waste from existing nuclear facilities. The Thorizon One concept is unique in that the core is composed of a set of cartridges that is replaced every five to ten years. This, the company says, overcomes two molten salt design obstacles: material corrosion and handling of used fuel volumes.

Under the new agreement, EDF R&D will review Thorizon's neutronic core calculations and conduct scenario analyses to determine how the Thorizon One could help to close the fuel cycle in the European reactor fleet.

Thorizon said it will ""benefit from EDF's expertise as the French leader in electricity production, and in particular from the recognised skills of its R&D researchers"".

""The R&D team covers all disciplines from neutronics and fuel to safety and construction,"" said Bernard Salha, EDF R&D Director and EDF Group Chief Technical Officer. ""We are actively supporting several start-ups in the France 2030 programme. The cartridge-based approach of Thorizon is interesting and promising.""

""It is a pleasure to work with the EDF team which has more experience in nuclear than any company across the globe,"" added Thorizon CEO Kiki Lauwers. ""Thanks to EDF R&D, start-ups like us benefit from access to unique industry experts that can very quickly spot the strengths and areas for improvements in our design. We hope we can continue to work with the EDF R&D team on the realisation of our technology in the future. We believe all solutions are needed to empower the energy transition and the Thorizon One can be a great compliment to the existing and planned nuclear fleet.""

Horizon says its ambition is to develop an MSR that ""can be realised rapidly and smartly, is 'walk-away' safe, and takes a first step towards circularity by using long-lived nuclear waste as a fuel source"". The company aims to build a non-nuclear molten salt demonstrator in the short-term and finalise the detailed design to start building a first-of-a-kind Thorizon One reactor by 2030.

Decarbonising industry

Blue Capsule - a spin-off from France's Alternative Energies & Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) - has announced the signing of a partnership agreement with the CEA for the development of its small modular reactor (SMR) that will supply heat and power to industry.

Aix-en-Provence-based Blue Capsule is developing a sodium-cooled, high-temperature SMR which can provide 150 MW of heat at 700°C, along with high-temperature steam and electricity. The company aims to decarbonise industrial sites used for ammonia and soda ash production, with subterranean capsules co-located onsite, close to demand.

Under the new agreement - with financial support from French public investment bank Bpifrance - CEA's support for Blue Capsule will extend to fields such as equipment and components, materials, calculation codes and TRISO-based fuel.

""France's leadership in the fields of nuclear energy and low-carbon solutions is creating big opportunities for industry right across the country,"" said Blue Capsule's reactor architect Domnin Erard. ""And for Blue Capsule, collaboration with the French nuclear sector is front and centre of our strategy.

""This vital partnership with the CEA means that Blue Capsule benefits from world-class expertise across the board. It lays the foundations for our future industrial cooperation with the French nuclear supply chain, for manufacturing and assembling Blue Capsule units.

""It all comes down to cutting industrial CO2 emissions and of course the re-industrialisation of communities in France and beyond. For our part, we'll do everything we can to help achieve that objective.""

Blue Capsule is planning to build a proof-of-concept sodium loop and a non-nuclear prototype by 2030. The company's first-of-a-kind SMR is scheduled for construction by 2035 and is set to be built in France.",world-nuclear-news.org,news,World Nuclear News (WNN),,0.1372549019607843,454689557,3,,

Progress on Alstom's action plan to support its financial targets

During the second half of fiscal year 2023/24, the Group mobilised around the operational, commercial, and cost efficiency plan:

Quality of order intake during the second half provides comfort in continuing to grow the margin in backlog: +60bps in FY 2023/24 versus last year, and expected +50bps per year in the coming three yearsIn FY 2023/24, Alstom continued to ramp-up production rates, delivering 4,645 cars, compared to 4,151 in 2022/23Supply chain efficiencies allowed to decrease inventory days since 30 September 2023Costs efficiency programs now launched across overheads and indirect procurement, with notably the aim to reduce SG&A over sales by ca. 1pp over three years vs FY 2022/23.

The €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan highlighting commitment to Investment Grade

As announced in November 2023 and reiterated in January 2024, Alstom's Board of Directors is committed to a conservative financial policy and to protect the Group's Investment Grade rating, in particular through a ca. €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan.

This plan and its execution, which have been unanimously approved by Alstom's Board of Directors, has the following components:

Divestments for ca. €700 million:Sale of TMH for €75 million realized in January 2024The announced sale of conventional signalling business in North America to Knorr-Bremse AG, which will generate proceeds of ca. €630 million upon closing expected during Summer 2024The issuance of hybrid bonds with 50% equity content for Moody's5 in an amount of ca. €750 million to be executed no later than September 2024 subject to market conditions and AMF approvalA capital increase with preferential subscription rights in an amount of ca. €1 billion to be executed no later than September 2024 subject to market conditions and AMF approval

The ca. €2.4 billion proceeds correspond to ca. €2 billion of deleveraging, mainly due to the hybrid bond's 50% Moody's debt content.

Each of CDPQ6 and Bpifrance, holding respectively 17.4% and 7.5% of Alstom's capital, has declared to the Company its intention to subscribe for its pro-rata share of the capital increase.

In addition, Alstom has entered into a standby underwriting commitment with BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, J.P. Morgan and Société Générale, acting as Joint Global Coordinators, pursuant to which they have undertaken to underwrite the remainder of the capital raise (i.e. ca. €750 million), subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions precedent.

Circa €1.2 billion of the proceeds of asset disposals and of the capital markets transactions will be used to repay financial debt by September 2024:

repayment of Neu CP by €1,033 million repayment of RCF drawings by €175 million

The remainder of the proceeds will be invested in highly liquid short-term investment (cash equivalent treatment) and will be earmarked for gross debt reduction at maturity.

Alstom Baa3 long-term issuer rating is reaffirmed, and the outlook will be changed to stable upon successful closing of the hybrid bond issuance and the rights issue.

Alstom will terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following the execution of the deleveraging plan.

Business update

Growth by offering greater value to customersOrders

During the fiscal year 2023/24, the Group recorded €18.9 billion in orders, with commercial success across multiple geographies, notably in Europe, Asia/Pacific and in Americas. During the last fiscal year, Alstom reported an order intake of €20.7 billion. The (8)% decrease is mostly driven by last year's landmark contract awarded by Landesanstalt Schienenfahrzeuge Baden Württemberg (SFBW) network in Germany of almost €2.5 billion.

In Europe, Alstom recorded €11.3 billion order intake during the fiscal year 2023/24, compared with €12.8 billion over the last fiscal year.

In the U.K, Alstom has signed an eight-year extension to its Train Services Agreement (TSA) with CrossCountry. The contract extension, valued at around €950 million, further secures this long-term partnership and is evidence of the trust placed by the customer.

In France, Alstom will supply île-de-France Mobilités and RATP with 103 new MF19 trainsets, which is the new generation metro on rail, for a total contract value of more than €800 million, 100% financed by Île-de-France Mobilités. This new fleet will replace the existing rolling stock on lines 13, 12 and 8 of the Île-de-France metro as of 2027. The Group also signed a framework contract with Akiem European rolling stock leasing company for 100 TraxxTM Universal multi-system (MS3) locomotives, together with an initial firm order for 65 locomotives. The total amount of the framework agreement is up €500 million.

In Germany, Alstom was awarded a contract to supply 40 Coradia StreamTM High-Capacity electric multiple units together with full maintenance for 30 years to Nahverkehrsverbund Schleswig-Holstein (NAH.SH), valued at close to €900 million, and including an option for up to 55 additional trains with a corresponding full-service package. The Group also signed a contract with RAILPOOL for 50 TraxxTM Universal multi-purpose locomotives.

In Romania, Alstom, as part of a consortium with the civil works companies Gulermak and Arcada, also signed a contract with the Cluj-Napoca City Hall in Romania for the construction of the Cluj-Napoca Metro Line 1. Alstom's share of this state-of-the-art turnkey project reaches approximately €400 million.

In Italy, Alstom was awarded a contract for the supply of high-speed trains.

In Americas, Alstom reported €2.0 billion order intake, compared with €2.7 billion over the last fiscal year, driven by a contract with the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) in the United States to deliver 130 full low floor electric streetcars for Philadelphia, valued at over €667 million and with options to build an additional 30 streetcars. And the Group was awarded a contract by the Connecticut Department of Transportation (CTDOT) in the United States to supply 60 single-level rail coach cars valued at approximately €285 million with options to build an additional 313 cars, as part of CTDOT's coach renewal program for its statewide rail system.

In Asia/Pacific, the order intake stood at €3.2 billion, compared to €3.0 billion for the last fiscal year. In the Philippines, Alstom in consortium with Colas Rail has been awarded by Mitsubishi Corporation a contract to provide an integrated railway system for the extension of the North-South Commuter Railway project (NSCR). Alstom's contract share is worth approximately €1 billion. In Australia, Alstom has been awarded a contract worth around €900 million to maintain the regional rolling stock VLocity and Classic fleets in Victoria, Australia for the next decade.

In Africa/Middle East/Central Asia, the Group reported €2.4 billion order intake, compared with €2.2 billion over the last fiscal year. In Israel, Alstom, a member of the TMT Consortium (TLV Metropolitan Tramway Ltd.) and its partners Electra Ltd. & Dan Public Transportation Ltd., have reached financial closure on the contract, awarded in May 2022, to design, build, maintain, and finance the Tel Aviv Metropolitan LRT Green line by Metropolitan Mass Transit System Ltd (NTA). Alstom's share is valued at €858 million. In Saudi Arabia, Alstom signed a contract of over €500 million with The Royal Commission for AlUla (RCU) for AlUla's pioneering battery-powered tramway - the world's longest catenary-free line.

As of 31 March 2024, the backlog stood at €92 billion, providing the Group with strong visibility over future sales.

Sales

Alstom's sales amounted to €17.6 billion for the fiscal year 2023/24, representing a growth of 6.7% on a reported basis and a strong 9.4% on an organic basis compared with Alstom sales in the last fiscal year. Sales related to non-performing backlog, corresponding to sales on legacy projects with a negative margin at completion, amounted to €1.7 billion during the fiscal year 2023/24.

Rolling stock sales reached €9.1 billion, representing an increase of 3.9% on a reported basis and 6.5% on an organic basis, driven by contracts ramp-up in France, Belgium and in the US, and the solid level of execution in South Africa, India and Europe.

Services sales stood at €4.3 billion, up 11.9% on a reported basis and 14.3% on an organic basis versus last year, benefiting from the continuous ramp-up in the UK, in Italy and in the US as well as a solid level of execution in Canada.

In Signalling, Alstom reported €2.6 billion sales, up 8.9% on a reported basis and 11.8% on an organic basis versus last year, led by a consistent execution across all regions, mainly in Europe and in APAC.

Systems sales grew 6.9% on a reported basis and 9.3% on an organic basis, and stood at €1.6 billion, driven by a good performance of Turnkey Systems projects in Mexico, Egypt and Canada.

Divestments

On 14 September 2023, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US department of Treasury added JSC Transmashholding (TMH AO) to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Person (SDN) List. TMH AO is the Russian holding company of TMH Group and is 100% owned by TMH Limited, and Alstom was holding a 20% stake in TMH limited. The Group further assessed potential exposures arising from the new OFAC sanctions and made the decision to sell its stake in TMH. The transaction was closed early January 2024 for an amount of €75 million, carrying value was nil as result of previous impairment, contributing to the de-risking of the company's portfolio.

On 19 April 2024, Alstom announced that it had entered into a binding agreement with Knorr-Bremse AG, to sell Alstom's North American conventional signalling business for a purchase price of around €630 million. Closing of the transaction is only subject to customary conditions, including regulatory approval, and is expected to take place as soon as summer 2024. Proceeds for Alstom at closing, net of expected tax and transaction costs, are expected to be around €620 million.

2.Innovation by Pioneering Smarter and Greener Mobility for All

As of end of March 2024, research and development gross costs amounted to €749 million, i.e. 4.3% of sales, delivering on the Alstom In Motion strategy which is based on three pillars: Autonomous mobility, Data factory and Mobility orchestration. Net R&D amounts to €549 million before PPA amortisation.

Programs funded by IPCEI Hydrogen are ongoing. This important European program supports the development of new hydrogen trains for regional applications, shunting locos and freight, leveraging on the experience collected with Coradia iLint regional trains that are now in revenue service.

Homologation tests of Avelia Horizon are planned in 2024 to enable a start of revenue service in 2025. The development of international configurations is ongoing. Alstom has launched the development of Avelia stream 300, addressing the high-speed single deck segment with a first project for Italy.

The replacement of Adessia commuter train has been launched to address the U.K. and USA markets. This new product range will include EMU, BMU, BEMU and HMU versions to also replace the existing Diesel trains.

TRAXX Multi-system 3 - locomotives is pursuing homologation tests in 2024 to enable it to run on the different European corridors. It includes the passenger version which can be operated at 200kph.

Services product line is focused on addressing green, sustainable and more efficient operation concepts. Green re-tractioning initiatives include for example the retrofit with hydrogen-fuelled internal combustion engines for locomotives and the ability to provide autonomy for non-electrified lines via the so-called ""Last-mile"" functionality supported by the IPCEI H2 program.

Signalling Product Line worked on Onvia Control L2 A and Onvia Control L2 B European Standard convergence, driving market presence with its integration into TRAXX platform and securing new contracts for cross border operation, Onvia Cab level 2 and level 3 on-board solution together with Automatic Train Operation, and it continued its footprint expansion with a new contract in Canada.

Alstom Innovations cluster continued to develop Autonomous Mobility solutions for Passengers & Freight trains. Major milestones on the roadmap to achieve GoA4 (Grade of Automation 4) have been successfully passed under real mainline operating conditions on passengers and freight train with SNCF in France, and for operation in yard in the Netherlands.

Alstom has also made great strides in developing a new SaaS platform that will enhance its global digital offering. The platform streamlines applications integration and deployment in a trusted and future-proof ecosystem.

3.Profitability

The adjusted EBIT margin has progressed from 5.2% over the fiscal year 2022/23 to 5.7% over the fiscal year 2023/24, benefiting from further synergies for 30bps, a steady reduction of non-performing legacy contracts sales for an impact of 30bps, an increased volume and favourable mix delivering 20bps gross margin expansion, partially offset by the negative gross margin impact related to the legacy portfolio deviations for (30)bps.

Alstom recorded restructuring and rationalisation charges of €(147) million mainly related to the reduction of overhead costs for €(115) million (""Autumn"" plan) and adaptation of the production setup for €(32) million, including the United Kingdom for €(14) million, Germany for €(8) million, France for €(3) million, Spain for €(3) million and the U.S.A. for €(2) million.

Costs related to the integration of Bombardier Transportation were recorded for an amount of €(142) million. €(118) million charges were related to some legal proceedings outside the ordinary course of business mainly for two projects - in U.S.A. and in Turkey, and for legal fees in the context of the claim against Bombardier Inc. €(30) million were related to impairment of assets due to the exit from Russia. Other exceptional expenses were recorded for €(73) million, of which €(36) million of consequential impacts from restructuring plan already initiated in Germany.

Alstom's EBIT before amortisation and impairment of assets exclusively valued when determining the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") stood at €356 million. This compares to €366 million for the last fiscal year.

The share in net income from equity investments amounted to €7 million, excluding the amortisation of the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") from Chinese joint ventures of €(10) million.

Adjusted net profit, representing the group's share of net profit from continued operations excluding PPA net of tax, amounts to €44 million for the fiscal year 2023/24. This compares to an adjusted net profit of €292 million during the last fiscal year.

The Group's Net profit/(loss) (Group share) stood at €(309) million for the fiscal year 2023/24, compared to €(132) million last fiscal year.

***

4.Financial structure

The Group's Free Cash Flow stands at €(557) million for the fiscal year 2023/24 as compared to €199 million during the last fiscal year and €(1,119) million at the first half of fiscal year 2023/24. Cash generation was impacted over the full year by an unfavourable €(856) million change in working capital compared to €(219) million in the last fiscal year; mostly due to change in Trade Working Capital as well as the reversal effect of the change in law on VAT in France for €(380) million. The Contract Working Capital is positively impacted by the acceleration of deliveries from major contracts in the second half of the year, strong collections of down payments as well as reduction of provision for risk on contracts.

On 31 March 2024, the Group recorded a net debt position of €(2,994) million.

In addition to its available cash and cash equivalents, amounting to €976 million on 31 March 2024, the Group benefits from strong liquidity with:

€2.25 billion Revolving Credit Facility maturing in October 2024;€1.75 billion Revolving Credit Facility maturing in January 2027;€2.5 billion Revolving Credit Facility maturing in January 2029.

The first facility has two six-month extension options remaining at borrowers' discretion. Alstom will, however, terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following execution of the deleveraging plan.

The last two facilities have been successfully extended by one year. On 31 March 2024, the €1.75 billion RCF line had been drawn down for €175 million, while the other two lines remained undrawn.

As per its conservative liquidity policy, the €2.5 billion Revolving Credit Facility serves as a back-up of the Group €2.5 billion Negotiable European Commercial Papers program in place. With these RCF lines (€175 million drawn on the RCF on 31 March 2024), the €1.03 billion of Neu CP outstanding on 31 March 2024, the Group benefitted from a €6.3 billion liquidity available.

5.One Alstom team - Agile, Inclusive and Responsible

Decarbonization is at the heart of Alstom's strategy. The Group is reducing its Scope 1 & 2 emissions reaching 139 ktonCO2e (representing a 39% decrease compared to March 2022), while collaborating with suppliers and customers on reducing its Scope 3 footprint. First results of this collaboration can be seen through the reduction of emissions intensity of sold product reaching 4.0 gCO2e/pass.km (i.e. (13)% compared to March 2022). Alstom CO2e emissions reduction targets had been validated on the 6th of July 2023 by the independent Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) as in line with requirements to reach Paris Agreement commitments.

The supply of electricity from renewable sources has also been expanded. Alstom signed a significant Power Purchase Agreement focused on solar development in Spain. The solar farm is expected to begin operations early 2025 with a 10-years contract. The project will cover the equivalent of 80% of Alstom's electricity consumption in Europe, so this is a major step in reaching the target of 100% electricity consumption from renewables.

Regarding Diversity & Inclusion, the Alstom in Motion (AiM) 2025 strategy targets to reach 28% of women managers, engineers and professionals' roles by 2025. As of end of March 2024, 24.7% of manager, engineer and professional roles are held by women. Alstom will continue to accelerate its efforts in the coming months.

Alstom's Corporate Social Responsibility performance is regularly evaluated by various rating agencies; the Group maintained its presence among the CAC40 ESG index for the third consecutive year and the DJSI for the 13th consecutive year. Alstom improved is scoring to ECOVADIS questionnaire with a score of 77/100 and kept AA score with MSCI agency. In addition, in 2024, Alstom improved is CDP rating, moving from B to A-. Those results reflect its strong position and strategy on Sustainability.

In addition, Alstom published for the second year European Taxonomy-aligned KPIs about Sales, Capex and Opex, pursuing strong analysis initiated last year. EU Taxonomy-aligned sales amounted to 60% and ranked Alstom among best in class, confirming the importance of the sector in which Alstom operates in achieving the EU's ambition of carbon neutrality by 2050. The EU Taxonomy purpose is to redirect capital flows towards sustainable activities and help navigate transition to a low carbon economy.

Financial trajectory for FY 2024/25

The outlook for FY 2024/25 is based on following main assumptions:

Supportive market demand FY 2024/25 downpayments consistent with FY 2023/24Balance sheet deleveraging plan fully executed in FY 2024/25End of integration of Bombardier Transportation in FY 2024/25

FY 2024/25 Outlook:

Book to bill above 1Sales organic growth: around 5%aEBIT margin around 6.5 %Free Cash Flow generation within the €300 million to €500 million rangeSeasonality driving:negative FCF in the first half of FY 2024/25 within a range of €(300) million to €(500) million margin development to be more second-half weighted

***

Mid to long-term ambitions

The Group's ambition is to deliver around 5% average sales growth over the mid to long term, thanks to a book-to-bill above 1, largely driven by Services, Signalling and Systems product lines. Rolling stock is expected to grow above market rate, Services and Signalling at high-single digit rates and Systems at double digit rates.

On profitability, Alstom's ambition is to consistently deliver an adjusted EBIT margin between 8% and 10% over the mid to long term. This improvement from 5.7% in fiscal year 2023/24 will be driven by:

Continuous improvement of gross margin in backlog thanks to quality order intake and completion of legacy projects.Improved execution through operational excellence initiatives and industrial optimisation.Cost efficiency programs across indirect procurement and overheads.

Considering the slight dilution from disposals and the revised timing of the impact from industrial optimisation, the Group expects to reach this profitability range in FY 2026/27, versus FY 2025/26 previously.

Free Cash Flow:Alstom expects free cash flow conversion to trend towards 100% of adjusted net income over the cycle. Yearly performance is subject to short-term working capital volatility, notably from the phasing of downpayments.Over the next three years, the Group expects to deliver at least €1.5 billion in free cash-flow over FY 2024/25 to FY 2026/27, despite Contract Working Capital being a headwind over that period.

APPENDIX 4 - NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INDICATORS DEFINITIONS

This section presents financial indicators used by the Group that are not defined by accounting standard setters.

Orders received

A new order is recognised as an order received only when the contract creates enforceable obligations between the Group and its customer. When this condition is met, the order is recognised at the contract value. If the contract is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the reporting unit, the Group requires the immediate elimination of currency exposure using forward currency sales. Orders are then measured using the spot rate at inception of hedging instruments.

Book-to-Bill

The book-to-bill ratio is the ratio of orders received to the amount of sales traded for a specific period.

Gross margin % on backlog

Gross Margin % on backlog is a KPI that presents the expected performance level of firm contracts in backlog. It represents the difference between the sales not yet recognized and the cost of sales not yet incurred from the contracts in backlog. This % is an average of the portfolio of contracts in backlog and is meaningful to project mid- and long-term profitability.

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA is a KPI that presents the level of recurring operational performance. It represents the sales minus the cost of sales, adjusted to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination as well as significant, non-recurring ""one off"" items that are not expected to occur again in subsequent years.

EBIT before PPA

Following the Bombardier Transportation acquisition and with effect from the fiscal year 2021/22 condensed consolidated financial statements, Alstom decided to introduce the ""EBIT before PPA"" KPI aimed at restating its Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (""EBIT"") to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination. This KPI is also aligned with market practice.

Adjusted EBIT

Adjusted EBIT (""aEBIT"") is the Key Performance Indicator to present the level of recurring operational performance. This indicator is also aligned with market practice and comparable to direct competitors.

Starting September 2019, Alstom has opted for the inclusion of the share in net income of the equity-accounted investments into the aEBIT when these are considered to be part of the operating activities of the Group (because there are significant operational flows and/or common project execution with these entities). This mainly includes Chinese joint-ventures, namely CASCO joint-venture for Alstom as well as, following the integration of Bombardier Transportation, Alstom Sifang (Qingdao) Transportation Ltd. (formerly Bombardier Sifang), Bombardier NUG Propulsion System Co. Ltd and Changchun Changke Alstom Railway Vehicles Company Ltd (formerly Changchun Bombardier).

aEBIT corresponds to Earning Before Interests and Tax adjusted for the following elements:

net restructuring expenses (including rationalization costs)tangibles and intangibles impairmentcapital gains or loss/revaluation on investments disposals or controls changes of an entityany other non-recurring items, such as some costs incurred to realize business combinations and amortization of an asset exclusively valued in the context of business combination, as well as litigation costs that have arisen outside the ordinary course of businessand including the share in net income of the operational equity-accounted investments

A non-recurring item is a ""one-off"" exceptional item that is not supposed to occur again in following years and that is significant.

Adjusted EBIT margin corresponds to Adjusted EBIT expressed as a percentage of sales.

EBITDA + JV dividends

EBITDA before PPA plus dividends from joint ventures is the EBIT before PPA, before depreciation and amortisation, with the addition of the dividends received from joint ventures.

Adjusted net profit

The ""Adjusted Net Profit"" KPI restates Alstom's net profit from continued operations (Group share) to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination, net of the corresponding tax effect. This indicator is also aligned with market practice.

Free cash flow

Free Cash Flow is de?ned as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures including capitalised development costs, net of proceeds from disposals of tangible and intangible assets. Free Cash Flow does not include any proceeds from disposals of activity.

The most directly comparable financial measure to Free Cash Flow calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS is net cash provided by operating activities.

Funds from Operations

Funds from Operations ""FFO"" in the EBIT to FCF statement refers to the Free Cash Flow generated by Operations, before Working Capital variations.

Contract and Trade Working Capital

Contract Working Capital is the sum of:

Contract Assets & Liabilities, which includes the Customer Down-PaymentsCurrent provisions, which includes Risks on contracts and Warranties

Trade Working Capital is the Working Capital that is not strictly related to contract. It includes all the elements of the working capital but

Contract Working Capital Income Tax receivables and payablesRestructuring provisions

Net cash/(debt)

The net cash/(debt) is defined as cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and other current financial asset, less borrowings.

Pay-out ratio

The pay-out ratio is calculated by dividing the amount of the overall dividend with the ""Adjusted Net profit from continuing operations attributable to equity holders of the parent, Group share"" as presented in the management report in the consolidated financial statements.

Organic basis

This press release includes performance indicators presented on a reported basis and on an organic basis. Figures given on an organic basis eliminate the impact of changes in scope of consolidation and changes resulting from the translation of the accounts into Euro following the variation of foreign currencies against the Euro.

The Group uses figures prepared on an organic basis both for internal analysis and for external communication, as it believes they provide means to analyse and explain variations from one period to another. However, these figures are not measurements of performance under IFRS.

Sales were €17.6 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio at 1.1.

The backlog reached €92 billion, providing strong visibility on future sales. Gross margin on backlog reached 17.5% as of 31 March 2024, compared to 16.9% on 31 March 2023.

In the fiscal year 2023/24, Alstom's adjusted EBIT was €997 million, up 17%, equivalent to a 5.7% aEBIT margin, and EBIT before PPA was €356 million. Adjusted net profit was €44 million, net income (group share) was €(309) million, and free cash flow was €(557) million for the full year.

On 31 March 2024, the Group's net debt position stood at €(2,994) million, compared to the €(2,135) million the Group reported on 31 March 2023. Alstom benefits from a solid €6.3 billion liquidity position and equity amounting to €8,778 million on 31 March 2024.

The Board of Directors, in its meeting of 7 May 2024, proposed that no dividend will be paid with regards to the fiscal year 2023/24.

""Alstom recorded a strong rebound during the second half of the year, with solid order intake, strong organic growth, improved profitability and €562 million free cash-flow generation. Thanks to the support of our reference shareholders, we will swiftly execute the €2 billion deleveraging plan, allowing for the stabilization of its Investment Grade rating. In April, we announced the sale of Alstom's conventional signalling business in North America at a favourable valuation, demonstrating the quality and attractiveness of the Group's assets. We are confident in the strength of our backlog and our strategy of selectivity and mix evolution towards services. The Group is capitalizing on the solid operational progress made over the last three years and is launching new initiatives to improve its industrial performance and reduce overheads and indirect procurement costs. Altogether, Alstom is now set on stronger foundations to deliver sustainable profit and cash generation."" said Henri Poupart-Lafarge, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Alstom.

Progress on Alstom's action plan to support its financial targets

During the second half of fiscal year 2023/24, the Group mobilised around the operational, commercial, and cost efficiency plan:

The €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan highlighting commitment to Investment Grade

As announced in November 2023 and reiterated in January 2024, Alstom's Board of Directors is committed to a conservative financial policy and to protect the Group's Investment Grade rating, in particular through a ca. €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan.

This plan and its execution, which have been unanimously approved by Alstom's Board of Directors, has the following components:

The ca. €2.4 billion proceeds correspond to ca. €2 billion of deleveraging, mainly due to the hybrid bond's 50% Moody's debt content.

Each of CDPQ and Bpifrance, holding respectively 17.4% and 7.5% of Alstom's capital, has declared to the Company its intention to subscribe for its pro-rata share of the capital increase.

In addition, Alstom has entered into a standby underwriting commitment with BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, J.P. Morgan and Société Générale, acting as Joint Global Coordinators, pursuant to which they have undertaken to underwrite the remainder of the capital raise (i.e. ca. €750 million), subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions precedent.

Circa €1.2 billion of the proceeds of asset disposals and of the capital markets transactions will be used to repay financial debt by September 2024:

The remainder of the proceeds will be invested in highly liquid short-term investment (cash equivalent treatment) and will be earmarked for gross debt reduction at maturity.

Alstom Baa3 long-term issuer rating is reaffirmed, and the outlook will be changed to stable upon successful closing of the hybrid bond issuance and the rights issue.

Alstom will terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following the execution of the deleveraging plan.

During the fiscal year 2023/24, the Group recorded €18.9 billion in orders, with commercial success across multiple geographies, notably in Europe, Asia/Pacific and in Americas. During the last fiscal year, Alstom reported an order intake of €20.7 billion. The (8)% decrease is mostly driven by last year's landmark contract awarded by Landesanstalt Schienenfahrzeuge Baden Württemberg (SFBW) network in Germany of almost €2.5 billion.

In Europe, Alstom recorded €11.3 billion order intake during the fiscal year 2023/24, compared with €12.8 billion over the last fiscal year.

In the U.K, Alstom has signed an eight-year extension to its Train Services Agreement (TSA) with CrossCountry. The contract extension, valued at around €950 million, further secures this long-term partnership and is evidence of the trust placed by the customer.

In France, Alstom will supply île-de-France Mobilités and RATP with 103 new MF19 trainsets, which is the new generation metro on rail, for a total contract value of more than €800 million, 100% financed by Île-de-France Mobilités. This new fleet will replace the existing rolling stock on lines 13, 12 and 8 of the Île-de-France metro as of 2027. The Group also signed a framework contract with Akiem European rolling stock leasing company for 100 Traxx Universal multi-system (MS3) locomotives, together with an initial firm order for 65 locomotives. The total amount of the framework agreement is up €500 million.

In Germany, Alstom was awarded a contract to supply 40 Coradia Stream High-Capacity electric multiple units together with full maintenance for 30 years to Nahverkehrsverbund Schleswig-Holstein (NAH.SH), valued at close to €900 million, and including an option for up to 55 additional trains with a corresponding full-service package. The Group also signed a contract with RAILPOOL for 50 Traxx Universal multi-purpose locomotives.

In Romania, Alstom, as part of a consortium with the civil works companies Gulermak and Arcada, also signed a contract with the Cluj-Napoca City Hall in Romania for the construction of the Cluj-Napoca Metro Line 1. Alstom's share of this state-of-the-art turnkey project reaches approximately €400 million.

In Italy, Alstom was awarded a contract for the supply of high-speed trains.

In Americas, Alstom reported €2.0 billion order intake, compared with €2.7 billion over the last fiscal year, driven by a contract with the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) in the United States to deliver 130 full low floor electric streetcars for Philadelphia, valued at over €667 million and with options to build an additional 30 streetcars. And the Group was awarded a contract by the Connecticut Department of Transportation (CTDOT) in the United States to supply 60 single-level rail coach cars valued at approximately €285 million with options to build an additional 313 cars, as part of CTDOT's coach renewal program for its statewide rail system.

In Asia/Pacific, the order intake stood at €3.2 billion, compared to €3.0 billion for the last fiscal year. In the Philippines, Alstom in consortium with Colas Rail has been awarded by Mitsubishi Corporation a contract to provide an integrated railway system for the extension of the North-South Commuter Railway project (NSCR). Alstom's contract share is worth approximately €1 billion. In Australia, Alstom has been awarded a contract worth around €900 million to maintain the regional rolling stock VLocity and Classic fleets in Victoria, Australia for the next decade.

In Africa/Middle East/Central Asia, the Group reported €2.4 billion order intake, compared with €2.2 billion over the last fiscal year. In Israel, Alstom, a member of the TMT Consortium (TLV Metropolitan Tramway Ltd.) and its partners Electra Ltd. & Dan Public Transportation Ltd., have reached financial closure on the contract, awarded in May 2022, to design, build, maintain, and finance the Tel Aviv Metropolitan LRT Green line by Metropolitan Mass Transit System Ltd (NTA). Alstom's share is valued at €858 million. In Saudi Arabia, Alstom signed a contract of over €500 million with The Royal Commission for AlUla (RCU) for AlUla's pioneering battery-powered tramway - the world's longest catenary-free line.

As of 31 March 2024, the backlog stood at €92 billion, providing the Group with strong visibility over future sales.

Alstom's sales amounted to €17.6 billion for the fiscal year 2023/24, representing a growth of 6.7% on a reported basis and a strong 9.4% on an organic basis compared with Alstom sales in the last fiscal year. Sales related to non-performing backlog, corresponding to sales on legacy projects with a negative margin at completion, amounted to €1.7 billion during the fiscal year 2023/24.

Rolling stock sales reached €9.1 billion, representing an increase of 3.9% on a reported basis and 6.5% on an organic basis, driven by contracts ramp-up in France, Belgium and in the US, and the solid level of execution in South Africa, India and Europe.

Services sales stood at €4.3 billion, up 11.9% on a reported basis and 14.3% on an organic basis versus last year, benefiting from the continuous ramp-up in the UK, in Italy and in the US as well as a solid level of execution in Canada.

In Signalling, Alstom reported €2.6 billion sales, up 8.9% on a reported basis and 11.8% on an organic basis versus last year, led by a consistent execution across all regions, mainly in Europe and in APAC.

Systems sales grew 6.9% on a reported basis and 9.3% on an organic basis, and stood at €1.6 billion, driven by a good performance of Turnkey Systems projects in Mexico, Egypt and Canada.

On 14 September 2023, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US department of Treasury added JSC Transmashholding (TMH AO) to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Person (SDN) List. TMH AO is the Russian holding company of TMH Group and is 100% owned by TMH Limited, and Alstom was holding a 20% stake in TMH limited. The Group further assessed potential exposures arising from the new OFAC sanctions and made the decision to sell its stake in TMH. The transaction was closed early January 2024 for an amount of €75 million, carrying value was nil as result of previous impairment, contributing to the de-risking of the company's portfolio.

On 19 April 2024, Alstom announced that it had entered into a binding agreement with Knorr-Bremse AG, to sell Alstom's North American conventional signalling business for a purchase price of around €630 million. Closing of the transaction is only subject to customary conditions, including regulatory approval, and is expected to take place as soon as summer 2024. Proceeds for Alstom at closing, net of expected tax and transaction costs, are expected to be around €620 million.

2. Innovation by Pioneering Smarter and Greener Mobility for All

As of end of March 2024, research and development gross costs amounted to €749 million, i.e. 4.3% of sales, delivering on the Alstom In Motion strategy which is based on three pillars: Autonomous mobility, Data factory and Mobility orchestration. Net R&D amounts to €549 million before PPA amortisation.

Programs funded by IPCEI Hydrogen are ongoing. This important European program supports the development of new hydrogen trains for regional applications, shunting locos and freight, leveraging on the experience collected with Coradia iLint regional trains that are now in revenue service.

Homologation tests of Avelia Horizon are planned in 2024 to enable a start of revenue service in 2025. The development of international configurations is ongoing. Alstom has launched the development of Avelia stream 300, addressing the high-speed single deck segment with a first project for Italy.

The replacement of Adessia commuter train has been launched to address the U.K. and USA markets. This new product range will include EMU, BMU, BEMU and HMU versions to also replace the existing Diesel trains.

TRAXX Multi-system 3 - locomotives is pursuing homologation tests in 2024 to enable it to run on the different European corridors. It includes the passenger version which can be operated at 200kph.

Services product line is focused on addressing green, sustainable and more efficient operation concepts. Green re-tractioning initiatives include for example the retrofit with hydrogen-fuelled internal combustion engines for locomotives and the ability to provide autonomy for non-electrified lines via the so-called ""Last-mile"" functionality supported by the IPCEI H2 program.

Signalling Product Line worked on Onvia Control L2 A and Onvia Control L2 B European Standard convergence, driving market presence with its integration into TRAXX platform and securing new contracts for cross border operation, Onvia Cab level 2 and level 3 on-board solution together with Automatic Train Operation, and it continued its footprint expansion with a new contract in Canada.

Alstom Innovations cluster continued to develop Autonomous Mobility solutions for Passengers & Freight trains. Major milestones on the roadmap to achieve GoA4 (Grade of Automation 4) have been successfully passed under real mainline operating conditions on passengers and freight train with SNCF in France, and for operation in yard in the Netherlands.

Alstom has also made great strides in developing a new SaaS platform that will enhance its global digital offering. The platform streamlines applications integration and deployment in a trusted and future-proof ecosystem.

The adjusted EBIT margin has progressed from 5.2% over the fiscal year 2022/23 to 5.7% over the fiscal year 2023/24, benefiting from further synergies for 30bps, a steady reduction of non-performing legacy contracts sales for an impact of 30bps, an increased volume and favourable mix delivering 20bps gross margin expansion, partially offset by the negative gross margin impact related to the legacy portfolio deviations for (30)bps.

Alstom recorded restructuring and rationalisation charges of €(147) million mainly related to the reduction of overhead costs for €(115) million (""Autumn"" plan) and adaptation of the production setup for €(32) million, including the United Kingdom for €(14) million, Germany for €(8) million, France for €(3) million, Spain for €(3) million and the U.S.A. for €(2) million.

Costs related to the integration of Bombardier Transportation were recorded for an amount of €(142) million. €(118) million charges were related to some legal proceedings outside the ordinary course of business mainly for two projects - in U.S.A. and in Turkey, and for legal fees in the context of the claim against Bombardier Inc. €(30) million were related to impairment of assets due to the exit from Russia. Other exceptional expenses were recorded for €(73) million, of which €(36) million of consequential impacts from restructuring plan already initiated in Germany.

Alstom's EBIT before amortisation and impairment of assets exclusively valued when determining the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") stood at €356 million. This compares to €366 million for the last fiscal year.

The share in net income from equity investments amounted to €7 million, excluding the amortisation of the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") from Chinese joint ventures of €(10) million.

Adjusted net profit, representing the group's share of net profit from continued operations excluding PPA net of tax, amounts to €44 million for the fiscal year 2023/24. This compares to an adjusted net profit of €292 million during the last fiscal year.

The Group's Net profit/(loss) (Group share) stood at €(309) million for the fiscal year 2023/24, compared to €(132) million last fiscal year.

4. Financial structure

The Group's Free Cash Flow stands at €(557) million for the fiscal year 2023/24 as compared to €199 million during the last fiscal year and €(1,119) million at the first half of fiscal year 2023/24. Cash generation was impacted over the full year by an unfavourable €(856) million change in working capital compared to €(219) million in the last fiscal year; mostly due to change in Trade Working Capital as well as the reversal effect of the change in law on VAT in France for €(380) million. The Contract Working Capital is positively impacted by the acceleration of deliveries from major contracts in the second half of the year, strong collections of down payments as well as reduction of provision for risk on contracts.

On 31 March 2024, the Group recorded a net debt position of €(2,994) million.

In addition to its available cash and cash equivalents, amounting to €976 million on 31 March 2024, the Group benefits from strong liquidity with:

The first facility has two six-month extension options remaining at borrowers' discretion. Alstom will, however, terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following execution of the deleveraging plan.

The last two facilities have been successfully extended by one year. On 31 March 2024, the €1.75 billion RCF line had been drawn down for €175 million, while the other two lines remained undrawn.

As per its conservative liquidity policy, the €2.5 billion Revolving Credit Facility serves as a back-up of the Group €2.5 billion Negotiable European Commercial Papers program in place. With these RCF lines (€175 million drawn on the RCF on 31 March 2024), the €1.03 billion of Neu CP outstanding on 31 March 2024, the Group benefitted from a €6.3 billion liquidity available.

5. One Alstom team - Agile, Inclusive and Responsible

Decarbonization is at the heart of Alstom's strategy. The Group is reducing its Scope 1 & 2 emissions reaching 139 ktonCO2e (representing a 39% decrease compared to March 2022), while collaborating with suppliers and customers on reducing its Scope 3 footprint. First results of this collaboration can be seen through the reduction of emissions intensity of sold product reaching 4.0 gCO2e/pass.km (i.e. (13)% compared to March 2022). Alstom CO2e emissions reduction targets had been validated on the 6 of July 2023 by the independent Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) as in line with requirements to reach Paris Agreement commitments.

The supply of electricity from renewable sources has also been expanded. Alstom signed a significant Power Purchase Agreement focused on solar development in Spain. The solar farm is expected to begin operations early 2025 with a 10-years contract. The project will cover the equivalent of 80% of Alstom's electricity consumption in Europe, so this is a major step in reaching the target of 100% electricity consumption from renewables.

Regarding Diversity & Inclusion, the Alstom in Motion (AiM) 2025 strategy targets to reach 28% of women managers, engineers and professionals' roles by 2025. As of end of March 2024, 24.7% of manager, engineer and professional roles are held by women. Alstom will continue to accelerate its efforts in the coming months.

Alstom's Corporate Social Responsibility performance is regularly evaluated by various rating agencies; the Group maintained its presence among the CAC40 ESG index for the third consecutive year and the DJSI for the 13 consecutive year. Alstom improved is scoring to ECOVADIS questionnaire with a score of 77/100 and kept AA score with MSCI agency. In addition, in 2024, Alstom improved is CDP rating, moving from B to A-. Those results reflect its strong position and strategy on Sustainability.

In addition, Alstom published for the second year European Taxonomy-aligned KPIs about Sales, Capex and Opex, pursuing strong analysis initiated last year. EU Taxonomy-aligned sales amounted to 60% and ranked Alstom among best in class, confirming the importance of the sector in which Alstom operates in achieving the EU's ambition of carbon neutrality by 2050. The EU Taxonomy purpose is to redirect capital flows towards sustainable activities and help navigate transition to a low carbon economy.

The outlook for FY 2024/25 is based on following main assumptions:

Considering the slight dilution from disposals and the revised timing of the impact from industrial optimisation, the Group expects to reach this profitability range in FY 2026/27, versus FY 2025/26 previously.

APPENDIX 4 - NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INDICATORS DEFINITIONS

This section presents financial indicators used by the Group that are not defined by accounting standard setters.

Orders received

A new order is recognised as an order received only when the contract creates enforceable obligations between the Group and its customer. When this condition is met, the order is recognised at the contract value. If the contract is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the reporting unit, the Group requires the immediate elimination of currency exposure using forward currency sales. Orders are then measured using the spot rate at inception of hedging instruments.

Book-to-Bill

The book-to-bill ratio is the ratio of orders received to the amount of sales traded for a specific period.

Gross margin % on backlog

Gross Margin % on backlog is a KPI that presents the expected performance level of firm contracts in backlog. It represents the difference between the sales not yet recognized and the cost of sales not yet incurred from the contracts in backlog. This % is an average of the portfolio of contracts in backlog and is meaningful to project mid- and long-term profitability.

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA is a KPI that presents the level of recurring operational performance. It represents the sales minus the cost of sales, adjusted to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination as well as significant, non-recurring ""one off"" items that are not expected to occur again in subsequent years.

EBIT before PPA

Following the Bombardier Transportation acquisition and with effect from the fiscal year 2021/22 condensed consolidated financial statements, Alstom decided to introduce the ""EBIT before PPA"" KPI aimed at restating its Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (""EBIT"") to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination. This KPI is also aligned with market practice.

Adjusted EBIT

Adjusted EBIT (""aEBIT"") is the Key Performance Indicator to present the level of recurring operational performance. This indicator is also aligned with market practice and comparable to direct competitors.

Starting September 2019, Alstom has opted for the inclusion of the share in net income of the equity-accounted investments into the aEBIT when these are considered to be part of the operating activities of the Group (because there are significant operational flows and/or common project execution with these entities). This mainly includes Chinese joint-ventures, namely CASCO joint-venture for Alstom as well as, following the integration of Bombardier Transportation, Alstom Sifang (Qingdao) Transportation Ltd. (formerly Bombardier Sifang), Bombardier NUG Propulsion System Co. Ltd and Changchun Changke Alstom Railway Vehicles Company Ltd (formerly Changchun Bombardier).

aEBIT corresponds to Earning Before Interests and Tax adjusted for the following elements:

A non-recurring item is a ""one-off"" exceptional item that is not supposed to occur again in following years and that is significant.

Adjusted EBIT margin corresponds to Adjusted EBIT expressed as a percentage of sales.

EBITDA + JV dividends

EBITDA before PPA plus dividends from joint ventures is the EBIT before PPA, before depreciation and amortisation, with the addition of the dividends received from joint ventures.

Adjusted net profit

The ""Adjusted Net Profit"" KPI restates Alstom's net profit from continued operations (Group share) to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination, net of the corresponding tax effect. This indicator is also aligned with market practice.

Free cash flow

Free Cash Flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures including capitalised development costs, net of proceeds from disposals of tangible and intangible assets. Free Cash Flow does not include any proceeds from disposals of activity.

The most directly comparable financial measure to Free Cash Flow calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS is net cash provided by operating activities.

Funds from Operations

Funds from Operations ""FFO"" in the EBIT to FCF statement refers to the Free Cash Flow generated by Operations, before Working Capital variations.

Contract and Trade Working Capital

Contract Working Capital is the sum of:

Trade Working Capital is the Working Capital that is not strictly related to contract. It includes all the elements of the working capital but

Net cash/(debt)

The net cash/(debt) is defined as cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and other current financial asset, less borrowings.

Pay-out ratio

The pay-out ratio is calculated by dividing the amount of the overall dividend with the ""Adjusted Net profit from continuing operations attributable to equity holders of the parent, Group share"" as presented in the management report in the consolidated financial statements.

Organic basis

This press release includes performance indicators presented on a reported basis and on an organic basis. Figures given on an organic basis eliminate the impact of changes in scope of consolidation and changes resulting from the translation of the accounts into Euro following the variation of foreign currencies against the Euro.

The Group uses figures prepared on an organic basis both for internal analysis and for external communication, as it believes they provide means to analyse and explain variations from one period to another. However, these figures are not measurements of performance under IFRS.",wallstreet-online.de,news,wallstreet:online,,0.1686274509803922,452842931,5,https://assets.wallstreet-online.de/_media/6/source1280/size_645/globenewswire-1280.png,eng-9548481

8 May 2024 - Between 1 April 2023 and 31 March 2024, Alstom booked €18.9 billion of orders. Sales were €17.6 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio at 1.1.

The backlog reached €92 billion, providing strong visibility on future sales. Gross margin on backlog reached 17.5% as of 31 March 2024, compared to 16.9% on 31 March 2023.

In the fiscal year 2023/24, Alstom's adjusted EBIT was €997 million, up 17%, equivalent to a 5.7% aEBIT margin, and EBIT before PPA was €356 million. Adjusted net profit was €44 million, net income (group share) was €(309) million, and free cash flow was €(557) million for the full year.

On 31 March 2024, the Group's net debt position stood at €(2,994) million, compared to the €(2,135) million the Group reported on 31 March 2023. Alstom benefits from a solid €6.3 billion liquidity position and equity amounting to €8,778 million on 31 March 2024.

The Board of Directors, in its meeting of 7 May 2024, proposed that no dividend will be paid with regards to the fiscal year 2023/24.

""Alstom recorded a strong rebound during the second half of the year, with solid order intake, strong organic growth, improved profitability and €562 million free cash-flow generation. Thanks to the support of our reference shareholders, we will swiftly execute the €2 billion deleveraging plan, allowing for the stabilization of its Investment Grade rating. In April, we announced the sale of Alstom's conventional signalling business in North America at a favourable valuation, demonstrating the quality and attractiveness of the Group's assets. We are confident in the strength of our backlog and our strategy of selectivity and mix evolution towards services. The Group is capitalizing on the solid operational progress made over the last three years and is launching new initiatives to improve its industrial performance and reduce overheads and indirect procurement costs. Altogether, Alstom is now set on stronger foundations to deliver sustainable profit and cash generation."" said Henri Poupart-Lafarge, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Alstom.

Progress on Alstom's action plan to support its financial targets

During the second half of fiscal year 2023/24, the Group mobilised around the operational, commercial, and cost efficiency plan:

The €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan highlighting commitment to Investment Grade

As announced in November 2023 and reiterated in January 2024, Alstom's Board of Directors is committed to a conservative financial policy and to protect the Group's Investment Grade rating, in particular through a ca. €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan.

This plan and its execution, which have been unanimously approved by Alstom's Board of Directors, has the following components:

The ca. €2.4 billion proceeds correspond to ca. €2 billion of deleveraging, mainly due to the hybrid bond's 50% Moody's debt content.

Each of CDPQ and Bpifrance, holding respectively 17.4% and 7.5% of Alstom's capital, has declared to the Company its intention to subscribe for its pro-rata share of the capital increase.

In addition, Alstom has entered into a standby underwriting commitment with BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, J.P. Morgan and Société Générale, acting as Joint Global Coordinators, pursuant to which they have undertaken to underwrite the remainder of the capital raise (i.e. ca. €750 million), subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions precedent.

Circa €1.2 billion of the proceeds of asset disposals and of the capital markets transactions will be used to repay financial debt by September 2024:

The remainder of the proceeds will be invested in highly liquid short-term investment (cash equivalent treatment) and will be earmarked for gross debt reduction at maturity.

Alstom Baa3 long-term issuer rating is reaffirmed, and the outlook will be changed to stable upon successful closing of the hybrid bond issuance and the rights issue.

Alstom will terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following the execution of the deleveraging plan.

During the fiscal year 2023/24, the Group recorded €18.9 billion in orders, with commercial success across multiple geographies, notably in Europe, Asia/Pacific and in Americas. During the last fiscal year, Alstom reported an order intake of €20.7 billion. The (8)% decrease is mostly driven by last year's landmark contract awarded by Landesanstalt Schienenfahrzeuge Baden Württemberg (SFBW) network in Germany of almost €2.5 billion.

2. Innovation by Pioneering Smarter and Greener Mobility for All

As of end of March 2024, research and development gross costs amounted to €749 million, i.e. 4.3% of sales, delivering on the Alstom In Motion strategy which is based on three pillars: Autonomous mobility, Data factory and Mobility orchestration. Net R&D amounts to €549 million before PPA amortisation.

Programs funded by IPCEI Hydrogen are ongoing. This important European program supports the development of new hydrogen trains for regional applications, shunting locos and freight, leveraging on the experience collected with Coradia iLint™ regional trains that are now in revenue service.

Homologation tests of Avelia Horizon™ are planned in 2024 to enable a start of revenue service in 2025. The development of international configurations is ongoing. Alstom has launched the development of Avelia stream™ 300, addressing the high-speed single deck segment with a first project for Italy.

The replacement of Adessia™ commuter train has been launched to address the U.K. and USA markets. This new product range will include EMU, BMU, BEMU and HMU versions to also replace the existing Diesel trains.

TRAXX™ Multi-system 3 - locomotives is pursuing homologation tests in 2024 to enable it to run on the different European corridors. It includes the passenger version which can be operated at 200kph.

Services product line is focused on addressing green, sustainable and more efficient operation concepts. Green re-tractioning initiatives include for example the retrofit with hydrogen-fuelled internal combustion engines for locomotives and the ability to provide autonomy for non-electrified lines via the so-called ""Last-mile"" functionality supported by the IPCEI H2 program.

Signalling Product Line worked on Onvia Control™ L2 A and Onvia Control™ L2 B European Standard convergence, driving market presence with its integration into TRAXX platform and securing new contracts for cross border operation, Onvia Cab™ level 2 and level 3 on-board solution together with Automatic Train Operation, and it continued its footprint expansion with a new contract in Canada.

Alstom Innovations cluster continued to develop Autonomous Mobility solutions for Passengers & Freight trains. Major milestones on the roadmap to achieve GoA4 (Grade of Automation 4) have been successfully passed under real mainline operating conditions on passengers and freight train with SNCF in France, and for operation in yard in the Netherlands.

Alstom has also made great strides in developing a new SaaS platform that will enhance its global digital offering. The platform streamlines applications integration and deployment in a trusted and future-proof ecosystem.

The adjusted EBIT margin has progressed from 5.2% over the fiscal year 2022/23 to 5.7% over the fiscal year 2023/24, benefiting from further synergies for 30bps, a steady reduction of non-performing legacy contracts sales for an impact of 30bps, an increased volume and favourable mix delivering 20bps gross margin expansion, partially offset by the negative gross margin impact related to the legacy portfolio deviations for (30)bps.

Alstom recorded restructuring and rationalisation charges of €(147) million mainly related to the reduction of overhead costs for €(115) million (""Autumn"" plan) and adaptation of the production setup for €(32) million, including the United Kingdom for €(14) million, Germany for €(8) million, France for €(3) million, Spain for €(3) million and the U.S.A. for €(2) million.

Costs related to the integration of Bombardier Transportation were recorded for an amount of €(142) million. €(118) million charges were related to some legal proceedings outside the ordinary course of business mainly for two projects - in U.S.A. and in Turkey, and for legal fees in the context of the claim against Bombardier Inc. €(30) million were related to impairment of assets due to the exit from Russia. Other exceptional expenses were recorded for €(73) million, of which €(36) million of consequential impacts from restructuring plan already initiated in Germany.

Alstom's EBIT before amortisation and impairment of assets exclusively valued when determining the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") stood at €356 million. This compares to €366 million for the last fiscal year.

The share in net income from equity investments amounted to €7 million, excluding the amortisation of the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") from Chinese joint ventures of €(10) million.

Adjusted net profit, representing the group's share of net profit from continued operations excluding PPA net of tax, amounts to €44 million for the fiscal year 2023/24. This compares to an adjusted net profit of €292 million during the last fiscal year.

The Group's Net profit/(loss) (Group share) stood at €(309) million for the fiscal year 2023/24, compared to €(132) million last fiscal year.

4. Financial structure

The Group's Free Cash Flow stands at €(557) million for the fiscal year 2023/24 as compared to €199 million during the last fiscal year and €(1,119) million at the first half of fiscal year 2023/24. Cash generation was impacted over the full year by an unfavourable €(856) million change in working capital compared to €(219) million in the last fiscal year; mostly due to change in Trade Working Capital as well as the reversal effect of the change in law on VAT in France for €(380) million. The Contract Working Capital is positively impacted by the acceleration of deliveries from major contracts in the second half of the year, strong collections of down payments as well as reduction of provision for risk on contracts.

On 31 March 2024, the Group recorded a net debt position of €(2,994) million.

In addition to its available cash and cash equivalents, amounting to €976 million on 31 March 2024, the Group benefits from strong liquidity with:

The first facility has two six-month extension options remaining at borrowers' discretion. Alstom will, however, terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following execution of the deleveraging plan.

The last two facilities have been successfully extended by one year. On 31 March 2024, the €1.75 billion RCF line had been drawn down for €175 million, while the other two lines remained undrawn.

As per its conservative liquidity policy, the €2.5 billion Revolving Credit Facility serves as a back-up of the Group €2.5 billion Negotiable European Commercial Papers program in place. With these RCF lines (€175 million drawn on the RCF on 31 March 2024), the €1.03 billion of Neu CP outstanding on 31 March 2024, the Group benefitted from a €6.3 billion liquidity available.

5. One Alstom team - Agile, Inclusive and Responsible

Decarbonization is at the heart of Alstom's strategy. The Group is reducing its Scope 1 & 2 emissions reaching 139 ktonCO2e (representing a 39% decrease compared to March 2022), while collaborating with suppliers and customers on reducing its Scope 3 footprint. First results of this collaboration can be seen through the reduction of emissions intensity of sold product reaching 4.0 gCO2e/pass.km (i.e. (13)% compared to March 2022). Alstom CO2e emissions reduction targets had been validated on the 6 of July 2023 by the independent Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) as in line with requirements to reach Paris Agreement commitments.

The supply of electricity from renewable sources has also been expanded. Alstom signed a significant Power Purchase Agreement focused on solar development in Spain. The solar farm is expected to begin operations early 2025 with a 10-years contract. The project will cover the equivalent of 80% of Alstom's electricity consumption in Europe, so this is a major step in reaching the target of 100% electricity consumption from renewables.

Regarding Diversity & Inclusion, the Alstom in Motion (AiM) 2025 strategy targets to reach 28% of women managers, engineers and professionals' roles by 2025. As of end of March 2024, 24.7% of manager, engineer and professional roles are held by women. Alstom will continue to accelerate its efforts in the coming months.

Alstom's Corporate Social Responsibility performance is regularly evaluated by various rating agencies; the Group maintained its presence among the CAC40 ESG index for the third consecutive year and the DJSI for the 13 consecutive year. Alstom improved is scoring to ECOVADIS questionnaire with a score of 77/100 and kept AA score with MSCI agency. In addition, in 2024, Alstom improved is CDP rating, moving from B to A-. Those results reflect its strong position and strategy on Sustainability.

In addition, Alstom published for the second year European Taxonomy-aligned KPIs about Sales, Capex and Opex, pursuing strong analysis initiated last year. EU Taxonomy-aligned sales amounted to 60% and ranked Alstom among best in class, confirming the importance of the sector in which Alstom operates in achieving the EU's ambition of carbon neutrality by 2050. The EU Taxonomy purpose is to redirect capital flows towards sustainable activities and help navigate transition to a low carbon economy.

The outlook for FY 2024/25 is based on following main assumptions:

Considering the slight dilution from disposals and the revised timing of the impact from industrial optimisation, the Group expects to reach this profitability range in FY 2026/27, versus FY 2025/26 previously.

APPENDIX 4 - NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INDICATORS DEFINITIONS

This section presents financial indicators used by the Group that are not defined by accounting standard setters.

Orders received

A new order is recognised as an order received only when the contract creates enforceable obligations between the Group and its customer. When this condition is met, the order is recognised at the contract value. If the contract is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the reporting unit, the Group requires the immediate elimination of currency exposure using forward currency sales. Orders are then measured using the spot rate at inception of hedging instruments.

Book-to-Bill

The book-to-bill ratio is the ratio of orders received to the amount of sales traded for a specific period.

Gross margin % on backlog

Gross Margin % on backlog is a KPI that presents the expected performance level of firm contracts in backlog. It represents the difference between the sales not yet recognized and the cost of sales not yet incurred from the contracts in backlog. This % is an average of the portfolio of contracts in backlog and is meaningful to project mid- and long-term profitability.

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA is a KPI that presents the level of recurring operational performance. It represents the sales minus the cost of sales, adjusted to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination as well as significant, non-recurring ""one off"" items that are not expected to occur again in subsequent years.

EBIT before PPA

Following the Bombardier Transportation acquisition and with effect from the fiscal year 2021/22 condensed consolidated financial statements, Alstom decided to introduce the ""EBIT before PPA"" KPI aimed at restating its Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (""EBIT"") to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination. This KPI is also aligned with market practice.

Adjusted EBIT

Adjusted EBIT (""aEBIT"") is the Key Performance Indicator to present the level of recurring operational performance. This indicator is also aligned with market practice and comparable to direct competitors.

Starting September 2019, Alstom has opted for the inclusion of the share in net income of the equity-accounted investments into the aEBIT when these are considered to be part of the operating activities of the Group (because there are significant operational flows and/or common project execution with these entities). This mainly includes Chinese joint-ventures, namely CASCO joint-venture for Alstom as well as, following the integration of Bombardier Transportation, Alstom Sifang (Qingdao) Transportation Ltd. (formerly Bombardier Sifang), Bombardier NUG Propulsion System Co. Ltd and Changchun Changke Alstom Railway Vehicles Company Ltd (formerly Changchun Bombardier).

aEBIT corresponds to Earning Before Interests and Tax adjusted for the following elements:

A non-recurring item is a ""one-off"" exceptional item that is not supposed to occur again in following years and that is significant.

Adjusted EBIT margin corresponds to Adjusted EBIT expressed as a percentage of sales.

EBITDA + JV dividends

EBITDA before PPA plus dividends from joint ventures is the EBIT before PPA, before depreciation and amortisation, with the addition of the dividends received from joint ventures.

Adjusted net profit

The ""Adjusted Net Profit"" KPI restates Alstom's net profit from continued operations (Group share) to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination, net of the corresponding tax effect. This indicator is also aligned with market practice.

Free cash flow

Free Cash Flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures including capitalised development costs, net of proceeds from disposals of tangible and intangible assets. Free Cash Flow does not include any proceeds from disposals of activity.

The most directly comparable financial measure to Free Cash Flow calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS is net cash provided by operating activities.

Funds from Operations

Funds from Operations ""FFO"" in the EBIT to FCF statement refers to the Free Cash Flow generated by Operations, before Working Capital variations.

Contract and Trade Working Capital

Contract Working Capital is the sum of:

Trade Working Capital is the Working Capital that is not strictly related to contract. It includes all the elements of the working capital but

Net cash/(debt)

The net cash/(debt) is defined as cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and other current financial asset, less borrowings.

Pay-out ratio

The pay-out ratio is calculated by dividing the amount of the overall dividend with the ""Adjusted Net profit from continuing operations attributable to equity holders of the parent, Group share"" as presented in the management report in the consolidated financial statements.

Organic basis

This press release includes performance indicators presented on a reported basis and on an organic basis. Figures given on an organic basis eliminate the impact of changes in scope of consolidation and changes resulting from the translation of the accounts into Euro following the variation of foreign currencies against the Euro.

The Group uses figures prepared on an organic basis both for internal analysis and for external communication, as it believes they provide means to analyse and explain variations from one period to another. However, these figures are not measurements of performance under IFRS.",marketscreener.com,news,Market Screener,,0.1686274509803922,452842765,5,https://www.marketscreener.com/images/twitter_MS_fdblanc.png,

The backlog reached €92 billion, providing strong visibility on future sales. Gross margin on backlog reached 17.5% as of 31 March 2024, compared to 16.9% on 31 March 2023.

In the fiscal year 2023/24, Alstom's adjusted EBIT was €997 million, up 17%, equivalent to a 5.7% aEBIT margin, and EBIT before PPA was €356 million. Adjusted net profit was €44 million, net income (group share) was €(309) million, and free cash flow was €(557) million for the full year.

On 31 March 2024, the Group's net debt position stood at €(2,994) million, compared to the €(2,135) million the Group reported on 31 March 2023. Alstom benefits from a solid €6.3 billion liquidity position and equity amounting to €8,778 million on 31 March 2024.

The Board of Directors, in its meeting of 7 May 2024, proposed that no dividend will be paid with regards to the fiscal year 2023/24.

""Alstom recorded a strong rebound during the second half of the year, with solid order intake, strong organic growth, improved profitability and €562 million free cash-flow generation. Thanks to the support of our reference shareholders, we will swiftly execute the €2 billion deleveraging plan, allowing for the stabilization of its Investment Grade rating. In April, we announced the sale of Alstom's conventional signalling business in North America at a favourable valuation, demonstrating the quality and attractiveness of the Group's assets. We are confident in the strength of our backlog and our strategy of selectivity and mix evolution towards services. The Group is capitalizing on the solid operational progress made over the last three years and is launching new initiatives to improve its industrial performance and reduce overheads and indirect procurement costs. Altogether, Alstom is now set on stronger foundations to deliver sustainable profit and cash generation."" said Henri Poupart-Lafarge, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Alstom.

Progress on Alstom's action plan to support its financial targets

During the second half of fiscal year 2023/24, the Group mobilised around the operational, commercial, and cost efficiency plan:

The €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan highlighting commitment to Investment Grade

As announced in November 2023 and reiterated in January 2024, Alstom's Board of Directors is committed to a conservative financial policy and to protect the Group's Investment Grade rating, in particular through a ca. €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan.

This plan and its execution, which have been unanimously approved by Alstom's Board of Directors, has the following components:

The ca. €2.4 billion proceeds correspond to ca. €2 billion of deleveraging, mainly due to the hybrid bond's 50% Moody's debt content.

Each of CDPQ and Bpifrance, holding respectively 17.4% and 7.5% of Alstom's capital, has declared to the Company its intention to subscribe for its pro-rata share of the capital increase.

In addition, Alstom has entered into a standby underwriting commitment with BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, J.P. Morgan and Société Générale, acting as Joint Global Coordinators, pursuant to which they have undertaken to underwrite the remainder of the capital raise (i.e. ca. €750 million), subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions precedent.

Circa €1.2 billion of the proceeds of asset disposals and of the capital markets transactions will be used to repay financial debt by September 2024:

The remainder of the proceeds will be invested in highly liquid short-term investment (cash equivalent treatment) and will be earmarked for gross debt reduction at maturity.

Alstom Baa3 long-term issuer rating is reaffirmed, and the outlook will be changed to stable upon successful closing of the hybrid bond issuance and the rights issue.

Alstom will terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following the execution of the deleveraging plan.

During the fiscal year 2023/24, the Group recorded €18.9 billion in orders, with commercial success across multiple geographies, notably in Europe, Asia/Pacific and in Americas. During the last fiscal year, Alstom reported an order intake of €20.7 billion. The (8)% decrease is mostly driven by last year's landmark contract awarded by Landesanstalt Schienenfahrzeuge Baden Württemberg (SFBW) network in Germany of almost €2.5 billion.

In Europe, Alstom recorded €11.3 billion order intake during the fiscal year 2023/24, compared with €12.8 billion over the last fiscal year.

In the U.K, Alstom has signed an eight-year extension to its Train Services Agreement (TSA) with CrossCountry. The contract extension, valued at around €950 million, further secures this long-term partnership and is evidence of the trust placed by the customer.

In France, Alstom will supply île-de-France Mobilités and RATP with 103 new MF19 trainsets, which is the new generation metro on rail, for a total contract value of more than €800 million, 100% financed by Île-de-France Mobilités. This new fleet will replace the existing rolling stock on lines 13, 12 and 8 of the Île-de-France metro as of 2027. The Group also signed a framework contract with Akiem European rolling stock leasing company for 100 Traxx Universal multi-system (MS3) locomotives, together with an initial firm order for 65 locomotives. The total amount of the framework agreement is up €500 million.

In Germany, Alstom was awarded a contract to supply 40 Coradia Stream High-Capacity electric multiple units together with full maintenance for 30 years to Nahverkehrsverbund Schleswig-Holstein (NAH.SH), valued at close to €900 million, and including an option for up to 55 additional trains with a corresponding full-service package. The Group also signed a contract with RAILPOOL for 50 Traxx Universal multi-purpose locomotives.

In Romania, Alstom, as part of a consortium with the civil works companies Gulermak and Arcada, also signed a contract with the Cluj-Napoca City Hall in Romania for the construction of the Cluj-Napoca Metro Line 1. Alstom's share of this state-of-the-art turnkey project reaches approximately €400 million.

In Italy, Alstom was awarded a contract for the supply of high-speed trains.

In Americas, Alstom reported €2.0 billion order intake, compared with €2.7 billion over the last fiscal year, driven by a contract with the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) in the United States to deliver 130 full low floor electric streetcars for Philadelphia, valued at over €667 million and with options to build an additional 30 streetcars. And the Group was awarded a contract by the Connecticut Department of Transportation (CTDOT) in the United States to supply 60 single-level rail coach cars valued at approximately €285 million with options to build an additional 313 cars, as part of CTDOT's coach renewal program for its statewide rail system.

In Asia/Pacific, the order intake stood at €3.2 billion, compared to €3.0 billion for the last fiscal year. In the Philippines, Alstom in consortium with Colas Rail has been awarded by Mitsubishi Corporation a contract to provide an integrated railway system for the extension of the North-South Commuter Railway project (NSCR). Alstom's contract share is worth approximately €1 billion. In Australia, Alstom has been awarded a contract worth around €900 million to maintain the regional rolling stock VLocity and Classic fleets in Victoria, Australia for the next decade.

In Africa/Middle East/Central Asia, the Group reported €2.4 billion order intake, compared with €2.2 billion over the last fiscal year. In Israel, Alstom, a member of the TMT Consortium (TLV Metropolitan Tramway Ltd.) and its partners Electra Ltd. & Dan Public Transportation Ltd., have reached financial closure on the contract, awarded in May 2022, to design, build, maintain, and finance the Tel Aviv Metropolitan LRT Green line by Metropolitan Mass Transit System Ltd (NTA). Alstom's share is valued at €858 million. In Saudi Arabia, Alstom signed a contract of over €500 million with The Royal Commission for AlUla (RCU) for AlUla's pioneering battery-powered tramway - the world's longest catenary-free line.

As of 31 March 2024, the backlog stood at €92 billion, providing the Group with strong visibility over future sales.

Alstom's sales amounted to €17.6 billion for the fiscal year 2023/24, representing a growth of 6.7% on a reported basis and a strong 9.4% on an organic basis compared with Alstom sales in the last fiscal year. Sales related to non-performing backlog, corresponding to sales on legacy projects with a negative margin at completion, amounted to €1.7 billion during the fiscal year 2023/24.

Rolling stock sales reached €9.1 billion, representing an increase of 3.9% on a reported basis and 6.5% on an organic basis, driven by contracts ramp-up in France, Belgium and in the US, and the solid level of execution in South Africa, India and Europe.

Services sales stood at €4.3 billion, up 11.9% on a reported basis and 14.3% on an organic basis versus last year, benefiting from the continuous ramp-up in the UK, in Italy and in the US as well as a solid level of execution in Canada.

In Signalling, Alstom reported €2.6 billion sales, up 8.9% on a reported basis and 11.8% on an organic basis versus last year, led by a consistent execution across all regions, mainly in Europe and in APAC.

Systems sales grew 6.9% on a reported basis and 9.3% on an organic basis, and stood at €1.6 billion, driven by a good performance of Turnkey Systems projects in Mexico, Egypt and Canada.

On 14 September 2023, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US department of Treasury added JSC Transmashholding (TMH AO) to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Person (SDN) List. TMH AO is the Russian holding company of TMH Group and is 100% owned by TMH Limited, and Alstom was holding a 20% stake in TMH limited. The Group further assessed potential exposures arising from the new OFAC sanctions and made the decision to sell its stake in TMH. The transaction was closed early January 2024 for an amount of €75 million, carrying value was nil as result of previous impairment, contributing to the de-risking of the company's portfolio.

On 19 April 2024, Alstom announced that it had entered into a binding agreement with Knorr-Bremse AG, to sell Alstom's North American conventional signalling business for a purchase price of around €630 million. Closing of the transaction is only subject to customary conditions, including regulatory approval, and is expected to take place as soon as summer 2024. Proceeds for Alstom at closing, net of expected tax and transaction costs, are expected to be around €620 million.

As of end of March 2024, research and development gross costs amounted to €749 million, i.e. 4.3% of sales, delivering on the Alstom In Motion strategy which is based on three pillars: Autonomous mobility, Data factory and Mobility orchestration. Net R&D amounts to €549 million before PPA amortisation.

Programs funded by IPCEI Hydrogen are ongoing. This important European program supports the development of new hydrogen trains for regional applications, shunting locos and freight, leveraging on the experience collected with Coradia iLint™ regional trains that are now in revenue service.

Homologation tests of Avelia Horizon™ are planned in 2024 to enable a start of revenue service in 2025. The development of international configurations is ongoing. Alstom has launched the development of Avelia stream™ 300, addressing the high-speed single deck segment with a first project for Italy.

The replacement of Adessia™ commuter train has been launched to address the U.K. and USA markets. This new product range will include EMU, BMU, BEMU and HMU versions to also replace the existing Diesel trains.

TRAXX™ Multi-system 3 - locomotives is pursuing homologation tests in 2024 to enable it to run on the different European corridors. It includes the passenger version which can be operated at 200kph.

Services product line is focused on addressing green, sustainable and more efficient operation concepts. Green re-tractioning initiatives include for example the retrofit with hydrogen-fuelled internal combustion engines for locomotives and the ability to provide autonomy for non-electrified lines via the so-called ""Last-mile"" functionality supported by the IPCEI H2 program.

Signalling Product Line worked on Onvia Control™ L2 A and Onvia Control™ L2 B European Standard convergence, driving market presence with its integration into TRAXX platform and securing new contracts for cross border operation, Onvia Cab™ level 2 and level 3 on-board solution together with Automatic Train Operation, and it continued its footprint expansion with a new contract in Canada.

Alstom Innovations cluster continued to develop Autonomous Mobility solutions for Passengers & Freight trains. Major milestones on the roadmap to achieve GoA4 (Grade of Automation 4) have been successfully passed under real mainline operating conditions on passengers and freight train with SNCF in France, and for operation in yard in the Netherlands.

Alstom has also made great strides in developing a new SaaS platform that will enhance its global digital offering. The platform streamlines applications integration and deployment in a trusted and future-proof ecosystem.

The adjusted EBIT margin has progressed from 5.2% over the fiscal year 2022/23 to 5.7% over the fiscal year 2023/24, benefiting from further synergies for 30bps, a steady reduction of non-performing legacy contracts sales for an impact of 30bps, an increased volume and favourable mix delivering 20bps gross margin expansion, partially offset by the negative gross margin impact related to the legacy portfolio deviations for (30)bps.

Alstom recorded restructuring and rationalisation charges of €(147) million mainly related to the reduction of overhead costs for €(115) million (""Autumn"" plan) and adaptation of the production setup for €(32) million, including the United Kingdom for €(14) million, Germany for €(8) million, France for €(3) million, Spain for €(3) million and the U.S.A. for €(2) million.

Costs related to the integration of Bombardier Transportation were recorded for an amount of €(142) million. €(118) million charges were related to some legal proceedings outside the ordinary course of business mainly for two projects - in U.S.A. and in Turkey, and for legal fees in the context of the claim against Bombardier Inc. €(30) million were related to impairment of assets due to the exit from Russia. Other exceptional expenses were recorded for €(73) million, of which €(36) million of consequential impacts from restructuring plan already initiated in Germany.

Alstom's EBIT before amortisation and impairment of assets exclusively valued when determining the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") stood at €356 million. This compares to €366 million for the last fiscal year.

The share in net income from equity investments amounted to €7 million, excluding the amortisation of the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") from Chinese joint ventures of €(10) million.

Adjusted net profit, representing the group's share of net profit from continued operations excluding PPA net of tax, amounts to €44 million for the fiscal year 2023/24. This compares to an adjusted net profit of €292 million during the last fiscal year.

The Group's Net profit/(loss) (Group share) stood at €(309) million for the fiscal year 2023/24, compared to €(132) million last fiscal year.

4. Financial structure

The Group's Free Cash Flow stands at €(557) million for the fiscal year 2023/24 as compared to €199 million during the last fiscal year and €(1,119) million at the first half of fiscal year 2023/24. Cash generation was impacted over the full year by an unfavourable €(856) million change in working capital compared to €(219) million in the last fiscal year; mostly due to change in Trade Working Capital as well as the reversal effect of the change in law on VAT in France for €(380) million. The Contract Working Capital is positively impacted by the acceleration of deliveries from major contracts in the second half of the year, strong collections of down payments as well as reduction of provision for risk on contracts.

On 31 March 2024, the Group recorded a net debt position of €(2,994) million.

In addition to its available cash and cash equivalents, amounting to €976 million on 31 March 2024, the Group benefits from strong liquidity with:

The first facility has two six-month extension options remaining at borrowers' discretion. Alstom will, however, terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following execution of the deleveraging plan.

The last two facilities have been successfully extended by one year. On 31 March 2024, the €1.75 billion RCF line had been drawn down for €175 million, while the other two lines remained undrawn.

As per its conservative liquidity policy, the €2.5 billion Revolving Credit Facility serves as a back-up of the Group €2.5 billion Negotiable European Commercial Papers program in place. With these RCF lines (€175 million drawn on the RCF on 31 March 2024), the €1.03 billion of Neu CP outstanding on 31 March 2024, the Group benefitted from a €6.3 billion liquidity available.

5. One Alstom team - Agile, Inclusive and Responsible

Decarbonization is at the heart of Alstom's strategy. The Group is reducing its Scope 1 & 2 emissions reaching 139 ktonCO2e (representing a 39% decrease compared to March 2022), while collaborating with suppliers and customers on reducing its Scope 3 footprint. First results of this collaboration can be seen through the reduction of emissions intensity of sold product reaching 4.0 gCO2e/pass.km (i.e. (13)% compared to March 2022). Alstom CO2e emissions reduction targets had been validated on the 6 of July 2023 by the independent Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) as in line with requirements to reach Paris Agreement commitments.

The supply of electricity from renewable sources has also been expanded. Alstom signed a significant Power Purchase Agreement focused on solar development in Spain. The solar farm is expected to begin operations early 2025 with a 10-years contract. The project will cover the equivalent of 80% of Alstom's electricity consumption in Europe, so this is a major step in reaching the target of 100% electricity consumption from renewables.

Regarding Diversity & Inclusion, the Alstom in Motion (AiM) 2025 strategy targets to reach 28% of women managers, engineers and professionals' roles by 2025. As of end of March 2024, 24.7% of manager, engineer and professional roles are held by women. Alstom will continue to accelerate its efforts in the coming months.

Alstom's Corporate Social Responsibility performance is regularly evaluated by various rating agencies; the Group maintained its presence among the CAC40 ESG index for the third consecutive year and the DJSI for the 13 consecutive year. Alstom improved is scoring to ECOVADIS questionnaire with a score of 77/100 and kept AA score with MSCI agency. In addition, in 2024, Alstom improved is CDP rating, moving from B to A-. Those results reflect its strong position and strategy on Sustainability.

In addition, Alstom published for the second year European Taxonomy-aligned KPIs about Sales, Capex and Opex, pursuing strong analysis initiated last year. EU Taxonomy-aligned sales amounted to 60% and ranked Alstom among best in class, confirming the importance of the sector in which Alstom operates in achieving the EU's ambition of carbon neutrality by 2050. The EU Taxonomy purpose is to redirect capital flows towards sustainable activities and help navigate transition to a low carbon economy.

The outlook for FY 2024/25 is based on following main assumptions:

FY 2024/25 Outlook:

Considering the slight dilution from disposals and the revised timing of the impact from industrial optimisation, the Group expects to reach this profitability range in FY 2026/27, versus FY 2025/26 previously.

APPENDIX 4 - NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INDICATORS DEFINITIONS

This section presents financial indicators used by the Group that are not defined by accounting standard setters.

Orders received

A new order is recognised as an order received only when the contract creates enforceable obligations between the Group and its customer. When this condition is met, the order is recognised at the contract value. If the contract is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the reporting unit, the Group requires the immediate elimination of currency exposure using forward currency sales. Orders are then measured using the spot rate at inception of hedging instruments.

Book-to-Bill

The book-to-bill ratio is the ratio of orders received to the amount of sales traded for a specific period.

Gross margin % on backlog

Gross Margin % on backlog is a KPI that presents the expected performance level of firm contracts in backlog. It represents the difference between the sales not yet recognized and the cost of sales not yet incurred from the contracts in backlog. This % is an average of the portfolio of contracts in backlog and is meaningful to project mid- and long-term profitability.

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA is a KPI that presents the level of recurring operational performance. It represents the sales minus the cost of sales, adjusted to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination as well as significant, non-recurring ""one off"" items that are not expected to occur again in subsequent years.

EBIT before PPA

Following the Bombardier Transportation acquisition and with effect from the fiscal year 2021/22 condensed consolidated financial statements, Alstom decided to introduce the ""EBIT before PPA"" KPI aimed at restating its Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (""EBIT"") to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination. This KPI is also aligned with market practice.

Adjusted EBIT

Adjusted EBIT (""aEBIT"") is the Key Performance Indicator to present the level of recurring operational performance. This indicator is also aligned with market practice and comparable to direct competitors.

Starting September 2019, Alstom has opted for the inclusion of the share in net income of the equity-accounted investments into the aEBIT when these are considered to be part of the operating activities of the Group (because there are significant operational flows and/or common project execution with these entities). This mainly includes Chinese joint-ventures, namely CASCO joint-venture for Alstom as well as, following the integration of Bombardier Transportation, Alstom Sifang (Qingdao) Transportation Ltd. (formerly Bombardier Sifang), Bombardier NUG Propulsion System Co. Ltd and Changchun Changke Alstom Railway Vehicles Company Ltd (formerly Changchun Bombardier).

aEBIT corresponds to Earning Before Interests and Tax adjusted for the following elements:

A non-recurring item is a ""one-off"" exceptional item that is not supposed to occur again in following years and that is significant.

Adjusted EBIT margin corresponds to Adjusted EBIT expressed as a percentage of sales.

EBITDA + JV dividends

EBITDA before PPA plus dividends from joint ventures is the EBIT before PPA, before depreciation and amortisation, with the addition of the dividends received from joint ventures.

Adjusted net profit

The ""Adjusted Net Profit"" KPI restates Alstom's net profit from continued operations (Group share) to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination, net of the corresponding tax effect. This indicator is also aligned with market practice.

Free cash flow

Free Cash Flow is de?ned as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures including capitalised development costs, net of proceeds from disposals of tangible and intangible assets. Free Cash Flow does not include any proceeds from disposals of activity.

The most directly comparable financial measure to Free Cash Flow calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS is net cash provided by operating activities.

Funds from Operations

Funds from Operations ""FFO"" in the EBIT to FCF statement refers to the Free Cash Flow generated by Operations, before Working Capital variations.

Contract and Trade Working Capital

Contract Working Capital is the sum of:

Trade Working Capital is the Working Capital that is not strictly related to contract. It includes all the elements of the working capital but

Net cash/(debt)

The net cash/(debt) is defined as cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and other current financial asset, less borrowings.

Pay-out ratio

The pay-out ratio is calculated by dividing the amount of the overall dividend with the ""Adjusted Net profit from continuing operations attributable to equity holders of the parent, Group share"" as presented in the management report in the consolidated financial statements.

Organic basis

This press release includes performance indicators presented on a reported basis and on an organic basis. Figures given on an organic basis eliminate the impact of changes in scope of consolidation and changes resulting from the translation of the accounts into Euro following the variation of foreign currencies against the Euro.

The Group uses figures prepared on an organic basis both for internal analysis and for external communication, as it believes they provide means to analyse and explain variations from one period to another. However, these figures are not measurements of performance under IFRS.",finanzen.at,news,finanzen.at,,0.223529411764706,452842634,5,https://www.finanzen.at/Images/FacebookIcon.jpg,eng-9548481

The backlog reached €92 billion, providing strong visibility on future sales. Gross margin on backlog reached 17.5% as of 31 March 2024, compared to 16.9% on 31 March 2023.

In the fiscal year 2023/24, Alstom's adjusted EBIT was €997 million, up 17%, equivalent to a 5.7% aEBIT margin, and EBIT before PPA was €356 million. Adjusted net profit was €44 million, net income (group share) was €(309) million, and free cash flow was €(557) million for the full year.

On 31 March 2024, the Group's net debt position stood at €(2,994) million, compared to the €(2,135) million the Group reported on 31 March 2023. Alstom benefits from a solid €6.3 billion liquidity position and equity amounting to €8,778 million on 31 March 2024.

The Board of Directors, in its meeting of 7 May 2024, proposed that no dividend will be paid with regards to the fiscal year 2023/24.

""Alstom recorded a strong rebound during the second half of the year, with solid order intake, strong organic growth, improved profitability and €562 million free cash-flow generation. Thanks to the support of our reference shareholders, we will swiftly execute the €2 billion deleveraging plan, allowing for the stabilization of its Investment Grade rating. In April, we announced the sale of Alstom's conventional signalling business in North America at a favourable valuation, demonstrating the quality and attractiveness of the Group's assets. We are confident in the strength of our backlog and our strategy of selectivity and mix evolution towards services. The Group is capitalizing on the solid operational progress made over the last three years and is launching new initiatives to improve its industrial performance and reduce overheads and indirect procurement costs. Altogether, Alstom is now set on stronger foundations to deliver sustainable profit and cash generation."" said Henri Poupart-Lafarge, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Alstom.

Progress on Alstom's action plan to support its financial targets

During the second half of fiscal year 2023/24, the Group mobilised around the operational, commercial, and cost efficiency plan:

The €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan highlighting commitment to Investment Grade

As announced in November 2023 and reiterated in January 2024, Alstom's Board of Directors is committed to a conservative financial policy and to protect the Group's Investment Grade rating, in particular through a ca. €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan.

This plan and its execution, which have been unanimously approved by Alstom's Board of Directors, has the following components:

The ca. €2.4 billion proceeds correspond to ca. €2 billion of deleveraging, mainly due to the hybrid bond's 50% Moody's debt content.

Each of CDPQ and Bpifrance, holding respectively 17.4% and 7.5% of Alstom's capital, has declared to the Company its intention to subscribe for its pro-rata share of the capital increase.

In addition, Alstom has entered into a standby underwriting commitment with BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, J.P. Morgan and Société Générale, acting as Joint Global Coordinators, pursuant to which they have undertaken to underwrite the remainder of the capital raise (i.e. ca. €750 million), subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions precedent.

Circa €1.2 billion of the proceeds of asset disposals and of the capital markets transactions will be used to repay financial debt by September 2024:

The remainder of the proceeds will be invested in highly liquid short-term investment (cash equivalent treatment) and will be earmarked for gross debt reduction at maturity.

Alstom Baa3 long-term issuer rating is reaffirmed, and the outlook will be changed to stable upon successful closing of the hybrid bond issuance and the rights issue.

Alstom will terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following the execution of the deleveraging plan.

During the fiscal year 2023/24, the Group recorded €18.9 billion in orders, with commercial success across multiple geographies, notably in Europe, Asia/Pacific and in Americas. During the last fiscal year, Alstom reported an order intake of €20.7 billion. The (8)% decrease is mostly driven by last year's landmark contract awarded by Landesanstalt Schienenfahrzeuge Baden Württemberg (SFBW) network in Germany of almost €2.5 billion.

In Europe, Alstom recorded €11.3 billion order intake during the fiscal year 2023/24, compared with €12.8 billion over the last fiscal year.

In the U.K, Alstom has signed an eight-year extension to its Train Services Agreement (TSA) with CrossCountry. The contract extension, valued at around €950 million, further secures this long-term partnership and is evidence of the trust placed by the customer.

In France, Alstom will supply île-de-France Mobilités and RATP with 103 new MF19 trainsets, which is the new generation metro on rail, for a total contract value of more than €800 million, 100% financed by Île-de-France Mobilités. This new fleet will replace the existing rolling stock on lines 13, 12 and 8 of the Île-de-France metro as of 2027. The Group also signed a framework contract with Akiem European rolling stock leasing company for 100 Traxx Universal multi-system (MS3) locomotives, together with an initial firm order for 65 locomotives. The total amount of the framework agreement is up €500 million.

In Germany, Alstom was awarded a contract to supply 40 Coradia Stream High-Capacity electric multiple units together with full maintenance for 30 years to Nahverkehrsverbund Schleswig-Holstein (NAH.SH), valued at close to €900 million, and including an option for up to 55 additional trains with a corresponding full-service package. The Group also signed a contract with RAILPOOL for 50 Traxx Universal multi-purpose locomotives.

In Romania, Alstom, as part of a consortium with the civil works companies Gulermak and Arcada, also signed a contract with the Cluj-Napoca City Hall in Romania for the construction of the Cluj-Napoca Metro Line 1. Alstom's share of this state-of-the-art turnkey project reaches approximately €400 million.

In Italy, Alstom was awarded a contract for the supply of high-speed trains.

In Americas, Alstom reported €2.0 billion order intake, compared with €2.7 billion over the last fiscal year, driven by a contract with the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) in the United States to deliver 130 full low floor electric streetcars for Philadelphia, valued at over €667 million and with options to build an additional 30 streetcars. And the Group was awarded a contract by the Connecticut Department of Transportation (CTDOT) in the United States to supply 60 single-level rail coach cars valued at approximately €285 million with options to build an additional 313 cars, as part of CTDOT's coach renewal program for its statewide rail system.

In Asia/Pacific, the order intake stood at €3.2 billion, compared to €3.0 billion for the last fiscal year. In the Philippines, Alstom in consortium with Colas Rail has been awarded by Mitsubishi Corporation a contract to provide an integrated railway system for the extension of the North-South Commuter Railway project (NSCR). Alstom's contract share is worth approximately €1 billion. In Australia, Alstom has been awarded a contract worth around €900 million to maintain the regional rolling stock VLocity and Classic fleets in Victoria, Australia for the next decade.

In Africa/Middle East/Central Asia, the Group reported €2.4 billion order intake, compared with €2.2 billion over the last fiscal year. In Israel, Alstom, a member of the TMT Consortium (TLV Metropolitan Tramway Ltd.) and its partners Electra Ltd. & Dan Public Transportation Ltd., have reached financial closure on the contract, awarded in May 2022, to design, build, maintain, and finance the Tel Aviv Metropolitan LRT Green line by Metropolitan Mass Transit System Ltd (NTA). Alstom's share is valued at €858 million. In Saudi Arabia, Alstom signed a contract of over €500 million with The Royal Commission for AlUla (RCU) for AlUla's pioneering battery-powered tramway - the world's longest catenary-free line.

As of 31 March 2024, the backlog stood at €92 billion, providing the Group with strong visibility over future sales.

Alstom's sales amounted to €17.6 billion for the fiscal year 2023/24, representing a growth of 6.7% on a reported basis and a strong 9.4% on an organic basis compared with Alstom sales in the last fiscal year. Sales related to non-performing backlog, corresponding to sales on legacy projects with a negative margin at completion, amounted to €1.7 billion during the fiscal year 2023/24.

Rolling stock sales reached €9.1 billion, representing an increase of 3.9% on a reported basis and 6.5% on an organic basis, driven by contracts ramp-up in France, Belgium and in the US, and the solid level of execution in South Africa, India and Europe.

Services sales stood at €4.3 billion, up 11.9% on a reported basis and 14.3% on an organic basis versus last year, benefiting from the continuous ramp-up in the UK, in Italy and in the US as well as a solid level of execution in Canada.

In Signalling, Alstom reported €2.6 billion sales, up 8.9% on a reported basis and 11.8% on an organic basis versus last year, led by a consistent execution across all regions, mainly in Europe and in APAC.

Systems sales grew 6.9% on a reported basis and 9.3% on an organic basis, and stood at €1.6 billion, driven by a good performance of Turnkey Systems projects in Mexico, Egypt and Canada.

On 14 September 2023, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US department of Treasury added JSC Transmashholding (TMH AO) to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Person (SDN) List. TMH AO is the Russian holding company of TMH Group and is 100% owned by TMH Limited, and Alstom was holding a 20% stake in TMH limited. The Group further assessed potential exposures arising from the new OFAC sanctions and made the decision to sell its stake in TMH. The transaction was closed early January 2024 for an amount of €75 million, carrying value was nil as result of previous impairment, contributing to the de-risking of the company's portfolio.

On 19 April 2024, Alstom announced that it had entered into a binding agreement with Knorr-Bremse AG, to sell Alstom's North American conventional signalling business for a purchase price of around €630 million. Closing of the transaction is only subject to customary conditions, including regulatory approval, and is expected to take place as soon as summer 2024. Proceeds for Alstom at closing, net of expected tax and transaction costs, are expected to be around €620 million.

As of end of March 2024, research and development gross costs amounted to €749 million, i.e. 4.3% of sales, delivering on the Alstom In Motion strategy which is based on three pillars: Autonomous mobility, Data factory and Mobility orchestration. Net R&D amounts to €549 million before PPA amortisation.

Programs funded by IPCEI Hydrogen are ongoing. This important European program supports the development of new hydrogen trains for regional applications, shunting locos and freight, leveraging on the experience collected with Coradia iLint™ regional trains that are now in revenue service.

Homologation tests of Avelia Horizon™ are planned in 2024 to enable a start of revenue service in 2025. The development of international configurations is ongoing. Alstom has launched the development of Avelia stream™ 300, addressing the high-speed single deck segment with a first project for Italy.

The replacement of Adessia™ commuter train has been launched to address the U.K. and USA markets. This new product range will include EMU, BMU, BEMU and HMU versions to also replace the existing Diesel trains.

TRAXX™ Multi-system 3 - locomotives is pursuing homologation tests in 2024 to enable it to run on the different European corridors. It includes the passenger version which can be operated at 200kph.

Services product line is focused on addressing green, sustainable and more efficient operation concepts. Green re-tractioning initiatives include for example the retrofit with hydrogen-fuelled internal combustion engines for locomotives and the ability to provide autonomy for non-electrified lines via the so-called ""Last-mile"" functionality supported by the IPCEI H2 program.

Signalling Product Line worked on Onvia Control™ L2 A and Onvia Control™ L2 B European Standard convergence, driving market presence with its integration into TRAXX platform and securing new contracts for cross border operation, Onvia Cab™ level 2 and level 3 on-board solution together with Automatic Train Operation, and it continued its footprint expansion with a new contract in Canada.

Alstom Innovations cluster continued to develop Autonomous Mobility solutions for Passengers & Freight trains. Major milestones on the roadmap to achieve GoA4 (Grade of Automation 4) have been successfully passed under real mainline operating conditions on passengers and freight train with SNCF in France, and for operation in yard in the Netherlands.

Alstom has also made great strides in developing a new SaaS platform that will enhance its global digital offering. The platform streamlines applications integration and deployment in a trusted and future-proof ecosystem.

The adjusted EBIT margin has progressed from 5.2% over the fiscal year 2022/23 to 5.7% over the fiscal year 2023/24, benefiting from further synergies for 30bps, a steady reduction of non-performing legacy contracts sales for an impact of 30bps, an increased volume and favourable mix delivering 20bps gross margin expansion, partially offset by the negative gross margin impact related to the legacy portfolio deviations for (30)bps.

Alstom recorded restructuring and rationalisation charges of €(147) million mainly related to the reduction of overhead costs for €(115) million (""Autumn"" plan) and adaptation of the production setup for €(32) million, including the United Kingdom for €(14) million, Germany for €(8) million, France for €(3) million, Spain for €(3) million and the U.S.A. for €(2) million.

Costs related to the integration of Bombardier Transportation were recorded for an amount of €(142) million. €(118) million charges were related to some legal proceedings outside the ordinary course of business mainly for two projects - in U.S.A. and in Turkey, and for legal fees in the context of the claim against Bombardier Inc. €(30) million were related to impairment of assets due to the exit from Russia. Other exceptional expenses were recorded for €(73) million, of which €(36) million of consequential impacts from restructuring plan already initiated in Germany.

Alstom's EBIT before amortisation and impairment of assets exclusively valued when determining the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") stood at €356 million. This compares to €366 million for the last fiscal year.

The share in net income from equity investments amounted to €7 million, excluding the amortisation of the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") from Chinese joint ventures of €(10) million.

Adjusted net profit, representing the group's share of net profit from continued operations excluding PPA net of tax, amounts to €44 million for the fiscal year 2023/24. This compares to an adjusted net profit of €292 million during the last fiscal year.

The Group's Net profit/(loss) (Group share) stood at €(309) million for the fiscal year 2023/24, compared to €(132) million last fiscal year.

4. Financial structure

The Group's Free Cash Flow stands at €(557) million for the fiscal year 2023/24 as compared to €199 million during the last fiscal year and €(1,119) million at the first half of fiscal year 2023/24. Cash generation was impacted over the full year by an unfavourable €(856) million change in working capital compared to €(219) million in the last fiscal year; mostly due to change in Trade Working Capital as well as the reversal effect of the change in law on VAT in France for €(380) million. The Contract Working Capital is positively impacted by the acceleration of deliveries from major contracts in the second half of the year, strong collections of down payments as well as reduction of provision for risk on contracts.

On 31 March 2024, the Group recorded a net debt position of €(2,994) million.

In addition to its available cash and cash equivalents, amounting to €976 million on 31 March 2024, the Group benefits from strong liquidity with:

The first facility has two six-month extension options remaining at borrowers' discretion. Alstom will, however, terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following execution of the deleveraging plan.

The last two facilities have been successfully extended by one year. On 31 March 2024, the €1.75 billion RCF line had been drawn down for €175 million, while the other two lines remained undrawn.

As per its conservative liquidity policy, the €2.5 billion Revolving Credit Facility serves as a back-up of the Group €2.5 billion Negotiable European Commercial Papers program in place. With these RCF lines (€175 million drawn on the RCF on 31 March 2024), the €1.03 billion of Neu CP outstanding on 31 March 2024, the Group benefitted from a €6.3 billion liquidity available.

5. One Alstom team - Agile, Inclusive and Responsible

Decarbonization is at the heart of Alstom's strategy. The Group is reducing its Scope 1 & 2 emissions reaching 139 ktonCO2e (representing a 39% decrease compared to March 2022), while collaborating with suppliers and customers on reducing its Scope 3 footprint. First results of this collaboration can be seen through the reduction of emissions intensity of sold product reaching 4.0 gCO2e/pass.km (i.e. (13)% compared to March 2022). Alstom CO2e emissions reduction targets had been validated on the 6 of July 2023 by the independent Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) as in line with requirements to reach Paris Agreement commitments.

The supply of electricity from renewable sources has also been expanded. Alstom signed a significant Power Purchase Agreement focused on solar development in Spain. The solar farm is expected to begin operations early 2025 with a 10-years contract. The project will cover the equivalent of 80% of Alstom's electricity consumption in Europe, so this is a major step in reaching the target of 100% electricity consumption from renewables.

Regarding Diversity & Inclusion, the Alstom in Motion (AiM) 2025 strategy targets to reach 28% of women managers, engineers and professionals' roles by 2025. As of end of March 2024, 24.7% of manager, engineer and professional roles are held by women. Alstom will continue to accelerate its efforts in the coming months.

Alstom's Corporate Social Responsibility performance is regularly evaluated by various rating agencies; the Group maintained its presence among the CAC40 ESG index for the third consecutive year and the DJSI for the 13 consecutive year. Alstom improved is scoring to ECOVADIS questionnaire with a score of 77/100 and kept AA score with MSCI agency. In addition, in 2024, Alstom improved is CDP rating, moving from B to A-. Those results reflect its strong position and strategy on Sustainability.

In addition, Alstom published for the second year European Taxonomy-aligned KPIs about Sales, Capex and Opex, pursuing strong analysis initiated last year. EU Taxonomy-aligned sales amounted to 60% and ranked Alstom among best in class, confirming the importance of the sector in which Alstom operates in achieving the EU's ambition of carbon neutrality by 2050. The EU Taxonomy purpose is to redirect capital flows towards sustainable activities and help navigate transition to a low carbon economy.

The outlook for FY 2024/25 is based on following main assumptions:

FY 2024/25 Outlook:

Considering the slight dilution from disposals and the revised timing of the impact from industrial optimisation, the Group expects to reach this profitability range in FY 2026/27, versus FY 2025/26 previously.

APPENDIX 4 - NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INDICATORS DEFINITIONS

This section presents financial indicators used by the Group that are not defined by accounting standard setters.

Orders received

A new order is recognised as an order received only when the contract creates enforceable obligations between the Group and its customer. When this condition is met, the order is recognised at the contract value. If the contract is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the reporting unit, the Group requires the immediate elimination of currency exposure using forward currency sales. Orders are then measured using the spot rate at inception of hedging instruments.

Book-to-Bill

The book-to-bill ratio is the ratio of orders received to the amount of sales traded for a specific period.

Gross margin % on backlog

Gross Margin % on backlog is a KPI that presents the expected performance level of firm contracts in backlog. It represents the difference between the sales not yet recognized and the cost of sales not yet incurred from the contracts in backlog. This % is an average of the portfolio of contracts in backlog and is meaningful to project mid- and long-term profitability.

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA is a KPI that presents the level of recurring operational performance. It represents the sales minus the cost of sales, adjusted to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination as well as significant, non-recurring ""one off"" items that are not expected to occur again in subsequent years.

EBIT before PPA

Following the Bombardier Transportation acquisition and with effect from the fiscal year 2021/22 condensed consolidated financial statements, Alstom decided to introduce the ""EBIT before PPA"" KPI aimed at restating its Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (""EBIT"") to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination. This KPI is also aligned with market practice.

Adjusted EBIT

Adjusted EBIT (""aEBIT"") is the Key Performance Indicator to present the level of recurring operational performance. This indicator is also aligned with market practice and comparable to direct competitors.

Starting September 2019, Alstom has opted for the inclusion of the share in net income of the equity-accounted investments into the aEBIT when these are considered to be part of the operating activities of the Group (because there are significant operational flows and/or common project execution with these entities). This mainly includes Chinese joint-ventures, namely CASCO joint-venture for Alstom as well as, following the integration of Bombardier Transportation, Alstom Sifang (Qingdao) Transportation Ltd. (formerly Bombardier Sifang), Bombardier NUG Propulsion System Co. Ltd and Changchun Changke Alstom Railway Vehicles Company Ltd (formerly Changchun Bombardier).

aEBIT corresponds to Earning Before Interests and Tax adjusted for the following elements:

A non-recurring item is a ""one-off"" exceptional item that is not supposed to occur again in following years and that is significant.

Adjusted EBIT margin corresponds to Adjusted EBIT expressed as a percentage of sales.

EBITDA + JV dividends

EBITDA before PPA plus dividends from joint ventures is the EBIT before PPA, before depreciation and amortisation, with the addition of the dividends received from joint ventures.

Adjusted net profit

The ""Adjusted Net Profit"" KPI restates Alstom's net profit from continued operations (Group share) to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination, net of the corresponding tax effect. This indicator is also aligned with market practice.

Free cash flow

Free Cash Flow is de?ned as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures including capitalised development costs, net of proceeds from disposals of tangible and intangible assets. Free Cash Flow does not include any proceeds from disposals of activity.

The most directly comparable financial measure to Free Cash Flow calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS is net cash provided by operating activities.

Funds from Operations

Funds from Operations ""FFO"" in the EBIT to FCF statement refers to the Free Cash Flow generated by Operations, before Working Capital variations.

Contract and Trade Working Capital

Contract Working Capital is the sum of:

Trade Working Capital is the Working Capital that is not strictly related to contract. It includes all the elements of the working capital but

Net cash/(debt)

The net cash/(debt) is defined as cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and other current financial asset, less borrowings.

Pay-out ratio

The pay-out ratio is calculated by dividing the amount of the overall dividend with the ""Adjusted Net profit from continuing operations attributable to equity holders of the parent, Group share"" as presented in the management report in the consolidated financial statements.

Organic basis

This press release includes performance indicators presented on a reported basis and on an organic basis. Figures given on an organic basis eliminate the impact of changes in scope of consolidation and changes resulting from the translation of the accounts into Euro following the variation of foreign currencies against the Euro.

The Group uses figures prepared on an organic basis both for internal analysis and for external communication, as it believes they provide means to analyse and explain variations from one period to another. However, these figures are not measurements of performance under IFRS.",finanzen.ch,news,finanzen.ch,,0.223529411764706,452842602,5,https://images.finanzen.net/mediacenter/unsortiert/facebookicon.jpg,

8 May 2024 - Between 1 April 2023 and 31 March 2024, Alstom booked €18.9 billion of orders. Sales were €17.6 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio at 1.1.

The backlog reached €92 billion, providing strong visibility on future sales. Gross margin on backlog reached 17.5% as of 31 March 2024, compared to 16.9% on 31 March 2023.

In the fiscal year 2023/24, Alstom's adjusted EBIT was €997 million, up 17%, equivalent to a 5.7% aEBIT margin, and EBIT before PPA was €356 million. Adjusted net profit was €44 million, net income (group share) was €(309) million, and free cash flow was €(557) million for the full year.

On 31 March 2024, the Group's net debt position stood at €(2,994) million, compared to the €(2,135) million the Group reported on 31 March 2023. Alstom benefits from a solid €6.3 billion liquidity position and equity amounting to €8,778 million on 31 March 2024.

The Board of Directors, in its meeting of 7 May 2024, proposed that no dividend will be paid with regards to the fiscal year 2023/24.

""Alstom recorded a strong rebound during the second half of the year, with solid order intake, strong organic growth, improved profitability and €562 million free cash-flow generation. Thanks to the support of our reference shareholders, we will swiftly execute the €2 billion deleveraging plan, allowing for the stabilization of its Investment Grade rating. In April, we announced the sale of Alstom's conventional signalling business in North America at a favourable valuation, demonstrating the quality and attractiveness of the Group's assets. We are confident in the strength of our backlog and our strategy of selectivity and mix evolution towards services. The Group is capitalizing on the solid operational progress made over the last three years and is launching new initiatives to improve its industrial performance and reduce overheads and indirect procurement costs. Altogether, Alstom is now set on stronger foundations to deliver sustainable profit and cash generation."" said Henri Poupart-Lafarge, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Alstom.

Progress on Alstom's action plan to support its financial targets

During the second half of fiscal year 2023/24, the Group mobilised around the operational, commercial, and cost efficiency plan:

The €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan highlighting commitment to Investment Grade

As announced in November 2023 and reiterated in January 2024, Alstom's Board of Directors is committed to a conservative financial policy and to protect the Group's Investment Grade rating, in particular through a ca. €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan.

This plan and its execution, which have been unanimously approved by Alstom's Board of Directors, has the following components:

The ca. €2.4 billion proceeds correspond to ca. €2 billion of deleveraging, mainly due to the hybrid bond's 50% Moody's debt content.

Each of CDPQ and Bpifrance, holding respectively 17.4% and 7.5% of Alstom's capital, has declared to the Company its intention to subscribe for its pro-rata share of the capital increase.

In addition, Alstom has entered into a standby underwriting commitment with BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, J.P. Morgan and Société Générale, acting as Joint Global Coordinators, pursuant to which they have undertaken to underwrite the remainder of the capital raise (i.e. ca. €750 million), subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions precedent.

Circa €1.2 billion of the proceeds of asset disposals and of the capital markets transactions will be used to repay financial debt by September 2024:

The remainder of the proceeds will be invested in highly liquid short-term investment (cash equivalent treatment) and will be earmarked for gross debt reduction at maturity.

Alstom Baa3 long-term issuer rating is reaffirmed, and the outlook will be changed to stable upon successful closing of the hybrid bond issuance and the rights issue.

Alstom will terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following the execution of the deleveraging plan.

During the fiscal year 2023/24, the Group recorded €18.9 billion in orders, with commercial success across multiple geographies, notably in Europe, Asia/Pacific and in Americas. During the last fiscal year, Alstom reported an order intake of €20.7 billion. The (8)% decrease is mostly driven by last year's landmark contract awarded by Landesanstalt Schienenfahrzeuge Baden Württemberg (SFBW) network in Germany of almost €2.5 billion.

In Europe, Alstom recorded €11.3 billion order intake during the fiscal year 2023/24, compared with €12.8 billion over the last fiscal year.

In the U.K, Alstom has signed an eight-year extension to its Train Services Agreement (TSA) with CrossCountry. The contract extension, valued at around €950 million, further secures this long-term partnership and is evidence of the trust placed by the customer.

In France, Alstom will supply île-de-France Mobilités and RATP with 103 new MF19 trainsets, which is the new generation metro on rail, for a total contract value of more than €800 million, 100% financed by Île-de-France Mobilités. This new fleet will replace the existing rolling stock on lines 13, 12 and 8 of the Île-de-France metro as of 2027. The Group also signed a framework contract with Akiem European rolling stock leasing company for 100 Traxx Universal multi-system (MS3) locomotives, together with an initial firm order for 65 locomotives. The total amount of the framework agreement is up €500 million.

In Germany, Alstom was awarded a contract to supply 40 Coradia Stream High-Capacity electric multiple units together with full maintenance for 30 years to Nahverkehrsverbund Schleswig-Holstein (NAH.SH), valued at close to €900 million, and including an option for up to 55 additional trains with a corresponding full-service package. The Group also signed a contract with RAILPOOL for 50 Traxx Universal multi-purpose locomotives.

In Romania, Alstom, as part of a consortium with the civil works companies Gulermak and Arcada, also signed a contract with the Cluj-Napoca City Hall in Romania for the construction of the Cluj-Napoca Metro Line 1. Alstom's share of this state-of-the-art turnkey project reaches approximately €400 million.

In Italy, Alstom was awarded a contract for the supply of high-speed trains.

In Americas, Alstom reported €2.0 billion order intake, compared with €2.7 billion over the last fiscal year, driven by a contract with the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) in the United States to deliver 130 full low floor electric streetcars for Philadelphia, valued at over €667 million and with options to build an additional 30 streetcars. And the Group was awarded a contract by the Connecticut Department of Transportation (CTDOT) in the United States to supply 60 single-level rail coach cars valued at approximately €285 million with options to build an additional 313 cars, as part of CTDOT's coach renewal program for its statewide rail system.

In Asia/Pacific, the order intake stood at €3.2 billion, compared to €3.0 billion for the last fiscal year. In the Philippines, Alstom in consortium with Colas Rail has been awarded by Mitsubishi Corporation a contract to provide an integrated railway system for the extension of the North-South Commuter Railway project (NSCR). Alstom's contract share is worth approximately €1 billion. In Australia, Alstom has been awarded a contract worth around €900 million to maintain the regional rolling stock VLocity and Classic fleets in Victoria, Australia for the next decade.

In Africa/Middle East/Central Asia, the Group reported €2.4 billion order intake, compared with €2.2 billion over the last fiscal year. In Israel, Alstom, a member of the TMT Consortium (TLV Metropolitan Tramway Ltd.) and its partners Electra Ltd. & Dan Public Transportation Ltd., have reached financial closure on the contract, awarded in May 2022, to design, build, maintain, and finance the Tel Aviv Metropolitan LRT Green line by Metropolitan Mass Transit System Ltd (NTA). Alstom's share is valued at €858 million. In Saudi Arabia, Alstom signed a contract of over €500 million with The Royal Commission for AlUla (RCU) for AlUla's pioneering battery-powered tramway - the world's longest catenary-free line.

As of 31 March 2024, the backlog stood at €92 billion, providing the Group with strong visibility over future sales.

Alstom's sales amounted to €17.6 billion for the fiscal year 2023/24, representing a growth of 6.7% on a reported basis and a strong 9.4% on an organic basis compared with Alstom sales in the last fiscal year. Sales related to non-performing backlog, corresponding to sales on legacy projects with a negative margin at completion, amounted to €1.7 billion during the fiscal year 2023/24.

Rolling stock sales reached €9.1 billion, representing an increase of 3.9% on a reported basis and 6.5% on an organic basis, driven by contracts ramp-up in France, Belgium and in the US, and the solid level of execution in South Africa, India and Europe.

Services sales stood at €4.3 billion, up 11.9% on a reported basis and 14.3% on an organic basis versus last year, benefiting from the continuous ramp-up in the UK, in Italy and in the US as well as a solid level of execution in Canada.

Systems sales grew 6.9% on a reported basis and 9.3% on an organic basis, and stood at €1.6 billion, driven by a good performance of Turnkey Systems projects in Mexico, Egypt and Canada.

On 14 September 2023, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US department of Treasury added JSC Transmashholding (TMH AO) to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Person (SDN) List. TMH AO is the Russian holding company of TMH Group and is 100% owned by TMH Limited, and Alstom was holding a 20% stake in TMH limited. The Group further assessed potential exposures arising from the new OFAC sanctions and made the decision to sell its stake in TMH. The transaction was closed early January 2024 for an amount of €75 million, carrying value was nil as result of previous impairment, contributing to the de-risking of the company's portfolio.

On 19 April 2024, Alstom announced that it had entered into a binding agreement with Knorr-Bremse AG, to sell Alstom's North American conventional signalling business for a purchase price of around €630 million. Closing of the transaction is only subject to customary conditions, including regulatory approval, and is expected to take place as soon as summer 2024. Proceeds for Alstom at closing, net of expected tax and transaction costs, are expected to be around €620 million.

As of end of March 2024, research and development gross costs amounted to €749 million, i.e. 4.3% of sales, delivering on the Alstom In Motion strategy which is based on three pillars: Autonomous mobility, Data factory and Mobility orchestration. Net R&D amounts to €549 million before PPA amortisation.

Programs funded by IPCEI Hydrogen are ongoing. This important European program supports the development of new hydrogen trains for regional applications, shunting locos and freight, leveraging on the experience collected with Coradia iLint™ regional trains that are now in revenue service.

Homologation tests of Avelia Horizon™ are planned in 2024 to enable a start of revenue service in 2025. The development of international configurations is ongoing. Alstom has launched the development of Avelia stream™ 300, addressing the high-speed single deck segment with a first project for Italy.

The replacement of Adessia™ commuter train has been launched to address the U.K. and USA markets. This new product range will include EMU, BMU, BEMU and HMU versions to also replace the existing Diesel trains.

TRAXX™ Multi-system 3 - locomotives is pursuing homologation tests in 2024 to enable it to run on the different European corridors. It includes the passenger version which can be operated at 200kph.

Services product line is focused on addressing green, sustainable and more efficient operation concepts. Green re-tractioning initiatives include for example the retrofit with hydrogen-fuelled internal combustion engines for locomotives and the ability to provide autonomy for non-electrified lines via the so-called ""Last-mile"" functionality supported by the IPCEI H2 program.

Signalling Product Line worked on Onvia Control™ L2 A and Onvia Control™ L2 B European Standard convergence, driving market presence with its integration into TRAXX platform and securing new contracts for cross border operation, Onvia Cab™ level 2 and level 3 on-board solution together with Automatic Train Operation, and it continued its footprint expansion with a new contract in Canada.

Alstom Innovations cluster continued to develop Autonomous Mobility solutions for Passengers & Freight trains. Major milestones on the roadmap to achieve GoA4 (Grade of Automation 4) have been successfully passed under real mainline operating conditions on passengers and freight train with SNCF in France, and for operation in yard in the Netherlands.

Alstom has also made great strides in developing a new SaaS platform that will enhance its global digital offering. The platform streamlines applications integration and deployment in a trusted and future-proof ecosystem.

The adjusted EBIT margin has progressed from 5.2% over the fiscal year 2022/23 to 5.7% over the fiscal year 2023/24, benefiting from further synergies for 30bps, a steady reduction of non-performing legacy contracts sales for an impact of 30bps, an increased volume and favourable mix delivering 20bps gross margin expansion, partially offset by the negative gross margin impact related to the legacy portfolio deviations for (30)bps.

Alstom recorded restructuring and rationalisation charges of €(147) million mainly related to the reduction of overhead costs for €(115) million (""Autumn"" plan) and adaptation of the production setup for €(32) million, including the United Kingdom for €(14) million, Germany for €(8) million, France for €(3) million, Spain for €(3) million and the U.S.A. for €(2) million.

Costs related to the integration of Bombardier Transportation were recorded for an amount of €(142) million. €(118) million charges were related to some legal proceedings outside the ordinary course of business mainly for two projects - in U.S.A. and in Turkey, and for legal fees in the context of the claim against Bombardier Inc. €(30) million were related to impairment of assets due to the exit from Russia. Other exceptional expenses were recorded for €(73) million, of which €(36) million of consequential impacts from restructuring plan already initiated in Germany.

Alstom's EBIT before amortisation and impairment of assets exclusively valued when determining the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") stood at €356 million. This compares to €366 million for the last fiscal year.

The share in net income from equity investments amounted to €7 million, excluding the amortisation of the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") from Chinese joint ventures of €(10) million.

Adjusted net profit, representing the group's share of net profit from continued operations excluding PPA net of tax, amounts to €44 million for the fiscal year 2023/24. This compares to an adjusted net profit of €292 million during the last fiscal year.

The Group's Net profit/(loss) (Group share) stood at €(309) million for the fiscal year 2023/24, compared to €(132) million last fiscal year.

4. Financial structure

The Group's Free Cash Flow stands at €(557) million for the fiscal year 2023/24 as compared to €199 million during the last fiscal year and €(1,119) million at the first half of fiscal year 2023/24. Cash generation was impacted over the full year by an unfavourable €(856) million change in working capital compared to €(219) million in the last fiscal year; mostly due to change in Trade Working Capital as well as the reversal effect of the change in law on VAT in France for €(380) million. The Contract Working Capital is positively impacted by the acceleration of deliveries from major contracts in the second half of the year, strong collections of down payments as well as reduction of provision for risk on contracts.

On 31 March 2024, the Group recorded a net debt position of €(2,994) million.

In addition to its available cash and cash equivalents, amounting to €976 million on 31 March 2024, the Group benefits from strong liquidity with:

The first facility has two six-month extension options remaining at borrowers' discretion. Alstom will, however, terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following execution of the deleveraging plan.

The last two facilities have been successfully extended by one year. On 31 March 2024, the €1.75 billion RCF line had been drawn down for €175 million, while the other two lines remained undrawn.

As per its conservative liquidity policy, the €2.5 billion Revolving Credit Facility serves as a back-up of the Group €2.5 billion Negotiable European Commercial Papers program in place. With these RCF lines (€175 million drawn on the RCF on 31 March 2024), the €1.03 billion of Neu CP outstanding on 31 March 2024, the Group benefitted from a €6.3 billion liquidity available.

5. One Alstom team - Agile, Inclusive and Responsible

Decarbonization is at the heart of Alstom's strategy. The Group is reducing its Scope 1 & 2 emissions reaching 139 ktonCO2e (representing a 39% decrease compared to March 2022), while collaborating with suppliers and customers on reducing its Scope 3 footprint. First results of this collaboration can be seen through the reduction of emissions intensity of sold product reaching 4.0 gCO2e/pass.km (i.e. (13)% compared to March 2022). Alstom CO2e emissions reduction targets had been validated on the 6 of July 2023 by the independent Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) as in line with requirements to reach Paris Agreement commitments.

The supply of electricity from renewable sources has also been expanded. Alstom signed a significant Power Purchase Agreement focused on solar development in Spain. The solar farm is expected to begin operations early 2025 with a 10-years contract. The project will cover the equivalent of 80% of Alstom's electricity consumption in Europe, so this is a major step in reaching the target of 100% electricity consumption from renewables.

Regarding Diversity & Inclusion, the Alstom in Motion (AiM) 2025 strategy targets to reach 28% of women managers, engineers and professionals' roles by 2025. As of end of March 2024, 24.7% of manager, engineer and professional roles are held by women. Alstom will continue to accelerate its efforts in the coming months.

Alstom's Corporate Social Responsibility performance is regularly evaluated by various rating agencies; the Group maintained its presence among the CAC40 ESG index for the third consecutive year and the DJSI for the 13 consecutive year. Alstom improved is scoring to ECOVADIS questionnaire with a score of 77/100 and kept AA score with MSCI agency. In addition, in 2024, Alstom improved is CDP rating, moving from B to A-. Those results reflect its strong position and strategy on Sustainability.

In addition, Alstom published for the second year European Taxonomy-aligned KPIs about Sales, Capex and Opex, pursuing strong analysis initiated last year. EU Taxonomy-aligned sales amounted to 60% and ranked Alstom among best in class, confirming the importance of the sector in which Alstom operates in achieving the EU's ambition of carbon neutrality by 2050. The EU Taxonomy purpose is to redirect capital flows towards sustainable activities and help navigate transition to a low carbon economy.

The outlook for FY 2024/25 is based on following main assumptions:

FY 2024/25 Outlook:

Considering the slight dilution from disposals and the revised timing of the impact from industrial optimisation, the Group expects to reach this profitability range in FY 2026/27, versus FY 2025/26 previously.

APPENDIX 4 - NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INDICATORS DEFINITIONS

This section presents financial indicators used by the Group that are not defined by accounting standard setters.

Orders received

A new order is recognised as an order received only when the contract creates enforceable obligations between the Group and its customer. When this condition is met, the order is recognised at the contract value. If the contract is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the reporting unit, the Group requires the immediate elimination of currency exposure using forward currency sales. Orders are then measured using the spot rate at inception of hedging instruments.

Book-to-Bill

The book-to-bill ratio is the ratio of orders received to the amount of sales traded for a specific period.

Gross margin % on backlog

Gross Margin % on backlog is a KPI that presents the expected performance level of firm contracts in backlog. It represents the difference between the sales not yet recognized and the cost of sales not yet incurred from the contracts in backlog. This % is an average of the portfolio of contracts in backlog and is meaningful to project mid- and long-term profitability.

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA is a KPI that presents the level of recurring operational performance. It represents the sales minus the cost of sales, adjusted to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination as well as significant, non-recurring ""one off"" items that are not expected to occur again in subsequent years.

EBIT before PPA

Following the Bombardier Transportation acquisition and with effect from the fiscal year 2021/22 condensed consolidated financial statements, Alstom decided to introduce the ""EBIT before PPA"" KPI aimed at restating its Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (""EBIT"") to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination. This KPI is also aligned with market practice.

Adjusted EBIT

Adjusted EBIT (""aEBIT"") is the Key Performance Indicator to present the level of recurring operational performance. This indicator is also aligned with market practice and comparable to direct competitors.

Starting September 2019, Alstom has opted for the inclusion of the share in net income of the equity-accounted investments into the aEBIT when these are considered to be part of the operating activities of the Group (because there are significant operational flows and/or common project execution with these entities). This mainly includes Chinese joint-ventures, namely CASCO joint-venture for Alstom as well as, following the integration of Bombardier Transportation, Alstom Sifang (Qingdao) Transportation Ltd. (formerly Bombardier Sifang), Bombardier NUG Propulsion System Co. Ltd and Changchun Changke Alstom Railway Vehicles Company Ltd (formerly Changchun Bombardier).

aEBIT corresponds to Earning Before Interests and Tax adjusted for the following elements:

A non-recurring item is a ""one-off"" exceptional item that is not supposed to occur again in following years and that is significant.

Adjusted EBIT margin corresponds to Adjusted EBIT expressed as a percentage of sales.

EBITDA + JV dividends

EBITDA before PPA plus dividends from joint ventures is the EBIT before PPA, before depreciation and amortisation, with the addition of the dividends received from joint ventures.

Adjusted net profit

The ""Adjusted Net Profit"" KPI restates Alstom's net profit from continued operations (Group share) to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination, net of the corresponding tax effect. This indicator is also aligned with market practice.

Free cash flow

Free Cash Flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures including capitalised development costs, net of proceeds from disposals of tangible and intangible assets. Free Cash Flow does not include any proceeds from disposals of activity.

The most directly comparable financial measure to Free Cash Flow calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS is net cash provided by operating activities.

Funds from Operations

Funds from Operations ""FFO"" in the EBIT to FCF statement refers to the Free Cash Flow generated by Operations, before Working Capital variations.

Contract and Trade Working Capital

Contract Working Capital is the sum of:

Trade Working Capital is the Working Capital that is not strictly related to contract. It includes all the elements of the working capital but

Net cash/(debt)

The net cash/(debt) is defined as cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and other current financial asset, less borrowings.

Pay-out ratio

The pay-out ratio is calculated by dividing the amount of the overall dividend with the ""Adjusted Net profit from continuing operations attributable to equity holders of the parent, Group share"" as presented in the management report in the consolidated financial statements.

Organic basis

This press release includes performance indicators presented on a reported basis and on an organic basis. Figures given on an organic basis eliminate the impact of changes in scope of consolidation and changes resulting from the translation of the accounts into Euro following the variation of foreign currencies against the Euro.

The Group uses figures prepared on an organic basis both for internal analysis and for external communication, as it believes they provide means to analyse and explain variations from one period to another. However, these figures are not measurements of performance under IFRS.",streetinsider.com,news,StreetInsider.com,,0.1607843137254903,452842387,5,http://www.streetinsider.com/images/silogo-new.png,eng-9548481

Sales were €17.6 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio at 1.1.

The backlog reached €92 billion, providing strong visibility on future sales. Gross margin on backlog reached 17.5% as of 31 March 2024, compared to 16.9% on 31 March 2023.

In the fiscal year 2023/24, Alstom's adjusted EBIT was €997 million, up 17%, equivalent to a 5.7% aEBIT margin, and EBIT before PPA was €356 million. Adjusted net profit was €44 million, net income (group share) was €(309) million, and free cash flow was €(557) million for the full year.

On 31 March 2024, the Group's net debt position stood at €(2,994) million, compared to the €(2,135) million the Group reported on 31 March 2023. Alstom benefits from a solid €6.3 billion liquidity position and equity amounting to €8,778 million on 31 March 2024.

The Board of Directors, in its meeting of 7 May 2024, proposed that no dividend will be paid with regards to the fiscal year 2023/24.

""Alstom recorded a strong rebound during the second half of the year, with solid order intake, strong organic growth, improved profitability and €562 million free cash-flow generation. Thanks to the support of our reference shareholders, we will swiftly execute the €2 billion deleveraging plan, allowing for the stabilization of its Investment Grade rating. In April, we announced the sale of Alstom's conventional signalling business in North America at a favourable valuation, demonstrating the quality and attractiveness of the Group's assets. We are confident in the strength of our backlog and our strategy of selectivity and mix evolution towards services. The Group is capitalizing on the solid operational progress made over the last three years and is launching new initiatives to improve its industrial performance and reduce overheads and indirect procurement costs. Altogether, Alstom is now set on stronger foundations to deliver sustainable profit and cash generation."" said Henri Poupart-Lafarge, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Alstom.

During the second half of fiscal year 2023/24, the Group mobilised around the operational, commercial, and cost efficiency plan:

As announced in November 2023 and reiterated in January 2024, Alstom's Board of Directors is committed to a conservative financial policy and to protect the Group's Investment Grade rating, in particular through a ca. €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan.

This plan and its execution, which have been unanimously approved by Alstom's Board of Directors, has the following components:

The ca. €2.4 billion proceeds correspond to ca. €2 billion of deleveraging, mainly due to the hybrid bond's 50% Moody's debt content.

Each of CDPQ[6] and Bpifrance, holding respectively 17.4% and 7.5% of Alstom's capital, has declared to the Company its intention to subscribe for its pro-rata share of the capital increase.

In addition, Alstom has entered into a standby underwriting commitment with BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, J.P. Morgan and Société Générale, acting as Joint Global Coordinators, pursuant to which they have undertaken to underwrite the remainder of the capital raise (i.e. ca. €750 million), subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions precedent.

Circa €1.2 billion of the proceeds of asset disposals and of the capital markets transactions will be used to repay financial debt by September 2024:

The remainder of the proceeds will be invested in highly liquid short-term investment (cash equivalent treatment) and will be earmarked for gross debt reduction at maturity.

Alstom Baa3 long-term issuer rating is reaffirmed, and the outlook will be changed to stable upon successful closing of the hybrid bond issuance and the rights issue.

Alstom will terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following the execution of the deleveraging plan.

***

During the fiscal year 2023/24, the Group recorded €18.9 billion in orders, with commercial success across multiple geographies, notably in Europe, Asia/Pacific and in Americas. During the last fiscal year, Alstom reported an order intake of €20.7 billion. The (8)% decrease is mostly driven by last year's landmark contract awarded by Landesanstalt Schienenfahrzeuge Baden Württemberg (SFBW) network in Germany of almost €2.5 billion.

In Europe, Alstom recorded €11.3 billion order intake during the fiscal year 2023/24, compared with €12.8 billion over the last fiscal year.

In the U.K, Alstom has signed an eight-year extension to its Train Services Agreement (TSA) with CrossCountry. The contract extension, valued at around €950 million, further secures this long-term partnership and is evidence of the trust placed by the customer.

In France, Alstom will supply île-de-France Mobilités and RATP with 103 new MF19 trainsets, which is the new generation metro on rail, for a total contract value of more than €800 million, 100% financed by Île-de-France Mobilités. This new fleet will replace the existing rolling stock on lines 13, 12 and 8 of the Île-de-France metro as of 2027. The Group also signed a framework contract with Akiem European rolling stock leasing company for 100 Traxx Universal multi-system (MS3) locomotives, together with an initial firm order for 65 locomotives. The total amount of the framework agreement is up €500 million.

In Italy, Alstom was awarded a contract for the supply of high-speed trains.

In Americas, Alstom reported €2.0 billion order intake, compared with €2.7 billion over the last fiscal year, driven by a contract with the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) in the United States to deliver 130 full low floor electric streetcars for Philadelphia, valued at over €667 million and with options to build an additional 30 streetcars. And the Group was awarded a contract by the Connecticut Department of Transportation (CTDOT) in the United States to supply 60 single-level rail coach cars valued at approximately €285 million with options to build an additional 313 cars, as part of CTDOT's coach renewal program for its statewide rail system.

Alstom's contract share is worth approximately €1 billion. In Australia, Alstom has been awarded a contract worth around €900 million to maintain the regional rolling stock VLocity and Classic fleets in Victoria, Australia for the next decade.

In Africa/Middle East/Central Asia, the Group reported €2.4 billion order intake, compared with €2.2 billion over the last fiscal year. In Israel, Alstom, a member of the TMT Consortium (TLV Metropolitan Tramway Ltd.) and its partners Electra Ltd. & Dan Public Transportation Ltd., have reached financial closure on the contract, awarded in May 2022, to design, build, maintain, and finance the Tel Aviv Metropolitan LRT Green line by Metropolitan Mass Transit System Ltd (NTA). Alstom's share is valued at €858 million. In Saudi Arabia, Alstom signed a contract of over €500 million with The Royal Commission for AlUla (RCU) for AlUla's pioneering battery-powered tramway - the world's longest catenary-free line.

As of 31 March 2024, the backlog stood at €92 billion, providing the Group with strong visibility over future sales.

Alstom's sales amounted to €17.6 billion for the fiscal year 2023/24, representing a growth of 6.7% on a reported basis and a strong 9.4% on an organic basis compared with Alstom sales in the last fiscal year. Sales related to non-performing backlog, corresponding to sales on legacy projects with a negative margin at completion, amounted to €1.7 billion during the fiscal year 2023/24.

Rolling stock sales reached €9.1 billion, representing an increase of 3.9% on a reported basis and 6.5% on an organic basis, driven by contracts ramp-up in France, Belgium and in the US, and the solid level of execution in South Africa, India and Europe.

Services sales stood at €4.3 billion, up 11.9% on a reported basis and 14.3% on an organic basis versus last year, benefiting from the continuous ramp-up in the UK, in Italy and in the US as well as a solid level of execution in Canada.

Systems sales grew 6.9% on a reported basis and 9.3% on an organic basis, and stood at €1.6 billion, driven by a good performance of Turnkey Systems projects in Mexico, Egypt and Canada.

On 14 September 2023, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US department of Treasury added JSC Transmashholding (TMH AO) to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Person (SDN) List. TMH AO is the Russian holding company of TMH Group and is 100% owned by TMH Limited, and Alstom was holding a 20% stake in TMH limited. The Group further assessed potential exposures arising from the new OFAC sanctions and made the decision to sell its stake in TMH. The transaction was closed early January 2024 for an amount of €75 million, carrying value was nil as result of previous impairment, contributing to the de-risking of the company's portfolio.

On 19 April 2024, Alstom announced that it had entered into a binding agreement with Knorr-Bremse AG, to sell Alstom's North American conventional signalling business for a purchase price of around €630 million. Closing of the transaction is only subject to customary conditions, including regulatory approval, and is expected to take place as soon as summer 2024. Proceeds for Alstom at closing, net of expected tax and transaction costs, are expected to be around €620 million.

As of end of March 2024, research and development gross costs amounted to €749 million, i.e. 4.3% of sales, delivering on the Alstom In Motion strategy which is based on three pillars: Autonomous mobility, Data factory and Mobility orchestration. Net R&D amounts to €549 million before PPA amortisation.

Programs funded by IPCEI Hydrogen are ongoing. This important European program supports the development of new hydrogen trains for regional applications, shunting locos and freight, leveraging on the experience collected with Coradia iLint™ regional trains that are now in revenue service.

Homologation tests of Avelia Horizon™ are planned in 2024 to enable a start of revenue service in 2025. The development of international configurations is ongoing. Alstom has launched the development of Avelia Stream™ 300, addressing the high-speed single deck segment with a first project for Italy.

The replacement of Adessia™ commuter train has been launched to address the U.K. and USA markets. This new product range will include EMU, BMU, BEMU and HMU versions to also replace the existing Diesel trains.

Traxx™ Multi-system 3 - locomotives is pursuing homologation tests in 2024 to enable it to run on the different European corridors. It includes the passenger version which can be operated at 200kph.

Services product line is focused on addressing green, sustainable and more efficient operation concepts. Green re-tractioning initiatives include for example the retrofit with hydrogen-fuelled internal combustion engines for locomotives and the ability to provide autonomy for non-electrified lines via the so-called ""Last-mile"" functionality supported by the IPCEI H2 program.

Signalling Product Line worked on Onvia Control™ L2 A and Onvia Control™ L2 B European Standard convergence, driving market presence with its integration into TRAXX platform and securing new contracts for cross border operation, Onvia Cab™ level 2 and level 3 on-board solution together with Automatic Train Operation, and it continued its footprint expansion with a new contract in Canada.

Alstom Innovations cluster continued to develop Autonomous Mobility solutions for Passengers & Freight trains. Major milestones on the roadmap to achieve GoA4 (Grade of Automation 4) have been successfully passed under real mainline operating conditions on passengers and freight train with SNCF in France, and for operation in yard in the Netherlands.

Alstom has also made great strides in developing a new SaaS platform that will enhance its global digital offering. The platform streamlines applications integration and deployment in a trusted and future-proof ecosystem.

The adjusted EBIT margin has progressed from 5.2% over the fiscal year 2022/23 to 5.7% over the fiscal year 2023/24, benefiting from further synergies for 30bps, a steady reduction of non-performing legacy contracts sales for an impact of 30bps, an increased volume and favourable mix delivering 20bps gross margin expansion, partially offset by the negative gross margin impact related to the legacy portfolio deviations for (30)bps.

Alstom recorded restructuring and rationalisation charges of €(147) million mainly related to the reduction of overhead costs for €(115) million (""Autumn"" plan) and adaptation of the production setup for €(32) million, including the United Kingdom for €(14) million, Germany for €(8) million, France for €(3) million, Spain for €(3) million and the U.S.A. for €(2) million.

Costs related to the integration of Bombardier Transportation were recorded for an amount of €(142) million. €(118) million charges were related to some legal proceedings outside the ordinary course of business mainly for two projects - in U.S.A. and in Turkey, and for legal fees in the context of the claim against Bombardier Inc. €(30) million were related to impairment of assets due to the exit from Russia. Other exceptional expenses were recorded for €(73) million, of which €(36) million of consequential impacts from restructuring plan already initiated in Germany.

Alstom's EBIT before amortisation and impairment of assets exclusively valued when determining the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") stood at €356 million. This compares to €366 million for the last fiscal year.

The share in net income from equity investments amounted to €7 million, excluding the amortisation of the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") from Chinese joint ventures of €(10) million.

Adjusted net profit, representing the group's share of net profit from continued operations excluding PPA net of tax, amounts to €44 million for the fiscal year 2023/24. This compares to an adjusted net profit of €292 million during the last fiscal year.

The Group's Net profit/(loss) (Group share) stood at €(309) million for the fiscal year 2023/24, compared to €(132) million last fiscal year.

***

The Group's Free Cash Flow stands at €(557) million for the fiscal year 2023/24 as compared to €199 million during the last fiscal year and €(1,119) million at the first half of fiscal year 2023/24. Cash generation was impacted over the full year by an unfavourable €(856) million change in working capital compared to €(219) million in the last fiscal year; mostly due to change in Trade Working Capital as well as the reversal effect of the change in law on VAT in France for €(380) million. The Contract Working Capital is positively impacted by the acceleration of deliveries from major contracts in the second half of the year, strong collections of down payments as well as reduction of provision for risk on contracts.

On 31 March 2024, the Group recorded a net debt position of €(2,994) million.

In addition to its available cash and cash equivalents, amounting to €976 million on 31 March 2024, the Group benefits from strong liquidity with:

The first facility has two six-month extension options remaining at borrowers' discretion. Alstom will, however, terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following execution of the deleveraging plan.

The last two facilities have been successfully extended by one year. On 31 March 2024, the €1.75 billion RCF line had been drawn down for €175 million, while the other two lines remained undrawn.

As per its conservative liquidity policy, the €2.5 billion Revolving Credit Facility serves as a back-up of the Group €2.5 billion Negotiable European Commercial Papers program in place. With these RCF lines (€175 million drawn on the RCF on 31 March 2024), the €1.03 billion of Neu CP outstanding on 31 March 2024, the Group benefitted from a €6.3 billion liquidity available.

***

Decarbonization is at the heart of Alstom's strategy. The Group is reducing its Scope 1 & 2 emissions reaching 139 ktonCO2e (representing a 39% decrease compared to March 2022), while collaborating with suppliers and customers on reducing its Scope 3 footprint. First results of this collaboration can be seen through the reduction of emissions intensity of sold product reaching 4.0 gCO2e/pass.km (i.e. (13)% compared to March 2022). Alstom CO2e emissions reduction targets had been validated on the 6 of July 2023 by the independent Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) as in line with requirements to reach Paris Agreement commitments.

The supply of electricity from renewable sources has also been expanded. Alstom signed a significant Power Purchase Agreement focused on solar development in Spain. The solar farm is expected to begin operations early 2025 with a 10-years contract. The project will cover the equivalent of 80% of Alstom's electricity consumption in Europe, so this is a major step in reaching the target of 100% electricity consumption from renewables.

Regarding Diversity & Inclusion, the Alstom in Motion (AiM) 2025 strategy targets to reach 28% of women managers, engineers and professionals' roles by 2025. As of end of March 2024, 24.7% of manager, engineer and professional roles are held by women. Alstom will continue to accelerate its efforts in the coming months.

Alstom's Corporate Social Responsibility performance is regularly evaluated by various rating agencies; the Group maintained its presence among the CAC40 ESG index for the third consecutive year and the DJSI for the 13 consecutive year. Alstom improved is scoring to ECOVADIS questionnaire with a score of 77/100 and kept AA score with MSCI agency. In addition, in 2024, Alstom improved is CDP rating, moving from B to A-. Those results reflect its strong position and strategy on Sustainability.

In addition, Alstom published for the second year European Taxonomy-aligned KPIs about Sales, Capex and Opex, pursuing strong analysis initiated last year. EU Taxonomy-aligned sales amounted to 60% and ranked Alstom among best in class, confirming the importance of the sector in which Alstom operates in achieving the EU's ambition of carbon neutrality by 2050. The EU Taxonomy purpose is to redirect capital flows towards sustainable activities and help navigate transition to a low carbon economy.

***

The outlook for FY 2024/25 is based on following main assumptions:

Considering the slight dilution from disposals and the revised timing of the impact from industrial optimisation, the Group expects to reach this profitability range in FY 2026/27, versus FY 2025/26 previously.

APPENDIX 4 - NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INDICATORS DEFINITIONS

This section presents financial indicators used by the Group that are not defined by accounting standard setters.

Orders received

A new order is recognised as an order received only when the contract creates enforceable obligations between the Group and its customer. When this condition is met, the order is recognised at the contract value. If the contract is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the reporting unit, the Group requires the immediate elimination of currency exposure using forward currency sales. Orders are then measured using the spot rate at inception of hedging instruments.

Book-to-Bill

The book-to-bill ratio is the ratio of orders received to the amount of sales traded for a specific period.

Gross margin % on backlog

Gross Margin % on backlog is a KPI that presents the expected performance level of firm contracts in backlog. It represents the difference between the sales not yet recognized and the cost of sales not yet incurred from the contracts in backlog. This % is an average of the portfolio of contracts in backlog and is meaningful to project mid- and long-term profitability.

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA is a KPI that presents the level of recurring operational performance. It represents the sales minus the cost of sales, adjusted to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination as well as significant, non-recurring ""one off"" items that are not expected to occur again in subsequent years.

EBIT before PPA

Following the Bombardier Transportation acquisition and with effect from the fiscal year 2021/22 condensed consolidated financial statements, Alstom decided to introduce the ""EBIT before PPA"" KPI aimed at restating its Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (""EBIT"") to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination. This KPI is also aligned with market practice.

Adjusted EBIT

Adjusted EBIT (""aEBIT"") is the Key Performance Indicator to present the level of recurring operational performance. This indicator is also aligned with market practice and comparable to direct competitors.

Starting September 2019, Alstom has opted for the inclusion of the share in net income of the equity-accounted investments into the aEBIT when these are considered to be part of the operating activities of the Group (because there are significant operational flows and/or common project execution with these entities). This mainly includes Chinese joint-ventures, namely CASCO joint-venture for Alstom as well as, following the integration of Bombardier Transportation, Alstom Sifang (Qingdao) Transportation Ltd. (formerly Bombardier Sifang), Bombardier NUG Propulsion System Co. Ltd and Changchun Changke Alstom Railway Vehicles Company Ltd (formerly Changchun Bombardier).

aEBIT corresponds to Earning Before Interests and Tax adjusted for the following elements:

A non-recurring item is a ""one-off"" exceptional item that is not supposed to occur again in following years and that is significant.

Adjusted EBIT margin corresponds to Adjusted EBIT expressed as a percentage of sales.

EBITDA + JV dividends

EBITDA before PPA plus dividends from joint ventures is the EBIT before PPA, before depreciation and amortisation, with the addition of the dividends received from joint ventures.

Adjusted net profit

The ""Adjusted Net Profit"" KPI restates Alstom's net profit from continued operations (Group share) to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination, net of the corresponding tax effect. This indicator is also aligned with market practice.

Free cash flow

Free Cash Flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures including capitalised development costs, net of proceeds from disposals of tangible and intangible assets. Free Cash Flow does not include any proceeds from disposals of activity.

The most directly comparable financial measure to Free Cash Flow calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS is net cash provided by operating activities.

Funds from Operations

Funds from Operations ""FFO"" in the EBIT to FCF statement refers to the Free Cash Flow generated by Operations, before Working Capital variations.

Trade Working Capital is the Working Capital that is not strictly related to contract. It includes all the elements of the working capital but

Net cash/(debt)

The net cash/(debt) is defined as cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and other current financial asset, less borrowings.

Pay-out ratio

The pay-out ratio is calculated by dividing the amount of the overall dividend with the ""Adjusted Net profit from continuing operations attributable to equity holders of the parent, Group share"" as presented in the management report in the consolidated financial statements.

Organic basis

This press release includes performance indicators presented on a reported basis and on an organic basis. Figures given on an organic basis eliminate the impact of changes in scope of consolidation and changes resulting from the translation of the accounts into Euro following the variation of foreign currencies against the Euro.

The Group uses figures prepared on an organic basis both for internal analysis and for external communication, as it believes they provide means to analyse and explain variations from one period to another. However, these figures are not measurements of performance under IFRS.

Chinese universities have been gaining popularity among African students thanks to the offering of scholarships as well as China's growing reputation in technology and development.30 Therefore, as Figure 4 shows, China is the second-most popular destination for Africans seeking higher education abroad, with roughly 81,600 students; France is the most popular (126,300 students) and the United States is the third-most popular (48,300 students). However, China's immigration policy is much tighter than the policies in European and North American countries. Therefore, most Africans studying in China tend to return home upon the completion of their studies instead of staying abroad, significantly reducing the prospects of ""brain drain"" for Africa.

China-Africa educational institutions are also maintaining strong collaboration. Sixty-one Confucius Institutes and forty-eight programs have been established in forty-eight African countries as of 2021. Additionally, China has supported over thirty African universities to set up departments or programs to study Chinese language. Luban Workshops in Djibouti, Egypt, Kenya, and South Africa have provided Chinese-style vocational training to African technicians, even when international travel has been restricted due to the COVID pandemic. Conversely, universities in China have added new courses for African languages, such as Amharic, Malagasy, and Zulu. Furthermore, the Plan for China-Africa Cooperation on Talent Development, announced in August 2023, has pledged to train 500 principals and high-calibre teachers of vocational colleges every year, as well as 10,000 technical personnel with both Chinese language and vocational skills for Africa. The number of cooperating Chinese and African universities will be increased from 20+20 to 50+50. However, there are occasionally reports about African students' complaints related to Chinese teachers' English proficiency, internship and employment opportunities, as well as administrative services. If the education quality does not improve, the quantitative growth in cooperating universities may not be sustainable.

Media and cultural exchanges between African countries and China have increased since the start of the pandemic, largely due to the use of digital technologies. The Chinese cable television operator StarTimes provided 13 million subscribers in Africa with programs in eleven languages as of November 2021. TikTok, cell phone maker Transsion, and other Chinese internet companies greatly boost the formation of Africa's mobile media sphere. Chinese and African entertainment industries have been deepening their collaboration as well, with the joint production and broadcasting of movies and television series. Two notable series, Welcome to Milele Village (2023) and Ebola Fighters (2021), depicted Chinese medical teams in Africa and gained popularity among Chinese audiences. Soccer players from Angola, Cameroon, Ghana, and Nigeria have joined clubs in China's Premier league and A-level league. Chinese tourists are now also interested in taking historical tours and immersing themselves in African culture, as well as exploring the country's natural landscape. A number of African countries, including most recently Egypt, Mauritius, Morocco, and Tunisia, have been providing visa-free or visa-on-arrival entries to Chinese visitors to foster tourism. Echoing the movement, China's Ministry of Culture and Tourism has listed thirty-four African countries as destinations for group tours.

Conclusion

China's economic growth is slowing from the double digits of previous decades as policymakers steer the economy toward a more high-tech, consumption-oriented, and environmentally sustainable growth model with reduced exposure to geopolitical shocks. And this economic transition will increasingly have implications for China's international economic relations with the rest of the world. As discussed above, across the five domains of China's economic engagement with Africa -- trade, investment, fiscal stabilization, RMB internationalization, and people-to-people ties -- both strong continuities and changes are evident. But this engagement is not happening in a vacuum. Policy directions within African countries and third parties such as the United States will greatly shape how these changes in the China-Africa relationship continue to unfold.

The changing patterns of trade between African countries and China will be shaped by policies in both advanced economies and African countries themselves. Rising barriers to market access in advanced economies are likely to push African countries further into the embrace of China. Between 2021 and 2024, the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden has suspended a record eight African countries from the U.S. trade preference program, the African Growth and Opportunity Act. Meanwhile, the European Union's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, which began its initial transitional phase in October 2023, could make it even more difficult for African manufacturers to export to the European market and reduce the continent's GDP by up to $25 billion. Although individual European countries like France seek to expand their trade with Anglophone African countries, for instance, and the United Kingdom recently signed a trade deal with Kenya, this may not be sufficient to offset the wide-ranging impacts of market-restricting policies like the CBAM. Furthermore, growing China-Africa trade volumes will continue to be characterized by trade deficits. To address these deficits, African countries need to make a concerted effort to diversify their exports to China. Important steps to take include implementing the AfCFTA to create regional value chains, utilizing trade preference programs particularly the green lanes initiative -- as Kenya and Namibia are doing -- to export semi-processed agriculture produce to China and emulating the Indonesian approach to pressure Chinese companies to invest in the refining and processing of minerals in African countries.

As Chinese investments in Africa shift from infrastructure-oriented projects toward industrialization-oriented projects, African policy responses and the ability of Western countries to fill infrastructure financing gaps will be crucial. Chinese FDI flows for processing and manufacturing in various sectors -- whether related to agriculture, minerals and metals, construction material, or apparel -- are contingent on requirements in the domestic business environment that are within the remit of African governments. Basic requirements include the availability of affordable and reliable electricity, good transportation networks, skilled local workers, security, and the ability to compel Chinese companies to enter into joint ventures with local African firms for technology transfer. Whether the United States and its allies in Europe and Japan can step into the space being vacated by Chinese policy banks to provide infrastructure financing in Africa is an open question. Implementation of the Lobito Corridor project, a signature initiative of the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII), will test the G7's commitment to the scaling up of infrastructure investments in Africa. Whether the United States continues to prioritize the PGII by ensuring the program's continuity or incorporating new infrastructure projects remains to be seen -- especially if a new U.S. administration comes into office in January 2025.

Expansion of China's rescue-lending efforts and internationalization of the RMB in Africa are significantly dependent on African countries' own demand for and uptake of these initiatives. Will a growing number of African countries look to China, as an alternative to the IMF, for emergency liquidity support as their ability to finance imports diminish due to fiscal crises? Will there be a growing appetite among African countries for more central bank currency swap lines with the PBOC, and will there be increased drawdowns of yuan reserves? As African countries struggle to find scarce foreign exchange resources to settle and invoice their trade, will they follow the trend among some Asian countries in using the RMB for their bilateral trade with China? The answer to these questions may lie largely in whether the United States and its allies in Europe will provide sufficient measures to support African countries to overcome the latest bout of debt distress and fiscal crises.

Finally, China's loosening of pandemic-era travel restrictions and the phenomenon of digitalization will accelerate the increasing trend of people-to-people exchanges with African countries in higher education, media, and culture. Developments in China's immigration policy will be important to track as it begins to roll out visa-free travel for a select number of European and Asian countries. The hardening of visa regimes in Canada, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the United States, and other Western countries will also be important to monitor, as it could affect these countries' historically robust people-to-people exchanges with African countries.

Chinese universities have been gaining popularity among African students thanks to the offering of scholarships as well as China's growing reputation in technology and development.30 Therefore, as Figure 4 shows, China is the second-most popular destination for Africans seeking higher education abroad, with roughly 81,600 students; France is the most popular (126,300 students) and the United States is the third-most popular (48,300 students). However, China's immigration policy is much tighter than the policies in European and North American countries. Therefore, most Africans studying in China tend to return home upon the completion of their studies instead of staying abroad, significantly reducing the prospects of ""brain drain"" for Africa.

China-Africa educational institutions are also maintaining strong collaboration. Sixty-one Confucius Institutes and forty-eight programs have been established in forty-eight African countries as of 2021. Additionally, China has supported over thirty African universities to set up departments or programs to study Chinese language. Luban Workshops in Djibouti, Egypt, Kenya, and South Africa have provided Chinese-style vocational training to African technicians, even when international travel has been restricted due to the COVID pandemic. Conversely, universities in China have added new courses for African languages, such as Amharic, Malagasy, and Zulu. Furthermore, the Plan for China-Africa Cooperation on Talent Development, announced in August 2023, has pledged to train 500 principals and high-calibre teachers of vocational colleges every year, as well as 10,000 technical personnel with both Chinese language and vocational skills for Africa. The number of cooperating Chinese and African universities will be increased from 20+20 to 50+50. However, there are occasionally reports about African students' complaints related to Chinese teachers' English proficiency, internship and employment opportunities, as well as administrative services. If the education quality does not improve, the quantitative growth in cooperating universities may not be sustainable.

Media and cultural exchanges between African countries and China have increased since the start of the pandemic, largely due to the use of digital technologies. The Chinese cable television operator StarTimes provided 13 million subscribers in Africa with programs in eleven languages as of November 2021. TikTok, cell phone maker Transsion, and other Chinese internet companies greatly boost the formation of Africa's mobile media sphere. Chinese and African entertainment industries have been deepening their collaboration as well, with the joint production and broadcasting of movies and television series. Two notable series, Welcome to Milele Village (2023) and Ebola Fighters (2021), depicted Chinese medical teams in Africa and gained popularity among Chinese audiences. Soccer players from Angola, Cameroon, Ghana, and Nigeria have joined clubs in China's Premier league and A-level league. Chinese tourists are now also interested in taking historical tours and immersing themselves in African culture, as well as exploring the country's natural landscape. A number of African countries, including most recently Egypt, Mauritius, Morocco, and Tunisia, have been providing visa-free or visa-on-arrival entries to Chinese visitors to foster tourism. Echoing the movement, China's Ministry of Culture and Tourism has listed thirty-four African countries as destinations for group tours.

Conclusion

China's economic growth is slowing from the double digits of previous decades as policymakers steer the economy toward a more high-tech, consumption-oriented, and environmentally sustainable growth model with reduced exposure to geopolitical shocks. And this economic transition will increasingly have implications for China's international economic relations with the rest of the world. As discussed above, across the five domains of China's economic engagement with Africa -- trade, investment, fiscal stabilization, RMB internationalization, and people-to-people ties -- both strong continuities and changes are evident. But this engagement is not happening in a vacuum. Policy directions within African countries and third parties such as the United States will greatly shape how these changes in the China-Africa relationship continue to unfold.

The changing patterns of trade between African countries and China will be shaped by policies in both advanced economies and African countries themselves. Rising barriers to market access in advanced economies are likely to push African countries further into the embrace of China. Between 2021 and 2024, the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden has suspended a record eight African countries from the U.S. trade preference program, the African Growth and Opportunity Act. Meanwhile, the European Union's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, which began its initial transitional phase in October 2023, could make it even more difficult for African manufacturers to export to the European market and reduce the continent's GDP by up to $25 billion. Although individual European countries like France seek to expand their trade with Anglophone African countries, for instance, and the United Kingdom recently signed a trade deal with Kenya, this may not be sufficient to offset the wide-ranging impacts of market-restricting policies like the CBAM. Furthermore, growing China-Africa trade volumes will continue to be characterized by trade deficits. To address these deficits, African countries need to make a concerted effort to diversify their exports to China. Important steps to take include implementing the AfCFTA to create regional value chains, utilizing trade preference programs particularly the green lanes initiative -- as Kenya and Namibia are doing -- to export semi-processed agriculture produce to China and emulating the Indonesian approach to pressure Chinese companies to invest in the refining and processing of minerals in African countries.

As Chinese investments in Africa shift from infrastructure-oriented projects toward industrialization-oriented projects, African policy responses and the ability of Western countries to fill infrastructure financing gaps will be crucial. Chinese FDI flows for processing and manufacturing in various sectors -- whether related to agriculture, minerals and metals, construction material, or apparel -- are contingent on requirements in the domestic business environment that are within the remit of African governments. Basic requirements include the availability of affordable and reliable electricity, good transportation networks, skilled local workers, security, and the ability to compel Chinese companies to enter into joint ventures with local African firms for technology transfer. Whether the United States and its allies in Europe and Japan can step into the space being vacated by Chinese policy banks to provide infrastructure financing in Africa is an open question. Implementation of the Lobito Corridor project, a signature initiative of the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII), will test the G7's commitment to the scaling up of infrastructure investments in Africa. Whether the United States continues to prioritize the PGII by ensuring the program's continuity or incorporating new infrastructure projects remains to be seen -- especially if a new U.S. administration comes into office in January 2025.

Expansion of China's rescue-lending efforts and internationalization of the RMB in Africa are significantly dependent on African countries' own demand for and uptake of these initiatives. Will a growing number of African countries look to China, as an alternative to the IMF, for emergency liquidity support as their ability to finance imports diminish due to fiscal crises? Will there be a growing appetite among African countries for more central bank currency swap lines with the PBOC, and will there be increased drawdowns of yuan reserves? As African countries struggle to find scarce foreign exchange resources to settle and invoice their trade, will they follow the trend among some Asian countries in using the RMB for their bilateral trade with China? The answer to these questions may lie largely in whether the United States and its allies in Europe will provide sufficient measures to support African countries to overcome the latest bout of debt distress and fiscal crises.

Finally, China's loosening of pandemic-era travel restrictions and the phenomenon of digitalization will accelerate the increasing trend of people-to-people exchanges with African countries in higher education, media, and culture. Developments in China's immigration policy will be important to track as it begins to roll out visa-free travel for a select number of European and Asian countries. The hardening of visa regimes in Canada, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the United States, and other Western countries will also be important to monitor, as it could affect these countries' historically robust people-to-people exchanges with African countries.

Progress on Alstom's action plan to support its financial targets

During the second half of fiscal year 2023/24, the Group mobilised around the operational, commercial, and cost efficiency plan:

Quality of order intake during the second half provides comfort in continuing to grow the margin in backlog: +60bps in FY 2023/24 versus last year, and expected +50bps per year in the coming three yearsIn FY 2023/24, Alstom continued to ramp-up production rates, delivering 4,645 cars, compared to 4,151 in 2022/23Supply chain efficiencies allowed to decrease inventory days since 30 September 2023Costs efficiency programs now launched across overheads and indirect procurement, with notably the aim to reduce SG&A over sales by ca. 1pp over three years vs FY 2022/23.

The €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan highlighting commitment to Investment Grade

As announced in November 2023 and reiterated in January 2024, Alstom's Board of Directors is committed to a conservative financial policy and to protect the Group's Investment Grade rating, in particular through a ca. €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan.

This plan and its execution, which have been unanimously approved by Alstom's Board of Directors, has the following components:

Divestments for ca. €700 million:Sale of TMH for €75 million realized in January 2024The announced sale of conventional signalling business in North America to Knorr-Bremse AG, which will generate proceeds of ca. €630 million upon closing expected during Summer 2024The issuance of hybrid bonds with 50% equity content for Moody's5 in an amount of ca. €750 million to be executed no later than September 2024 subject to market conditions and AMF approvalA capital increase with preferential subscription rights in an amount of ca. €1 billion to be executed no later than September 2024 subject to market conditions and AMF approval

The ca. €2.4 billion proceeds correspond to ca. €2 billion of deleveraging, mainly due to the hybrid bond's 50% Moody's debt content.

Each of CDPQ6 and Bpifrance, holding respectively 17.4% and 7.5% of Alstom's capital, has declared to the Company its intention to subscribe for its pro-rata share of the capital increase.

In addition, Alstom has entered into a standby underwriting commitment with BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, J.P. Morgan and Société Générale, acting as Joint Global Coordinators, pursuant to which they have undertaken to underwrite the remainder of the capital raise (i.e. ca. €750 million), subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions precedent.

Circa €1.2 billion of the proceeds of asset disposals and of the capital markets transactions will be used to repay financial debt by September 2024:

repayment of Neu CP by €1,033 million repayment of RCF drawings by €175 million

The remainder of the proceeds will be invested in highly liquid short-term investment (cash equivalent treatment) and will be earmarked for gross debt reduction at maturity.

Alstom Baa3 long-term issuer rating is reaffirmed, and the outlook will be changed to stable upon successful closing of the hybrid bond issuance and the rights issue.

Alstom will terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following the execution of the deleveraging plan.

Business update

Growth by offering greater value to customersOrders

During the fiscal year 2023/24, the Group recorded €18.9 billion in orders, with commercial success across multiple geographies, notably in Europe, Asia/Pacific and in Americas. During the last fiscal year, Alstom reported an order intake of €20.7 billion. The (8)% decrease is mostly driven by last year's landmark contract awarded by Landesanstalt Schienenfahrzeuge Baden Württemberg (SFBW) network in Germany of almost €2.5 billion.

In Europe, Alstom recorded €11.3 billion order intake during the fiscal year 2023/24, compared with €12.8 billion over the last fiscal year.

In the U.K, Alstom has signed an eight-year extension to its Train Services Agreement (TSA) with CrossCountry. The contract extension, valued at around €950 million, further secures this long-term partnership and is evidence of the trust placed by the customer.

In France, Alstom will supply île-de-France Mobilités and RATP with 103 new MF19 trainsets, which is the new generation metro on rail, for a total contract value of more than €800 million, 100% financed by Île-de-France Mobilités. This new fleet will replace the existing rolling stock on lines 13, 12 and 8 of the Île-de-France metro as of 2027. The Group also signed a framework contract with Akiem European rolling stock leasing company for 100 TraxxTM Universal multi-system (MS3) locomotives, together with an initial firm order for 65 locomotives. The total amount of the framework agreement is up €500 million.

In Germany, Alstom was awarded a contract to supply 40 Coradia StreamTM High-Capacity electric multiple units together with full maintenance for 30 years to Nahverkehrsverbund Schleswig-Holstein (NAH.SH), valued at close to €900 million, and including an option for up to 55 additional trains with a corresponding full-service package. The Group also signed a contract with RAILPOOL for 50 TraxxTM Universal multi-purpose locomotives.

In Romania, Alstom, as part of a consortium with the civil works companies Gulermak and Arcada, also signed a contract with the Cluj-Napoca City Hall in Romania for the construction of the Cluj-Napoca Metro Line 1. Alstom's share of this state-of-the-art turnkey project reaches approximately €400 million.

In Italy, Alstom was awarded a contract for the supply of high-speed trains.

In Americas, Alstom reported €2.0 billion order intake, compared with €2.7 billion over the last fiscal year, driven by a contract with the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) in the United States to deliver 130 full low floor electric streetcars for Philadelphia, valued at over €667 million and with options to build an additional 30 streetcars. And the Group was awarded a contract by the Connecticut Department of Transportation (CTDOT) in the United States to supply 60 single-level rail coach cars valued at approximately €285 million with options to build an additional 313 cars, as part of CTDOT's coach renewal program for its statewide rail system.

In Asia/Pacific, the order intake stood at €3.2 billion, compared to €3.0 billion for the last fiscal year. In the Philippines, Alstom in consortium with Colas Rail has been awarded by Mitsubishi Corporation a contract to provide an integrated railway system for the extension of the North-South Commuter Railway project (NSCR). Alstom's contract share is worth approximately €1 billion. In Australia, Alstom has been awarded a contract worth around €900 million to maintain the regional rolling stock VLocity and Classic fleets in Victoria, Australia for the next decade.

In Africa/Middle East/Central Asia, the Group reported €2.4 billion order intake, compared with €2.2 billion over the last fiscal year. In Israel, Alstom, a member of the TMT Consortium (TLV Metropolitan Tramway Ltd.) and its partners Electra Ltd. & Dan Public Transportation Ltd., have reached financial closure on the contract, awarded in May 2022, to design, build, maintain, and finance the Tel Aviv Metropolitan LRT Green line by Metropolitan Mass Transit System Ltd (NTA). Alstom's share is valued at €858 million. In Saudi Arabia, Alstom signed a contract of over €500 million with The Royal Commission for AlUla (RCU) for AlUla's pioneering battery-powered tramway - the world's longest catenary-free line.

As of 31 March 2024, the backlog stood at €92 billion, providing the Group with strong visibility over future sales.

Sales

Alstom's sales amounted to €17.6 billion for the fiscal year 2023/24, representing a growth of 6.7% on a reported basis and a strong 9.4% on an organic basis compared with Alstom sales in the last fiscal year. Sales related to non-performing backlog, corresponding to sales on legacy projects with a negative margin at completion, amounted to €1.7 billion during the fiscal year 2023/24.

Rolling stock sales reached €9.1 billion, representing an increase of 3.9% on a reported basis and 6.5% on an organic basis, driven by contracts ramp-up in France, Belgium and in the US, and the solid level of execution in South Africa, India and Europe.

Services sales stood at €4.3 billion, up 11.9% on a reported basis and 14.3% on an organic basis versus last year, benefiting from the continuous ramp-up in the UK, in Italy and in the US as well as a solid level of execution in Canada.

In Signalling, Alstom reported €2.6 billion sales, up 8.9% on a reported basis and 11.8% on an organic basis versus last year, led by a consistent execution across all regions, mainly in Europe and in APAC.

Systems sales grew 6.9% on a reported basis and 9.3% on an organic basis, and stood at €1.6 billion, driven by a good performance of Turnkey Systems projects in Mexico, Egypt and Canada.

Divestments

On 14 September 2023, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US department of Treasury added JSC Transmashholding (TMH AO) to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Person (SDN) List. TMH AO is the Russian holding company of TMH Group and is 100% owned by TMH Limited, and Alstom was holding a 20% stake in TMH limited. The Group further assessed potential exposures arising from the new OFAC sanctions and made the decision to sell its stake in TMH. The transaction was closed early January 2024 for an amount of €75 million, carrying value was nil as result of previous impairment, contributing to the de-risking of the company's portfolio.

On 19 April 2024, Alstom announced that it had entered into a binding agreement with Knorr-Bremse AG, to sell Alstom's North American conventional signalling business for a purchase price of around €630 million. Closing of the transaction is only subject to customary conditions, including regulatory approval, and is expected to take place as soon as summer 2024. Proceeds for Alstom at closing, net of expected tax and transaction costs, are expected to be around €620 million.

2.Innovation by Pioneering Smarter and Greener Mobility for All

As of end of March 2024, research and development gross costs amounted to €749 million, i.e. 4.3% of sales, delivering on the Alstom In Motion strategy which is based on three pillars: Autonomous mobility, Data factory and Mobility orchestration. Net R&D amounts to €549 million before PPA amortisation.

Programs funded by IPCEI Hydrogen are ongoing. This important European program supports the development of new hydrogen trains for regional applications, shunting locos and freight, leveraging on the experience collected with Coradia iLint regional trains that are now in revenue service.

Homologation tests of Avelia Horizon are planned in 2024 to enable a start of revenue service in 2025. The development of international configurations is ongoing. Alstom has launched the development of Avelia stream 300, addressing the high-speed single deck segment with a first project for Italy.

The replacement of Adessia commuter train has been launched to address the U.K. and USA markets. This new product range will include EMU, BMU, BEMU and HMU versions to also replace the existing Diesel trains.

TRAXX Multi-system 3 - locomotives is pursuing homologation tests in 2024 to enable it to run on the different European corridors. It includes the passenger version which can be operated at 200kph.

Services product line is focused on addressing green, sustainable and more efficient operation concepts. Green re-tractioning initiatives include for example the retrofit with hydrogen-fuelled internal combustion engines for locomotives and the ability to provide autonomy for non-electrified lines via the so-called ""Last-mile"" functionality supported by the IPCEI H2 program.

Signalling Product Line worked on Onvia Control L2 A and Onvia Control L2 B European Standard convergence, driving market presence with its integration into TRAXX platform and securing new contracts for cross border operation, Onvia Cab level 2 and level 3 on-board solution together with Automatic Train Operation, and it continued its footprint expansion with a new contract in Canada.

Alstom Innovations cluster continued to develop Autonomous Mobility solutions for Passengers & Freight trains. Major milestones on the roadmap to achieve GoA4 (Grade of Automation 4) have been successfully passed under real mainline operating conditions on passengers and freight train with SNCF in France, and for operation in yard in the Netherlands.

Alstom has also made great strides in developing a new SaaS platform that will enhance its global digital offering. The platform streamlines applications integration and deployment in a trusted and future-proof ecosystem.

3.Profitability

The adjusted EBIT margin has progressed from 5.2% over the fiscal year 2022/23 to 5.7% over the fiscal year 2023/24, benefiting from further synergies for 30bps, a steady reduction of non-performing legacy contracts sales for an impact of 30bps, an increased volume and favourable mix delivering 20bps gross margin expansion, partially offset by the negative gross margin impact related to the legacy portfolio deviations for (30)bps.

Alstom recorded restructuring and rationalisation charges of €(147) million mainly related to the reduction of overhead costs for €(115) million (""Autumn"" plan) and adaptation of the production setup for €(32) million, including the United Kingdom for €(14) million, Germany for €(8) million, France for €(3) million, Spain for €(3) million and the U.S.A. for €(2) million.

Costs related to the integration of Bombardier Transportation were recorded for an amount of €(142) million. €(118) million charges were related to some legal proceedings outside the ordinary course of business mainly for two projects - in U.S.A. and in Turkey, and for legal fees in the context of the claim against Bombardier Inc. €(30) million were related to impairment of assets due to the exit from Russia. Other exceptional expenses were recorded for €(73) million, of which €(36) million of consequential impacts from restructuring plan already initiated in Germany.

Alstom's EBIT before amortisation and impairment of assets exclusively valued when determining the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") stood at €356 million. This compares to €366 million for the last fiscal year.

The share in net income from equity investments amounted to €7 million, excluding the amortisation of the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") from Chinese joint ventures of €(10) million.

Adjusted net profit, representing the group's share of net profit from continued operations excluding PPA net of tax, amounts to €44 million for the fiscal year 2023/24. This compares to an adjusted net profit of €292 million during the last fiscal year.

The Group's Net profit/(loss) (Group share) stood at €(309) million for the fiscal year 2023/24, compared to €(132) million last fiscal year.

***

4.Financial structure

The Group's Free Cash Flow stands at €(557) million for the fiscal year 2023/24 as compared to €199 million during the last fiscal year and €(1,119) million at the first half of fiscal year 2023/24. Cash generation was impacted over the full year by an unfavourable €(856) million change in working capital compared to €(219) million in the last fiscal year; mostly due to change in Trade Working Capital as well as the reversal effect of the change in law on VAT in France for €(380) million. The Contract Working Capital is positively impacted by the acceleration of deliveries from major contracts in the second half of the year, strong collections of down payments as well as reduction of provision for risk on contracts.

On 31 March 2024, the Group recorded a net debt position of €(2,994) million.

In addition to its available cash and cash equivalents, amounting to €976 million on 31 March 2024, the Group benefits from strong liquidity with:

€2.25 billion Revolving Credit Facility maturing in October 2024;€1.75 billion Revolving Credit Facility maturing in January 2027;€2.5 billion Revolving Credit Facility maturing in January 2029.

The first facility has two six-month extension options remaining at borrowers' discretion. Alstom will, however, terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following execution of the deleveraging plan.

The last two facilities have been successfully extended by one year. On 31 March 2024, the €1.75 billion RCF line had been drawn down for €175 million, while the other two lines remained undrawn.

As per its conservative liquidity policy, the €2.5 billion Revolving Credit Facility serves as a back-up of the Group €2.5 billion Negotiable European Commercial Papers program in place. With these RCF lines (€175 million drawn on the RCF on 31 March 2024), the €1.03 billion of Neu CP outstanding on 31 March 2024, the Group benefitted from a €6.3 billion liquidity available.

5.One Alstom team - Agile, Inclusive and Responsible

Decarbonization is at the heart of Alstom's strategy. The Group is reducing its Scope 1 & 2 emissions reaching 139 ktonCO2e (representing a 39% decrease compared to March 2022), while collaborating with suppliers and customers on reducing its Scope 3 footprint. First results of this collaboration can be seen through the reduction of emissions intensity of sold product reaching 4.0 gCO2e/pass.km (i.e. (13)% compared to March 2022). Alstom CO2e emissions reduction targets had been validated on the 6th of July 2023 by the independent Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) as in line with requirements to reach Paris Agreement commitments.

The supply of electricity from renewable sources has also been expanded. Alstom signed a significant Power Purchase Agreement focused on solar development in Spain. The solar farm is expected to begin operations early 2025 with a 10-years contract. The project will cover the equivalent of 80% of Alstom's electricity consumption in Europe, so this is a major step in reaching the target of 100% electricity consumption from renewables.

Regarding Diversity & Inclusion, the Alstom in Motion (AiM) 2025 strategy targets to reach 28% of women managers, engineers and professionals' roles by 2025. As of end of March 2024, 24.7% of manager, engineer and professional roles are held by women. Alstom will continue to accelerate its efforts in the coming months.

Alstom's Corporate Social Responsibility performance is regularly evaluated by various rating agencies; the Group maintained its presence among the CAC40 ESG index for the third consecutive year and the DJSI for the 13th consecutive year. Alstom improved is scoring to ECOVADIS questionnaire with a score of 77/100 and kept AA score with MSCI agency. In addition, in 2024, Alstom improved is CDP rating, moving from B to A-. Those results reflect its strong position and strategy on Sustainability.

In addition, Alstom published for the second year European Taxonomy-aligned KPIs about Sales, Capex and Opex, pursuing strong analysis initiated last year. EU Taxonomy-aligned sales amounted to 60% and ranked Alstom among best in class, confirming the importance of the sector in which Alstom operates in achieving the EU's ambition of carbon neutrality by 2050. The EU Taxonomy purpose is to redirect capital flows towards sustainable activities and help navigate transition to a low carbon economy.

***

Mid to long-term ambitions

The Group's ambition is to deliver around 5% average sales growth over the mid to long term, thanks to a book-to-bill above 1, largely driven by Services, Signalling and Systems product lines. Rolling stock is expected to grow above market rate, Services and Signalling at high-single digit rates and Systems at double digit rates.

On profitability, Alstom's ambition is to consistently deliver an adjusted EBIT margin between 8% and 10% over the mid to long term. This improvement from 5.7% in fiscal year 2023/24 will be driven by:

Continuous improvement of gross margin in backlog thanks to quality order intake and completion of legacy projects.Improved execution through operational excellence initiatives and industrial optimisation.Cost efficiency programs across indirect procurement and overheads.

Considering the slight dilution from disposals and the revised timing of the impact from industrial optimisation, the Group expects to reach this profitability range in FY 2026/27, versus FY 2025/26 previously.

Free Cash Flow:Alstom expects free cash flow conversion to trend towards 100% of adjusted net income over the cycle. Yearly performance is subject to short-term working capital volatility, notably from the phasing of downpayments.Over the next three years, the Group expects to deliver at least €1.5 billion in free cash-flow over FY 2024/25 to FY 2026/27, despite Contract Working Capital being a headwind over that period.

APPENDIX 4 - NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INDICATORS DEFINITIONS

This section presents financial indicators used by the Group that are not defined by accounting standard setters.

Orders received

A new order is recognised as an order received only when the contract creates enforceable obligations between the Group and its customer. When this condition is met, the order is recognised at the contract value. If the contract is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the reporting unit, the Group requires the immediate elimination of currency exposure using forward currency sales. Orders are then measured using the spot rate at inception of hedging instruments.

Book-to-Bill

The book-to-bill ratio is the ratio of orders received to the amount of sales traded for a specific period.

Gross margin % on backlog

Gross Margin % on backlog is a KPI that presents the expected performance level of firm contracts in backlog. It represents the difference between the sales not yet recognized and the cost of sales not yet incurred from the contracts in backlog. This % is an average of the portfolio of contracts in backlog and is meaningful to project mid- and long-term profitability.

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA is a KPI that presents the level of recurring operational performance. It represents the sales minus the cost of sales, adjusted to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination as well as significant, non-recurring ""one off"" items that are not expected to occur again in subsequent years.

EBIT before PPA

Following the Bombardier Transportation acquisition and with effect from the fiscal year 2021/22 condensed consolidated financial statements, Alstom decided to introduce the ""EBIT before PPA"" KPI aimed at restating its Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (""EBIT"") to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination. This KPI is also aligned with market practice.

Adjusted EBIT

Adjusted EBIT (""aEBIT"") is the Key Performance Indicator to present the level of recurring operational performance. This indicator is also aligned with market practice and comparable to direct competitors.

Starting September 2019, Alstom has opted for the inclusion of the share in net income of the equity-accounted investments into the aEBIT when these are considered to be part of the operating activities of the Group (because there are significant operational flows and/or common project execution with these entities). This mainly includes Chinese joint-ventures, namely CASCO joint-venture for Alstom as well as, following the integration of Bombardier Transportation, Alstom Sifang (Qingdao) Transportation Ltd. (formerly Bombardier Sifang), Bombardier NUG Propulsion System Co. Ltd and Changchun Changke Alstom Railway Vehicles Company Ltd (formerly Changchun Bombardier).

aEBIT corresponds to Earning Before Interests and Tax adjusted for the following elements:

net restructuring expenses (including rationalization costs)tangibles and intangibles impairmentcapital gains or loss/revaluation on investments disposals or controls changes of an entityany other non-recurring items, such as some costs incurred to realize business combinations and amortization of an asset exclusively valued in the context of business combination, as well as litigation costs that have arisen outside the ordinary course of businessand including the share in net income of the operational equity-accounted investments

A non-recurring item is a ""one-off"" exceptional item that is not supposed to occur again in following years and that is significant.

Adjusted EBIT margin corresponds to Adjusted EBIT expressed as a percentage of sales.

EBITDA + JV dividends

EBITDA before PPA plus dividends from joint ventures is the EBIT before PPA, before depreciation and amortisation, with the addition of the dividends received from joint ventures.

Adjusted net profit

The ""Adjusted Net Profit"" KPI restates Alstom's net profit from continued operations (Group share) to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination, net of the corresponding tax effect. This indicator is also aligned with market practice.

Free cash flow

Free Cash Flow is de?ned as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures including capitalised development costs, net of proceeds from disposals of tangible and intangible assets. Free Cash Flow does not include any proceeds from disposals of activity.

The most directly comparable financial measure to Free Cash Flow calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS is net cash provided by operating activities.

Funds from Operations

Funds from Operations ""FFO"" in the EBIT to FCF statement refers to the Free Cash Flow generated by Operations, before Working Capital variations.

Contract and Trade Working Capital

Contract Working Capital is the sum of:

Contract Assets & Liabilities, which includes the Customer Down-PaymentsCurrent provisions, which includes Risks on contracts and Warranties

Trade Working Capital is the Working Capital that is not strictly related to contract. It includes all the elements of the working capital but

Contract Working Capital Income Tax receivables and payablesRestructuring provisions

Net cash/(debt)

The net cash/(debt) is defined as cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and other current financial asset, less borrowings.

Pay-out ratio

The pay-out ratio is calculated by dividing the amount of the overall dividend with the ""Adjusted Net profit from continuing operations attributable to equity holders of the parent, Group share"" as presented in the management report in the consolidated financial statements.

Organic basis

This press release includes performance indicators presented on a reported basis and on an organic basis. Figures given on an organic basis eliminate the impact of changes in scope of consolidation and changes resulting from the translation of the accounts into Euro following the variation of foreign currencies against the Euro.

The Group uses figures prepared on an organic basis both for internal analysis and for external communication, as it believes they provide means to analyse and explain variations from one period to another. However, these figures are not measurements of performance under IFRS.

Sales were €17.6 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio at 1.1.

The backlog reached €92 billion, providing strong visibility on future sales. Gross margin on backlog reached 17.5% as of 31 March 2024, compared to 16.9% on 31 March 2023.

In the fiscal year 2023/24, Alstom's adjusted EBIT was €997 million, up 17%, equivalent to a 5.7% aEBIT margin, and EBIT before PPA was €356 million. Adjusted net profit was €44 million, net income (group share) was €(309) million, and free cash flow was €(557) million for the full year.

On 31 March 2024, the Group's net debt position stood at €(2,994) million, compared to the €(2,135) million the Group reported on 31 March 2023. Alstom benefits from a solid €6.3 billion liquidity position and equity amounting to €8,778 million on 31 March 2024.

The Board of Directors, in its meeting of 7 May 2024, proposed that no dividend will be paid with regards to the fiscal year 2023/24.

""Alstom recorded a strong rebound during the second half of the year, with solid order intake, strong organic growth, improved profitability and €562 million free cash-flow generation. Thanks to the support of our reference shareholders, we will swiftly execute the €2 billion deleveraging plan, allowing for the stabilization of its Investment Grade rating. In April, we announced the sale of Alstom's conventional signalling business in North America at a favourable valuation, demonstrating the quality and attractiveness of the Group's assets. We are confident in the strength of our backlog and our strategy of selectivity and mix evolution towards services. The Group is capitalizing on the solid operational progress made over the last three years and is launching new initiatives to improve its industrial performance and reduce overheads and indirect procurement costs. Altogether, Alstom is now set on stronger foundations to deliver sustainable profit and cash generation."" said Henri Poupart-Lafarge, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Alstom.

Progress on Alstom's action plan to support its financial targets

During the second half of fiscal year 2023/24, the Group mobilised around the operational, commercial, and cost efficiency plan:

The €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan highlighting commitment to Investment Grade

As announced in November 2023 and reiterated in January 2024, Alstom's Board of Directors is committed to a conservative financial policy and to protect the Group's Investment Grade rating, in particular through a ca. €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan.

This plan and its execution, which have been unanimously approved by Alstom's Board of Directors, has the following components:

The ca. €2.4 billion proceeds correspond to ca. €2 billion of deleveraging, mainly due to the hybrid bond's 50% Moody's debt content.

Each of CDPQ and Bpifrance, holding respectively 17.4% and 7.5% of Alstom's capital, has declared to the Company its intention to subscribe for its pro-rata share of the capital increase.

In addition, Alstom has entered into a standby underwriting commitment with BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, J.P. Morgan and Société Générale, acting as Joint Global Coordinators, pursuant to which they have undertaken to underwrite the remainder of the capital raise (i.e. ca. €750 million), subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions precedent.

Circa €1.2 billion of the proceeds of asset disposals and of the capital markets transactions will be used to repay financial debt by September 2024:

The remainder of the proceeds will be invested in highly liquid short-term investment (cash equivalent treatment) and will be earmarked for gross debt reduction at maturity.

Alstom Baa3 long-term issuer rating is reaffirmed, and the outlook will be changed to stable upon successful closing of the hybrid bond issuance and the rights issue.

Alstom will terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following the execution of the deleveraging plan.

During the fiscal year 2023/24, the Group recorded €18.9 billion in orders, with commercial success across multiple geographies, notably in Europe, Asia/Pacific and in Americas. During the last fiscal year, Alstom reported an order intake of €20.7 billion. The (8)% decrease is mostly driven by last year's landmark contract awarded by Landesanstalt Schienenfahrzeuge Baden Württemberg (SFBW) network in Germany of almost €2.5 billion.

In Europe, Alstom recorded €11.3 billion order intake during the fiscal year 2023/24, compared with €12.8 billion over the last fiscal year.

In the U.K, Alstom has signed an eight-year extension to its Train Services Agreement (TSA) with CrossCountry. The contract extension, valued at around €950 million, further secures this long-term partnership and is evidence of the trust placed by the customer.

In France, Alstom will supply île-de-France Mobilités and RATP with 103 new MF19 trainsets, which is the new generation metro on rail, for a total contract value of more than €800 million, 100% financed by Île-de-France Mobilités. This new fleet will replace the existing rolling stock on lines 13, 12 and 8 of the Île-de-France metro as of 2027. The Group also signed a framework contract with Akiem European rolling stock leasing company for 100 Traxx Universal multi-system (MS3) locomotives, together with an initial firm order for 65 locomotives. The total amount of the framework agreement is up €500 million.

In Germany, Alstom was awarded a contract to supply 40 Coradia Stream High-Capacity electric multiple units together with full maintenance for 30 years to Nahverkehrsverbund Schleswig-Holstein (NAH.SH), valued at close to €900 million, and including an option for up to 55 additional trains with a corresponding full-service package. The Group also signed a contract with RAILPOOL for 50 Traxx Universal multi-purpose locomotives.

In Romania, Alstom, as part of a consortium with the civil works companies Gulermak and Arcada, also signed a contract with the Cluj-Napoca City Hall in Romania for the construction of the Cluj-Napoca Metro Line 1. Alstom's share of this state-of-the-art turnkey project reaches approximately €400 million.

In Italy, Alstom was awarded a contract for the supply of high-speed trains.

In Americas, Alstom reported €2.0 billion order intake, compared with €2.7 billion over the last fiscal year, driven by a contract with the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) in the United States to deliver 130 full low floor electric streetcars for Philadelphia, valued at over €667 million and with options to build an additional 30 streetcars. And the Group was awarded a contract by the Connecticut Department of Transportation (CTDOT) in the United States to supply 60 single-level rail coach cars valued at approximately €285 million with options to build an additional 313 cars, as part of CTDOT's coach renewal program for its statewide rail system.

In Asia/Pacific, the order intake stood at €3.2 billion, compared to €3.0 billion for the last fiscal year. In the Philippines, Alstom in consortium with Colas Rail has been awarded by Mitsubishi Corporation a contract to provide an integrated railway system for the extension of the North-South Commuter Railway project (NSCR). Alstom's contract share is worth approximately €1 billion. In Australia, Alstom has been awarded a contract worth around €900 million to maintain the regional rolling stock VLocity and Classic fleets in Victoria, Australia for the next decade.

In Africa/Middle East/Central Asia, the Group reported €2.4 billion order intake, compared with €2.2 billion over the last fiscal year. In Israel, Alstom, a member of the TMT Consortium (TLV Metropolitan Tramway Ltd.) and its partners Electra Ltd. & Dan Public Transportation Ltd., have reached financial closure on the contract, awarded in May 2022, to design, build, maintain, and finance the Tel Aviv Metropolitan LRT Green line by Metropolitan Mass Transit System Ltd (NTA). Alstom's share is valued at €858 million. In Saudi Arabia, Alstom signed a contract of over €500 million with The Royal Commission for AlUla (RCU) for AlUla's pioneering battery-powered tramway - the world's longest catenary-free line.

As of 31 March 2024, the backlog stood at €92 billion, providing the Group with strong visibility over future sales.

Alstom's sales amounted to €17.6 billion for the fiscal year 2023/24, representing a growth of 6.7% on a reported basis and a strong 9.4% on an organic basis compared with Alstom sales in the last fiscal year. Sales related to non-performing backlog, corresponding to sales on legacy projects with a negative margin at completion, amounted to €1.7 billion during the fiscal year 2023/24.

Rolling stock sales reached €9.1 billion, representing an increase of 3.9% on a reported basis and 6.5% on an organic basis, driven by contracts ramp-up in France, Belgium and in the US, and the solid level of execution in South Africa, India and Europe.

Services sales stood at €4.3 billion, up 11.9% on a reported basis and 14.3% on an organic basis versus last year, benefiting from the continuous ramp-up in the UK, in Italy and in the US as well as a solid level of execution in Canada.

In Signalling, Alstom reported €2.6 billion sales, up 8.9% on a reported basis and 11.8% on an organic basis versus last year, led by a consistent execution across all regions, mainly in Europe and in APAC.

Systems sales grew 6.9% on a reported basis and 9.3% on an organic basis, and stood at €1.6 billion, driven by a good performance of Turnkey Systems projects in Mexico, Egypt and Canada.

On 14 September 2023, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US department of Treasury added JSC Transmashholding (TMH AO) to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Person (SDN) List. TMH AO is the Russian holding company of TMH Group and is 100% owned by TMH Limited, and Alstom was holding a 20% stake in TMH limited. The Group further assessed potential exposures arising from the new OFAC sanctions and made the decision to sell its stake in TMH. The transaction was closed early January 2024 for an amount of €75 million, carrying value was nil as result of previous impairment, contributing to the de-risking of the company's portfolio.

On 19 April 2024, Alstom announced that it had entered into a binding agreement with Knorr-Bremse AG, to sell Alstom's North American conventional signalling business for a purchase price of around €630 million. Closing of the transaction is only subject to customary conditions, including regulatory approval, and is expected to take place as soon as summer 2024. Proceeds for Alstom at closing, net of expected tax and transaction costs, are expected to be around €620 million.

2. Innovation by Pioneering Smarter and Greener Mobility for All

As of end of March 2024, research and development gross costs amounted to €749 million, i.e. 4.3% of sales, delivering on the Alstom In Motion strategy which is based on three pillars: Autonomous mobility, Data factory and Mobility orchestration. Net R&D amounts to €549 million before PPA amortisation.

Programs funded by IPCEI Hydrogen are ongoing. This important European program supports the development of new hydrogen trains for regional applications, shunting locos and freight, leveraging on the experience collected with Coradia iLint regional trains that are now in revenue service.

Homologation tests of Avelia Horizon are planned in 2024 to enable a start of revenue service in 2025. The development of international configurations is ongoing. Alstom has launched the development of Avelia stream 300, addressing the high-speed single deck segment with a first project for Italy.

The replacement of Adessia commuter train has been launched to address the U.K. and USA markets. This new product range will include EMU, BMU, BEMU and HMU versions to also replace the existing Diesel trains.

TRAXX Multi-system 3 - locomotives is pursuing homologation tests in 2024 to enable it to run on the different European corridors. It includes the passenger version which can be operated at 200kph.

Services product line is focused on addressing green, sustainable and more efficient operation concepts. Green re-tractioning initiatives include for example the retrofit with hydrogen-fuelled internal combustion engines for locomotives and the ability to provide autonomy for non-electrified lines via the so-called ""Last-mile"" functionality supported by the IPCEI H2 program.

Signalling Product Line worked on Onvia Control L2 A and Onvia Control L2 B European Standard convergence, driving market presence with its integration into TRAXX platform and securing new contracts for cross border operation, Onvia Cab level 2 and level 3 on-board solution together with Automatic Train Operation, and it continued its footprint expansion with a new contract in Canada.

Alstom Innovations cluster continued to develop Autonomous Mobility solutions for Passengers & Freight trains. Major milestones on the roadmap to achieve GoA4 (Grade of Automation 4) have been successfully passed under real mainline operating conditions on passengers and freight train with SNCF in France, and for operation in yard in the Netherlands.

Alstom has also made great strides in developing a new SaaS platform that will enhance its global digital offering. The platform streamlines applications integration and deployment in a trusted and future-proof ecosystem.

The adjusted EBIT margin has progressed from 5.2% over the fiscal year 2022/23 to 5.7% over the fiscal year 2023/24, benefiting from further synergies for 30bps, a steady reduction of non-performing legacy contracts sales for an impact of 30bps, an increased volume and favourable mix delivering 20bps gross margin expansion, partially offset by the negative gross margin impact related to the legacy portfolio deviations for (30)bps.

Alstom recorded restructuring and rationalisation charges of €(147) million mainly related to the reduction of overhead costs for €(115) million (""Autumn"" plan) and adaptation of the production setup for €(32) million, including the United Kingdom for €(14) million, Germany for €(8) million, France for €(3) million, Spain for €(3) million and the U.S.A. for €(2) million.

Costs related to the integration of Bombardier Transportation were recorded for an amount of €(142) million. €(118) million charges were related to some legal proceedings outside the ordinary course of business mainly for two projects - in U.S.A. and in Turkey, and for legal fees in the context of the claim against Bombardier Inc. €(30) million were related to impairment of assets due to the exit from Russia. Other exceptional expenses were recorded for €(73) million, of which €(36) million of consequential impacts from restructuring plan already initiated in Germany.

Alstom's EBIT before amortisation and impairment of assets exclusively valued when determining the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") stood at €356 million. This compares to €366 million for the last fiscal year.

The share in net income from equity investments amounted to €7 million, excluding the amortisation of the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") from Chinese joint ventures of €(10) million.

Adjusted net profit, representing the group's share of net profit from continued operations excluding PPA net of tax, amounts to €44 million for the fiscal year 2023/24. This compares to an adjusted net profit of €292 million during the last fiscal year.

The Group's Net profit/(loss) (Group share) stood at €(309) million for the fiscal year 2023/24, compared to €(132) million last fiscal year.

4. Financial structure

The Group's Free Cash Flow stands at €(557) million for the fiscal year 2023/24 as compared to €199 million during the last fiscal year and €(1,119) million at the first half of fiscal year 2023/24. Cash generation was impacted over the full year by an unfavourable €(856) million change in working capital compared to €(219) million in the last fiscal year; mostly due to change in Trade Working Capital as well as the reversal effect of the change in law on VAT in France for €(380) million. The Contract Working Capital is positively impacted by the acceleration of deliveries from major contracts in the second half of the year, strong collections of down payments as well as reduction of provision for risk on contracts.

On 31 March 2024, the Group recorded a net debt position of €(2,994) million.

In addition to its available cash and cash equivalents, amounting to €976 million on 31 March 2024, the Group benefits from strong liquidity with:

The first facility has two six-month extension options remaining at borrowers' discretion. Alstom will, however, terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following execution of the deleveraging plan.

The last two facilities have been successfully extended by one year. On 31 March 2024, the €1.75 billion RCF line had been drawn down for €175 million, while the other two lines remained undrawn.

As per its conservative liquidity policy, the €2.5 billion Revolving Credit Facility serves as a back-up of the Group €2.5 billion Negotiable European Commercial Papers program in place. With these RCF lines (€175 million drawn on the RCF on 31 March 2024), the €1.03 billion of Neu CP outstanding on 31 March 2024, the Group benefitted from a €6.3 billion liquidity available.

5. One Alstom team - Agile, Inclusive and Responsible

Decarbonization is at the heart of Alstom's strategy. The Group is reducing its Scope 1 & 2 emissions reaching 139 ktonCO2e (representing a 39% decrease compared to March 2022), while collaborating with suppliers and customers on reducing its Scope 3 footprint. First results of this collaboration can be seen through the reduction of emissions intensity of sold product reaching 4.0 gCO2e/pass.km (i.e. (13)% compared to March 2022). Alstom CO2e emissions reduction targets had been validated on the 6 of July 2023 by the independent Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) as in line with requirements to reach Paris Agreement commitments.

The supply of electricity from renewable sources has also been expanded. Alstom signed a significant Power Purchase Agreement focused on solar development in Spain. The solar farm is expected to begin operations early 2025 with a 10-years contract. The project will cover the equivalent of 80% of Alstom's electricity consumption in Europe, so this is a major step in reaching the target of 100% electricity consumption from renewables.

Regarding Diversity & Inclusion, the Alstom in Motion (AiM) 2025 strategy targets to reach 28% of women managers, engineers and professionals' roles by 2025. As of end of March 2024, 24.7% of manager, engineer and professional roles are held by women. Alstom will continue to accelerate its efforts in the coming months.

Alstom's Corporate Social Responsibility performance is regularly evaluated by various rating agencies; the Group maintained its presence among the CAC40 ESG index for the third consecutive year and the DJSI for the 13 consecutive year. Alstom improved is scoring to ECOVADIS questionnaire with a score of 77/100 and kept AA score with MSCI agency. In addition, in 2024, Alstom improved is CDP rating, moving from B to A-. Those results reflect its strong position and strategy on Sustainability.

In addition, Alstom published for the second year European Taxonomy-aligned KPIs about Sales, Capex and Opex, pursuing strong analysis initiated last year. EU Taxonomy-aligned sales amounted to 60% and ranked Alstom among best in class, confirming the importance of the sector in which Alstom operates in achieving the EU's ambition of carbon neutrality by 2050. The EU Taxonomy purpose is to redirect capital flows towards sustainable activities and help navigate transition to a low carbon economy.

The outlook for FY 2024/25 is based on following main assumptions:

Considering the slight dilution from disposals and the revised timing of the impact from industrial optimisation, the Group expects to reach this profitability range in FY 2026/27, versus FY 2025/26 previously.

Alstom is pleased to invite you to a conference call presenting its full year results for Fiscal Year 2023/24 on Wednesday 8 May at 08:30 am (Paris time), hosted by Henri Poupart-Lafarge, CEO and Bernard Delpit, CFO.

APPENDIX 4 - NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INDICATORS DEFINITIONS

This section presents financial indicators used by the Group that are not defined by accounting standard setters.

Orders received

A new order is recognised as an order received only when the contract creates enforceable obligations between the Group and its customer. When this condition is met, the order is recognised at the contract value. If the contract is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the reporting unit, the Group requires the immediate elimination of currency exposure using forward currency sales. Orders are then measured using the spot rate at inception of hedging instruments.

Book-to-Bill

The book-to-bill ratio is the ratio of orders received to the amount of sales traded for a specific period.

Gross margin % on backlog

Gross Margin % on backlog is a KPI that presents the expected performance level of firm contracts in backlog. It represents the difference between the sales not yet recognized and the cost of sales not yet incurred from the contracts in backlog. This % is an average of the portfolio of contracts in backlog and is meaningful to project mid- and long-term profitability.

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA is a KPI that presents the level of recurring operational performance. It represents the sales minus the cost of sales, adjusted to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination as well as significant, non-recurring ""one off"" items that are not expected to occur again in subsequent years.

EBIT before PPA

Following the Bombardier Transportation acquisition and with effect from the fiscal year 2021/22 condensed consolidated financial statements, Alstom decided to introduce the ""EBIT before PPA"" KPI aimed at restating its Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (""EBIT"") to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination. This KPI is also aligned with market practice.

Adjusted EBIT

Adjusted EBIT (""aEBIT"") is the Key Performance Indicator to present the level of recurring operational performance. This indicator is also aligned with market practice and comparable to direct competitors.

Starting September 2019, Alstom has opted for the inclusion of the share in net income of the equity-accounted investments into the aEBIT when these are considered to be part of the operating activities of the Group (because there are significant operational flows and/or common project execution with these entities). This mainly includes Chinese joint-ventures, namely CASCO joint-venture for Alstom as well as, following the integration of Bombardier Transportation, Alstom Sifang (Qingdao) Transportation Ltd. (formerly Bombardier Sifang), Bombardier NUG Propulsion System Co. Ltd and Changchun Changke Alstom Railway Vehicles Company Ltd (formerly Changchun Bombardier).

aEBIT corresponds to Earning Before Interests and Tax adjusted for the following elements:

A non-recurring item is a ""one-off"" exceptional item that is not supposed to occur again in following years and that is significant.

Adjusted EBIT margin corresponds to Adjusted EBIT expressed as a percentage of sales.

EBITDA + JV dividends

EBITDA before PPA plus dividends from joint ventures is the EBIT before PPA, before depreciation and amortisation, with the addition of the dividends received from joint ventures.

Adjusted net profit

The ""Adjusted Net Profit"" KPI restates Alstom's net profit from continued operations (Group share) to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination, net of the corresponding tax effect. This indicator is also aligned with market practice.

Free cash flow

Free Cash Flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures including capitalised development costs, net of proceeds from disposals of tangible and intangible assets. Free Cash Flow does not include any proceeds from disposals of activity.

The most directly comparable financial measure to Free Cash Flow calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS is net cash provided by operating activities.

Funds from Operations

Funds from Operations ""FFO"" in the EBIT to FCF statement refers to the Free Cash Flow generated by Operations, before Working Capital variations.

Contract and Trade Working Capital

Contract Working Capital is the sum of:

Trade Working Capital is the Working Capital that is not strictly related to contract. It includes all the elements of the working capital but

Net cash/(debt)

The net cash/(debt) is defined as cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and other current financial asset, less borrowings.

Pay-out ratio

The pay-out ratio is calculated by dividing the amount of the overall dividend with the ""Adjusted Net profit from continuing operations attributable to equity holders of the parent, Group share"" as presented in the management report in the consolidated financial statements.

Organic basis

This press release includes performance indicators presented on a reported basis and on an organic basis. Figures given on an organic basis eliminate the impact of changes in scope of consolidation and changes resulting from the translation of the accounts into Euro following the variation of foreign currencies against the Euro.

The Group uses figures prepared on an organic basis both for internal analysis and for external communication, as it believes they provide means to analyse and explain variations from one period to another. However, these figures are not measurements of performance under IFRS.",wallstreet-online.de,news,wallstreet:online,,0.1686274509803922,452842931,12,https://assets.wallstreet-online.de/_media/6/source1280/size_645/globenewswire-1280.png,eng-9548481

Thanks to the support of our reference shareholders, we will swiftly execute the €2 billion deleveraging plan, allowing for the stabilization of its Investment Grade rating. In April, we announced the sale of Alstom's conventional signalling business in North America at a favourable valuation, demonstrating the quality and attractiveness of the Group's assets. We are confident in the strength of our backlog and our strategy of selectivity and mix evolution towards services. The Group is capitalizing on the solid operational progress made over the last three years and is launching new initiatives to improve its industrial performance and reduce overheads and indirect procurement costs. Altogether, Alstom is now set on stronger foundations to deliver sustainable profit and cash generation."" said Henri Poupart-Lafarge, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Alstom.

Progress on Alstom's action plan to support its financial targets

During the second half of fiscal year 2023/24, the Group mobilised around the operational, commercial, and cost efficiency plan:

The €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan highlighting commitment to Investment Grade

As announced in November 2023 and reiterated in January 2024, Alstom's Board of Directors is committed to a conservative financial policy and to protect the Group's Investment Grade rating, in particular through a ca. €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan.

This plan and its execution, which have been unanimously approved by Alstom's Board of Directors, has the following components:

The ca. €2.4 billion proceeds correspond to ca. €2 billion of deleveraging, mainly due to the hybrid bond's 50% Moody's debt content.

Each of CDPQ and Bpifrance, holding respectively 17.4% and 7.5% of Alstom's capital, has declared to the Company its intention to subscribe for its pro-rata share of the capital increase.

In addition, Alstom has entered into a standby underwriting commitment with BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, J.P. Morgan and Société Générale, acting as Joint Global Coordinators, pursuant to which they have undertaken to underwrite the remainder of the capital raise (i.e. ca. €750 million), subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions precedent.

Circa €1.2 billion of the proceeds of asset disposals and of the capital markets transactions will be used to repay financial debt by September 2024:

The remainder of the proceeds will be invested in highly liquid short-term investment (cash equivalent treatment) and will be earmarked for gross debt reduction at maturity.

Alstom Baa3 long-term issuer rating is reaffirmed, and the outlook will be changed to stable upon successful closing of the hybrid bond issuance and the rights issue.

Alstom will terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following the execution of the deleveraging plan.

During the fiscal year 2023/24, the Group recorded €18.9 billion in orders, with commercial success across multiple geographies, notably in Europe, Asia/Pacific and in Americas. During the last fiscal year, Alstom reported an order intake of €20.7 billion. The (8)% decrease is mostly driven by last year's landmark contract awarded by Landesanstalt Schienenfahrzeuge Baden Württemberg (SFBW) network in Germany of almost €2.5 billion.

In Europe, Alstom recorded €11.3 billion order intake during the fiscal year 2023/24, compared with €12.8 billion over the last fiscal year.

In the U.K, Alstom has signed an eight-year extension to its Train Services Agreement (TSA) with CrossCountry. The contract extension, valued at around €950 million, further secures this long-term partnership and is evidence of the trust placed by the customer.

In France, Alstom will supply île-de-France Mobilités and RATP with 103 new MF19 trainsets, which is the new generation metro on rail, for a total contract value of more than €800 million, 100% financed by Île-de-France Mobilités. This new fleet will replace the existing rolling stock on lines 13, 12 and 8 of the Île-de-France metro as of 2027. The Group also signed a framework contract with Akiem European rolling stock leasing company for 100 Traxx Universal multi-system (MS3) locomotives, together with an initial firm order for 65 locomotives. The total amount of the framework agreement is up €500 million.

In Germany, Alstom was awarded a contract to supply 40 Coradia Stream High-Capacity electric multiple units together with full maintenance for 30 years to Nahverkehrsverbund Schleswig-Holstein (NAH.SH), valued at close to €900 million, and including an option for up to 55 additional trains with a corresponding full-service package. The Group also signed a contract with RAILPOOL for 50 Traxx Universal multi-purpose locomotives.

In Romania, Alstom, as part of a consortium with the civil works companies Gulermak and Arcada, also signed a contract with the Cluj-Napoca City Hall in Romania for the construction of the Cluj-Napoca Metro Line 1. Alstom's share of this state-of-the-art turnkey project reaches approximately €400 million.

In Italy, Alstom was awarded a contract for the supply of high-speed trains.

In Americas, Alstom reported €2.0 billion order intake, compared with €2.7 billion over the last fiscal year, driven by a contract with the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) in the United States to deliver 130 full low floor electric streetcars for Philadelphia, valued at over €667 million and with options to build an additional 30 streetcars. And the Group was awarded a contract by the Connecticut Department of Transportation (CTDOT) in the United States to supply 60 single-level rail coach cars valued at approximately €285 million with options to build an additional 313 cars, as part of CTDOT's coach renewal program for its statewide rail system.

In Asia/Pacific, the order intake stood at €3.2 billion, compared to €3.0 billion for the last fiscal year. In the Philippines, Alstom in consortium with Colas Rail has been awarded by Mitsubishi Corporation a contract to provide an integrated railway system for the extension of the North-South Commuter Railway project (NSCR). Alstom's contract share is worth approximately €1 billion. In Australia, Alstom has been awarded a contract worth around €900 million to maintain the regional rolling stock VLocity and Classic fleets in Victoria, Australia for the next decade.

In Africa/Middle East/Central Asia, the Group reported €2.4 billion order intake, compared with €2.2 billion over the last fiscal year. In Israel, Alstom, a member of the TMT Consortium (TLV Metropolitan Tramway Ltd.) and its partners Electra Ltd. & Dan Public Transportation Ltd., have reached financial closure on the contract, awarded in May 2022, to design, build, maintain, and finance the Tel Aviv Metropolitan LRT Green line by Metropolitan Mass Transit System Ltd (NTA). Alstom's share is valued at €858 million. In Saudi Arabia, Alstom signed a contract of over €500 million with The Royal Commission for AlUla (RCU) for AlUla's pioneering battery-powered tramway - the world's longest catenary-free line.

As of 31 March 2024, the backlog stood at €92 billion, providing the Group with strong visibility over future sales.

Alstom's sales amounted to €17.6 billion for the fiscal year 2023/24, representing a growth of 6.7% on a reported basis and a strong 9.4% on an organic basis compared with Alstom sales in the last fiscal year. Sales related to non-performing backlog, corresponding to sales on legacy projects with a negative margin at completion, amounted to €1.7 billion during the fiscal year 2023/24.

Rolling stock sales reached €9.1 billion, representing an increase of 3.9% on a reported basis and 6.5% on an organic basis, driven by contracts ramp-up in France, Belgium and in the US, and the solid level of execution in South Africa, India and Europe.

Services sales stood at €4.3 billion, up 11.9% on a reported basis and 14.3% on an organic basis versus last year, benefiting from the continuous ramp-up in the UK, in Italy and in the US as well as a solid level of execution in Canada.

In Signalling, Alstom reported €2.6 billion sales, up 8.9% on a reported basis and 11.8% on an organic basis versus last year, led by a consistent execution across all regions, mainly in Europe and in APAC.

Systems sales grew 6.9% on a reported basis and 9.3% on an organic basis, and stood at €1.6 billion, driven by a good performance of Turnkey Systems projects in Mexico, Egypt and Canada.

On 14 September 2023, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US department of Treasury added JSC Transmashholding (TMH AO) to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Person (SDN) List. TMH AO is the Russian holding company of TMH Group and is 100% owned by TMH Limited, and Alstom was holding a 20% stake in TMH limited. The Group further assessed potential exposures arising from the new OFAC sanctions and made the decision to sell its stake in TMH. The transaction was closed early January 2024 for an amount of €75 million, carrying value was nil as result of previous impairment, contributing to the de-risking of the company's portfolio.

On 19 April 2024, Alstom announced that it had entered into a binding agreement with Knorr-Bremse AG, to sell Alstom's North American conventional signalling business for a purchase price of around €630 million. Closing of the transaction is only subject to customary conditions, including regulatory approval, and is expected to take place as soon as summer 2024. Proceeds for Alstom at closing, net of expected tax and transaction costs, are expected to be around €620 million.

2. Innovation by Pioneering Smarter and Greener Mobility for All

As of end of March 2024, research and development gross costs amounted to €749 million, i.e. 4.3% of sales, delivering on the Alstom In Motion strategy which is based on three pillars: Autonomous mobility, Data factory and Mobility orchestration. Net R&D amounts to €549 million before PPA amortisation.

Programs funded by IPCEI Hydrogen are ongoing. This important European program supports the development of new hydrogen trains for regional applications, shunting locos and freight, leveraging on the experience collected with Coradia iLint™ regional trains that are now in revenue service.

Homologation tests of Avelia Horizon™ are planned in 2024 to enable a start of revenue service in 2025. The development of international configurations is ongoing. Alstom has launched the development of Avelia stream™ 300, addressing the high-speed single deck segment with a first project for Italy.

The replacement of Adessia™ commuter train has been launched to address the U.K. and USA markets. This new product range will include EMU, BMU, BEMU and HMU versions to also replace the existing Diesel trains.

TRAXX™ Multi-system 3 - locomotives is pursuing homologation tests in 2024 to enable it to run on the different European corridors. It includes the passenger version which can be operated at 200kph.

Services product line is focused on addressing green, sustainable and more efficient operation concepts. Green re-tractioning initiatives include for example the retrofit with hydrogen-fuelled internal combustion engines for locomotives and the ability to provide autonomy for non-electrified lines via the so-called ""Last-mile"" functionality supported by the IPCEI H2 program.

Signalling Product Line worked on Onvia Control™ L2 A and Onvia Control™ L2 B European Standard convergence, driving market presence with its integration into TRAXX platform and securing new contracts for cross border operation, Onvia Cab™ level 2 and level 3 on-board solution together with Automatic Train Operation, and it continued its footprint expansion with a new contract in Canada.

Alstom Innovations cluster continued to develop Autonomous Mobility solutions for Passengers & Freight trains. Major milestones on the roadmap to achieve GoA4 (Grade of Automation 4) have been successfully passed under real mainline operating conditions on passengers and freight train with SNCF in France, and for operation in yard in the Netherlands.

Alstom has also made great strides in developing a new SaaS platform that will enhance its global digital offering. The platform streamlines applications integration and deployment in a trusted and future-proof ecosystem.

The adjusted EBIT margin has progressed from 5.2% over the fiscal year 2022/23 to 5.7% over the fiscal year 2023/24, benefiting from further synergies for 30bps, a steady reduction of non-performing legacy contracts sales for an impact of 30bps, an increased volume and favourable mix delivering 20bps gross margin expansion, partially offset by the negative gross margin impact related to the legacy portfolio deviations for (30)bps.

Alstom recorded restructuring and rationalisation charges of €(147) million mainly related to the reduction of overhead costs for €(115) million (""Autumn"" plan) and adaptation of the production setup for €(32) million, including the United Kingdom for €(14) million, Germany for €(8) million, France for €(3) million, Spain for €(3) million and the U.S.A. for €(2) million.

Costs related to the integration of Bombardier Transportation were recorded for an amount of €(142) million. €(118) million charges were related to some legal proceedings outside the ordinary course of business mainly for two projects - in U.S.A. and in Turkey, and for legal fees in the context of the claim against Bombardier Inc. €(30) million were related to impairment of assets due to the exit from Russia. Other exceptional expenses were recorded for €(73) million, of which €(36) million of consequential impacts from restructuring plan already initiated in Germany.

Alstom's EBIT before amortisation and impairment of assets exclusively valued when determining the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") stood at €356 million. This compares to €366 million for the last fiscal year.

The share in net income from equity investments amounted to €7 million, excluding the amortisation of the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") from Chinese joint ventures of €(10) million.

Adjusted net profit, representing the group's share of net profit from continued operations excluding PPA net of tax, amounts to €44 million for the fiscal year 2023/24. This compares to an adjusted net profit of €292 million during the last fiscal year.

The Group's Net profit/(loss) (Group share) stood at €(309) million for the fiscal year 2023/24, compared to €(132) million last fiscal year.

4. Financial structure

The Group's Free Cash Flow stands at €(557) million for the fiscal year 2023/24 as compared to €199 million during the last fiscal year and €(1,119) million at the first half of fiscal year 2023/24. Cash generation was impacted over the full year by an unfavourable €(856) million change in working capital compared to €(219) million in the last fiscal year; mostly due to change in Trade Working Capital as well as the reversal effect of the change in law on VAT in France for €(380) million. The Contract Working Capital is positively impacted by the acceleration of deliveries from major contracts in the second half of the year, strong collections of down payments as well as reduction of provision for risk on contracts.

On 31 March 2024, the Group recorded a net debt position of €(2,994) million.

In addition to its available cash and cash equivalents, amounting to €976 million on 31 March 2024, the Group benefits from strong liquidity with:

The first facility has two six-month extension options remaining at borrowers' discretion. Alstom will, however, terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following execution of the deleveraging plan.

The last two facilities have been successfully extended by one year. On 31 March 2024, the €1.75 billion RCF line had been drawn down for €175 million, while the other two lines remained undrawn.

As per its conservative liquidity policy, the €2.5 billion Revolving Credit Facility serves as a back-up of the Group €2.5 billion Negotiable European Commercial Papers program in place. With these RCF lines (€175 million drawn on the RCF on 31 March 2024), the €1.03 billion of Neu CP outstanding on 31 March 2024, the Group benefitted from a €6.3 billion liquidity available.

5. One Alstom team - Agile, Inclusive and Responsible

Decarbonization is at the heart of Alstom's strategy. The Group is reducing its Scope 1 & 2 emissions reaching 139 ktonCO2e (representing a 39% decrease compared to March 2022), while collaborating with suppliers and customers on reducing its Scope 3 footprint. First results of this collaboration can be seen through the reduction of emissions intensity of sold product reaching 4.0 gCO2e/pass.km (i.e. (13)% compared to March 2022). Alstom CO2e emissions reduction targets had been validated on the 6 of July 2023 by the independent Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) as in line with requirements to reach Paris Agreement commitments.

The supply of electricity from renewable sources has also been expanded. Alstom signed a significant Power Purchase Agreement focused on solar development in Spain. The solar farm is expected to begin operations early 2025 with a 10-years contract. The project will cover the equivalent of 80% of Alstom's electricity consumption in Europe, so this is a major step in reaching the target of 100% electricity consumption from renewables.

Regarding Diversity & Inclusion, the Alstom in Motion (AiM) 2025 strategy targets to reach 28% of women managers, engineers and professionals' roles by 2025. As of end of March 2024, 24.7% of manager, engineer and professional roles are held by women. Alstom will continue to accelerate its efforts in the coming months.

Alstom's Corporate Social Responsibility performance is regularly evaluated by various rating agencies; the Group maintained its presence among the CAC40 ESG index for the third consecutive year and the DJSI for the 13 consecutive year. Alstom improved is scoring to ECOVADIS questionnaire with a score of 77/100 and kept AA score with MSCI agency. In addition, in 2024, Alstom improved is CDP rating, moving from B to A-. Those results reflect its strong position and strategy on Sustainability.

In addition, Alstom published for the second year European Taxonomy-aligned KPIs about Sales, Capex and Opex, pursuing strong analysis initiated last year. EU Taxonomy-aligned sales amounted to 60% and ranked Alstom among best in class, confirming the importance of the sector in which Alstom operates in achieving the EU's ambition of carbon neutrality by 2050. The EU Taxonomy purpose is to redirect capital flows towards sustainable activities and help navigate transition to a low carbon economy.

The outlook for FY 2024/25 is based on following main assumptions:

Considering the slight dilution from disposals and the revised timing of the impact from industrial optimisation, the Group expects to reach this profitability range in FY 2026/27, versus FY 2025/26 previously.

APPENDIX 4 - NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INDICATORS DEFINITIONS

This section presents financial indicators used by the Group that are not defined by accounting standard setters.

Orders received

A new order is recognised as an order received only when the contract creates enforceable obligations between the Group and its customer. When this condition is met, the order is recognised at the contract value. If the contract is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the reporting unit, the Group requires the immediate elimination of currency exposure using forward currency sales. Orders are then measured using the spot rate at inception of hedging instruments.

Book-to-Bill

The book-to-bill ratio is the ratio of orders received to the amount of sales traded for a specific period.

Gross margin % on backlog

Gross Margin % on backlog is a KPI that presents the expected performance level of firm contracts in backlog. It represents the difference between the sales not yet recognized and the cost of sales not yet incurred from the contracts in backlog. This % is an average of the portfolio of contracts in backlog and is meaningful to project mid- and long-term profitability.

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA is a KPI that presents the level of recurring operational performance. It represents the sales minus the cost of sales, adjusted to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination as well as significant, non-recurring ""one off"" items that are not expected to occur again in subsequent years.

EBIT before PPA

Following the Bombardier Transportation acquisition and with effect from the fiscal year 2021/22 condensed consolidated financial statements, Alstom decided to introduce the ""EBIT before PPA"" KPI aimed at restating its Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (""EBIT"") to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination. This KPI is also aligned with market practice.

Adjusted EBIT

Adjusted EBIT (""aEBIT"") is the Key Performance Indicator to present the level of recurring operational performance. This indicator is also aligned with market practice and comparable to direct competitors.

Starting September 2019, Alstom has opted for the inclusion of the share in net income of the equity-accounted investments into the aEBIT when these are considered to be part of the operating activities of the Group (because there are significant operational flows and/or common project execution with these entities). This mainly includes Chinese joint-ventures, namely CASCO joint-venture for Alstom as well as, following the integration of Bombardier Transportation, Alstom Sifang (Qingdao) Transportation Ltd. (formerly Bombardier Sifang), Bombardier NUG Propulsion System Co. Ltd and Changchun Changke Alstom Railway Vehicles Company Ltd (formerly Changchun Bombardier).

aEBIT corresponds to Earning Before Interests and Tax adjusted for the following elements:

A non-recurring item is a ""one-off"" exceptional item that is not supposed to occur again in following years and that is significant.

Adjusted EBIT margin corresponds to Adjusted EBIT expressed as a percentage of sales.

EBITDA + JV dividends

EBITDA before PPA plus dividends from joint ventures is the EBIT before PPA, before depreciation and amortisation, with the addition of the dividends received from joint ventures.

Adjusted net profit

The ""Adjusted Net Profit"" KPI restates Alstom's net profit from continued operations (Group share) to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination, net of the corresponding tax effect. This indicator is also aligned with market practice.

Free cash flow

Free Cash Flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures including capitalised development costs, net of proceeds from disposals of tangible and intangible assets. Free Cash Flow does not include any proceeds from disposals of activity.

The most directly comparable financial measure to Free Cash Flow calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS is net cash provided by operating activities.

Funds from Operations

Funds from Operations ""FFO"" in the EBIT to FCF statement refers to the Free Cash Flow generated by Operations, before Working Capital variations.

Contract and Trade Working Capital

Contract Working Capital is the sum of:

Trade Working Capital is the Working Capital that is not strictly related to contract. It includes all the elements of the working capital but

Net cash/(debt)

The net cash/(debt) is defined as cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and other current financial asset, less borrowings.

Pay-out ratio

The pay-out ratio is calculated by dividing the amount of the overall dividend with the ""Adjusted Net profit from continuing operations attributable to equity holders of the parent, Group share"" as presented in the management report in the consolidated financial statements.

Organic basis

This press release includes performance indicators presented on a reported basis and on an organic basis. Figures given on an organic basis eliminate the impact of changes in scope of consolidation and changes resulting from the translation of the accounts into Euro following the variation of foreign currencies against the Euro.

The Group uses figures prepared on an organic basis both for internal analysis and for external communication, as it believes they provide means to analyse and explain variations from one period to another.

Progress on Alstom's action plan to support its financial targets

During the second half of fiscal year 2023/24, the Group mobilised around the operational, commercial, and cost efficiency plan:

The €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan highlighting commitment to Investment Grade

As announced in November 2023 and reiterated in January 2024, Alstom's Board of Directors is committed to a conservative financial policy and to protect the Group's Investment Grade rating, in particular through a ca. €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan.

This plan and its execution, which have been unanimously approved by Alstom's Board of Directors, has the following components:

The ca. €2.4 billion proceeds correspond to ca. €2 billion of deleveraging, mainly due to the hybrid bond's 50% Moody's debt content.

Each of CDPQ and Bpifrance, holding respectively 17.4% and 7.5% of Alstom's capital, has declared to the Company its intention to subscribe for its pro-rata share of the capital increase.

In addition, Alstom has entered into a standby underwriting commitment with BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, J.P. Morgan and Société Générale, acting as Joint Global Coordinators, pursuant to which they have undertaken to underwrite the remainder of the capital raise (i.e. ca. €750 million), subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions precedent.

Circa €1.2 billion of the proceeds of asset disposals and of the capital markets transactions will be used to repay financial debt by September 2024:

The remainder of the proceeds will be invested in highly liquid short-term investment (cash equivalent treatment) and will be earmarked for gross debt reduction at maturity.

Alstom Baa3 long-term issuer rating is reaffirmed, and the outlook will be changed to stable upon successful closing of the hybrid bond issuance and the rights issue.

Alstom will terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following the execution of the deleveraging plan.

During the fiscal year 2023/24, the Group recorded €18.9 billion in orders, with commercial success across multiple geographies, notably in Europe, Asia/Pacific and in Americas. During the last fiscal year, Alstom reported an order intake of €20.7 billion. The (8)% decrease is mostly driven by last year's landmark contract awarded by Landesanstalt Schienenfahrzeuge Baden Württemberg (SFBW) network in Germany of almost €2.5 billion.

In Europe, Alstom recorded €11.3 billion order intake during the fiscal year 2023/24, compared with €12.8 billion over the last fiscal year.

In the U.K, Alstom has signed an eight-year extension to its Train Services Agreement (TSA) with CrossCountry. The contract extension, valued at around €950 million, further secures this long-term partnership and is evidence of the trust placed by the customer.

In France, Alstom will supply île-de-France Mobilités and RATP with 103 new MF19 trainsets, which is the new generation metro on rail, for a total contract value of more than €800 million, 100% financed by Île-de-France Mobilités. This new fleet will replace the existing rolling stock on lines 13, 12 and 8 of the Île-de-France metro as of 2027. The Group also signed a framework contract with Akiem European rolling stock leasing company for 100 Traxx Universal multi-system (MS3) locomotives, together with an initial firm order for 65 locomotives. The total amount of the framework agreement is up €500 million.

In Germany, Alstom was awarded a contract to supply 40 Coradia Stream High-Capacity electric multiple units together with full maintenance for 30 years to Nahverkehrsverbund Schleswig-Holstein (NAH.SH), valued at close to €900 million, and including an option for up to 55 additional trains with a corresponding full-service package. The Group also signed a contract with RAILPOOL for 50 Traxx Universal multi-purpose locomotives.

In Romania, Alstom, as part of a consortium with the civil works companies Gulermak and Arcada, also signed a contract with the Cluj-Napoca City Hall in Romania for the construction of the Cluj-Napoca Metro Line 1. Alstom's share of this state-of-the-art turnkey project reaches approximately €400 million.

In Italy, Alstom was awarded a contract for the supply of high-speed trains.

In Americas, Alstom reported €2.0 billion order intake, compared with €2.7 billion over the last fiscal year, driven by a contract with the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) in the United States to deliver 130 full low floor electric streetcars for Philadelphia, valued at over €667 million and with options to build an additional 30 streetcars. And the Group was awarded a contract by the Connecticut Department of Transportation (CTDOT) in the United States to supply 60 single-level rail coach cars valued at approximately €285 million with options to build an additional 313 cars, as part of CTDOT's coach renewal program for its statewide rail system.

In Asia/Pacific, the order intake stood at €3.2 billion, compared to €3.0 billion for the last fiscal year. In the Philippines, Alstom in consortium with Colas Rail has been awarded by Mitsubishi Corporation a contract to provide an integrated railway system for the extension of the North-South Commuter Railway project (NSCR). Alstom's contract share is worth approximately €1 billion. In Australia, Alstom has been awarded a contract worth around €900 million to maintain the regional rolling stock VLocity and Classic fleets in Victoria, Australia for the next decade.

In Africa/Middle East/Central Asia, the Group reported €2.4 billion order intake, compared with €2.2 billion over the last fiscal year. In Israel, Alstom, a member of the TMT Consortium (TLV Metropolitan Tramway Ltd.) and its partners Electra Ltd. & Dan Public Transportation Ltd., have reached financial closure on the contract, awarded in May 2022, to design, build, maintain, and finance the Tel Aviv Metropolitan LRT Green line by Metropolitan Mass Transit System Ltd (NTA). Alstom's share is valued at €858 million. In Saudi Arabia, Alstom signed a contract of over €500 million with The Royal Commission for AlUla (RCU) for AlUla's pioneering battery-powered tramway - the world's longest catenary-free line.

As of 31 March 2024, the backlog stood at €92 billion, providing the Group with strong visibility over future sales.

Alstom's sales amounted to €17.6 billion for the fiscal year 2023/24, representing a growth of 6.7% on a reported basis and a strong 9.4% on an organic basis compared with Alstom sales in the last fiscal year. Sales related to non-performing backlog, corresponding to sales on legacy projects with a negative margin at completion, amounted to €1.7 billion during the fiscal year 2023/24.

Rolling stock sales reached €9.1 billion, representing an increase of 3.9% on a reported basis and 6.5% on an organic basis, driven by contracts ramp-up in France, Belgium and in the US, and the solid level of execution in South Africa, India and Europe.

Services sales stood at €4.3 billion, up 11.9% on a reported basis and 14.3% on an organic basis versus last year, benefiting from the continuous ramp-up in the UK, in Italy and in the US as well as a solid level of execution in Canada.

In Signalling, Alstom reported €2.6 billion sales, up 8.9% on a reported basis and 11.8% on an organic basis versus last year, led by a consistent execution across all regions, mainly in Europe and in APAC.

Systems sales grew 6.9% on a reported basis and 9.3% on an organic basis, and stood at €1.6 billion, driven by a good performance of Turnkey Systems projects in Mexico, Egypt and Canada.

On 14 September 2023, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US department of Treasury added JSC Transmashholding (TMH AO) to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Person (SDN) List. TMH AO is the Russian holding company of TMH Group and is 100% owned by TMH Limited, and Alstom was holding a 20% stake in TMH limited. The Group further assessed potential exposures arising from the new OFAC sanctions and made the decision to sell its stake in TMH. The transaction was closed early January 2024 for an amount of €75 million, carrying value was nil as result of previous impairment, contributing to the de-risking of the company's portfolio.

On 19 April 2024, Alstom announced that it had entered into a binding agreement with Knorr-Bremse AG, to sell Alstom's North American conventional signalling business for a purchase price of around €630 million. Closing of the transaction is only subject to customary conditions, including regulatory approval, and is expected to take place as soon as summer 2024. Proceeds for Alstom at closing, net of expected tax and transaction costs, are expected to be around €620 million.

As of end of March 2024, research and development gross costs amounted to €749 million, i.e. 4.3% of sales, delivering on the Alstom In Motion strategy which is based on three pillars: Autonomous mobility, Data factory and Mobility orchestration. Net R&D amounts to €549 million before PPA amortisation.

Programs funded by IPCEI Hydrogen are ongoing. This important European program supports the development of new hydrogen trains for regional applications, shunting locos and freight, leveraging on the experience collected with Coradia iLint™ regional trains that are now in revenue service.

Homologation tests of Avelia Horizon™ are planned in 2024 to enable a start of revenue service in 2025. The development of international configurations is ongoing. Alstom has launched the development of Avelia stream™ 300, addressing the high-speed single deck segment with a first project for Italy.

The replacement of Adessia™ commuter train has been launched to address the U.K. and USA markets. This new product range will include EMU, BMU, BEMU and HMU versions to also replace the existing Diesel trains.

TRAXX™ Multi-system 3 - locomotives is pursuing homologation tests in 2024 to enable it to run on the different European corridors. It includes the passenger version which can be operated at 200kph.

Services product line is focused on addressing green, sustainable and more efficient operation concepts. Green re-tractioning initiatives include for example the retrofit with hydrogen-fuelled internal combustion engines for locomotives and the ability to provide autonomy for non-electrified lines via the so-called ""Last-mile"" functionality supported by the IPCEI H2 program.

Signalling Product Line worked on Onvia Control™ L2 A and Onvia Control™ L2 B European Standard convergence, driving market presence with its integration into TRAXX platform and securing new contracts for cross border operation, Onvia Cab™ level 2 and level 3 on-board solution together with Automatic Train Operation, and it continued its footprint expansion with a new contract in Canada.

Alstom Innovations cluster continued to develop Autonomous Mobility solutions for Passengers & Freight trains. Major milestones on the roadmap to achieve GoA4 (Grade of Automation 4) have been successfully passed under real mainline operating conditions on passengers and freight train with SNCF in France, and for operation in yard in the Netherlands.

Alstom has also made great strides in developing a new SaaS platform that will enhance its global digital offering. The platform streamlines applications integration and deployment in a trusted and future-proof ecosystem.

The adjusted EBIT margin has progressed from 5.2% over the fiscal year 2022/23 to 5.7% over the fiscal year 2023/24, benefiting from further synergies for 30bps, a steady reduction of non-performing legacy contracts sales for an impact of 30bps, an increased volume and favourable mix delivering 20bps gross margin expansion, partially offset by the negative gross margin impact related to the legacy portfolio deviations for (30)bps.

Alstom recorded restructuring and rationalisation charges of €(147) million mainly related to the reduction of overhead costs for €(115) million (""Autumn"" plan) and adaptation of the production setup for €(32) million, including the United Kingdom for €(14) million, Germany for €(8) million, France for €(3) million, Spain for €(3) million and the U.S.A. for €(2) million.

Costs related to the integration of Bombardier Transportation were recorded for an amount of €(142) million. €(118) million charges were related to some legal proceedings outside the ordinary course of business mainly for two projects - in U.S.A. and in Turkey, and for legal fees in the context of the claim against Bombardier Inc. €(30) million were related to impairment of assets due to the exit from Russia. Other exceptional expenses were recorded for €(73) million, of which €(36) million of consequential impacts from restructuring plan already initiated in Germany.

Alstom's EBIT before amortisation and impairment of assets exclusively valued when determining the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") stood at €356 million. This compares to €366 million for the last fiscal year.

The share in net income from equity investments amounted to €7 million, excluding the amortisation of the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") from Chinese joint ventures of €(10) million.

Adjusted net profit, representing the group's share of net profit from continued operations excluding PPA net of tax, amounts to €44 million for the fiscal year 2023/24. This compares to an adjusted net profit of €292 million during the last fiscal year.

The Group's Net profit/(loss) (Group share) stood at €(309) million for the fiscal year 2023/24, compared to €(132) million last fiscal year.

4. Financial structure

The Group's Free Cash Flow stands at €(557) million for the fiscal year 2023/24 as compared to €199 million during the last fiscal year and €(1,119) million at the first half of fiscal year 2023/24. Cash generation was impacted over the full year by an unfavourable €(856) million change in working capital compared to €(219) million in the last fiscal year; mostly due to change in Trade Working Capital as well as the reversal effect of the change in law on VAT in France for €(380) million. The Contract Working Capital is positively impacted by the acceleration of deliveries from major contracts in the second half of the year, strong collections of down payments as well as reduction of provision for risk on contracts.

On 31 March 2024, the Group recorded a net debt position of €(2,994) million.

In addition to its available cash and cash equivalents, amounting to €976 million on 31 March 2024, the Group benefits from strong liquidity with:

The first facility has two six-month extension options remaining at borrowers' discretion. Alstom will, however, terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following execution of the deleveraging plan.

The last two facilities have been successfully extended by one year. On 31 March 2024, the €1.75 billion RCF line had been drawn down for €175 million, while the other two lines remained undrawn.

As per its conservative liquidity policy, the €2.5 billion Revolving Credit Facility serves as a back-up of the Group €2.5 billion Negotiable European Commercial Papers program in place. With these RCF lines (€175 million drawn on the RCF on 31 March 2024), the €1.03 billion of Neu CP outstanding on 31 March 2024, the Group benefitted from a €6.3 billion liquidity available.

5. One Alstom team - Agile, Inclusive and Responsible

Decarbonization is at the heart of Alstom's strategy. The Group is reducing its Scope 1 & 2 emissions reaching 139 ktonCO2e (representing a 39% decrease compared to March 2022), while collaborating with suppliers and customers on reducing its Scope 3 footprint. First results of this collaboration can be seen through the reduction of emissions intensity of sold product reaching 4.0 gCO2e/pass.km (i.e. (13)% compared to March 2022). Alstom CO2e emissions reduction targets had been validated on the 6 of July 2023 by the independent Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) as in line with requirements to reach Paris Agreement commitments.

The supply of electricity from renewable sources has also been expanded. Alstom signed a significant Power Purchase Agreement focused on solar development in Spain. The solar farm is expected to begin operations early 2025 with a 10-years contract. The project will cover the equivalent of 80% of Alstom's electricity consumption in Europe, so this is a major step in reaching the target of 100% electricity consumption from renewables.

Regarding Diversity & Inclusion, the Alstom in Motion (AiM) 2025 strategy targets to reach 28% of women managers, engineers and professionals' roles by 2025. As of end of March 2024, 24.7% of manager, engineer and professional roles are held by women. Alstom will continue to accelerate its efforts in the coming months.

Alstom's Corporate Social Responsibility performance is regularly evaluated by various rating agencies; the Group maintained its presence among the CAC40 ESG index for the third consecutive year and the DJSI for the 13 consecutive year. Alstom improved is scoring to ECOVADIS questionnaire with a score of 77/100 and kept AA score with MSCI agency. In addition, in 2024, Alstom improved is CDP rating, moving from B to A-. Those results reflect its strong position and strategy on Sustainability.

In addition, Alstom published for the second year European Taxonomy-aligned KPIs about Sales, Capex and Opex, pursuing strong analysis initiated last year. EU Taxonomy-aligned sales amounted to 60% and ranked Alstom among best in class, confirming the importance of the sector in which Alstom operates in achieving the EU's ambition of carbon neutrality by 2050. The EU Taxonomy purpose is to redirect capital flows towards sustainable activities and help navigate transition to a low carbon economy.

The outlook for FY 2024/25 is based on following main assumptions:

FY 2024/25 Outlook:

Considering the slight dilution from disposals and the revised timing of the impact from industrial optimisation, the Group expects to reach this profitability range in FY 2026/27, versus FY 2025/26 previously.

APPENDIX 4 - NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INDICATORS DEFINITIONS

This section presents financial indicators used by the Group that are not defined by accounting standard setters.

Orders received

A new order is recognised as an order received only when the contract creates enforceable obligations between the Group and its customer. When this condition is met, the order is recognised at the contract value. If the contract is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the reporting unit, the Group requires the immediate elimination of currency exposure using forward currency sales. Orders are then measured using the spot rate at inception of hedging instruments.

Book-to-Bill

The book-to-bill ratio is the ratio of orders received to the amount of sales traded for a specific period.

Gross margin % on backlog

Gross Margin % on backlog is a KPI that presents the expected performance level of firm contracts in backlog. It represents the difference between the sales not yet recognized and the cost of sales not yet incurred from the contracts in backlog. This % is an average of the portfolio of contracts in backlog and is meaningful to project mid- and long-term profitability.

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA is a KPI that presents the level of recurring operational performance. It represents the sales minus the cost of sales, adjusted to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination as well as significant, non-recurring ""one off"" items that are not expected to occur again in subsequent years.

EBIT before PPA

Following the Bombardier Transportation acquisition and with effect from the fiscal year 2021/22 condensed consolidated financial statements, Alstom decided to introduce the ""EBIT before PPA"" KPI aimed at restating its Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (""EBIT"") to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination. This KPI is also aligned with market practice.

Adjusted EBIT

Adjusted EBIT (""aEBIT"") is the Key Performance Indicator to present the level of recurring operational performance. This indicator is also aligned with market practice and comparable to direct competitors.

Starting September 2019, Alstom has opted for the inclusion of the share in net income of the equity-accounted investments into the aEBIT when these are considered to be part of the operating activities of the Group (because there are significant operational flows and/or common project execution with these entities). This mainly includes Chinese joint-ventures, namely CASCO joint-venture for Alstom as well as, following the integration of Bombardier Transportation, Alstom Sifang (Qingdao) Transportation Ltd. (formerly Bombardier Sifang), Bombardier NUG Propulsion System Co. Ltd and Changchun Changke Alstom Railway Vehicles Company Ltd (formerly Changchun Bombardier).

aEBIT corresponds to Earning Before Interests and Tax adjusted for the following elements:

A non-recurring item is a ""one-off"" exceptional item that is not supposed to occur again in following years and that is significant.

Adjusted EBIT margin corresponds to Adjusted EBIT expressed as a percentage of sales.

EBITDA + JV dividends

EBITDA before PPA plus dividends from joint ventures is the EBIT before PPA, before depreciation and amortisation, with the addition of the dividends received from joint ventures.

Adjusted net profit

The ""Adjusted Net Profit"" KPI restates Alstom's net profit from continued operations (Group share) to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination, net of the corresponding tax effect. This indicator is also aligned with market practice.

Free cash flow

Free Cash Flow is de?ned as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures including capitalised development costs, net of proceeds from disposals of tangible and intangible assets. Free Cash Flow does not include any proceeds from disposals of activity.

The most directly comparable financial measure to Free Cash Flow calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS is net cash provided by operating activities.

Funds from Operations

Funds from Operations ""FFO"" in the EBIT to FCF statement refers to the Free Cash Flow generated by Operations, before Working Capital variations.

Contract and Trade Working Capital

Contract Working Capital is the sum of:

Trade Working Capital is the Working Capital that is not strictly related to contract. It includes all the elements of the working capital but

Net cash/(debt)

The net cash/(debt) is defined as cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and other current financial asset, less borrowings.

Pay-out ratio

The pay-out ratio is calculated by dividing the amount of the overall dividend with the ""Adjusted Net profit from continuing operations attributable to equity holders of the parent, Group share"" as presented in the management report in the consolidated financial statements.

Organic basis

This press release includes performance indicators presented on a reported basis and on an organic basis. Figures given on an organic basis eliminate the impact of changes in scope of consolidation and changes resulting from the translation of the accounts into Euro following the variation of foreign currencies against the Euro.

The Group uses figures prepared on an organic basis both for internal analysis and for external communication, as it believes they provide means to analyse and explain variations from one period to another. However, these figures are not measurements of performance under IFRS.",finanzen.at,news,finanzen.at,,0.223529411764706,452842634,12,https://www.finanzen.at/Images/FacebookIcon.jpg,eng-9548481

The backlog reached €92 billion, providing strong visibility on future sales. Gross margin on backlog reached 17.5% as of 31 March 2024, compared to 16.9% on 31 March 2023.

In the fiscal year 2023/24, Alstom's adjusted EBIT was €997 million, up 17%, equivalent to a 5.7% aEBIT margin, and EBIT before PPA was €356 million. Adjusted net profit was €44 million, net income (group share) was €(309) million, and free cash flow was €(557) million for the full year.

On 31 March 2024, the Group's net debt position stood at €(2,994) million, compared to the €(2,135) million the Group reported on 31 March 2023. Alstom benefits from a solid €6.3 billion liquidity position and equity amounting to €8,778 million on 31 March 2024.

The Board of Directors, in its meeting of 7 May 2024, proposed that no dividend will be paid with regards to the fiscal year 2023/24.

""Alstom recorded a strong rebound during the second half of the year, with solid order intake, strong organic growth, improved profitability and €562 million free cash-flow generation. Thanks to the support of our reference shareholders, we will swiftly execute the €2 billion deleveraging plan, allowing for the stabilization of its Investment Grade rating. In April, we announced the sale of Alstom's conventional signalling business in North America at a favourable valuation, demonstrating the quality and attractiveness of the Group's assets. We are confident in the strength of our backlog and our strategy of selectivity and mix evolution towards services. The Group is capitalizing on the solid operational progress made over the last three years and is launching new initiatives to improve its industrial performance and reduce overheads and indirect procurement costs. Altogether, Alstom is now set on stronger foundations to deliver sustainable profit and cash generation."" said Henri Poupart-Lafarge, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Alstom.

Progress on Alstom's action plan to support its financial targets

During the second half of fiscal year 2023/24, the Group mobilised around the operational, commercial, and cost efficiency plan:

The €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan highlighting commitment to Investment Grade

As announced in November 2023 and reiterated in January 2024, Alstom's Board of Directors is committed to a conservative financial policy and to protect the Group's Investment Grade rating, in particular through a ca. €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan.

This plan and its execution, which have been unanimously approved by Alstom's Board of Directors, has the following components:

The ca. €2.4 billion proceeds correspond to ca. €2 billion of deleveraging, mainly due to the hybrid bond's 50% Moody's debt content.

Each of CDPQ and Bpifrance, holding respectively 17.4% and 7.5% of Alstom's capital, has declared to the Company its intention to subscribe for its pro-rata share of the capital increase.

In addition, Alstom has entered into a standby underwriting commitment with BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, J.P. Morgan and Société Générale, acting as Joint Global Coordinators, pursuant to which they have undertaken to underwrite the remainder of the capital raise (i.e. ca. €750 million), subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions precedent.

Circa €1.2 billion of the proceeds of asset disposals and of the capital markets transactions will be used to repay financial debt by September 2024:

The remainder of the proceeds will be invested in highly liquid short-term investment (cash equivalent treatment) and will be earmarked for gross debt reduction at maturity.

Alstom Baa3 long-term issuer rating is reaffirmed, and the outlook will be changed to stable upon successful closing of the hybrid bond issuance and the rights issue.

Alstom will terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following the execution of the deleveraging plan.

During the fiscal year 2023/24, the Group recorded €18.9 billion in orders, with commercial success across multiple geographies, notably in Europe, Asia/Pacific and in Americas. During the last fiscal year, Alstom reported an order intake of €20.7 billion. The (8)% decrease is mostly driven by last year's landmark contract awarded by Landesanstalt Schienenfahrzeuge Baden Württemberg (SFBW) network in Germany of almost €2.5 billion.

In Europe, Alstom recorded €11.3 billion order intake during the fiscal year 2023/24, compared with €12.8 billion over the last fiscal year.

In the U.K, Alstom has signed an eight-year extension to its Train Services Agreement (TSA) with CrossCountry. The contract extension, valued at around €950 million, further secures this long-term partnership and is evidence of the trust placed by the customer.

In France, Alstom will supply île-de-France Mobilités and RATP with 103 new MF19 trainsets, which is the new generation metro on rail, for a total contract value of more than €800 million, 100% financed by Île-de-France Mobilités. This new fleet will replace the existing rolling stock on lines 13, 12 and 8 of the Île-de-France metro as of 2027. The Group also signed a framework contract with Akiem European rolling stock leasing company for 100 Traxx Universal multi-system (MS3) locomotives, together with an initial firm order for 65 locomotives. The total amount of the framework agreement is up €500 million.

In Germany, Alstom was awarded a contract to supply 40 Coradia Stream High-Capacity electric multiple units together with full maintenance for 30 years to Nahverkehrsverbund Schleswig-Holstein (NAH.SH), valued at close to €900 million, and including an option for up to 55 additional trains with a corresponding full-service package. The Group also signed a contract with RAILPOOL for 50 Traxx Universal multi-purpose locomotives.

In Romania, Alstom, as part of a consortium with the civil works companies Gulermak and Arcada, also signed a contract with the Cluj-Napoca City Hall in Romania for the construction of the Cluj-Napoca Metro Line 1. Alstom's share of this state-of-the-art turnkey project reaches approximately €400 million.

In Italy, Alstom was awarded a contract for the supply of high-speed trains.

In Americas, Alstom reported €2.0 billion order intake, compared with €2.7 billion over the last fiscal year, driven by a contract with the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) in the United States to deliver 130 full low floor electric streetcars for Philadelphia, valued at over €667 million and with options to build an additional 30 streetcars. And the Group was awarded a contract by the Connecticut Department of Transportation (CTDOT) in the United States to supply 60 single-level rail coach cars valued at approximately €285 million with options to build an additional 313 cars, as part of CTDOT's coach renewal program for its statewide rail system.

In Asia/Pacific, the order intake stood at €3.2 billion, compared to €3.0 billion for the last fiscal year. In the Philippines, Alstom in consortium with Colas Rail has been awarded by Mitsubishi Corporation a contract to provide an integrated railway system for the extension of the North-South Commuter Railway project (NSCR). Alstom's contract share is worth approximately €1 billion. In Australia, Alstom has been awarded a contract worth around €900 million to maintain the regional rolling stock VLocity and Classic fleets in Victoria, Australia for the next decade.

In Africa/Middle East/Central Asia, the Group reported €2.4 billion order intake, compared with €2.2 billion over the last fiscal year. In Israel, Alstom, a member of the TMT Consortium (TLV Metropolitan Tramway Ltd.) and its partners Electra Ltd. & Dan Public Transportation Ltd., have reached financial closure on the contract, awarded in May 2022, to design, build, maintain, and finance the Tel Aviv Metropolitan LRT Green line by Metropolitan Mass Transit System Ltd (NTA). Alstom's share is valued at €858 million. In Saudi Arabia, Alstom signed a contract of over €500 million with The Royal Commission for AlUla (RCU) for AlUla's pioneering battery-powered tramway - the world's longest catenary-free line.

As of 31 March 2024, the backlog stood at €92 billion, providing the Group with strong visibility over future sales.

Alstom's sales amounted to €17.6 billion for the fiscal year 2023/24, representing a growth of 6.7% on a reported basis and a strong 9.4% on an organic basis compared with Alstom sales in the last fiscal year. Sales related to non-performing backlog, corresponding to sales on legacy projects with a negative margin at completion, amounted to €1.7 billion during the fiscal year 2023/24.

Rolling stock sales reached €9.1 billion, representing an increase of 3.9% on a reported basis and 6.5% on an organic basis, driven by contracts ramp-up in France, Belgium and in the US, and the solid level of execution in South Africa, India and Europe.

Services sales stood at €4.3 billion, up 11.9% on a reported basis and 14.3% on an organic basis versus last year, benefiting from the continuous ramp-up in the UK, in Italy and in the US as well as a solid level of execution in Canada.

In Signalling, Alstom reported €2.6 billion sales, up 8.9% on a reported basis and 11.8% on an organic basis versus last year, led by a consistent execution across all regions, mainly in Europe and in APAC.

Systems sales grew 6.9% on a reported basis and 9.3% on an organic basis, and stood at €1.6 billion, driven by a good performance of Turnkey Systems projects in Mexico, Egypt and Canada.

On 14 September 2023, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US department of Treasury added JSC Transmashholding (TMH AO) to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Person (SDN) List. TMH AO is the Russian holding company of TMH Group and is 100% owned by TMH Limited, and Alstom was holding a 20% stake in TMH limited. The Group further assessed potential exposures arising from the new OFAC sanctions and made the decision to sell its stake in TMH. The transaction was closed early January 2024 for an amount of €75 million, carrying value was nil as result of previous impairment, contributing to the de-risking of the company's portfolio.

On 19 April 2024, Alstom announced that it had entered into a binding agreement with Knorr-Bremse AG, to sell Alstom's North American conventional signalling business for a purchase price of around €630 million. Closing of the transaction is only subject to customary conditions, including regulatory approval, and is expected to take place as soon as summer 2024. Proceeds for Alstom at closing, net of expected tax and transaction costs, are expected to be around €620 million.

As of end of March 2024, research and development gross costs amounted to €749 million, i.e. 4.3% of sales, delivering on the Alstom In Motion strategy which is based on three pillars: Autonomous mobility, Data factory and Mobility orchestration. Net R&D amounts to €549 million before PPA amortisation.

Programs funded by IPCEI Hydrogen are ongoing. This important European program supports the development of new hydrogen trains for regional applications, shunting locos and freight, leveraging on the experience collected with Coradia iLint™ regional trains that are now in revenue service.

Homologation tests of Avelia Horizon™ are planned in 2024 to enable a start of revenue service in 2025. The development of international configurations is ongoing. Alstom has launched the development of Avelia stream™ 300, addressing the high-speed single deck segment with a first project for Italy.

The replacement of Adessia™ commuter train has been launched to address the U.K. and USA markets. This new product range will include EMU, BMU, BEMU and HMU versions to also replace the existing Diesel trains.

TRAXX™ Multi-system 3 - locomotives is pursuing homologation tests in 2024 to enable it to run on the different European corridors. It includes the passenger version which can be operated at 200kph.

Services product line is focused on addressing green, sustainable and more efficient operation concepts. Green re-tractioning initiatives include for example the retrofit with hydrogen-fuelled internal combustion engines for locomotives and the ability to provide autonomy for non-electrified lines via the so-called ""Last-mile"" functionality supported by the IPCEI H2 program.

Signalling Product Line worked on Onvia Control™ L2 A and Onvia Control™ L2 B European Standard convergence, driving market presence with its integration into TRAXX platform and securing new contracts for cross border operation, Onvia Cab™ level 2 and level 3 on-board solution together with Automatic Train Operation, and it continued its footprint expansion with a new contract in Canada.

Alstom Innovations cluster continued to develop Autonomous Mobility solutions for Passengers & Freight trains. Major milestones on the roadmap to achieve GoA4 (Grade of Automation 4) have been successfully passed under real mainline operating conditions on passengers and freight train with SNCF in France, and for operation in yard in the Netherlands.

Alstom has also made great strides in developing a new SaaS platform that will enhance its global digital offering. The platform streamlines applications integration and deployment in a trusted and future-proof ecosystem.

The adjusted EBIT margin has progressed from 5.2% over the fiscal year 2022/23 to 5.7% over the fiscal year 2023/24, benefiting from further synergies for 30bps, a steady reduction of non-performing legacy contracts sales for an impact of 30bps, an increased volume and favourable mix delivering 20bps gross margin expansion, partially offset by the negative gross margin impact related to the legacy portfolio deviations for (30)bps.

Alstom recorded restructuring and rationalisation charges of €(147) million mainly related to the reduction of overhead costs for €(115) million (""Autumn"" plan) and adaptation of the production setup for €(32) million, including the United Kingdom for €(14) million, Germany for €(8) million, France for €(3) million, Spain for €(3) million and the U.S.A. for €(2) million.

Costs related to the integration of Bombardier Transportation were recorded for an amount of €(142) million. €(118) million charges were related to some legal proceedings outside the ordinary course of business mainly for two projects - in U.S.A. and in Turkey, and for legal fees in the context of the claim against Bombardier Inc. €(30) million were related to impairment of assets due to the exit from Russia. Other exceptional expenses were recorded for €(73) million, of which €(36) million of consequential impacts from restructuring plan already initiated in Germany.

Alstom's EBIT before amortisation and impairment of assets exclusively valued when determining the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") stood at €356 million. This compares to €366 million for the last fiscal year.

The share in net income from equity investments amounted to €7 million, excluding the amortisation of the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") from Chinese joint ventures of €(10) million.

Adjusted net profit, representing the group's share of net profit from continued operations excluding PPA net of tax, amounts to €44 million for the fiscal year 2023/24. This compares to an adjusted net profit of €292 million during the last fiscal year.

The Group's Net profit/(loss) (Group share) stood at €(309) million for the fiscal year 2023/24, compared to €(132) million last fiscal year.

4. Financial structure

The Group's Free Cash Flow stands at €(557) million for the fiscal year 2023/24 as compared to €199 million during the last fiscal year and €(1,119) million at the first half of fiscal year 2023/24. Cash generation was impacted over the full year by an unfavourable €(856) million change in working capital compared to €(219) million in the last fiscal year; mostly due to change in Trade Working Capital as well as the reversal effect of the change in law on VAT in France for €(380) million. The Contract Working Capital is positively impacted by the acceleration of deliveries from major contracts in the second half of the year, strong collections of down payments as well as reduction of provision for risk on contracts.

On 31 March 2024, the Group recorded a net debt position of €(2,994) million.

In addition to its available cash and cash equivalents, amounting to €976 million on 31 March 2024, the Group benefits from strong liquidity with:

The first facility has two six-month extension options remaining at borrowers' discretion. Alstom will, however, terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following execution of the deleveraging plan.

The last two facilities have been successfully extended by one year. On 31 March 2024, the €1.75 billion RCF line had been drawn down for €175 million, while the other two lines remained undrawn.

As per its conservative liquidity policy, the €2.5 billion Revolving Credit Facility serves as a back-up of the Group €2.5 billion Negotiable European Commercial Papers program in place. With these RCF lines (€175 million drawn on the RCF on 31 March 2024), the €1.03 billion of Neu CP outstanding on 31 March 2024, the Group benefitted from a €6.3 billion liquidity available.

5. One Alstom team - Agile, Inclusive and Responsible

Decarbonization is at the heart of Alstom's strategy. The Group is reducing its Scope 1 & 2 emissions reaching 139 ktonCO2e (representing a 39% decrease compared to March 2022), while collaborating with suppliers and customers on reducing its Scope 3 footprint. First results of this collaboration can be seen through the reduction of emissions intensity of sold product reaching 4.0 gCO2e/pass.km (i.e. (13)% compared to March 2022). Alstom CO2e emissions reduction targets had been validated on the 6 of July 2023 by the independent Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) as in line with requirements to reach Paris Agreement commitments.

The supply of electricity from renewable sources has also been expanded. Alstom signed a significant Power Purchase Agreement focused on solar development in Spain. The solar farm is expected to begin operations early 2025 with a 10-years contract. The project will cover the equivalent of 80% of Alstom's electricity consumption in Europe, so this is a major step in reaching the target of 100% electricity consumption from renewables.

Regarding Diversity & Inclusion, the Alstom in Motion (AiM) 2025 strategy targets to reach 28% of women managers, engineers and professionals' roles by 2025. As of end of March 2024, 24.7% of manager, engineer and professional roles are held by women. Alstom will continue to accelerate its efforts in the coming months.

Alstom's Corporate Social Responsibility performance is regularly evaluated by various rating agencies; the Group maintained its presence among the CAC40 ESG index for the third consecutive year and the DJSI for the 13 consecutive year. Alstom improved is scoring to ECOVADIS questionnaire with a score of 77/100 and kept AA score with MSCI agency. In addition, in 2024, Alstom improved is CDP rating, moving from B to A-. Those results reflect its strong position and strategy on Sustainability.

In addition, Alstom published for the second year European Taxonomy-aligned KPIs about Sales, Capex and Opex, pursuing strong analysis initiated last year. EU Taxonomy-aligned sales amounted to 60% and ranked Alstom among best in class, confirming the importance of the sector in which Alstom operates in achieving the EU's ambition of carbon neutrality by 2050. The EU Taxonomy purpose is to redirect capital flows towards sustainable activities and help navigate transition to a low carbon economy.

The outlook for FY 2024/25 is based on following main assumptions:

FY 2024/25 Outlook:

Considering the slight dilution from disposals and the revised timing of the impact from industrial optimisation, the Group expects to reach this profitability range in FY 2026/27, versus FY 2025/26 previously.

APPENDIX 4 - NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INDICATORS DEFINITIONS

This section presents financial indicators used by the Group that are not defined by accounting standard setters.

Orders received

A new order is recognised as an order received only when the contract creates enforceable obligations between the Group and its customer. When this condition is met, the order is recognised at the contract value. If the contract is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the reporting unit, the Group requires the immediate elimination of currency exposure using forward currency sales. Orders are then measured using the spot rate at inception of hedging instruments.

Book-to-Bill

The book-to-bill ratio is the ratio of orders received to the amount of sales traded for a specific period.

Gross margin % on backlog

Gross Margin % on backlog is a KPI that presents the expected performance level of firm contracts in backlog. It represents the difference between the sales not yet recognized and the cost of sales not yet incurred from the contracts in backlog. This % is an average of the portfolio of contracts in backlog and is meaningful to project mid- and long-term profitability.

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA is a KPI that presents the level of recurring operational performance. It represents the sales minus the cost of sales, adjusted to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination as well as significant, non-recurring ""one off"" items that are not expected to occur again in subsequent years.

EBIT before PPA

Following the Bombardier Transportation acquisition and with effect from the fiscal year 2021/22 condensed consolidated financial statements, Alstom decided to introduce the ""EBIT before PPA"" KPI aimed at restating its Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (""EBIT"") to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination. This KPI is also aligned with market practice.

Adjusted EBIT

Adjusted EBIT (""aEBIT"") is the Key Performance Indicator to present the level of recurring operational performance. This indicator is also aligned with market practice and comparable to direct competitors.

Starting September 2019, Alstom has opted for the inclusion of the share in net income of the equity-accounted investments into the aEBIT when these are considered to be part of the operating activities of the Group (because there are significant operational flows and/or common project execution with these entities). This mainly includes Chinese joint-ventures, namely CASCO joint-venture for Alstom as well as, following the integration of Bombardier Transportation, Alstom Sifang (Qingdao) Transportation Ltd. (formerly Bombardier Sifang), Bombardier NUG Propulsion System Co. Ltd and Changchun Changke Alstom Railway Vehicles Company Ltd (formerly Changchun Bombardier).

aEBIT corresponds to Earning Before Interests and Tax adjusted for the following elements:

A non-recurring item is a ""one-off"" exceptional item that is not supposed to occur again in following years and that is significant.

Adjusted EBIT margin corresponds to Adjusted EBIT expressed as a percentage of sales.

EBITDA + JV dividends

EBITDA before PPA plus dividends from joint ventures is the EBIT before PPA, before depreciation and amortisation, with the addition of the dividends received from joint ventures.

Adjusted net profit

The ""Adjusted Net Profit"" KPI restates Alstom's net profit from continued operations (Group share) to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination, net of the corresponding tax effect. This indicator is also aligned with market practice.

Free cash flow

Free Cash Flow is de?ned as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures including capitalised development costs, net of proceeds from disposals of tangible and intangible assets. Free Cash Flow does not include any proceeds from disposals of activity.

The most directly comparable financial measure to Free Cash Flow calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS is net cash provided by operating activities.

Funds from Operations

Funds from Operations ""FFO"" in the EBIT to FCF statement refers to the Free Cash Flow generated by Operations, before Working Capital variations.

Contract and Trade Working Capital

Contract Working Capital is the sum of:

Trade Working Capital is the Working Capital that is not strictly related to contract. It includes all the elements of the working capital but

Net cash/(debt)

The net cash/(debt) is defined as cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and other current financial asset, less borrowings.

Pay-out ratio

The pay-out ratio is calculated by dividing the amount of the overall dividend with the ""Adjusted Net profit from continuing operations attributable to equity holders of the parent, Group share"" as presented in the management report in the consolidated financial statements.

Organic basis

This press release includes performance indicators presented on a reported basis and on an organic basis. Figures given on an organic basis eliminate the impact of changes in scope of consolidation and changes resulting from the translation of the accounts into Euro following the variation of foreign currencies against the Euro.

The Group uses figures prepared on an organic basis both for internal analysis and for external communication, as it believes they provide means to analyse and explain variations from one period to another. However, these figures are not measurements of performance under IFRS.",finanzen.ch,news,finanzen.ch,,0.223529411764706,452842602,12,https://images.finanzen.net/mediacenter/unsortiert/facebookicon.jpg,

Alstom FY 2023/24 Free cash flow at €(557) million following strong €562 million Free cash flow generation in the second half on the back of operational turnaround, and €2 billion deleveraging plan ready to be executed.

8 May 2024 - Between 1 April 2023 and 31 March 2024, Alstom booked €18.9 billion of orders. Sales were €17.6 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio at 1.1.

The backlog reached €92 billion, providing strong visibility on future sales. Gross margin on backlog reached 17.5% as of 31 March 2024, compared to 16.9% on 31 March 2023.

In the fiscal year 2023/24, Alstom's adjusted EBIT was €997 million, up 17%, equivalent to a 5.7% aEBIT margin, and EBIT before PPA was €356 million. Adjusted net profit was €44 million, net income (group share) was €(309) million, and free cash flow was €(557) million for the full year.

On 31 March 2024, the Group's net debt position stood at €(2,994) million, compared to the €(2,135) million the Group reported on 31 March 2023. Alstom benefits from a solid €6.3 billion liquidity position and equity amounting to €8,778 million on 31 March 2024.

The Board of Directors, in its meeting of 7 May 2024, proposed that no dividend will be paid with regards to the fiscal year 2023/24.

""Alstom recorded a strong rebound during the second half of the year, with solid order intake, strong organic growth, improved profitability and €562 million free cash-flow generation. Thanks to the support of our reference shareholders, we will swiftly execute the €2 billion deleveraging plan, allowing for the stabilization of its Investment Grade rating. In April, we announced the sale of Alstom's conventional signalling business in North America at a favourable valuation, demonstrating the quality and attractiveness of the Group's assets. We are confident in the strength of our backlog and our strategy of selectivity and mix evolution towards services. The Group is capitalizing on the solid operational progress made over the last three years and is launching new initiatives to improve its industrial performance and reduce overheads and indirect procurement costs. Altogether, Alstom is now set on stronger foundations to deliver sustainable profit and cash generation."" said Henri Poupart-Lafarge, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Alstom.

Progress on Alstom's action plan to support its financial targets

During the second half of fiscal year 2023/24, the Group mobilised around the operational, commercial, and cost efficiency plan:

The €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan highlighting commitment to Investment Grade

As announced in November 2023 and reiterated in January 2024, Alstom's Board of Directors is committed to a conservative financial policy and to protect the Group's Investment Grade rating, in particular through a ca. €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan.

This plan and its execution, which have been unanimously approved by Alstom's Board of Directors, has the following components:

The ca. €2.4 billion proceeds correspond to ca. €2 billion of deleveraging, mainly due to the hybrid bond's 50% Moody's debt content.

Each of CDPQ and Bpifrance, holding respectively 17.4% and 7.5% of Alstom's capital, has declared to the Company its intention to subscribe for its pro-rata share of the capital increase.

In addition, Alstom has entered into a standby underwriting commitment with BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, J.P. Morgan and Société Générale, acting as Joint Global Coordinators, pursuant to which they have undertaken to underwrite the remainder of the capital raise (i.e. ca. €750 million), subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions precedent.

Circa €1.2 billion of the proceeds of asset disposals and of the capital markets transactions will be used to repay financial debt by September 2024:

The remainder of the proceeds will be invested in highly liquid short-term investment (cash equivalent treatment) and will be earmarked for gross debt reduction at maturity.

Alstom Baa3 long-term issuer rating is reaffirmed, and the outlook will be changed to stable upon successful closing of the hybrid bond issuance and the rights issue.

Alstom will terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following the execution of the deleveraging plan.

During the fiscal year 2023/24, the Group recorded €18.9 billion in orders, with commercial success across multiple geographies, notably in Europe, Asia/Pacific and in Americas. During the last fiscal year, Alstom reported an order intake of €20.7 billion. The (8)% decrease is mostly driven by last year's landmark contract awarded by Landesanstalt Schienenfahrzeuge Baden Württemberg (SFBW) network in Germany of almost €2.5 billion.

In Europe, Alstom recorded €11.3 billion order intake during the fiscal year 2023/24, compared with €12.8 billion over the last fiscal year.

In the U.K, Alstom has signed an eight-year extension to its Train Services Agreement (TSA) with CrossCountry. The contract extension, valued at around €950 million, further secures this long-term partnership and is evidence of the trust placed by the customer.

In France, Alstom will supply île-de-France Mobilités and RATP with 103 new MF19 trainsets, which is the new generation metro on rail, for a total contract value of more than €800 million, 100% financed by Île-de-France Mobilités. This new fleet will replace the existing rolling stock on lines 13, 12 and 8 of the Île-de-France metro as of 2027.

On 14 September 2023, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US department of Treasury added JSC Transmashholding (TMH AO) to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Person (SDN) List. TMH AO is the Russian holding company of TMH Group and is 100% owned by TMH Limited, and Alstom was holding a 20% stake in TMH limited. The Group further assessed potential exposures arising from the new OFAC sanctions and made the decision to sell its stake in TMH. The transaction was closed early January 2024 for an amount of €75 million, carrying value was nil as result of previous impairment, contributing to the de-risking of the company's portfolio.

Programs funded by IPCEI Hydrogen are ongoing. This important European program supports the development of new hydrogen trains for regional applications, shunting locos and freight, leveraging on the experience collected with Coradia iLint™ regional trains that are now in revenue service.

Homologation tests of Avelia Horizon™ are planned in 2024 to enable a start of revenue service in 2025. The development of international configurations is ongoing. Alstom has launched the development of Avelia stream™ 300, addressing the high-speed single deck segment with a first project for Italy.

The replacement of Adessia™ commuter train has been launched to address the U.K. and USA markets. This new product range will include EMU, BMU, BEMU and HMU versions to also replace the existing Diesel trains.

TRAXX™ Multi-system 3 - locomotives is pursuing homologation tests in 2024 to enable it to run on the different European corridors. It includes the passenger version which can be operated at 200kph.

Services product line is focused on addressing green, sustainable and more efficient operation concepts. Green re-tractioning initiatives include for example the retrofit with hydrogen-fuelled internal combustion engines for locomotives and the ability to provide autonomy for non-electrified lines via the so-called ""Last-mile"" functionality supported by the IPCEI H2 program.

Signalling Product Line worked on Onvia Control™ L2 A and Onvia Control™ L2 B European Standard convergence, driving market presence with its integration into TRAXX platform and securing new contracts for cross border operation, Onvia Cab™ level 2 and level 3 on-board solution together with Automatic Train Operation, and it continued its footprint expansion with a new contract in Canada.

Alstom Innovations cluster continued to develop Autonomous Mobility solutions for Passengers & Freight trains. Major milestones on the roadmap to achieve GoA4 (Grade of Automation 4) have been successfully passed under real mainline operating conditions on passengers and freight train with SNCF in France, and for operation in yard in the Netherlands.

Alstom has also made great strides in developing a new SaaS platform that will enhance its global digital offering. The platform streamlines applications integration and deployment in a trusted and future-proof ecosystem.

The adjusted EBIT margin has progressed from 5.2% over the fiscal year 2022/23 to 5.7% over the fiscal year 2023/24, benefiting from further synergies for 30bps, a steady reduction of non-performing legacy contracts sales for an impact of 30bps, an increased volume and favourable mix delivering 20bps gross margin expansion, partially offset by the negative gross margin impact related to the legacy portfolio deviations for (30)bps.

Alstom recorded restructuring and rationalisation charges of €(147) million mainly related to the reduction of overhead costs for €(115) million (""Autumn"" plan) and adaptation of the production setup for €(32) million, including the United Kingdom for €(14) million, Germany for €(8) million, France for €(3) million, Spain for €(3) million and the U.S.A. for €(2) million.

Costs related to the integration of Bombardier Transportation were recorded for an amount of €(142) million. €(118) million charges were related to some legal proceedings outside the ordinary course of business mainly for two projects - in U.S.A. and in Turkey, and for legal fees in the context of the claim against Bombardier Inc. €(30) million were related to impairment of assets due to the exit from Russia. Other exceptional expenses were recorded for €(73) million, of which €(36) million of consequential impacts from restructuring plan already initiated in Germany.

4. Financial structure

The Group's Free Cash Flow stands at €(557) million for the fiscal year 2023/24 as compared to €199 million during the last fiscal year and €(1,119) million at the first half of fiscal year 2023/24. Cash generation was impacted over the full year by an unfavourable €(856) million change in working capital compared to €(219) million in the last fiscal year; mostly due to change in Trade Working Capital as well as the reversal effect of the change in law on VAT in France for €(380) million. The Contract Working Capital is positively impacted by the acceleration of deliveries from major contracts in the second half of the year, strong collections of down payments as well as reduction of provision for risk on contracts.

On 31 March 2024, the Group recorded a net debt position of €(2,994) million.

In addition to its available cash and cash equivalents, amounting to €976 million on 31 March 2024, the Group benefits from strong liquidity with:

The first facility has two six-month extension options remaining at borrowers' discretion. Alstom will, however, terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following execution of the deleveraging plan.

The last two facilities have been successfully extended by one year. On 31 March 2024, the €1.75 billion RCF line had been drawn down for €175 million, while the other two lines remained undrawn.

As per its conservative liquidity policy, the €2.5 billion Revolving Credit Facility serves as a back-up of the Group €2.5 billion Negotiable European Commercial Papers program in place. With these RCF lines (€175 million drawn on the RCF on 31 March 2024), the €1.03 billion of Neu CP outstanding on 31 March 2024, the Group benefitted from a €6.3 billion liquidity available.

5. One Alstom team - Agile, Inclusive and Responsible

Decarbonization is at the heart of Alstom's strategy. The Group is reducing its Scope 1 & 2 emissions reaching 139 ktonCO2e (representing a 39% decrease compared to March 2022), while collaborating with suppliers and customers on reducing its Scope 3 footprint. First results of this collaboration can be seen through the reduction of emissions intensity of sold product reaching 4.0 gCO2e/pass.km (i.e. (13)% compared to March 2022). Alstom CO2e emissions reduction targets had been validated on the 6 of July 2023 by the independent Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) as in line with requirements to reach Paris Agreement commitments.

The supply of electricity from renewable sources has also been expanded. Alstom signed a significant Power Purchase Agreement focused on solar development in Spain. The solar farm is expected to begin operations early 2025 with a 10-years contract. The project will cover the equivalent of 80% of Alstom's electricity consumption in Europe, so this is a major step in reaching the target of 100% electricity consumption from renewables.

Regarding Diversity & Inclusion, the Alstom in Motion (AiM) 2025 strategy targets to reach 28% of women managers, engineers and professionals' roles by 2025. As of end of March 2024, 24.7% of manager, engineer and professional roles are held by women. Alstom will continue to accelerate its efforts in the coming months.

Alstom's Corporate Social Responsibility performance is regularly evaluated by various rating agencies; the Group maintained its presence among the CAC40 ESG index for the third consecutive year and the DJSI for the 13 consecutive year. Alstom improved is scoring to ECOVADIS questionnaire with a score of 77/100 and kept AA score with MSCI agency. In addition, in 2024, Alstom improved is CDP rating, moving from B to A-. Those results reflect its strong position and strategy on Sustainability.

In addition, Alstom published for the second year European Taxonomy-aligned KPIs about Sales, Capex and Opex, pursuing strong analysis initiated last year. EU Taxonomy-aligned sales amounted to 60% and ranked Alstom among best in class, confirming the importance of the sector in which Alstom operates in achieving the EU's ambition of carbon neutrality by 2050. The EU Taxonomy purpose is to redirect capital flows towards sustainable activities and help navigate transition to a low carbon economy.

The outlook for FY 2024/25 is based on following main assumptions:

FY 2024/25 Outlook:

Considering the slight dilution from disposals and the revised timing of the impact from industrial optimisation, the Group expects to reach this profitability range in FY 2026/27, versus FY 2025/26 previously.

APPENDIX 4 - NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INDICATORS DEFINITIONS

This section presents financial indicators used by the Group that are not defined by accounting standard setters.

Orders received

A new order is recognised as an order received only when the contract creates enforceable obligations between the Group and its customer. When this condition is met, the order is recognised at the contract value. If the contract is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the reporting unit, the Group requires the immediate elimination of currency exposure using forward currency sales. Orders are then measured using the spot rate at inception of hedging instruments.

Book-to-Bill

The book-to-bill ratio is the ratio of orders received to the amount of sales traded for a specific period.

Gross margin % on backlog

Gross Margin % on backlog is a KPI that presents the expected performance level of firm contracts in backlog. It represents the difference between the sales not yet recognized and the cost of sales not yet incurred from the contracts in backlog. This % is an average of the portfolio of contracts in backlog and is meaningful to project mid- and long-term profitability.

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA is a KPI that presents the level of recurring operational performance. It represents the sales minus the cost of sales, adjusted to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination as well as significant, non-recurring ""one off"" items that are not expected to occur again in subsequent years.

EBIT before PPA

Following the Bombardier Transportation acquisition and with effect from the fiscal year 2021/22 condensed consolidated financial statements, Alstom decided to introduce the ""EBIT before PPA"" KPI aimed at restating its Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (""EBIT"") to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination. This KPI is also aligned with market practice.

Adjusted EBIT

Adjusted EBIT (""aEBIT"") is the Key Performance Indicator to present the level of recurring operational performance. This indicator is also aligned with market practice and comparable to direct competitors.

Starting September 2019, Alstom has opted for the inclusion of the share in net income of the equity-accounted investments into the aEBIT when these are considered to be part of the operating activities of the Group (because there are significant operational flows and/or common project execution with these entities). This mainly includes Chinese joint-ventures, namely CASCO joint-venture for Alstom as well as, following the integration of Bombardier Transportation, Alstom Sifang (Qingdao) Transportation Ltd. (formerly Bombardier Sifang), Bombardier NUG Propulsion System Co. Ltd and Changchun Changke Alstom Railway Vehicles Company Ltd (formerly Changchun Bombardier).

aEBIT corresponds to Earning Before Interests and Tax adjusted for the following elements:

A non-recurring item is a ""one-off"" exceptional item that is not supposed to occur again in following years and that is significant.

Adjusted EBIT margin corresponds to Adjusted EBIT expressed as a percentage of sales.

EBITDA + JV dividends

EBITDA before PPA plus dividends from joint ventures is the EBIT before PPA, before depreciation and amortisation, with the addition of the dividends received from joint ventures.

Adjusted net profit

The ""Adjusted Net Profit"" KPI restates Alstom's net profit from continued operations (Group share) to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination, net of the corresponding tax effect. This indicator is also aligned with market practice.

Free cash flow

Free Cash Flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures including capitalised development costs, net of proceeds from disposals of tangible and intangible assets. Free Cash Flow does not include any proceeds from disposals of activity.

The most directly comparable financial measure to Free Cash Flow calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS is net cash provided by operating activities.

Funds from Operations

Funds from Operations ""FFO"" in the EBIT to FCF statement refers to the Free Cash Flow generated by Operations, before Working Capital variations.

Contract and Trade Working Capital

Contract Working Capital is the sum of:

Trade Working Capital is the Working Capital that is not strictly related to contract. It includes all the elements of the working capital but

Net cash/(debt)

The net cash/(debt) is defined as cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and other current financial asset, less borrowings.

Pay-out ratio

The pay-out ratio is calculated by dividing the amount of the overall dividend with the ""Adjusted Net profit from continuing operations attributable to equity holders of the parent, Group share"" as presented in the management report in the consolidated financial statements.

Organic basis

This press release includes performance indicators presented on a reported basis and on an organic basis. Figures given on an organic basis eliminate the impact of changes in scope of consolidation and changes resulting from the translation of the accounts into Euro following the variation of foreign currencies against the Euro.

The Group uses figures prepared on an organic basis both for internal analysis and for external communication, as it believes they provide means to analyse and explain variations from one period to another. However, these figures are not measurements of performance under IFRS.",streetinsider.com,news,StreetInsider.com,,0.1607843137254903,452842387,12,http://www.streetinsider.com/images/silogo-new.png,eng-9548481

Sales were €17.6 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio at 1.1.

The backlog reached €92 billion, providing strong visibility on future sales. Gross margin on backlog reached 17.5% as of 31 March 2024, compared to 16.9% on 31 March 2023.

In the fiscal year 2023/24, Alstom's adjusted EBIT was €997 million, up 17%, equivalent to a 5.7% aEBIT margin, and EBIT before PPA was €356 million. Adjusted net profit was €44 million, net income (group share) was €(309) million, and free cash flow was €(557) million for the full year.

On 31 March 2024, the Group's net debt position stood at €(2,994) million, compared to the €(2,135) million the Group reported on 31 March 2023. Alstom benefits from a solid €6.3 billion liquidity position and equity amounting to €8,778 million on 31 March 2024.

The Board of Directors, in its meeting of 7 May 2024, proposed that no dividend will be paid with regards to the fiscal year 2023/24.

""Alstom recorded a strong rebound during the second half of the year, with solid order intake, strong organic growth, improved profitability and €562 million free cash-flow generation. Thanks to the support of our reference shareholders, we will swiftly execute the €2 billion deleveraging plan, allowing for the stabilization of its Investment Grade rating. In April, we announced the sale of Alstom's conventional signalling business in North America at a favourable valuation, demonstrating the quality and attractiveness of the Group's assets. We are confident in the strength of our backlog and our strategy of selectivity and mix evolution towards services. The Group is capitalizing on the solid operational progress made over the last three years and is launching new initiatives to improve its industrial performance and reduce overheads and indirect procurement costs. Altogether, Alstom is now set on stronger foundations to deliver sustainable profit and cash generation."" said Henri Poupart-Lafarge, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Alstom.

During the second half of fiscal year 2023/24, the Group mobilised around the operational, commercial, and cost efficiency plan:

As announced in November 2023 and reiterated in January 2024, Alstom's Board of Directors is committed to a conservative financial policy and to protect the Group's Investment Grade rating, in particular through a ca. €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan.

This plan and its execution, which have been unanimously approved by Alstom's Board of Directors, has the following components:

The ca. €2.4 billion proceeds correspond to ca. €2 billion of deleveraging, mainly due to the hybrid bond's 50% Moody's debt content.

Each of CDPQ[6] and Bpifrance, holding respectively 17.4% and 7.5% of Alstom's capital, has declared to the Company its intention to subscribe for its pro-rata share of the capital increase.

In addition, Alstom has entered into a standby underwriting commitment with BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, J.P. Morgan and Société Générale, acting as Joint Global Coordinators, pursuant to which they have undertaken to underwrite the remainder of the capital raise (i.e. ca. €750 million), subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions precedent.

Circa €1.2 billion of the proceeds of asset disposals and of the capital markets transactions will be used to repay financial debt by September 2024:

The remainder of the proceeds will be invested in highly liquid short-term investment (cash equivalent treatment) and will be earmarked for gross debt reduction at maturity.

Alstom Baa3 long-term issuer rating is reaffirmed, and the outlook will be changed to stable upon successful closing of the hybrid bond issuance and the rights issue.

Alstom will terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following the execution of the deleveraging plan.

Rolling stock sales reached €9.1 billion, representing an increase of 3.9% on a reported basis and 6.5% on an organic basis, driven by contracts ramp-up in France, Belgium and in the US, and the solid level of execution in South Africa, India and Europe.

Services sales stood at €4.3 billion, up 11.9% on a reported basis and 14.3% on an organic basis versus last year, benefiting from the continuous ramp-up in the UK, in Italy and in the US as well as a solid level of execution in Canada.

In Signalling, Alstom reported €2.6 billion sales, up 8.9% on a reported basis and 11.8% on an organic basis versus last year, led by a consistent execution across all regions, mainly in Europe and in APAC.

Systems sales grew 6.9% on a reported basis and 9.3% on an organic basis, and stood at €1.6 billion, driven by a good performance of Turnkey Systems projects in Mexico, Egypt and Canada.

On 14 September 2023, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US department of Treasury added JSC Transmashholding (TMH AO) to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Person (SDN) List. TMH AO is the Russian holding company of TMH Group and is 100% owned by TMH Limited, and Alstom was holding a 20% stake in TMH limited. The Group further assessed potential exposures arising from the new OFAC sanctions and made the decision to sell its stake in TMH. The transaction was closed early January 2024 for an amount of €75 million, carrying value was nil as result of previous impairment, contributing to the de-risking of the company's portfolio.

On 19 April 2024, Alstom announced that it had entered into a binding agreement with Knorr-Bremse AG, to sell Alstom's North American conventional signalling business for a purchase price of around €630 million. Closing of the transaction is only subject to customary conditions, including regulatory approval, and is expected to take place as soon as summer 2024. Proceeds for Alstom at closing, net of expected tax and transaction costs, are expected to be around €620 million.

As of end of March 2024, research and development gross costs amounted to €749 million, i.e. 4.3% of sales, delivering on the Alstom In Motion strategy which is based on three pillars: Autonomous mobility, Data factory and Mobility orchestration. Net R&D amounts to €549 million before PPA amortisation.

Programs funded by IPCEI Hydrogen are ongoing. This important European program supports the development of new hydrogen trains for regional applications, shunting locos and freight, leveraging on the experience collected with Coradia iLint™ regional trains that are now in revenue service.

Homologation tests of Avelia Horizon™ are planned in 2024 to enable a start of revenue service in 2025. The development of international configurations is ongoing. Alstom has launched the development of Avelia Stream™ 300, addressing the high-speed single deck segment with a first project for Italy.

The replacement of Adessia™ commuter train has been launched to address the U.K. and USA markets. This new product range will include EMU, BMU, BEMU and HMU versions to also replace the existing Diesel trains.

Traxx™ Multi-system 3 - locomotives is pursuing homologation tests in 2024 to enable it to run on the different European corridors. It includes the passenger version which can be operated at 200kph.

Services product line is focused on addressing green, sustainable and more efficient operation concepts. Green re-tractioning initiatives include for example the retrofit with hydrogen-fuelled internal combustion engines for locomotives and the ability to provide autonomy for non-electrified lines via the so-called ""Last-mile"" functionality supported by the IPCEI H2 program.

Signalling Product Line worked on Onvia Control™ L2 A and Onvia Control™ L2 B European Standard convergence, driving market presence with its integration into TRAXX platform and securing new contracts for cross border operation, Onvia Cab™ level 2 and level 3 on-board solution together with Automatic Train Operation, and it continued its footprint expansion with a new contract in Canada.

Alstom Innovations cluster continued to develop Autonomous Mobility solutions for Passengers & Freight trains. Major milestones on the roadmap to achieve GoA4 (Grade of Automation 4) have been successfully passed under real mainline operating conditions on passengers and freight train with SNCF in France, and for operation in yard in the Netherlands.

Alstom has also made great strides in developing a new SaaS platform that will enhance its global digital offering. The platform streamlines applications integration and deployment in a trusted and future-proof ecosystem.

The adjusted EBIT margin has progressed from 5.2% over the fiscal year 2022/23 to 5.7% over the fiscal year 2023/24, benefiting from further synergies for 30bps, a steady reduction of non-performing legacy contracts sales for an impact of 30bps, an increased volume and favourable mix delivering 20bps gross margin expansion, partially offset by the negative gross margin impact related to the legacy portfolio deviations for (30)bps.

Alstom recorded restructuring and rationalisation charges of €(147) million mainly related to the reduction of overhead costs for €(115) million (""Autumn"" plan) and adaptation of the production setup for €(32) million, including the United Kingdom for €(14) million, Germany for €(8) million, France for €(3) million, Spain for €(3) million and the U.S.A. for €(2) million.

Costs related to the integration of Bombardier Transportation were recorded for an amount of €(142) million. €(118) million charges were related to some legal proceedings outside the ordinary course of business mainly for two projects - in U.S.A. and in Turkey, and for legal fees in the context of the claim against Bombardier Inc. €(30) million were related to impairment of assets due to the exit from Russia. Other exceptional expenses were recorded for €(73) million, of which €(36) million of consequential impacts from restructuring plan already initiated in Germany.

Alstom's EBIT before amortisation and impairment of assets exclusively valued when determining the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") stood at €356 million. This compares to €366 million for the last fiscal year.

The share in net income from equity investments amounted to €7 million, excluding the amortisation of the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") from Chinese joint ventures of €(10) million.

Adjusted net profit, representing the group's share of net profit from continued operations excluding PPA net of tax, amounts to €44 million for the fiscal year 2023/24. This compares to an adjusted net profit of €292 million during the last fiscal year.

The Group's Net profit/(loss) (Group share) stood at €(309) million for the fiscal year 2023/24, compared to €(132) million last fiscal year.

***

The Group's Free Cash Flow stands at €(557) million for the fiscal year 2023/24 as compared to €199 million during the last fiscal year and €(1,119) million at the first half of fiscal year 2023/24. Cash generation was impacted over the full year by an unfavourable €(856) million change in working capital compared to €(219) million in the last fiscal year; mostly due to change in Trade Working Capital as well as the reversal effect of the change in law on VAT in France for €(380) million. The Contract Working Capital is positively impacted by the acceleration of deliveries from major contracts in the second half of the year, strong collections of down payments as well as reduction of provision for risk on contracts.

On 31 March 2024, the Group recorded a net debt position of €(2,994) million.

In addition to its available cash and cash equivalents, amounting to €976 million on 31 March 2024, the Group benefits from strong liquidity with:

The first facility has two six-month extension options remaining at borrowers' discretion. Alstom will, however, terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following execution of the deleveraging plan.

The last two facilities have been successfully extended by one year. On 31 March 2024, the €1.75 billion RCF line had been drawn down for €175 million, while the other two lines remained undrawn.

As per its conservative liquidity policy, the €2.5 billion Revolving Credit Facility serves as a back-up of the Group €2.5 billion Negotiable European Commercial Papers program in place. With these RCF lines (€175 million drawn on the RCF on 31 March 2024), the €1.03 billion of Neu CP outstanding on 31 March 2024, the Group benefitted from a €6.3 billion liquidity available.

***

Decarbonization is at the heart of Alstom's strategy. The Group is reducing its Scope 1 & 2 emissions reaching 139 ktonCO2e (representing a 39% decrease compared to March 2022), while collaborating with suppliers and customers on reducing its Scope 3 footprint. First results of this collaboration can be seen through the reduction of emissions intensity of sold product reaching 4.0 gCO2e/pass.km (i.e. (13)% compared to March 2022). Alstom CO2e emissions reduction targets had been validated on the 6 of July 2023 by the independent Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) as in line with requirements to reach Paris Agreement commitments.

The supply of electricity from renewable sources has also been expanded. Alstom signed a significant Power Purchase Agreement focused on solar development in Spain. The solar farm is expected to begin operations early 2025 with a 10-years contract. The project will cover the equivalent of 80% of Alstom's electricity consumption in Europe, so this is a major step in reaching the target of 100% electricity consumption from renewables.

Regarding Diversity & Inclusion, the Alstom in Motion (AiM) 2025 strategy targets to reach 28% of women managers, engineers and professionals' roles by 2025. As of end of March 2024, 24.7% of manager, engineer and professional roles are held by women. Alstom will continue to accelerate its efforts in the coming months.

Alstom's Corporate Social Responsibility performance is regularly evaluated by various rating agencies; the Group maintained its presence among the CAC40 ESG index for the third consecutive year and the DJSI for the 13 consecutive year. Alstom improved is scoring to ECOVADIS questionnaire with a score of 77/100 and kept AA score with MSCI agency. In addition, in 2024, Alstom improved is CDP rating, moving from B to A-. Those results reflect its strong position and strategy on Sustainability.

In addition, Alstom published for the second year European Taxonomy-aligned KPIs about Sales, Capex and Opex, pursuing strong analysis initiated last year. EU Taxonomy-aligned sales amounted to 60% and ranked Alstom among best in class, confirming the importance of the sector in which Alstom operates in achieving the EU's ambition of carbon neutrality by 2050. The EU Taxonomy purpose is to redirect capital flows towards sustainable activities and help navigate transition to a low carbon economy.

***

The outlook for FY 2024/25 is based on following main assumptions:

Considering the slight dilution from disposals and the revised timing of the impact from industrial optimisation, the Group expects to reach this profitability range in FY 2026/27, versus FY 2025/26 previously.

APPENDIX 4 - NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INDICATORS DEFINITIONS

This section presents financial indicators used by the Group that are not defined by accounting standard setters.

Orders received

A new order is recognised as an order received only when the contract creates enforceable obligations between the Group and its customer. When this condition is met, the order is recognised at the contract value. If the contract is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the reporting unit, the Group requires the immediate elimination of currency exposure using forward currency sales. Orders are then measured using the spot rate at inception of hedging instruments.

Book-to-Bill

The book-to-bill ratio is the ratio of orders received to the amount of sales traded for a specific period.

Gross margin % on backlog

Gross Margin % on backlog is a KPI that presents the expected performance level of firm contracts in backlog. It represents the difference between the sales not yet recognized and the cost of sales not yet incurred from the contracts in backlog. This % is an average of the portfolio of contracts in backlog and is meaningful to project mid- and long-term profitability.

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA is a KPI that presents the level of recurring operational performance. It represents the sales minus the cost of sales, adjusted to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination as well as significant, non-recurring ""one off"" items that are not expected to occur again in subsequent years.

EBIT before PPA

Following the Bombardier Transportation acquisition and with effect from the fiscal year 2021/22 condensed consolidated financial statements, Alstom decided to introduce the ""EBIT before PPA"" KPI aimed at restating its Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (""EBIT"") to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination. This KPI is also aligned with market practice.

Adjusted EBIT

Adjusted EBIT (""aEBIT"") is the Key Performance Indicator to present the level of recurring operational performance. This indicator is also aligned with market practice and comparable to direct competitors.

Starting September 2019, Alstom has opted for the inclusion of the share in net income of the equity-accounted investments into the aEBIT when these are considered to be part of the operating activities of the Group (because there are significant operational flows and/or common project execution with these entities). This mainly includes Chinese joint-ventures, namely CASCO joint-venture for Alstom as well as, following the integration of Bombardier Transportation, Alstom Sifang (Qingdao) Transportation Ltd. (formerly Bombardier Sifang), Bombardier NUG Propulsion System Co. Ltd and Changchun Changke Alstom Railway Vehicles Company Ltd (formerly Changchun Bombardier).

aEBIT corresponds to Earning Before Interests and Tax adjusted for the following elements:

A non-recurring item is a ""one-off"" exceptional item that is not supposed to occur again in following years and that is significant.

Adjusted EBIT margin corresponds to Adjusted EBIT expressed as a percentage of sales.

EBITDA + JV dividends

EBITDA before PPA plus dividends from joint ventures is the EBIT before PPA, before depreciation and amortisation, with the addition of the dividends received from joint ventures.

Adjusted net profit

The ""Adjusted Net Profit"" KPI restates Alstom's net profit from continued operations (Group share) to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination, net of the corresponding tax effect. This indicator is also aligned with market practice.

Free cash flow

Free Cash Flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures including capitalised development costs, net of proceeds from disposals of tangible and intangible assets. Free Cash Flow does not include any proceeds from disposals of activity.

The most directly comparable financial measure to Free Cash Flow calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS is net cash provided by operating activities.

Funds from Operations

Funds from Operations ""FFO"" in the EBIT to FCF statement refers to the Free Cash Flow generated by Operations, before Working Capital variations.

Trade Working Capital is the Working Capital that is not strictly related to contract. It includes all the elements of the working capital but

Net cash/(debt)

The net cash/(debt) is defined as cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and other current financial asset, less borrowings.

Pay-out ratio

The pay-out ratio is calculated by dividing the amount of the overall dividend with the ""Adjusted Net profit from continuing operations attributable to equity holders of the parent, Group share"" as presented in the management report in the consolidated financial statements.

Organic basis

This press release includes performance indicators presented on a reported basis and on an organic basis. Figures given on an organic basis eliminate the impact of changes in scope of consolidation and changes resulting from the translation of the accounts into Euro following the variation of foreign currencies against the Euro.

The Group uses figures prepared on an organic basis both for internal analysis and for external communication, as it believes they provide means to analyse and explain variations from one period to another. However, these figures are not measurements of performance under IFRS.

Chinese universities have been gaining popularity among African students thanks to the offering of scholarships as well as China's growing reputation in technology and development.30 Therefore, as Figure 4 shows, China is the second-most popular destination for Africans seeking higher education abroad, with roughly 81,600 students; France is the most popular (126,300 students) and the United States is the third-most popular (48,300 students). However, China's immigration policy is much tighter than the policies in European and North American countries. Therefore, most Africans studying in China tend to return home upon the completion of their studies instead of staying abroad, significantly reducing the prospects of ""brain drain"" for Africa.

China-Africa educational institutions are also maintaining strong collaboration. Sixty-one Confucius Institutes and forty-eight programs have been established in forty-eight African countries as of 2021. Additionally, China has supported over thirty African universities to set up departments or programs to study Chinese language. Luban Workshops in Djibouti, Egypt, Kenya, and South Africa have provided Chinese-style vocational training to African technicians, even when international travel has been restricted due to the COVID pandemic. Conversely, universities in China have added new courses for African languages, such as Amharic, Malagasy, and Zulu. Furthermore, the Plan for China-Africa Cooperation on Talent Development, announced in August 2023, has pledged to train 500 principals and high-calibre teachers of vocational colleges every year, as well as 10,000 technical personnel with both Chinese language and vocational skills for Africa. The number of cooperating Chinese and African universities will be increased from 20+20 to 50+50. However, there are occasionally reports about African students' complaints related to Chinese teachers' English proficiency, internship and employment opportunities, as well as administrative services. If the education quality does not improve, the quantitative growth in cooperating universities may not be sustainable.

Media and cultural exchanges between African countries and China have increased since the start of the pandemic, largely due to the use of digital technologies. The Chinese cable television operator StarTimes provided 13 million subscribers in Africa with programs in eleven languages as of November 2021. TikTok, cell phone maker Transsion, and other Chinese internet companies greatly boost the formation of Africa's mobile media sphere. Chinese and African entertainment industries have been deepening their collaboration as well, with the joint production and broadcasting of movies and television series. Two notable series, Welcome to Milele Village (2023) and Ebola Fighters (2021), depicted Chinese medical teams in Africa and gained popularity among Chinese audiences. Soccer players from Angola, Cameroon, Ghana, and Nigeria have joined clubs in China's Premier league and A-level league. Chinese tourists are now also interested in taking historical tours and immersing themselves in African culture, as well as exploring the country's natural landscape. A number of African countries, including most recently Egypt, Mauritius, Morocco, and Tunisia, have been providing visa-free or visa-on-arrival entries to Chinese visitors to foster tourism. Echoing the movement, China's Ministry of Culture and Tourism has listed thirty-four African countries as destinations for group tours.

Conclusion

China's economic growth is slowing from the double digits of previous decades as policymakers steer the economy toward a more high-tech, consumption-oriented, and environmentally sustainable growth model with reduced exposure to geopolitical shocks. And this economic transition will increasingly have implications for China's international economic relations with the rest of the world. As discussed above, across the five domains of China's economic engagement with Africa -- trade, investment, fiscal stabilization, RMB internationalization, and people-to-people ties -- both strong continuities and changes are evident. But this engagement is not happening in a vacuum. Policy directions within African countries and third parties such as the United States will greatly shape how these changes in the China-Africa relationship continue to unfold.

The changing patterns of trade between African countries and China will be shaped by policies in both advanced economies and African countries themselves. Rising barriers to market access in advanced economies are likely to push African countries further into the embrace of China. Between 2021 and 2024, the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden has suspended a record eight African countries from the U.S. trade preference program, the African Growth and Opportunity Act. Meanwhile, the European Union's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, which began its initial transitional phase in October 2023, could make it even more difficult for African manufacturers to export to the European market and reduce the continent's GDP by up to $25 billion. Although individual European countries like France seek to expand their trade with Anglophone African countries, for instance, and the United Kingdom recently signed a trade deal with Kenya, this may not be sufficient to offset the wide-ranging impacts of market-restricting policies like the CBAM. Furthermore, growing China-Africa trade volumes will continue to be characterized by trade deficits. To address these deficits, African countries need to make a concerted effort to diversify their exports to China. Important steps to take include implementing the AfCFTA to create regional value chains, utilizing trade preference programs particularly the green lanes initiative -- as Kenya and Namibia are doing -- to export semi-processed agriculture produce to China and emulating the Indonesian approach to pressure Chinese companies to invest in the refining and processing of minerals in African countries.

As Chinese investments in Africa shift from infrastructure-oriented projects toward industrialization-oriented projects, African policy responses and the ability of Western countries to fill infrastructure financing gaps will be crucial. Chinese FDI flows for processing and manufacturing in various sectors -- whether related to agriculture, minerals and metals, construction material, or apparel -- are contingent on requirements in the domestic business environment that are within the remit of African governments. Basic requirements include the availability of affordable and reliable electricity, good transportation networks, skilled local workers, security, and the ability to compel Chinese companies to enter into joint ventures with local African firms for technology transfer. Whether the United States and its allies in Europe and Japan can step into the space being vacated by Chinese policy banks to provide infrastructure financing in Africa is an open question. Implementation of the Lobito Corridor project, a signature initiative of the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII), will test the G7's commitment to the scaling up of infrastructure investments in Africa. Whether the United States continues to prioritize the PGII by ensuring the program's continuity or incorporating new infrastructure projects remains to be seen -- especially if a new U.S. administration comes into office in January 2025.

Expansion of China's rescue-lending efforts and internationalization of the RMB in Africa are significantly dependent on African countries' own demand for and uptake of these initiatives. Will a growing number of African countries look to China, as an alternative to the IMF, for emergency liquidity support as their ability to finance imports diminish due to fiscal crises? Will there be a growing appetite among African countries for more central bank currency swap lines with the PBOC, and will there be increased drawdowns of yuan reserves? As African countries struggle to find scarce foreign exchange resources to settle and invoice their trade, will they follow the trend among some Asian countries in using the RMB for their bilateral trade with China? The answer to these questions may lie largely in whether the United States and its allies in Europe will provide sufficient measures to support African countries to overcome the latest bout of debt distress and fiscal crises.

Finally, China's loosening of pandemic-era travel restrictions and the phenomenon of digitalization will accelerate the increasing trend of people-to-people exchanges with African countries in higher education, media, and culture. Developments in China's immigration policy will be important to track as it begins to roll out visa-free travel for a select number of European and Asian countries. The hardening of visa regimes in Canada, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the United States, and other Western countries will also be important to monitor, as it could affect these countries' historically robust people-to-people exchanges with African countries.

Meanwhile, Blue Capsule has signed a partnership agreement with the French Alternative Energies & Atomic Energy Commission, from which it was spun off, for the development of its small modular reactor.

Thorizon - a spin-off from NRG, which operates the High Flux Reactor in Petten - is developing a 250 MWt/100 MWe molten salt reactor (MSR), targeted at large industrial customers and utilities. Thorizon aims to construct a pilot reactor system before 2035.

MSRs use molten fluoride salts as primary coolant, at low pressure. They may operate with epithermal or fast neutron spectrums, and with a variety of fuels. Much of the interest today in reviving the MSR concept relates to using thorium (to breed fissile uranium-233), where an initial source of fissile material such as plutonium-239 needs to be provided. There are a number of different MSR design concepts, and a number of interesting challenges in the commercialisation of many, especially with thorium.

The molten salt fuel adopted by Thorizon uses a combination of long-lived elements from reprocessed used nuclear fuel and thorium. The reactor will be able to recycle long-lived waste from existing nuclear facilities. The Thorizon One concept is unique in that the core is composed of a set of cartridges that is replaced every five to ten years. This, the company says, overcomes two molten salt design obstacles: material corrosion and handling of used fuel volumes.

Under the new agreement, EDF R&D will review Thorizon's neutronic core calculations and conduct scenario analyses to determine how the Thorizon One could help to close the fuel cycle in the European reactor fleet.

Thorizon said it will ""benefit from EDF's expertise as the French leader in electricity production, and in particular from the recognised skills of its R&D researchers"".

""The R&D team covers all disciplines from neutronics and fuel to safety and construction,"" said Bernard Salha, EDF R&D Director and EDF Group Chief Technical Officer. ""We are actively supporting several start-ups in the France 2030 programme. The cartridge-based approach of Thorizon is interesting and promising.""

""It is a pleasure to work with the EDF team which has more experience in nuclear than any company across the globe,"" added Thorizon CEO Kiki Lauwers. ""Thanks to EDF R&D, start-ups like us benefit from access to unique industry experts that can very quickly spot the strengths and areas for improvements in our design. We hope we can continue to work with the EDF R&D team on the realisation of our technology in the future. We believe all solutions are needed to empower the energy transition and the Thorizon One can be a great compliment to the existing and planned nuclear fleet.""

Horizon says its ambition is to develop an MSR that ""can be realised rapidly and smartly, is 'walk-away' safe, and takes a first step towards circularity by using long-lived nuclear waste as a fuel source"". The company aims to build a non-nuclear molten salt demonstrator in the short-term and finalise the detailed design to start building a first-of-a-kind Thorizon One reactor by 2030.

Decarbonising industry

Blue Capsule - a spin-off from France's Alternative Energies & Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) - has announced the signing of a partnership agreement with the CEA for the development of its small modular reactor (SMR) that will supply heat and power to industry.

Aix-en-Provence-based Blue Capsule is developing a sodium-cooled, high-temperature SMR which can provide 150 MW of heat at 700°C, along with high-temperature steam and electricity. The company aims to decarbonise industrial sites used for ammonia and soda ash production, with subterranean capsules co-located onsite, close to demand.

Under the new agreement - with financial support from French public investment bank Bpifrance - CEA's support for Blue Capsule will extend to fields such as equipment and components, materials, calculation codes and TRISO-based fuel.

""France's leadership in the fields of nuclear energy and low-carbon solutions is creating big opportunities for industry right across the country,"" said Blue Capsule's reactor architect Domnin Erard. ""And for Blue Capsule, collaboration with the French nuclear sector is front and centre of our strategy.

""This vital partnership with the CEA means that Blue Capsule benefits from world-class expertise across the board. It lays the foundations for our future industrial cooperation with the French nuclear supply chain, for manufacturing and assembling Blue Capsule units.

""It all comes down to cutting industrial CO2 emissions and of course the re-industrialisation of communities in France and beyond. For our part, we'll do everything we can to help achieve that objective.""

Blue Capsule is planning to build a proof-of-concept sodium loop and a non-nuclear prototype by 2030. The company's first-of-a-kind SMR is scheduled for construction by 2035 and is set to be built in France.",world-nuclear-news.org,news,World Nuclear News (WNN),,0.1372549019607843,454689557,12,,

And we had an earlier statement from the idf saying that these strikes were carried out against legitimate targets under international law for the use of precise munitions and on the basis of precise intelligence against two senior hamas officials but as you did mention there, reaction coming in from right around the world. We also heard from the U.N. palestinian refugee agency, unwra. It has posted on ""x"" that gaza is now hell on earth adding that they have lost contact with colleagues in the gaza strip. Let's take a listen to what we also heard from the e.u.'s foreign policy. Josef burrell. >> This is a dilemma how the international community can force implementation of the international justice. >> Natasha: there's something else we absolutely need to cover. This airstrike happened just hours after dispursed rocket attacks into central israel in months and the rockets were fired from rafah and hamas has claimed responsibility. That's a major development. Just bring us up to speed on that. >> Reporter: you're exactly right. It's caused a lot of shock here in tel aviv and central israel. It was four months since the last air raid sirens were activated. A barrage of missiles sent over from, as you mentioned there, from rafah into central israel, causing people to run to shelter. We can stel tell you that the iron dome missile defence system was activated and intercepted quite a large number of these rockets, although some did make it through. It was just a little further north of me that one of these rockets actually came and hit a house injuring one person that was then taken to hospital. So certainly this is something that hamas continues to do, fire rockets from rafah, really causing a lot of panic here in israel. >> Natasha: we've got two, three days of just absolutely devastating and destructive rocket fire going back and forth. What is all this doing for any possibility of ceasefires or talks of negotiations, hostage release, anything like that? >> Reporter: well, really it would appear to be diminishing the chances of any hostage and ceasefire talks. We do know that the israeli war cabinet met last night, although they are remaining very, very tight-lipped about what actually was discussed there. We've also heard the qataris coming out saying these strikes on rafah really affect the chances of any ceasefire and hostage deal being reached and while there is a lot of hope this may be achieved, not really a lot of optimism. >> Natasha: sarah coates in tel aviv, thank you.

>>> A jewish girls' school in toronto is welcoming back students today after shots were fired at the building over the weekend. Police say they're looking at multiple suspects and the hate crimes unit has opened up its own investigation. Cbc's marianne dimain is following this ier stochlt earlier today a solidarity rally did take place. The mayor and other officials were there. What can you tell us about that? >> Reporter: the message at this rally outside of the school in toronto this morning is that students should have the right to a safe learning environment and that's why dozens of people came out outside of the jewish girls' school. Some of them carrying flags, other signs. One of them said ""you are not alone."" what you're looking at now, scenes from the weekend and the damage to the school that happened on saturday morning. Police saying that armed suspects were at the school around 5 A.M. that's when shots were fired at the school before the suspects fled the scene. At this point, they have not found those suspects, but no one was injured in this case. The school was damaged, as you saw there in those images. The school community quite shaken up as a result of what happened there over the weekend and that's what prompted today's rally. The mayored was also there but also parents were quite concerned and here's more from one of those parents. >> Who are angry and shocked, angry that we have to explain to our girls why this is happening and shocked that, you know, it's gone this far. >> Reporter: toronto's police chief as well as the mayor of the city was also there this morning. Other communities were also speaking to the crowd of dozens of people standing there in the rain this morning and here's some of what was said. >> What happened here this weekend crossed a dangerous line. It was an attempt to intimidate and isolate the wonderful people, the wonderful children, here and it was a deliberate attempt to spread fear across our entire jewish community, to make us cower and hide who we are. As you can see here today, the attackers completely failed. We are more united than ever. We are more committed than ever to support each other. We are more determined than ever to fight antisemitism wherever it happens. >> We say to this coward, these cowards, we will find you. You will be held responsible. >> Reporter: toronto's guns and gangs unit as well as the hate crime unit are investigating. The suspect has not yet been found. >> Natasha: I want to let folks watching at home know that we have put in a request to speak to toronto mayor olivia chow about what's happened at the school and how things will move forward from there. So thank you for playing that clip, marianne. Let's talk about the school itself. What is it going to look like there today? >> Reporter: you know the school community banding together right now. They are standing together in solidarity. Its business as usual there. The principal spoke at this news conference as well as to reporters saying that there is a lot of attendance there. Not a lot of people have stayed home. They have pretty much a full house. Amid those classes today also a stepped up police presence. That will be the case for quite some time. Also some important conversations. Here's more on that. >> I have two groups of students who are splitting them in half. The younger students first and then the older students. And we are going to have those conversations. We'll discuss what happened. We're going to discuss moving forward, how we plan to continue doing what we're doing. >> Reporter: that stepped up police presence not just at the bais mushka but other area schools and area synagogues in the community as well. >> Natasha: cbc's marianne dimain dimain, thank you so much.

>>> In just under an hour's time, thousands of residents in fort nelson, british columbia, and fort nelson first nation will be allowed to return home. They've been on an evacuation order for more than two weeks when the parker lake wildfire got way too close. They're praying themselves for what they're see when they get back home. >> Out in the rural areas, they're going to see a lot of damage. Particularly out on the edges of community to the north and at the fire bird highway so it's blackened trees and there's some places where you can't go where you used to be able to go like the parker lake recreation area is blocked off just because of so many danger trees across the road. So there is some significant damage to the north and west of the community. You know, that's going to make them feel sad. >> Natasha: more than 4500 evacuees have been out of their homes since may the 10th. Some essential workers have been there over the past few days to get services up and running again. The mayor is telling people to fuel up and bring a few days' of essential supplies. Residents will need to remain on high alert and ready to leave again since they are still fires burning nearby. >>> Prime minister justin trudeau will head to france next week to mark the 80th anniversary of d-day.

At Thunder Bay's favourite festival ""Wake the Giant"". Ta-da! There it is. The premier says the materials in the school were clearly inappropriate. What exactly is the issue? >> Reporter: it's hard to see and vey exactly what the premier is taking issue with, though we know that the premier blaine higgs posted on ""x,"" former twitter, he is furious about this picture, this photo of a presentation that was done at a new brunswick school that was shared with him and is shows questions on this slide where it has questions like, do girls masturbate? Will it hurt the first time I do it? Questions that might come up kind of organically during a sex ed conversation or sex ed class; however, this was being done and organized by the research and information group so acb global action, a group that tries to share information about sexual transmitted infections with students around the world and across canada and specifically this past week in a few schools in new brunswick. And so blaine higgs, the premier of new brunswick, saying that what they were talking about goes beyond the scope of what they were there to speak to the students about. Now, he put this in his post at the bottom of the post, there is a link to the pc party website where people can share their thoughts on if they are concerned about this, how much they are concerned about this, as well as an option to volunteer for the party. So perhaps some public sentiment assessment, perhaps a collection of public feedback happening here as well. >> Natasha: what are we hearing from this organization that offered the sex ed resource? >> Reporter: well, they're scratching their heads a bit too because they've done presentations like this for years in new brunswick schools. They have been prepared in four different new brunswick schools. The material or the topics they will be talking about is all within the curriculum, they say, of new brunswick and the materials specifically was approved, as is always, for them, they say, prior to the presentation beginning by the schools themselves. So they are surprised, disappointed, by this decision. As for more details, the cbc new brunswick colleagues are reaching out to the premier's office so far for more details. So far no answer to those requests. >> Natasha: brett ruskin in halifax, thank you.

This is a highly orchestrated criminal operation where several individuals were responsible for stealing the vehicles through various methods, many of which we have come to know that include violent carjacking as well as other methods of stealing vehicles for the intention of shipping overseas. >> Natasha: project odyssey led to the arrest of sixteen people with ten arrest warrants still jut standing. Police say they have laid more than 300 charges. 69 vehicles have been recovered worth more than $33 million. The suspects were reportedly working with organized crime to export stolen vehicles through the port of montreal to the united arab emirates and oman. >>> Still ahead, extreme weather wreaks havoc in the U.S. midwest over this memorial day weekend.

[Lion roar] (Opening Mnemonic) (music throughout) ( ) ( ) [ ] >> Natasha: we expect to hear in the next half hour or so from the governor of kentucky. It's one of four states hit over the weekend by deadly tornadoes. As many as 120 million americans remain under an extreme weather threat. Officials say four children are among the nineteen people killed

across texas, oklahoma, arkansas and kentucky. Hundreds of others have been hurt and at least eleven tornadoes were reported just on sunday. Reporter steve futterman is joining us live from los angeles. Steve, such a terrible loss and loss of life but also the destruction of property, the uprooting of communities. What's the latest from the officials in those four affected states? >> Reporter: you know, natasha, this is a holiday weekend here in the U.S. but there are many people in those four states who are not really celebrating death and destruction in those four states, texas, oklahoma, arkansas and kentucky. Texas, I think, one of the hardest hit areas. You go to some pockets where the tornadoes went through, there's not much left in some of these small towns. Virtually every home has been knocked town, businesses knocked down. We've heard harrowing stories of survival. This man from texas telling how he got through the tornado. >> The owner came around honking his horn warning everybody to get out. I don't know why I heeded that warning. I'm glad I did. I grabbed my dog. We headed for there and it just -- it was just unbelievable the sound of all the destruction going on around us. It's terrible. >> It's terrible. It's amazing the destruction and

the loss that has been experienced in this tornado. Not only here in valleyview but at the other locations here in north texas. >> Reporter: valleyview, texas, you heard that mentioned just before that area, that small town at least seven people died there. And you look everywhere in these places, the trees are down, power lines are down, there are hundreds of thousands of customers without electricity right now. And there are even some reports of some of these big rig trucks, natasha, these giant big rig trucks just blown over by all this. >> Natasha: the weather continues to be a threat. So what are we seeing in the forecast? >> Reporter: well, this storm is not over. It's moving east, though, so kentucky, these other states will not be impacted that much but it's moving east so the east coast is going to be hit. We don't know how severe the weather will be, but there are these severe weather watches throughout and up and down the east coast from new york to savannah, georgia, and we mentioned texas. They may not be having these storms right now but they're having right now very hot weather in del rio, texas, today, temperatures expected to hit 43° celsius. So if it's not a storm, it's the heat. Just really severe weather throughout the U.S. right now. >> Natasha: steve futterman, thank you so much. >> Reporter: thank you. [ ] Let's go for a skate, and a little chat.

( ) 12340e9>> Natasha: a new chapter may be written today for canada's biggest bookstore chain. Indigo shareholders are voting on a deal that would put the company fully back in the hands of its founder and her husband. Scott peterson is following this story. The big question is why take the company private now? >> Reporter: a lot of analysts are asking this. There's a couple of it different answers. One the stock is flirting with lows that we haven't seen in four years. So it's a potentially good buying opportunity. And two, if you're the majority shareholder, maybe you want to buy those shares back before putting some real investment into the company. There's a couple of different things. Take a look at the stock price and get a sense of what's happening. The share is worth $8. Over $30 if you go back a few years. They're at $2.48, there about, because the offer now is for $2.50 for the shares that heather reisman and jared schwartz do not own. So the ownership structure here is kind of an interesting with indigo. For example, jared schwartz is the founder of onyx corp.

he owns 59% of the common shares of the company through holding companies. He is married to ceo heather reisman, who owns about 4.6 of indigo shares again through holding companies. So together, they make up about two-thirds of the company. Now, the offer for the shares, like I mentioned, at $2.50, and the vote is taking place this morning at 11 o'clock and it requires approval by two-thirds of the shareholders out there and the majority of the shareholders who are not involved with those holding companies. So a lot of analysts are saying that indigo is going through some tough times. They need some money to invest. They've fired people as recently as january and they took a $50 million fiscal loss last year, so the company is poised to have an influx of cash. Maybe we will see that after the restructuring and if it does go through and approved by the board, there will be -- it should delist the company as of june. They expect that to close soon. >> Natasha: the canadian stock market is open for business. It's memorial day down south. What should we be looking for? >> Reporter: look for markets to drive the sideways. We have the tsx up 50 points. Don't expect any volume or volatility without the big direction of U.S. neighbour. Let's take a look at some of the indicators s the price of oil flirting with $78 a barrel. We have the canadian dollar, the euro, british pound, all a little bit positive against its U.S. counterpart. I don't know if we get the tsx. It's up about 60 points right now. That's without direction of the U.S. markets which are closed for memorial day. >> Natasha: thank you, scott. >> Reporter: thanks.

[ ] >> Natasha: officials in papa new guinea now say more than 2,000 people may have been buried alive by friday's landslide. Rescuers are digging with their bare hands or simple tools to reach the victims. Tons of debris buried the homes in the middle of the night when most of the villagers were asleep. Some parts of the village are under as much as 8 metres of debris. Officials warn that few of those will be saved because damaged roads mean rescuers can't get the heavy equipment they need into the disaster zone. Let's stick with this story. Mate begocher is with the united nations humanitarian. He is an adviser there. He's based in papa new guinea and joining us from wabeg. Thank you for making time for us. >> Reporter: thank you. I want to let the audience know, it is so dark where you are because ""a,"" it's the middle of the night, and you guys have lost power. So it really means a lot that you've stayed up to speak to us. We care deeply about this story. I know we're reaching you in this location right now but you are in some of the disaster areas earlier in the day. Can you please describe what you saw. >> Yes, thank you for having us. So we reached today the disaster area. We were there where the landslide occurred, approximately 72 hours ago. So there is a population in big disstress. People are very traumatized looking for their relatives who are buried and the overall situation was very, very tense.

So, this will be some soaking rains at times. And you can see winds currently out of the east. They will turn to a southwest wind and going to be a little breezy at times, likely 30 to 40km, 30 to 50km/h throughout the day. Today we're starting off pretty mild.

Here's a look at your national and international headlines. The death toll from severe weather in the southern united states has now risen to 18. Powerful storms left a wide trail of destruction across texas, oklahoma and arkansas. The worst damage was seen in a region spanning from north of dallas to the northwest corner of arkansas. The governor of kentucky declared a state of emergency early this morning, citing multiple reports of wind damage and tornadoes. Now, forecasters say the greatest risk for weather will shift to the east today, with severe storms expected anywhere from alabama as far as new york city. Strong winds and heavy rain pounded the coastal regions of bangladesh and india as a severe cyclone made landfall. Millions of people are without electricity after a power poles fell and trees were uprooted by gusty winds. Dozens of bangladeshi villages were flooded after a flood protection. Embankments either washed away or were damaged by the storm surge. Nearly 800,000 people had been evacuated from vulnerable areas in bangladesh on sunday. The india meteorological department says the storm is likely to weaken further throughout the day, but warns heavy showers will remain over the next two days. 12 people were injured by severe turbulence on a qatar airways flight from doha to dublin. It happened while flying over turkey. The plane, a boeing 787 dreamliner, still managed to land safely as scheduled, but passengers on board say the turbulence lasted less than 20s and occurred during food and drink service. This incident follows similarly severe turbulence on a singapore airlines flight nearly a week ago, where dozens of passengers were injured and a man died of a suspected heart attack. Former us president donald trump is looking to gain more support along the campaign trail this weekend. He took to swing state north carolina, where he was met with waves and cheers. But he had a rockier reception at the libertarian national convention after getting booed and heckled

during a raucous speech. Astrid martinez has more on what lies ahead for trump and president joe biden. This week, as summer kicks off the presidential race is also heating up in north carolina this weekend, nascar fans cheered ahead of former president trump's arrival at the coca-cola 600 race. >> It's trump's third visit to the swing state this election. >> It's going to be a great race. >> But his reception was far less friendly while on the campaign trail in dc on saturday. >> I will be a true friend to libertarians in the white house. >> Trump was booed by the crowd at the libertarian national convention after asking for the third party's endorsement. President biden did not attend the libertarian convention, instead delivering the commencement address at west point graduation and using the moment to take a jab at former president trump. >> And your very first day at west point, you raised your right hand and took an oath not to a political party, not to a president, but to the constitution of the united states of america. >> President biden will also head to a swing state this week. Pennsylvania it will be his seventh time in the state this year. Astrid martinez, cbs news the remains of an unknown newfoundland soldier who died in france during the first world war arrived home in saint john's . >> France transferred the remains to canada over the weekend during a repatriation ceremony at the beaumont-hamel newfoundland memorial. This year marks the 100th anniversary of the national war memorial in downtown saint john's. This is where the unknown soldier's remains will be placed in a black granite tomb on newfoundland's memorial day on july 1st. A graphic artist who designed tragically hip themed canadian travel posters has caught the attention of the band. As jay-durant explains, these posters are now being sold across the country. >> A little background music for inspiration. Graphic artist john bell island, his creative partner adam rogers came up with a unique idea to showcase their client mitchell presses capabilities. It'd be kind of cool to do travel posters that were based on the tragically hip songs. Drawing from a classic canadian style, the finished products posted on social media quickly caught the attention of the kingston band, and they got a call from the tragically hip and said, wow, I don't even know about this project. Really interesting. Maybe we can talk about it now. The complete set is being sold on the hips website. On their 40th anniversary, a hip trip around canada incorporating some hidden nuggets from those well-known lyrics. This weathervane jesus. At the top of this, we have ry cooder up in here, singing his eulogy could have been the willie nelson, or it could have been the wine. I probably went through their whole catalog. We actually ended up hiring a writer to help us with that, because we really wanted it to have like a over the top sort of advertising feel to the writing. This is not bilal's first tragically hip themed work. He created a commemorative poster for rogers arena during the farewell tour in 2016, back when he was more of a casual fan. I probably had 2 to 3 albums and now I probably, you know, I listen to them all the time, shaking now that I got my hands steady. John's also an instructor at the wilson school of design from this project that's quickly taken off. There's a lesson here that he will continue to share with his students. You're going to get overwhelmed by the software and the technology and all of those things. But at the end of the day, it's all about imagination. And it will be the one thing that will keep you in the industry. Jay-durant ""global news"" >> And that's what's making national and international news.

This ranking, launched by ""Les Echos"" in partnership with Statista, aims to highlight French companies that excel in innovation and best practices.

Gilles David, CEO of ENERTIME, affirms: ""Being in the TOP 5 of Innovation Leaders in France is a great source of pride for all ENERTIME employees, past and present, who have developed over the past fifteen years, a unique proprietary technology in high-power turbomachinery and thermodynamic machines essential for the energy transition. This success is due not only to our teams but also to our shareholders who have supported us and to our clients who took the risk of trusting a young independent SME.""

Innovation Rooted in French Scientific Excellence

ENERTIME's technologies, based on thermodynamics combined with rotating machinery design, exploit a science born in France 200 years ago that is essential to the energy transition. They offer decarbonized and decentralized solutions as an alternative to centralized production solutions.

Tailored Solutions for Industrial Needs

ENERTIME provides customized systems for industrial clients, developing a unique ability to understand and address their issues, which fosters continuous and sustainable innovation.

Strategic Vision Coupled with Innovation

With full ownership of its intellectual property and patents, ENERTIME can deploy its technologies, developed on Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) machines, in other fields. These capabilities are a significant asset for developing high-temperature, high-power heat pumps (HTHP). The natural gas expansion turbine installed for GRTgaz in Villiers-le-Bel and the partnership with STOLECT illustrate other successful applications of these technologies.

Inherently Competitive Technologies

A high-power ORC (typically 2 to 3 MW) for waste heat recovery is a very competitive solution with a typical LCOE[1] of €62/MWhe. A high temperature heat pump producing steam, reduces the CO2 emissions of steam production by a factor of ten in France and is 2 to 3 times more efficient than an electric boiler. It also avoids pollutant emissions associated with biomass or RDF[2] combustion. ENERTIME has developed these complex technologies without decarbonization subsidies, which were nonexistent before 2021, and plans to build 10 new machines in two years, in addition to the 12 commissioned between 2012 and 2023.

Strong International Ambition

To become competitive, decarbonization technologies must target a global market. ENERTIME has always aimed to develop relevant international solutions to compensate for a domestic market that take time to open. This strategy has led to successes on three continents and exports to eleven countries. ENERTIME expects most of its revenue to come from exports by 2030. In May 2024, ENERTIME was labeled an Efficient Solution for its ORC modules by the Solar Impulse Foundation and joined this global alliance.

ABOUT ENERTIME

Created in 2008, ENERTIME designs, develops, and implements Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) machines, gaz expansion turbines and high temperature heat pumps for industrial energy efficiency and decentralized production of renewable energy. ORC machines convert heat into electricity. Heat pumps use low-temperature heat to produce high-temperature heat.

ENERTIME is the only player offering ORC machines and a portfolio of technology in the field of thermodynamics for the energy transition. For ORC technology, it is one of the four main global players and the only French one fully mastering this technology of high-power machines (1 MW and more). The Company is qualified as an ""innovative company"" by BPIfrance and is recognized as a French ""Creative Industry"".

ENERGIE CIRCULAIRE, the ESCO subsidiary of ENERTIME is offering the company's technology as a service.

ENERTIME is listed on the Euronext Growth market (ISIN: FR0011915339 - ticker: ALENE).

This ranking, launched by ""Les Echos"" in partnership with Statista, aims to highlight French companies that excel in innovation and best practices.

Gilles David, CEO of ENERTIME, affirms: ""Being in the TOP 5 of Innovation Leaders in France is a great source of pride for all ENERTIME employees, past and present, who have developed over the past fifteen years, a unique proprietary technology in high-power turbomachinery and thermodynamic machines essential for the energy transition. This success is due not only to our teams but also to our shareholders who have supported us and to our clients who took the risk of trusting a young independent SME.""

Innovation Rooted in French Scientific Excellence

ENERTIME's technologies, based on thermodynamics combined with rotating machinery design, exploit a science born in France 200 years ago that is essential to the energy transition. They offer decarbonized and decentralized solutions as an alternative to centralized production solutions.

Tailored Solutions for Industrial Needs

ENERTIME provides customized systems for industrial clients, developing a unique ability to understand and address their issues, which fosters continuous and sustainable innovation.

Strategic Vision Coupled with Innovation

With full ownership of its intellectual property and patents, ENERTIME can deploy its technologies, developed on Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) machines, in other fields. These capabilities are a significant asset for developing high-temperature, high-power heat pumps (HTHP). The natural gas expansion turbine installed for GRTgaz in Villiers-le-Bel and the partnership with STOLECT illustrate other successful applications of these technologies.

Inherently Competitive Technologies

A high-power ORC (typically 2 to 3 MW) for waste heat recovery is a very competitive solution with a typical LCOE[1] of €62/MWhe. A high temperature heat pump producing steam, reduces the CO2 emissions of steam production by a factor of ten in France and is 2 to 3 times more efficient than an electric boiler. It also avoids pollutant emissions associated with biomass or RDF[2] combustion. ENERTIME has developed these complex technologies without decarbonization subsidies, which were nonexistent before 2021, and plans to build 10 new machines in two years, in addition to the 12 commissioned between 2012 and 2023.

Strong International Ambition

To become competitive, decarbonization technologies must target a global market. ENERTIME has always aimed to develop relevant international solutions to compensate for a domestic market that take time to open. This strategy has led to successes on three continents and exports to eleven countries. ENERTIME expects most of its revenue to come from exports by 2030. In May 2024, ENERTIME was labeled an Efficient Solution for its ORC modules by the Solar Impulse Foundation and joined this global alliance.

ABOUT ENERTIME

Created in 2008, ENERTIME designs, develops, and implements Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) machines, gaz expansion turbines and high temperature heat pumps for industrial energy efficiency and decentralized production of renewable energy. ORC machines convert heat into electricity. Heat pumps use low-temperature heat to produce high-temperature heat.

ENERTIME is the only player offering ORC machines and a portfolio of technology in the field of thermodynamics for the energy transition. For ORC technology, it is one of the four main global players and the only French one fully mastering this technology of high-power machines (1 MW and more). The Company is qualified as an ""innovative company"" by BPIfrance and is recognized as a French ""Creative Industry"".

Progress on Alstom's action plan to support its financial targets

During the second half of fiscal year 2023/24, the Group mobilised around the operational, commercial, and cost efficiency plan:

Quality of order intake during the second half provides comfort in continuing to grow the margin in backlog: +60bps in FY 2023/24 versus last year, and expected +50bps per year in the coming three yearsIn FY 2023/24, Alstom continued to ramp-up production rates, delivering 4,645 cars, compared to 4,151 in 2022/23Supply chain efficiencies allowed to decrease inventory days since 30 September 2023Costs efficiency programs now launched across overheads and indirect procurement, with notably the aim to reduce SG&A over sales by ca. 1pp over three years vs FY 2022/23.

The €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan highlighting commitment to Investment Grade

As announced in November 2023 and reiterated in January 2024, Alstom's Board of Directors is committed to a conservative financial policy and to protect the Group's Investment Grade rating, in particular through a ca. €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan.

This plan and its execution, which have been unanimously approved by Alstom's Board of Directors, has the following components:

Divestments for ca. €700 million:Sale of TMH for €75 million realized in January 2024The announced sale of conventional signalling business in North America to Knorr-Bremse AG, which will generate proceeds of ca. €630 million upon closing expected during Summer 2024The issuance of hybrid bonds with 50% equity content for Moody's5 in an amount of ca. €750 million to be executed no later than September 2024 subject to market conditions and AMF approvalA capital increase with preferential subscription rights in an amount of ca. €1 billion to be executed no later than September 2024 subject to market conditions and AMF approval

The ca. €2.4 billion proceeds correspond to ca. €2 billion of deleveraging, mainly due to the hybrid bond's 50% Moody's debt content.

Each of CDPQ6 and Bpifrance, holding respectively 17.4% and 7.5% of Alstom's capital, has declared to the Company its intention to subscribe for its pro-rata share of the capital increase.

In addition, Alstom has entered into a standby underwriting commitment with BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, J.P. Morgan and Société Générale, acting as Joint Global Coordinators, pursuant to which they have undertaken to underwrite the remainder of the capital raise (i.e. ca. €750 million), subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions precedent.

Circa €1.2 billion of the proceeds of asset disposals and of the capital markets transactions will be used to repay financial debt by September 2024:

repayment of Neu CP by €1,033 million repayment of RCF drawings by €175 million

The remainder of the proceeds will be invested in highly liquid short-term investment (cash equivalent treatment) and will be earmarked for gross debt reduction at maturity.

Alstom Baa3 long-term issuer rating is reaffirmed, and the outlook will be changed to stable upon successful closing of the hybrid bond issuance and the rights issue.

Alstom will terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following the execution of the deleveraging plan.

Business update

Growth by offering greater value to customersOrders

During the fiscal year 2023/24, the Group recorded €18.9 billion in orders, with commercial success across multiple geographies, notably in Europe, Asia/Pacific and in Americas. During the last fiscal year, Alstom reported an order intake of €20.7 billion.

The total amount of the framework agreement is up €500 million.

In Germany, Alstom was awarded a contract to supply 40 Coradia StreamTM High-Capacity electric multiple units together with full maintenance for 30 years to Nahverkehrsverbund Schleswig-Holstein (NAH.SH), valued at close to €900 million, and including an option for up to 55 additional trains with a corresponding full-service package. The Group also signed a contract with RAILPOOL for 50 TraxxTM Universal multi-purpose locomotives.

In Romania, Alstom, as part of a consortium with the civil works companies Gulermak and Arcada, also signed a contract with the Cluj-Napoca City Hall in Romania for the construction of the Cluj-Napoca Metro Line 1. Alstom's share of this state-of-the-art turnkey project reaches approximately €400 million.

In Italy, Alstom was awarded a contract for the supply of high-speed trains.

In Americas, Alstom reported €2.0 billion order intake, compared with €2.7 billion over the last fiscal year, driven by a contract with the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) in the United States to deliver 130 full low floor electric streetcars for Philadelphia, valued at over €667 million and with options to build an additional 30 streetcars. And the Group was awarded a contract by the Connecticut Department of Transportation (CTDOT) in the United States to supply 60 single-level rail coach cars valued at approximately €285 million with options to build an additional 313 cars, as part of CTDOT's coach renewal program for its statewide rail system.

In Asia/Pacific, the order intake stood at €3.2 billion, compared to €3.0 billion for the last fiscal year. In the Philippines, Alstom in consortium with Colas Rail has been awarded by Mitsubishi Corporation a contract to provide an integrated railway system for the extension of the North-South Commuter Railway project (NSCR). Alstom's contract share is worth approximately €1 billion. In Australia, Alstom has been awarded a contract worth around €900 million to maintain the regional rolling stock VLocity and Classic fleets in Victoria, Australia for the next decade.

In Africa/Middle East/Central Asia, the Group reported €2.4 billion order intake, compared with €2.2 billion over the last fiscal year. In Israel, Alstom, a member of the TMT Consortium (TLV Metropolitan Tramway Ltd.) and its partners Electra Ltd. & Dan Public Transportation Ltd., have reached financial closure on the contract, awarded in May 2022, to design, build, maintain, and finance the Tel Aviv Metropolitan LRT Green line by Metropolitan Mass Transit System Ltd (NTA). Alstom's share is valued at €858 million. In Saudi Arabia, Alstom signed a contract of over €500 million with The Royal Commission for AlUla (RCU) for AlUla's pioneering battery-powered tramway - the world's longest catenary-free line.

As of 31 March 2024, the backlog stood at €92 billion, providing the Group with strong visibility over future sales.

Sales

Alstom's sales amounted to €17.6 billion for the fiscal year 2023/24, representing a growth of 6.7% on a reported basis and a strong 9.4% on an organic basis compared with Alstom sales in the last fiscal year. Sales related to non-performing backlog, corresponding to sales on legacy projects with a negative margin at completion, amounted to €1.7 billion during the fiscal year 2023/24.

Rolling stock sales reached €9.1 billion, representing an increase of 3.9% on a reported basis and 6.5% on an organic basis, driven by contracts ramp-up in France, Belgium and in the US, and the solid level of execution in South Africa, India and Europe.

Services sales stood at €4.3 billion, up 11.9% on a reported basis and 14.3% on an organic basis versus last year, benefiting from the continuous ramp-up in the UK, in Italy and in the US as well as a solid level of execution in Canada.

In Signalling, Alstom reported €2.6 billion sales, up 8.9% on a reported basis and 11.8% on an organic basis versus last year, led by a consistent execution across all regions, mainly in Europe and in APAC.

Systems sales grew 6.9% on a reported basis and 9.3% on an organic basis, and stood at €1.6 billion, driven by a good performance of Turnkey Systems projects in Mexico, Egypt and Canada.

Divestments

On 14 September 2023, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US department of Treasury added JSC Transmashholding (TMH AO) to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Person (SDN) List. TMH AO is the Russian holding company of TMH Group and is 100% owned by TMH Limited, and Alstom was holding a 20% stake in TMH limited. The Group further assessed potential exposures arising from the new OFAC sanctions and made the decision to sell its stake in TMH. The transaction was closed early January 2024 for an amount of €75 million, carrying value was nil as result of previous impairment, contributing to the de-risking of the company's portfolio.

On 19 April 2024, Alstom announced that it had entered into a binding agreement with Knorr-Bremse AG, to sell Alstom's North American conventional signalling business for a purchase price of around €630 million. Closing of the transaction is only subject to customary conditions, including regulatory approval, and is expected to take place as soon as summer 2024. Proceeds for Alstom at closing, net of expected tax and transaction costs, are expected to be around €620 million.

2.Innovation by Pioneering Smarter and Greener Mobility for All

As of end of March 2024, research and development gross costs amounted to €749 million, i.e. 4.3% of sales, delivering on the Alstom In Motion strategy which is based on three pillars: Autonomous mobility, Data factory and Mobility orchestration. Net R&D amounts to €549 million before PPA amortisation.

Programs funded by IPCEI Hydrogen are ongoing. This important European program supports the development of new hydrogen trains for regional applications, shunting locos and freight, leveraging on the experience collected with Coradia iLint regional trains that are now in revenue service.

Homologation tests of Avelia Horizon are planned in 2024 to enable a start of revenue service in 2025. The development of international configurations is ongoing. Alstom has launched the development of Avelia stream 300, addressing the high-speed single deck segment with a first project for Italy.

The replacement of Adessia commuter train has been launched to address the U.K. and USA markets. This new product range will include EMU, BMU, BEMU and HMU versions to also replace the existing Diesel trains.

TRAXX Multi-system 3 - locomotives is pursuing homologation tests in 2024 to enable it to run on the different European corridors. It includes the passenger version which can be operated at 200kph.

Services product line is focused on addressing green, sustainable and more efficient operation concepts. Green re-tractioning initiatives include for example the retrofit with hydrogen-fuelled internal combustion engines for locomotives and the ability to provide autonomy for non-electrified lines via the so-called ""Last-mile"" functionality supported by the IPCEI H2 program.

Signalling Product Line worked on Onvia Control L2 A and Onvia Control L2 B European Standard convergence, driving market presence with its integration into TRAXX platform and securing new contracts for cross border operation, Onvia Cab level 2 and level 3 on-board solution together with Automatic Train Operation, and it continued its footprint expansion with a new contract in Canada.

Alstom Innovations cluster continued to develop Autonomous Mobility solutions for Passengers & Freight trains. Major milestones on the roadmap to achieve GoA4 (Grade of Automation 4) have been successfully passed under real mainline operating conditions on passengers and freight train with SNCF in France, and for operation in yard in the Netherlands.

Alstom has also made great strides in developing a new SaaS platform that will enhance its global digital offering. The platform streamlines applications integration and deployment in a trusted and future-proof ecosystem.

3.Profitability

The adjusted EBIT margin has progressed from 5.2% over the fiscal year 2022/23 to 5.7% over the fiscal year 2023/24, benefiting from further synergies for 30bps, a steady reduction of non-performing legacy contracts sales for an impact of 30bps, an increased volume and favourable mix delivering 20bps gross margin expansion, partially offset by the negative gross margin impact related to the legacy portfolio deviations for (30)bps.

Alstom recorded restructuring and rationalisation charges of €(147) million mainly related to the reduction of overhead costs for €(115) million (""Autumn"" plan) and adaptation of the production setup for €(32) million, including the United Kingdom for €(14) million, Germany for €(8) million, France for €(3) million, Spain for €(3) million and the U.S.A. for €(2) million.

Costs related to the integration of Bombardier Transportation were recorded for an amount of €(142) million. €(118) million charges were related to some legal proceedings outside the ordinary course of business mainly for two projects - in U.S.A. and in Turkey, and for legal fees in the context of the claim against Bombardier Inc. €(30) million were related to impairment of assets due to the exit from Russia. Other exceptional expenses were recorded for €(73) million, of which €(36) million of consequential impacts from restructuring plan already initiated in Germany.

Alstom's EBIT before amortisation and impairment of assets exclusively valued when determining the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") stood at €356 million. This compares to €366 million for the last fiscal year.

The share in net income from equity investments amounted to €7 million, excluding the amortisation of the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") from Chinese joint ventures of €(10) million.

Adjusted net profit, representing the group's share of net profit from continued operations excluding PPA net of tax, amounts to €44 million for the fiscal year 2023/24. This compares to an adjusted net profit of €292 million during the last fiscal year.

The Group's Net profit/(loss) (Group share) stood at €(309) million for the fiscal year 2023/24, compared to €(132) million last fiscal year.

4.Financial structure

The Group's Free Cash Flow stands at €(557) million for the fiscal year 2023/24 as compared to €199 million during the last fiscal year and €(1,119) million at the first half of fiscal year 2023/24. Cash generation was impacted over the full year by an unfavourable €(856) million change in working capital compared to €(219) million in the last fiscal year; mostly due to change in Trade Working Capital as well as the reversal effect of the change in law on VAT in France for €(380) million. The Contract Working Capital is positively impacted by the acceleration of deliveries from major contracts in the second half of the year, strong collections of down payments as well as reduction of provision for risk on contracts.

On 31 March 2024, the Group recorded a net debt position of €(2,994) million.

In addition to its available cash and cash equivalents, amounting to €976 million on 31 March 2024, the Group benefits from strong liquidity with:

€2.25 billion Revolving Credit Facility maturing in October 2024;€1.75 billion Revolving Credit Facility maturing in January 2027;€2.5 billion Revolving Credit Facility maturing in January 2029.

The first facility has two six-month extension options remaining at borrowers' discretion. Alstom will, however, terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following execution of the deleveraging plan.

The last two facilities have been successfully extended by one year. On 31 March 2024, the €1.75 billion RCF line had been drawn down for €175 million, while the other two lines remained undrawn.

As per its conservative liquidity policy, the €2.5 billion Revolving Credit Facility serves as a back-up of the Group €2.5 billion Negotiable European Commercial Papers program in place. With these RCF lines (€175 million drawn on the RCF on 31 March 2024), the €1.03 billion of Neu CP outstanding on 31 March 2024, the Group benefitted from a €6.3 billion liquidity available.

5.One Alstom team - Agile, Inclusive and Responsible

Decarbonization is at the heart of Alstom's strategy. The Group is reducing its Scope 1 & 2 emissions reaching 139 ktonCO2e (representing a 39% decrease compared to March 2022), while collaborating with suppliers and customers on reducing its Scope 3 footprint. First results of this collaboration can be seen through the reduction of emissions intensity of sold product reaching 4.0 gCO2e/pass.km (i.e. (13)% compared to March 2022). Alstom CO2e emissions reduction targets had been validated on the 6th of July 2023 by the independent Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) as in line with requirements to reach Paris Agreement commitments.

The supply of electricity from renewable sources has also been expanded. Alstom signed a significant Power Purchase Agreement focused on solar development in Spain. The solar farm is expected to begin operations early 2025 with a 10-years contract. The project will cover the equivalent of 80% of Alstom's electricity consumption in Europe, so this is a major step in reaching the target of 100% electricity consumption from renewables.

Regarding Diversity & Inclusion, the Alstom in Motion (AiM) 2025 strategy targets to reach 28% of women managers, engineers and professionals' roles by 2025. As of end of March 2024, 24.7% of manager, engineer and professional roles are held by women. Alstom will continue to accelerate its efforts in the coming months.

Alstom's Corporate Social Responsibility performance is regularly evaluated by various rating agencies; the Group maintained its presence among the CAC40 ESG index for the third consecutive year and the DJSI for the 13th consecutive year. Alstom improved is scoring to ECOVADIS questionnaire with a score of 77/100 and kept AA score with MSCI agency. In addition, in 2024, Alstom improved is CDP rating, moving from B to A-. Those results reflect its strong position and strategy on Sustainability.

In addition, Alstom published for the second year European Taxonomy-aligned KPIs about Sales, Capex and Opex, pursuing strong analysis initiated last year. EU Taxonomy-aligned sales amounted to 60% and ranked Alstom among best in class, confirming the importance of the sector in which Alstom operates in achieving the EU's ambition of carbon neutrality by 2050. The EU Taxonomy purpose is to redirect capital flows towards sustainable activities and help navigate transition to a low carbon economy.

Financial trajectory for FY 2024/25

The outlook for FY 2024/25 is based on following main assumptions:

Supportive market demand FY 2024/25 downpayments consistent with FY 2023/24Balance sheet deleveraging plan fully executed in FY 2024/25End of integration of Bombardier Transportation in FY 2024/25

FY 2024/25 Outlook:

Book to bill above 1Sales organic growth: around 5%aEBIT margin around 6.5 %Free Cash Flow generation within the €300 million to €500 million rangeSeasonality driving:negative FCF in the first half of FY 2024/25 within a range of €(300) million to €(500) million margin development to be more second-half weighted

***

Mid to long-term ambitions

The Group's ambition is to deliver around 5% average sales growth over the mid to long term, thanks to a book-to-bill above 1, largely driven by Services, Signalling and Systems product lines. Rolling stock is expected to grow above market rate, Services and Signalling at high-single digit rates and Systems at double digit rates.

On profitability, Alstom's ambition is to consistently deliver an adjusted EBIT margin between 8% and 10% over the mid to long term. This improvement from 5.7% in fiscal year 2023/24 will be driven by:

Continuous improvement of gross margin in backlog thanks to quality order intake and completion of legacy projects.Improved execution through operational excellence initiatives and industrial optimisation.Cost efficiency programs across indirect procurement and overheads.

Considering the slight dilution from disposals and the revised timing of the impact from industrial optimisation, the Group expects to reach this profitability range in FY 2026/27, versus FY 2025/26 previously.

Free Cash Flow:Alstom expects free cash flow conversion to trend towards 100% of adjusted net income over the cycle. Yearly performance is subject to short-term working capital volatility, notably from the phasing of downpayments.Over the next three years, the Group expects to deliver at least €1.5 billion in free cash-flow over FY 2024/25 to FY 2026/27, despite Contract Working Capital being a headwind over that period.

APPENDIX 4 - NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INDICATORS DEFINITIONS

This section presents financial indicators used by the Group that are not defined by accounting standard setters.

Orders received

A new order is recognised as an order received only when the contract creates enforceable obligations between the Group and its customer. When this condition is met, the order is recognised at the contract value. If the contract is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the reporting unit, the Group requires the immediate elimination of currency exposure using forward currency sales. Orders are then measured using the spot rate at inception of hedging instruments.

Book-to-Bill

The book-to-bill ratio is the ratio of orders received to the amount of sales traded for a specific period.

Gross margin % on backlog

Gross Margin % on backlog is a KPI that presents the expected performance level of firm contracts in backlog. It represents the difference between the sales not yet recognized and the cost of sales not yet incurred from the contracts in backlog. This % is an average of the portfolio of contracts in backlog and is meaningful to project mid- and long-term profitability.

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA is a KPI that presents the level of recurring operational performance. It represents the sales minus the cost of sales, adjusted to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination as well as significant, non-recurring ""one off"" items that are not expected to occur again in subsequent years.

EBIT before PPA

Following the Bombardier Transportation acquisition and with effect from the fiscal year 2021/22 condensed consolidated financial statements, Alstom decided to introduce the ""EBIT before PPA"" KPI aimed at restating its Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (""EBIT"") to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination. This KPI is also aligned with market practice.

Adjusted EBIT

Adjusted EBIT (""aEBIT"") is the Key Performance Indicator to present the level of recurring operational performance. This indicator is also aligned with market practice and comparable to direct competitors.

Starting September 2019, Alstom has opted for the inclusion of the share in net income of the equity-accounted investments into the aEBIT when these are considered to be part of the operating activities of the Group (because there are significant operational flows and/or common project execution with these entities). This mainly includes Chinese joint-ventures, namely CASCO joint-venture for Alstom as well as, following the integration of Bombardier Transportation, Alstom Sifang (Qingdao) Transportation Ltd. (formerly Bombardier Sifang), Bombardier NUG Propulsion System Co. Ltd and Changchun Changke Alstom Railway Vehicles Company Ltd (formerly Changchun Bombardier).

aEBIT corresponds to Earning Before Interests and Tax adjusted for the following elements:

net restructuring expenses (including rationalization costs)tangibles and intangibles impairmentcapital gains or loss/revaluation on investments disposals or controls changes of an entityany other non-recurring items, such as some costs incurred to realize business combinations and amortization of an asset exclusively valued in the context of business combination, as well as litigation costs that have arisen outside the ordinary course of businessand including the share in net income of the operational equity-accounted investments

A non-recurring item is a ""one-off"" exceptional item that is not supposed to occur again in following years and that is significant.

Adjusted EBIT margin corresponds to Adjusted EBIT expressed as a percentage of sales.

EBITDA + JV dividends

EBITDA before PPA plus dividends from joint ventures is the EBIT before PPA, before depreciation and amortisation, with the addition of the dividends received from joint ventures.

Adjusted net profit

The ""Adjusted Net Profit"" KPI restates Alstom's net profit from continued operations (Group share) to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination, net of the corresponding tax effect. This indicator is also aligned with market practice.

Free cash flow

Free Cash Flow is de?ned as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures including capitalised development costs, net of proceeds from disposals of tangible and intangible assets. Free Cash Flow does not include any proceeds from disposals of activity.

The most directly comparable financial measure to Free Cash Flow calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS is net cash provided by operating activities.

Funds from Operations

Funds from Operations ""FFO"" in the EBIT to FCF statement refers to the Free Cash Flow generated by Operations, before Working Capital variations.

Contract and Trade Working Capital

Contract Working Capital is the sum of:

Contract Assets & Liabilities, which includes the Customer Down-PaymentsCurrent provisions, which includes Risks on contracts and Warranties

Trade Working Capital is the Working Capital that is not strictly related to contract. It includes all the elements of the working capital but

Contract Working Capital Income Tax receivables and payablesRestructuring provisions

Net cash/(debt)

The net cash/(debt) is defined as cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and other current financial asset, less borrowings.

Pay-out ratio

The pay-out ratio is calculated by dividing the amount of the overall dividend with the ""Adjusted Net profit from continuing operations attributable to equity holders of the parent, Group share"" as presented in the management report in the consolidated financial statements.

Organic basis

This press release includes performance indicators presented on a reported basis and on an organic basis. Figures given on an organic basis eliminate the impact of changes in scope of consolidation and changes resulting from the translation of the accounts into Euro following the variation of foreign currencies against the Euro.

The Group uses figures prepared on an organic basis both for internal analysis and for external communication, as it believes they provide means to analyse and explain variations from one period to another. However, these figures are not measurements of performance under IFRS.

The Board of Directors, in its meeting of 7 May 2024, proposed that no dividend will be paid with regards to the fiscal year 2023/24.

""Alstom recorded a strong rebound during the second half of the year, with solid order intake, strong organic growth, improved profitability and €562 million free cash-flow generation. Thanks to the support of our reference shareholders, we will swiftly execute the €2 billion deleveraging plan, allowing for the stabilization of its Investment Grade rating. In April, we announced the sale of Alstom's conventional signalling business in North America at a favourable valuation, demonstrating the quality and attractiveness of the Group's assets. We are confident in the strength of our backlog and our strategy of selectivity and mix evolution towards services. The Group is capitalizing on the solid operational progress made over the last three years and is launching new initiatives to improve its industrial performance and reduce overheads and indirect procurement costs. Altogether, Alstom is now set on stronger foundations to deliver sustainable profit and cash generation."" said Henri Poupart-Lafarge, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Alstom.

Progress on Alstom's action plan to support its financial targets

During the second half of fiscal year 2023/24, the Group mobilised around the operational, commercial, and cost efficiency plan:

Quality of order intake during the second half provides comfort in continuing to grow the margin in backlog: +60bps in FY 2023/24 versus last year, and expected +50bps per year in the coming three yearsIn FY 2023/24, Alstom continued to ramp-up production rates, delivering 4,645 cars, compared to 4,151 in 2022/23Supply chain efficiencies allowed to decrease inventory days since 30 September 2023Costs efficiency programs now launched across overheads and indirect procurement, with notably the aim to reduce SG&A over sales by ca. 1pp over three years vs FY 2022/23.

The €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan highlighting commitment to Investment Grade

As announced in November 2023 and reiterated in January 2024, Alstom's Board of Directors is committed to a conservative financial policy and to protect the Group's Investment Grade rating, in particular through a ca. €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan.

This plan and its execution, which have been unanimously approved by Alstom's Board of Directors, has the following components:

Divestments for ca. €700 million:Sale of TMH for €75 million realized in January 2024The announced sale of conventional signalling business in North America to Knorr-Bremse AG, which will generate proceeds of ca. €630 million upon closing expected during Summer 2024The issuance of hybrid bonds with 50% equity content for Moody's5 in an amount of ca. €750 million to be executed no later than September 2024 subject to market conditions and AMF approvalA capital increase with preferential subscription rights in an amount of ca. €1 billion to be executed no later than September 2024 subject to market conditions and AMF approval

The ca. €2.4 billion proceeds correspond to ca. €2 billion of deleveraging, mainly due to the hybrid bond's 50% Moody's debt content.

Each of CDPQ6 and Bpifrance, holding respectively 17.4% and 7.5% of Alstom's capital, has declared to the Company its intention to subscribe for its pro-rata share of the capital increase.

In addition, Alstom has entered into a standby underwriting commitment with BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, J.P. Morgan and Société Générale, acting as Joint Global Coordinators, pursuant to which they have undertaken to underwrite the remainder of the capital raise (i.e. ca. €750 million), subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions precedent.

Circa €1.2 billion of the proceeds of asset disposals and of the capital markets transactions will be used to repay financial debt by September 2024:

repayment of Neu CP by €1,033 million repayment of RCF drawings by €175 million

The remainder of the proceeds will be invested in highly liquid short-term investment (cash equivalent treatment) and will be earmarked for gross debt reduction at maturity.

Alstom Baa3 long-term issuer rating is reaffirmed, and the outlook will be changed to stable upon successful closing of the hybrid bond issuance and the rights issue.

Alstom will terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following the execution of the deleveraging plan.

Business update

Growth by offering greater value to customersOrders

During the fiscal year 2023/24, the Group recorded €18.9 billion in orders, with commercial success across multiple geographies, notably in Europe, Asia/Pacific and in Americas. During the last fiscal year, Alstom reported an order intake of €20.7 billion. The (8)% decrease is mostly driven by last year's landmark contract awarded by Landesanstalt Schienenfahrzeuge Baden Württemberg (SFBW) network in Germany of almost €2.5 billion.

In Europe, Alstom recorded €11.3 billion order intake during the fiscal year 2023/24, compared with €12.8 billion over the last fiscal year.

In the U.K, Alstom has signed an eight-year extension to its Train Services Agreement (TSA) with CrossCountry. The contract extension, valued at around €950 million, further secures this long-term partnership and is evidence of the trust placed by the customer.

In France, Alstom will supply île-de-France Mobilités and RATP with 103 new MF19 trainsets, which is the new generation metro on rail, for a total contract value of more than €800 million, 100% financed by Île-de-France Mobilités. This new fleet will replace the existing rolling stock on lines 13, 12 and 8 of the Île-de-France metro as of 2027. The Group also signed a framework contract with Akiem European rolling stock leasing company for 100 TraxxTM Universal multi-system (MS3) locomotives, together with an initial firm order for 65 locomotives. The total amount of the framework agreement is up €500 million.

In Germany, Alstom was awarded a contract to supply 40 Coradia StreamTM High-Capacity electric multiple units together with full maintenance for 30 years to Nahverkehrsverbund Schleswig-Holstein (NAH.SH), valued at close to €900 million, and including an option for up to 55 additional trains with a corresponding full-service package. The Group also signed a contract with RAILPOOL for 50 TraxxTM Universal multi-purpose locomotives.

In Romania, Alstom, as part of a consortium with the civil works companies Gulermak and Arcada, also signed a contract with the Cluj-Napoca City Hall in Romania for the construction of the Cluj-Napoca Metro Line 1. Alstom's share of this state-of-the-art turnkey project reaches approximately €400 million.

In Italy, Alstom was awarded a contract for the supply of high-speed trains.

In Americas, Alstom reported €2.0 billion order intake, compared with €2.7 billion over the last fiscal year, driven by a contract with the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) in the United States to deliver 130 full low floor electric streetcars for Philadelphia, valued at over €667 million and with options to build an additional 30 streetcars. And the Group was awarded a contract by the Connecticut Department of Transportation (CTDOT) in the United States to supply 60 single-level rail coach cars valued at approximately €285 million with options to build an additional 313 cars, as part of CTDOT's coach renewal program for its statewide rail system.

In Asia/Pacific, the order intake stood at €3.2 billion, compared to €3.0 billion for the last fiscal year. In the Philippines, Alstom in consortium with Colas Rail has been awarded by Mitsubishi Corporation a contract to provide an integrated railway system for the extension of the North-South Commuter Railway project (NSCR). Alstom's contract share is worth approximately €1 billion. In Australia, Alstom has been awarded a contract worth around €900 million to maintain the regional rolling stock VLocity and Classic fleets in Victoria, Australia for the next decade.

In Africa/Middle East/Central Asia, the Group reported €2.4 billion order intake, compared with €2.2 billion over the last fiscal year. In Israel, Alstom, a member of the TMT Consortium (TLV Metropolitan Tramway Ltd.) and its partners Electra Ltd. & Dan Public Transportation Ltd., have reached financial closure on the contract, awarded in May 2022, to design, build, maintain, and finance the Tel Aviv Metropolitan LRT Green line by Metropolitan Mass Transit System Ltd (NTA). Alstom's share is valued at €858 million. In Saudi Arabia, Alstom signed a contract of over €500 million with The Royal Commission for AlUla (RCU) for AlUla's pioneering battery-powered tramway - the world's longest catenary-free line.

As of 31 March 2024, the backlog stood at €92 billion, providing the Group with strong visibility over future sales.

Sales

Alstom's sales amounted to €17.6 billion for the fiscal year 2023/24, representing a growth of 6.7% on a reported basis and a strong 9.4% on an organic basis compared with Alstom sales in the last fiscal year. Sales related to non-performing backlog, corresponding to sales on legacy projects with a negative margin at completion, amounted to €1.7 billion during the fiscal year 2023/24.

Rolling stock sales reached €9.1 billion, representing an increase of 3.9% on a reported basis and 6.5% on an organic basis, driven by contracts ramp-up in France, Belgium and in the US, and the solid level of execution in South Africa, India and Europe.

Services sales stood at €4.3 billion, up 11.9% on a reported basis and 14.3% on an organic basis versus last year, benefiting from the continuous ramp-up in the UK, in Italy and in the US as well as a solid level of execution in Canada.

In Signalling, Alstom reported €2.6 billion sales, up 8.9% on a reported basis and 11.8% on an organic basis versus last year, led by a consistent execution across all regions, mainly in Europe and in APAC.

Systems sales grew 6.9% on a reported basis and 9.3% on an organic basis, and stood at €1.6 billion, driven by a good performance of Turnkey Systems projects in Mexico, Egypt and Canada.

Divestments

On 14 September 2023, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US department of Treasury added JSC Transmashholding (TMH AO) to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Person (SDN) List. TMH AO is the Russian holding company of TMH Group and is 100% owned by TMH Limited, and Alstom was holding a 20% stake in TMH limited. The Group further assessed potential exposures arising from the new OFAC sanctions and made the decision to sell its stake in TMH. The transaction was closed early January 2024 for an amount of €75 million, carrying value was nil as result of previous impairment, contributing to the de-risking of the company's portfolio.

On 19 April 2024, Alstom announced that it had entered into a binding agreement with Knorr-Bremse AG, to sell Alstom's North American conventional signalling business for a purchase price of around €630 million. Closing of the transaction is only subject to customary conditions, including regulatory approval, and is expected to take place as soon as summer 2024. Proceeds for Alstom at closing, net of expected tax and transaction costs, are expected to be around €620 million.

2.Innovation by Pioneering Smarter and Greener Mobility for All

As of end of March 2024, research and development gross costs amounted to €749 million, i.e. 4.3% of sales, delivering on the Alstom In Motion strategy which is based on three pillars: Autonomous mobility, Data factory and Mobility orchestration. Net R&D amounts to €549 million before PPA amortisation.

Programs funded by IPCEI Hydrogen are ongoing. This important European program supports the development of new hydrogen trains for regional applications, shunting locos and freight, leveraging on the experience collected with Coradia iLint regional trains that are now in revenue service.

Homologation tests of Avelia Horizon are planned in 2024 to enable a start of revenue service in 2025. The development of international configurations is ongoing. Alstom has launched the development of Avelia stream 300, addressing the high-speed single deck segment with a first project for Italy.

The replacement of Adessia commuter train has been launched to address the U.K. and USA markets. This new product range will include EMU, BMU, BEMU and HMU versions to also replace the existing Diesel trains.

TRAXX Multi-system 3 - locomotives is pursuing homologation tests in 2024 to enable it to run on the different European corridors. It includes the passenger version which can be operated at 200kph.

Services product line is focused on addressing green, sustainable and more efficient operation concepts. Green re-tractioning initiatives include for example the retrofit with hydrogen-fuelled internal combustion engines for locomotives and the ability to provide autonomy for non-electrified lines via the so-called ""Last-mile"" functionality supported by the IPCEI H2 program.

Signalling Product Line worked on Onvia Control L2 A and Onvia Control L2 B European Standard convergence, driving market presence with its integration into TRAXX platform and securing new contracts for cross border operation, Onvia Cab level 2 and level 3 on-board solution together with Automatic Train Operation, and it continued its footprint expansion with a new contract in Canada.

Alstom Innovations cluster continued to develop Autonomous Mobility solutions for Passengers & Freight trains. Major milestones on the roadmap to achieve GoA4 (Grade of Automation 4) have been successfully passed under real mainline operating conditions on passengers and freight train with SNCF in France, and for operation in yard in the Netherlands.

Alstom has also made great strides in developing a new SaaS platform that will enhance its global digital offering. The platform streamlines applications integration and deployment in a trusted and future-proof ecosystem.

3.Profitability

The adjusted EBIT margin has progressed from 5.2% over the fiscal year 2022/23 to 5.7% over the fiscal year 2023/24, benefiting from further synergies for 30bps, a steady reduction of non-performing legacy contracts sales for an impact of 30bps, an increased volume and favourable mix delivering 20bps gross margin expansion, partially offset by the negative gross margin impact related to the legacy portfolio deviations for (30)bps.

Alstom recorded restructuring and rationalisation charges of €(147) million mainly related to the reduction of overhead costs for €(115) million (""Autumn"" plan) and adaptation of the production setup for €(32) million, including the United Kingdom for €(14) million, Germany for €(8) million, France for €(3) million, Spain for €(3) million and the U.S.A. for €(2) million.

Costs related to the integration of Bombardier Transportation were recorded for an amount of €(142) million. €(118) million charges were related to some legal proceedings outside the ordinary course of business mainly for two projects - in U.S.A. and in Turkey, and for legal fees in the context of the claim against Bombardier Inc. €(30) million were related to impairment of assets due to the exit from Russia. Other exceptional expenses were recorded for €(73) million, of which €(36) million of consequential impacts from restructuring plan already initiated in Germany.

Alstom's EBIT before amortisation and impairment of assets exclusively valued when determining the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") stood at €356 million. This compares to €366 million for the last fiscal year.

The share in net income from equity investments amounted to €7 million, excluding the amortisation of the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") from Chinese joint ventures of €(10) million.

Adjusted net profit, representing the group's share of net profit from continued operations excluding PPA net of tax, amounts to €44 million for the fiscal year 2023/24. This compares to an adjusted net profit of €292 million during the last fiscal year.

The Group's Net profit/(loss) (Group share) stood at €(309) million for the fiscal year 2023/24, compared to €(132) million last fiscal year.

***

4.Financial structure

The Group's Free Cash Flow stands at €(557) million for the fiscal year 2023/24 as compared to €199 million during the last fiscal year and €(1,119) million at the first half of fiscal year 2023/24. Cash generation was impacted over the full year by an unfavourable €(856) million change in working capital compared to €(219) million in the last fiscal year; mostly due to change in Trade Working Capital as well as the reversal effect of the change in law on VAT in France for €(380) million. The Contract Working Capital is positively impacted by the acceleration of deliveries from major contracts in the second half of the year, strong collections of down payments as well as reduction of provision for risk on contracts.

On 31 March 2024, the Group recorded a net debt position of €(2,994) million.

In addition to its available cash and cash equivalents, amounting to €976 million on 31 March 2024, the Group benefits from strong liquidity with:

€2.25 billion Revolving Credit Facility maturing in October 2024;€1.75 billion Revolving Credit Facility maturing in January 2027;€2.5 billion Revolving Credit Facility maturing in January 2029.

The first facility has two six-month extension options remaining at borrowers' discretion. Alstom will, however, terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following execution of the deleveraging plan.

The last two facilities have been successfully extended by one year. On 31 March 2024, the €1.75 billion RCF line had been drawn down for €175 million, while the other two lines remained undrawn.

As per its conservative liquidity policy, the €2.5 billion Revolving Credit Facility serves as a back-up of the Group €2.5 billion Negotiable European Commercial Papers program in place. With these RCF lines (€175 million drawn on the RCF on 31 March 2024), the €1.03 billion of Neu CP outstanding on 31 March 2024, the Group benefitted from a €6.3 billion liquidity available.

5.One Alstom team - Agile, Inclusive and Responsible

Decarbonization is at the heart of Alstom's strategy. The Group is reducing its Scope 1 & 2 emissions reaching 139 ktonCO2e (representing a 39% decrease compared to March 2022), while collaborating with suppliers and customers on reducing its Scope 3 footprint. First results of this collaboration can be seen through the reduction of emissions intensity of sold product reaching 4.0 gCO2e/pass.km (i.e. (13)% compared to March 2022). Alstom CO2e emissions reduction targets had been validated on the 6th of July 2023 by the independent Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) as in line with requirements to reach Paris Agreement commitments.

The supply of electricity from renewable sources has also been expanded. Alstom signed a significant Power Purchase Agreement focused on solar development in Spain. The solar farm is expected to begin operations early 2025 with a 10-years contract. The project will cover the equivalent of 80% of Alstom's electricity consumption in Europe, so this is a major step in reaching the target of 100% electricity consumption from renewables.

Regarding Diversity & Inclusion, the Alstom in Motion (AiM) 2025 strategy targets to reach 28% of women managers, engineers and professionals' roles by 2025. As of end of March 2024, 24.7% of manager, engineer and professional roles are held by women. Alstom will continue to accelerate its efforts in the coming months.

Alstom's Corporate Social Responsibility performance is regularly evaluated by various rating agencies; the Group maintained its presence among the CAC40 ESG index for the third consecutive year and the DJSI for the 13th consecutive year. Alstom improved is scoring to ECOVADIS questionnaire with a score of 77/100 and kept AA score with MSCI agency. In addition, in 2024, Alstom improved is CDP rating, moving from B to A-. Those results reflect its strong position and strategy on Sustainability.

In addition, Alstom published for the second year European Taxonomy-aligned KPIs about Sales, Capex and Opex, pursuing strong analysis initiated last year. EU Taxonomy-aligned sales amounted to 60% and ranked Alstom among best in class, confirming the importance of the sector in which Alstom operates in achieving the EU's ambition of carbon neutrality by 2050. The EU Taxonomy purpose is to redirect capital flows towards sustainable activities and help navigate transition to a low carbon economy.

Financial trajectory for FY 2024/25

The outlook for FY 2024/25 is based on following main assumptions:

Supportive market demand FY 2024/25 downpayments consistent with FY 2023/24Balance sheet deleveraging plan fully executed in FY 2024/25End of integration of Bombardier Transportation in FY 2024/25

FY 2024/25 Outlook:

Book to bill above 1Sales organic growth: around 5%aEBIT margin around 6.5 %Free Cash Flow generation within the €300 million to €500 million rangeSeasonality driving:negative FCF in the first half of FY 2024/25 within a range of €(300) million to €(500) million margin development to be more second-half weighted

***

Mid to long-term ambitions

The Group's ambition is to deliver around 5% average sales growth over the mid to long term, thanks to a book-to-bill above 1, largely driven by Services, Signalling and Systems product lines. Rolling stock is expected to grow above market rate, Services and Signalling at high-single digit rates and Systems at double digit rates.

On profitability, Alstom's ambition is to consistently deliver an adjusted EBIT margin between 8% and 10% over the mid to long term. This improvement from 5.7% in fiscal year 2023/24 will be driven by:

Continuous improvement of gross margin in backlog thanks to quality order intake and completion of legacy projects.Improved execution through operational excellence initiatives and industrial optimisation.Cost efficiency programs across indirect procurement and overheads.

Considering the slight dilution from disposals and the revised timing of the impact from industrial optimisation, the Group expects to reach this profitability range in FY 2026/27, versus FY 2025/26 previously.

Free Cash Flow:Alstom expects free cash flow conversion to trend towards 100% of adjusted net income over the cycle. Yearly performance is subject to short-term working capital volatility, notably from the phasing of downpayments.Over the next three years, the Group expects to deliver at least €1.5 billion in free cash-flow over FY 2024/25 to FY 2026/27, despite Contract Working Capital being a headwind over that period.

APPENDIX 4 - NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INDICATORS DEFINITIONS

This section presents financial indicators used by the Group that are not defined by accounting standard setters.

Orders received

A new order is recognised as an order received only when the contract creates enforceable obligations between the Group and its customer. When this condition is met, the order is recognised at the contract value. If the contract is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the reporting unit, the Group requires the immediate elimination of currency exposure using forward currency sales. Orders are then measured using the spot rate at inception of hedging instruments.

Book-to-Bill

The book-to-bill ratio is the ratio of orders received to the amount of sales traded for a specific period.

Gross margin % on backlog

Gross Margin % on backlog is a KPI that presents the expected performance level of firm contracts in backlog. It represents the difference between the sales not yet recognized and the cost of sales not yet incurred from the contracts in backlog. This % is an average of the portfolio of contracts in backlog and is meaningful to project mid- and long-term profitability.

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA is a KPI that presents the level of recurring operational performance. It represents the sales minus the cost of sales, adjusted to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination as well as significant, non-recurring ""one off"" items that are not expected to occur again in subsequent years.

EBIT before PPA

Following the Bombardier Transportation acquisition and with effect from the fiscal year 2021/22 condensed consolidated financial statements, Alstom decided to introduce the ""EBIT before PPA"" KPI aimed at restating its Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (""EBIT"") to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination. This KPI is also aligned with market practice.

Adjusted EBIT

Adjusted EBIT (""aEBIT"") is the Key Performance Indicator to present the level of recurring operational performance. This indicator is also aligned with market practice and comparable to direct competitors.

Starting September 2019, Alstom has opted for the inclusion of the share in net income of the equity-accounted investments into the aEBIT when these are considered to be part of the operating activities of the Group (because there are significant operational flows and/or common project execution with these entities). This mainly includes Chinese joint-ventures, namely CASCO joint-venture for Alstom as well as, following the integration of Bombardier Transportation, Alstom Sifang (Qingdao) Transportation Ltd. (formerly Bombardier Sifang), Bombardier NUG Propulsion System Co. Ltd and Changchun Changke Alstom Railway Vehicles Company Ltd (formerly Changchun Bombardier).

aEBIT corresponds to Earning Before Interests and Tax adjusted for the following elements:

net restructuring expenses (including rationalization costs)tangibles and intangibles impairmentcapital gains or loss/revaluation on investments disposals or controls changes of an entityany other non-recurring items, such as some costs incurred to realize business combinations and amortization of an asset exclusively valued in the context of business combination, as well as litigation costs that have arisen outside the ordinary course of businessand including the share in net income of the operational equity-accounted investments

A non-recurring item is a ""one-off"" exceptional item that is not supposed to occur again in following years and that is significant.

Adjusted EBIT margin corresponds to Adjusted EBIT expressed as a percentage of sales.

EBITDA + JV dividends

EBITDA before PPA plus dividends from joint ventures is the EBIT before PPA, before depreciation and amortisation, with the addition of the dividends received from joint ventures.

Adjusted net profit

The ""Adjusted Net Profit"" KPI restates Alstom's net profit from continued operations (Group share) to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination, net of the corresponding tax effect. This indicator is also aligned with market practice.

Free cash flow

Free Cash Flow is de?ned as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures including capitalised development costs, net of proceeds from disposals of tangible and intangible assets. Free Cash Flow does not include any proceeds from disposals of activity.

The most directly comparable financial measure to Free Cash Flow calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS is net cash provided by operating activities.

Funds from Operations

Funds from Operations ""FFO"" in the EBIT to FCF statement refers to the Free Cash Flow generated by Operations, before Working Capital variations.

Contract and Trade Working Capital

Contract Working Capital is the sum of:

Contract Assets & Liabilities, which includes the Customer Down-PaymentsCurrent provisions, which includes Risks on contracts and Warranties

Trade Working Capital is the Working Capital that is not strictly related to contract. It includes all the elements of the working capital but

Contract Working Capital Income Tax receivables and payablesRestructuring provisions

Net cash/(debt)

The net cash/(debt) is defined as cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and other current financial asset, less borrowings.

Pay-out ratio

The pay-out ratio is calculated by dividing the amount of the overall dividend with the ""Adjusted Net profit from continuing operations attributable to equity holders of the parent, Group share"" as presented in the management report in the consolidated financial statements.

Organic basis

This press release includes performance indicators presented on a reported basis and on an organic basis. Figures given on an organic basis eliminate the impact of changes in scope of consolidation and changes resulting from the translation of the accounts into Euro following the variation of foreign currencies against the Euro.

The Group uses figures prepared on an organic basis both for internal analysis and for external communication, as it believes they provide means to analyse and explain variations from one period to another. However, these figures are not measurements of performance under IFRS.

Sales were €17.6 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio at 1.1.

The backlog reached €92 billion, providing strong visibility on future sales. Gross margin on backlog reached 17.5% as of 31 March 2024, compared to 16.9% on 31 March 2023.

In the fiscal year 2023/24, Alstom's adjusted EBIT was €997 million, up 17%, equivalent to a 5.7% aEBIT margin, and EBIT before PPA was €356 million. Adjusted net profit was €44 million, net income (group share) was €(309) million, and free cash flow was €(557) million for the full year.

On 31 March 2024, the Group's net debt position stood at €(2,994) million, compared to the €(2,135) million the Group reported on 31 March 2023. Alstom benefits from a solid €6.3 billion liquidity position and equity amounting to €8,778 million on 31 March 2024.

The Board of Directors, in its meeting of 7 May 2024, proposed that no dividend will be paid with regards to the fiscal year 2023/24.

""Alstom recorded a strong rebound during the second half of the year, with solid order intake, strong organic growth, improved profitability and €562 million free cash-flow generation. Thanks to the support of our reference shareholders, we will swiftly execute the €2 billion deleveraging plan, allowing for the stabilization of its Investment Grade rating. In April, we announced the sale of Alstom's conventional signalling business in North America at a favourable valuation, demonstrating the quality and attractiveness of the Group's assets. We are confident in the strength of our backlog and our strategy of selectivity and mix evolution towards services. The Group is capitalizing on the solid operational progress made over the last three years and is launching new initiatives to improve its industrial performance and reduce overheads and indirect procurement costs. Altogether, Alstom is now set on stronger foundations to deliver sustainable profit and cash generation."" said Henri Poupart-Lafarge, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Alstom.

Progress on Alstom's action plan to support its financial targets

During the second half of fiscal year 2023/24, the Group mobilised around the operational, commercial, and cost efficiency plan:

The €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan highlighting commitment to Investment Grade

As announced in November 2023 and reiterated in January 2024, Alstom's Board of Directors is committed to a conservative financial policy and to protect the Group's Investment Grade rating, in particular through a ca. €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan.

This plan and its execution, which have been unanimously approved by Alstom's Board of Directors, has the following components:

The ca. €2.4 billion proceeds correspond to ca. €2 billion of deleveraging, mainly due to the hybrid bond's 50% Moody's debt content.

Each of CDPQ and Bpifrance, holding respectively 17.4% and 7.5% of Alstom's capital, has declared to the Company its intention to subscribe for its pro-rata share of the capital increase.

In addition, Alstom has entered into a standby underwriting commitment with BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, J.P. Morgan and Société Générale, acting as Joint Global Coordinators, pursuant to which they have undertaken to underwrite the remainder of the capital raise (i.e. ca. €750 million), subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions precedent.

Circa €1.2 billion of the proceeds of asset disposals and of the capital markets transactions will be used to repay financial debt by September 2024:

The remainder of the proceeds will be invested in highly liquid short-term investment (cash equivalent treatment) and will be earmarked for gross debt reduction at maturity.

Alstom Baa3 long-term issuer rating is reaffirmed, and the outlook will be changed to stable upon successful closing of the hybrid bond issuance and the rights issue.

Alstom will terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following the execution of the deleveraging plan.

During the fiscal year 2023/24, the Group recorded €18.9 billion in orders, with commercial success across multiple geographies, notably in Europe, Asia/Pacific and in Americas. During the last fiscal year, Alstom reported an order intake of €20.7 billion. The (8)% decrease is mostly driven by last year's landmark contract awarded by Landesanstalt Schienenfahrzeuge Baden Württemberg (SFBW) network in Germany of almost €2.5 billion.

In Europe, Alstom recorded €11.3 billion order intake during the fiscal year 2023/24, compared with €12.8 billion over the last fiscal year.

In the U.K, Alstom has signed an eight-year extension to its Train Services Agreement (TSA) with CrossCountry. The contract extension, valued at around €950 million, further secures this long-term partnership and is evidence of the trust placed by the customer.

In France, Alstom will supply île-de-France Mobilités and RATP with 103 new MF19 trainsets, which is the new generation metro on rail, for a total contract value of more than €800 million, 100% financed by Île-de-France Mobilités. This new fleet will replace the existing rolling stock on lines 13, 12 and 8 of the Île-de-France metro as of 2027. The Group also signed a framework contract with Akiem European rolling stock leasing company for 100 Traxx Universal multi-system (MS3) locomotives, together with an initial firm order for 65 locomotives. The total amount of the framework agreement is up €500 million.

In Germany, Alstom was awarded a contract to supply 40 Coradia Stream High-Capacity electric multiple units together with full maintenance for 30 years to Nahverkehrsverbund Schleswig-Holstein (NAH.SH), valued at close to €900 million, and including an option for up to 55 additional trains with a corresponding full-service package. The Group also signed a contract with RAILPOOL for 50 Traxx Universal multi-purpose locomotives.

In Romania, Alstom, as part of a consortium with the civil works companies Gulermak and Arcada, also signed a contract with the Cluj-Napoca City Hall in Romania for the construction of the Cluj-Napoca Metro Line 1. Alstom's share of this state-of-the-art turnkey project reaches approximately €400 million.

In Italy, Alstom was awarded a contract for the supply of high-speed trains.

In Americas, Alstom reported €2.0 billion order intake, compared with €2.7 billion over the last fiscal year, driven by a contract with the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) in the United States to deliver 130 full low floor electric streetcars for Philadelphia, valued at over €667 million and with options to build an additional 30 streetcars. And the Group was awarded a contract by the Connecticut Department of Transportation (CTDOT) in the United States to supply 60 single-level rail coach cars valued at approximately €285 million with options to build an additional 313 cars, as part of CTDOT's coach renewal program for its statewide rail system.

In Asia/Pacific, the order intake stood at €3.2 billion, compared to €3.0 billion for the last fiscal year. In the Philippines, Alstom in consortium with Colas Rail has been awarded by Mitsubishi Corporation a contract to provide an integrated railway system for the extension of the North-South Commuter Railway project (NSCR). Alstom's contract share is worth approximately €1 billion. In Australia, Alstom has been awarded a contract worth around €900 million to maintain the regional rolling stock VLocity and Classic fleets in Victoria, Australia for the next decade.

In Africa/Middle East/Central Asia, the Group reported €2.4 billion order intake, compared with €2.2 billion over the last fiscal year. In Israel, Alstom, a member of the TMT Consortium (TLV Metropolitan Tramway Ltd.) and its partners Electra Ltd. & Dan Public Transportation Ltd., have reached financial closure on the contract, awarded in May 2022, to design, build, maintain, and finance the Tel Aviv Metropolitan LRT Green line by Metropolitan Mass Transit System Ltd (NTA). Alstom's share is valued at €858 million. In Saudi Arabia, Alstom signed a contract of over €500 million with The Royal Commission for AlUla (RCU) for AlUla's pioneering battery-powered tramway - the world's longest catenary-free line.

As of 31 March 2024, the backlog stood at €92 billion, providing the Group with strong visibility over future sales.

Alstom's sales amounted to €17.6 billion for the fiscal year 2023/24, representing a growth of 6.7% on a reported basis and a strong 9.4% on an organic basis compared with Alstom sales in the last fiscal year. Sales related to non-performing backlog, corresponding to sales on legacy projects with a negative margin at completion, amounted to €1.7 billion during the fiscal year 2023/24.

Rolling stock sales reached €9.1 billion, representing an increase of 3.9% on a reported basis and 6.5% on an organic basis, driven by contracts ramp-up in France, Belgium and in the US, and the solid level of execution in South Africa, India and Europe.

Services sales stood at €4.3 billion, up 11.9% on a reported basis and 14.3% on an organic basis versus last year, benefiting from the continuous ramp-up in the UK, in Italy and in the US as well as a solid level of execution in Canada.

In Signalling, Alstom reported €2.6 billion sales, up 8.9% on a reported basis and 11.8% on an organic basis versus last year, led by a consistent execution across all regions, mainly in Europe and in APAC.

Systems sales grew 6.9% on a reported basis and 9.3% on an organic basis, and stood at €1.6 billion, driven by a good performance of Turnkey Systems projects in Mexico, Egypt and Canada.

On 14 September 2023, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US department of Treasury added JSC Transmashholding (TMH AO) to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Person (SDN) List. TMH AO is the Russian holding company of TMH Group and is 100% owned by TMH Limited, and Alstom was holding a 20% stake in TMH limited. The Group further assessed potential exposures arising from the new OFAC sanctions and made the decision to sell its stake in TMH. The transaction was closed early January 2024 for an amount of €75 million, carrying value was nil as result of previous impairment, contributing to the de-risking of the company's portfolio.

On 19 April 2024, Alstom announced that it had entered into a binding agreement with Knorr-Bremse AG, to sell Alstom's North American conventional signalling business for a purchase price of around €630 million. Closing of the transaction is only subject to customary conditions, including regulatory approval, and is expected to take place as soon as summer 2024. Proceeds for Alstom at closing, net of expected tax and transaction costs, are expected to be around €620 million.

2. Innovation by Pioneering Smarter and Greener Mobility for All

As of end of March 2024, research and development gross costs amounted to €749 million, i.e. 4.3% of sales, delivering on the Alstom In Motion strategy which is based on three pillars: Autonomous mobility, Data factory and Mobility orchestration. Net R&D amounts to €549 million before PPA amortisation.

Programs funded by IPCEI Hydrogen are ongoing. This important European program supports the development of new hydrogen trains for regional applications, shunting locos and freight, leveraging on the experience collected with Coradia iLint regional trains that are now in revenue service.

Homologation tests of Avelia Horizon are planned in 2024 to enable a start of revenue service in 2025. The development of international configurations is ongoing. Alstom has launched the development of Avelia stream 300, addressing the high-speed single deck segment with a first project for Italy.

The replacement of Adessia commuter train has been launched to address the U.K. and USA markets. This new product range will include EMU, BMU, BEMU and HMU versions to also replace the existing Diesel trains.

TRAXX Multi-system 3 - locomotives is pursuing homologation tests in 2024 to enable it to run on the different European corridors. It includes the passenger version which can be operated at 200kph.

Services product line is focused on addressing green, sustainable and more efficient operation concepts. Green re-tractioning initiatives include for example the retrofit with hydrogen-fuelled internal combustion engines for locomotives and the ability to provide autonomy for non-electrified lines via the so-called ""Last-mile"" functionality supported by the IPCEI H2 program.

Signalling Product Line worked on Onvia Control L2 A and Onvia Control L2 B European Standard convergence, driving market presence with its integration into TRAXX platform and securing new contracts for cross border operation, Onvia Cab level 2 and level 3 on-board solution together with Automatic Train Operation, and it continued its footprint expansion with a new contract in Canada.

Alstom Innovations cluster continued to develop Autonomous Mobility solutions for Passengers & Freight trains. Major milestones on the roadmap to achieve GoA4 (Grade of Automation 4) have been successfully passed under real mainline operating conditions on passengers and freight train with SNCF in France, and for operation in yard in the Netherlands.

Alstom has also made great strides in developing a new SaaS platform that will enhance its global digital offering. The platform streamlines applications integration and deployment in a trusted and future-proof ecosystem.

The adjusted EBIT margin has progressed from 5.2% over the fiscal year 2022/23 to 5.7% over the fiscal year 2023/24, benefiting from further synergies for 30bps, a steady reduction of non-performing legacy contracts sales for an impact of 30bps, an increased volume and favourable mix delivering 20bps gross margin expansion, partially offset by the negative gross margin impact related to the legacy portfolio deviations for (30)bps.

Alstom recorded restructuring and rationalisation charges of €(147) million mainly related to the reduction of overhead costs for €(115) million (""Autumn"" plan) and adaptation of the production setup for €(32) million, including the United Kingdom for €(14) million, Germany for €(8) million, France for €(3) million, Spain for €(3) million and the U.S.A. for €(2) million.

Costs related to the integration of Bombardier Transportation were recorded for an amount of €(142) million. €(118) million charges were related to some legal proceedings outside the ordinary course of business mainly for two projects - in U.S.A. and in Turkey, and for legal fees in the context of the claim against Bombardier Inc. €(30) million were related to impairment of assets due to the exit from Russia. Other exceptional expenses were recorded for €(73) million, of which €(36) million of consequential impacts from restructuring plan already initiated in Germany.

Alstom's EBIT before amortisation and impairment of assets exclusively valued when determining the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") stood at €356 million. This compares to €366 million for the last fiscal year.

The share in net income from equity investments amounted to €7 million, excluding the amortisation of the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") from Chinese joint ventures of €(10) million.

Adjusted net profit, representing the group's share of net profit from continued operations excluding PPA net of tax, amounts to €44 million for the fiscal year 2023/24. This compares to an adjusted net profit of €292 million during the last fiscal year.

The Group's Net profit/(loss) (Group share) stood at €(309) million for the fiscal year 2023/24, compared to €(132) million last fiscal year.

4. Financial structure

The Group's Free Cash Flow stands at €(557) million for the fiscal year 2023/24 as compared to €199 million during the last fiscal year and €(1,119) million at the first half of fiscal year 2023/24. Cash generation was impacted over the full year by an unfavourable €(856) million change in working capital compared to €(219) million in the last fiscal year; mostly due to change in Trade Working Capital as well as the reversal effect of the change in law on VAT in France for €(380) million. The Contract Working Capital is positively impacted by the acceleration of deliveries from major contracts in the second half of the year, strong collections of down payments as well as reduction of provision for risk on contracts.

On 31 March 2024, the Group recorded a net debt position of €(2,994) million.

In addition to its available cash and cash equivalents, amounting to €976 million on 31 March 2024, the Group benefits from strong liquidity with:

The first facility has two six-month extension options remaining at borrowers' discretion. Alstom will, however, terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following execution of the deleveraging plan.

The last two facilities have been successfully extended by one year. On 31 March 2024, the €1.75 billion RCF line had been drawn down for €175 million, while the other two lines remained undrawn.

As per its conservative liquidity policy, the €2.5 billion Revolving Credit Facility serves as a back-up of the Group €2.5 billion Negotiable European Commercial Papers program in place. With these RCF lines (€175 million drawn on the RCF on 31 March 2024), the €1.03 billion of Neu CP outstanding on 31 March 2024, the Group benefitted from a €6.3 billion liquidity available.

5. One Alstom team - Agile, Inclusive and Responsible

Decarbonization is at the heart of Alstom's strategy. The Group is reducing its Scope 1 & 2 emissions reaching 139 ktonCO2e (representing a 39% decrease compared to March 2022), while collaborating with suppliers and customers on reducing its Scope 3 footprint. First results of this collaboration can be seen through the reduction of emissions intensity of sold product reaching 4.0 gCO2e/pass.km (i.e. (13)% compared to March 2022). Alstom CO2e emissions reduction targets had been validated on the 6 of July 2023 by the independent Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) as in line with requirements to reach Paris Agreement commitments.

The supply of electricity from renewable sources has also been expanded. Alstom signed a significant Power Purchase Agreement focused on solar development in Spain. The solar farm is expected to begin operations early 2025 with a 10-years contract. The project will cover the equivalent of 80% of Alstom's electricity consumption in Europe, so this is a major step in reaching the target of 100% electricity consumption from renewables.

Regarding Diversity & Inclusion, the Alstom in Motion (AiM) 2025 strategy targets to reach 28% of women managers, engineers and professionals' roles by 2025. As of end of March 2024, 24.7% of manager, engineer and professional roles are held by women. Alstom will continue to accelerate its efforts in the coming months.

Alstom's Corporate Social Responsibility performance is regularly evaluated by various rating agencies; the Group maintained its presence among the CAC40 ESG index for the third consecutive year and the DJSI for the 13 consecutive year. Alstom improved is scoring to ECOVADIS questionnaire with a score of 77/100 and kept AA score with MSCI agency. In addition, in 2024, Alstom improved is CDP rating, moving from B to A-. Those results reflect its strong position and strategy on Sustainability.

In addition, Alstom published for the second year European Taxonomy-aligned KPIs about Sales, Capex and Opex, pursuing strong analysis initiated last year. EU Taxonomy-aligned sales amounted to 60% and ranked Alstom among best in class, confirming the importance of the sector in which Alstom operates in achieving the EU's ambition of carbon neutrality by 2050. The EU Taxonomy purpose is to redirect capital flows towards sustainable activities and help navigate transition to a low carbon economy.

The outlook for FY 2024/25 is based on following main assumptions:

Considering the slight dilution from disposals and the revised timing of the impact from industrial optimisation, the Group expects to reach this profitability range in FY 2026/27, versus FY 2025/26 previously.

APPENDIX 4 - NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INDICATORS DEFINITIONS

This section presents financial indicators used by the Group that are not defined by accounting standard setters.

Orders received

A new order is recognised as an order received only when the contract creates enforceable obligations between the Group and its customer. When this condition is met, the order is recognised at the contract value. If the contract is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the reporting unit, the Group requires the immediate elimination of currency exposure using forward currency sales. Orders are then measured using the spot rate at inception of hedging instruments.

Book-to-Bill

The book-to-bill ratio is the ratio of orders received to the amount of sales traded for a specific period.

Gross margin % on backlog

Gross Margin % on backlog is a KPI that presents the expected performance level of firm contracts in backlog. It represents the difference between the sales not yet recognized and the cost of sales not yet incurred from the contracts in backlog. This % is an average of the portfolio of contracts in backlog and is meaningful to project mid- and long-term profitability.

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA is a KPI that presents the level of recurring operational performance. It represents the sales minus the cost of sales, adjusted to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination as well as significant, non-recurring ""one off"" items that are not expected to occur again in subsequent years.

EBIT before PPA

Following the Bombardier Transportation acquisition and with effect from the fiscal year 2021/22 condensed consolidated financial statements, Alstom decided to introduce the ""EBIT before PPA"" KPI aimed at restating its Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (""EBIT"") to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination. This KPI is also aligned with market practice.

Adjusted EBIT

Adjusted EBIT (""aEBIT"") is the Key Performance Indicator to present the level of recurring operational performance. This indicator is also aligned with market practice and comparable to direct competitors.

Starting September 2019, Alstom has opted for the inclusion of the share in net income of the equity-accounted investments into the aEBIT when these are considered to be part of the operating activities of the Group (because there are significant operational flows and/or common project execution with these entities). This mainly includes Chinese joint-ventures, namely CASCO joint-venture for Alstom as well as, following the integration of Bombardier Transportation, Alstom Sifang (Qingdao) Transportation Ltd. (formerly Bombardier Sifang), Bombardier NUG Propulsion System Co. Ltd and Changchun Changke Alstom Railway Vehicles Company Ltd (formerly Changchun Bombardier).

aEBIT corresponds to Earning Before Interests and Tax adjusted for the following elements:

A non-recurring item is a ""one-off"" exceptional item that is not supposed to occur again in following years and that is significant.

Adjusted EBIT margin corresponds to Adjusted EBIT expressed as a percentage of sales.

EBITDA + JV dividends

EBITDA before PPA plus dividends from joint ventures is the EBIT before PPA, before depreciation and amortisation, with the addition of the dividends received from joint ventures.

Adjusted net profit

The ""Adjusted Net Profit"" KPI restates Alstom's net profit from continued operations (Group share) to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination, net of the corresponding tax effect. This indicator is also aligned with market practice.

Free cash flow

Free Cash Flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures including capitalised development costs, net of proceeds from disposals of tangible and intangible assets. Free Cash Flow does not include any proceeds from disposals of activity.

The most directly comparable financial measure to Free Cash Flow calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS is net cash provided by operating activities.

Funds from Operations

Funds from Operations ""FFO"" in the EBIT to FCF statement refers to the Free Cash Flow generated by Operations, before Working Capital variations.

Contract and Trade Working Capital

Contract Working Capital is the sum of:

Trade Working Capital is the Working Capital that is not strictly related to contract. It includes all the elements of the working capital but

Net cash/(debt)

The net cash/(debt) is defined as cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and other current financial asset, less borrowings.

Pay-out ratio

The pay-out ratio is calculated by dividing the amount of the overall dividend with the ""Adjusted Net profit from continuing operations attributable to equity holders of the parent, Group share"" as presented in the management report in the consolidated financial statements.

Organic basis

This press release includes performance indicators presented on a reported basis and on an organic basis. Figures given on an organic basis eliminate the impact of changes in scope of consolidation and changes resulting from the translation of the accounts into Euro following the variation of foreign currencies against the Euro.

The Group uses figures prepared on an organic basis both for internal analysis and for external communication, as it believes they provide means to analyse and explain variations from one period to another. However, these figures are not measurements of performance under IFRS.",wallstreet-online.de,news,wallstreet:online,,0.1686274509803922,452842931,8,https://assets.wallstreet-online.de/_media/6/source1280/size_645/globenewswire-1280.png,eng-9548481

8 May 2024 - Between 1 April 2023 and 31 March 2024, Alstom booked €18.9 billion of orders. Sales were €17.6 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio at 1.1.

The backlog reached €92 billion, providing strong visibility on future sales. Gross margin on backlog reached 17.5% as of 31 March 2024, compared to 16.9% on 31 March 2023.

In the fiscal year 2023/24, Alstom's adjusted EBIT was €997 million, up 17%, equivalent to a 5.7% aEBIT margin, and EBIT before PPA was €356 million. Adjusted net profit was €44 million, net income (group share) was €(309) million, and free cash flow was €(557) million for the full year.

On 31 March 2024, the Group's net debt position stood at €(2,994) million, compared to the €(2,135) million the Group reported on 31 March 2023. Alstom benefits from a solid €6.3 billion liquidity position and equity amounting to €8,778 million on 31 March 2024.

The Board of Directors, in its meeting of 7 May 2024, proposed that no dividend will be paid with regards to the fiscal year 2023/24.

""Alstom recorded a strong rebound during the second half of the year, with solid order intake, strong organic growth, improved profitability and €562 million free cash-flow generation. Thanks to the support of our reference shareholders, we will swiftly execute the €2 billion deleveraging plan, allowing for the stabilization of its Investment Grade rating. In April, we announced the sale of Alstom's conventional signalling business in North America at a favourable valuation, demonstrating the quality and attractiveness of the Group's assets. We are confident in the strength of our backlog and our strategy of selectivity and mix evolution towards services. The Group is capitalizing on the solid operational progress made over the last three years and is launching new initiatives to improve its industrial performance and reduce overheads and indirect procurement costs. Altogether, Alstom is now set on stronger foundations to deliver sustainable profit and cash generation."" said Henri Poupart-Lafarge, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Alstom.

Progress on Alstom's action plan to support its financial targets

During the second half of fiscal year 2023/24, the Group mobilised around the operational, commercial, and cost efficiency plan:

The €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan highlighting commitment to Investment Grade

As announced in November 2023 and reiterated in January 2024, Alstom's Board of Directors is committed to a conservative financial policy and to protect the Group's Investment Grade rating, in particular through a ca. €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan.

This plan and its execution, which have been unanimously approved by Alstom's Board of Directors, has the following components:

The ca. €2.4 billion proceeds correspond to ca. €2 billion of deleveraging, mainly due to the hybrid bond's 50% Moody's debt content.

Each of CDPQ and Bpifrance, holding respectively 17.4% and 7.5% of Alstom's capital, has declared to the Company its intention to subscribe for its pro-rata share of the capital increase.

In addition, Alstom has entered into a standby underwriting commitment with BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, J.P. Morgan and Société Générale, acting as Joint Global Coordinators, pursuant to which they have undertaken to underwrite the remainder of the capital raise (i.e. ca. €750 million), subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions precedent.

Circa €1.2 billion of the proceeds of asset disposals and of the capital markets transactions will be used to repay financial debt by September 2024:

The remainder of the proceeds will be invested in highly liquid short-term investment (cash equivalent treatment) and will be earmarked for gross debt reduction at maturity.

Alstom Baa3 long-term issuer rating is reaffirmed, and the outlook will be changed to stable upon successful closing of the hybrid bond issuance and the rights issue.

Alstom will terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following the execution of the deleveraging plan.

During the fiscal year 2023/24, the Group recorded €18.9 billion in orders, with commercial success across multiple geographies, notably in Europe, Asia/Pacific and in Americas. During the last fiscal year, Alstom reported an order intake of €20.7 billion. The (8)% decrease is mostly driven by last year's landmark contract awarded by Landesanstalt Schienenfahrzeuge Baden Württemberg (SFBW) network in Germany of almost €2.5 billion.

In Europe, Alstom recorded €11.3 billion order intake during the fiscal year 2023/24, compared with €12.8 billion over the last fiscal year.

In the U.K, Alstom has signed an eight-year extension to its Train Services Agreement (TSA) with CrossCountry. The contract extension, valued at around €950 million, further secures this long-term partnership and is evidence of the trust placed by the customer.

In France, Alstom will supply île-de-France Mobilités and RATP with 103 new MF19 trainsets, which is the new generation metro on rail, for a total contract value of more than €800 million, 100% financed by Île-de-France Mobilités. This new fleet will replace the existing rolling stock on lines 13, 12 and 8 of the Île-de-France metro as of 2027. The Group also signed a framework contract with Akiem European rolling stock leasing company for 100 Traxx Universal multi-system (MS3) locomotives, together with an initial firm order for 65 locomotives. The total amount of the framework agreement is up €500 million.

In Germany, Alstom was awarded a contract to supply 40 Coradia Stream High-Capacity electric multiple units together with full maintenance for 30 years to Nahverkehrsverbund Schleswig-Holstein (NAH.SH), valued at close to €900 million, and including an option for up to 55 additional trains with a corresponding full-service package. The Group also signed a contract with RAILPOOL for 50 Traxx Universal multi-purpose locomotives.

In Romania, Alstom, as part of a consortium with the civil works companies Gulermak and Arcada, also signed a contract with the Cluj-Napoca City Hall in Romania for the construction of the Cluj-Napoca Metro Line 1. Alstom's share of this state-of-the-art turnkey project reaches approximately €400 million.

In Italy, Alstom was awarded a contract for the supply of high-speed trains.

In Americas, Alstom reported €2.0 billion order intake, compared with €2.7 billion over the last fiscal year, driven by a contract with the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) in the United States to deliver 130 full low floor electric streetcars for Philadelphia, valued at over €667 million and with options to build an additional 30 streetcars. And the Group was awarded a contract by the Connecticut Department of Transportation (CTDOT) in the United States to supply 60 single-level rail coach cars valued at approximately €285 million with options to build an additional 313 cars, as part of CTDOT's coach renewal program for its statewide rail system.

In Asia/Pacific, the order intake stood at €3.2 billion, compared to €3.0 billion for the last fiscal year. In the Philippines, Alstom in consortium with Colas Rail has been awarded by Mitsubishi Corporation a contract to provide an integrated railway system for the extension of the North-South Commuter Railway project (NSCR). Alstom's contract share is worth approximately €1 billion. In Australia, Alstom has been awarded a contract worth around €900 million to maintain the regional rolling stock VLocity and Classic fleets in Victoria, Australia for the next decade.

In Africa/Middle East/Central Asia, the Group reported €2.4 billion order intake, compared with €2.2 billion over the last fiscal year. In Israel, Alstom, a member of the TMT Consortium (TLV Metropolitan Tramway Ltd.) and its partners Electra Ltd. & Dan Public Transportation Ltd., have reached financial closure on the contract, awarded in May 2022, to design, build, maintain, and finance the Tel Aviv Metropolitan LRT Green line by Metropolitan Mass Transit System Ltd (NTA). Alstom's share is valued at €858 million. In Saudi Arabia, Alstom signed a contract of over €500 million with The Royal Commission for AlUla (RCU) for AlUla's pioneering battery-powered tramway - the world's longest catenary-free line.

As of 31 March 2024, the backlog stood at €92 billion, providing the Group with strong visibility over future sales.

Alstom's sales amounted to €17.6 billion for the fiscal year 2023/24, representing a growth of 6.7% on a reported basis and a strong 9.4% on an organic basis compared with Alstom sales in the last fiscal year. Sales related to non-performing backlog, corresponding to sales on legacy projects with a negative margin at completion, amounted to €1.7 billion during the fiscal year 2023/24.

Rolling stock sales reached €9.1 billion, representing an increase of 3.9% on a reported basis and 6.5% on an organic basis, driven by contracts ramp-up in France, Belgium and in the US, and the solid level of execution in South Africa, India and Europe.

Services sales stood at €4.3 billion, up 11.9% on a reported basis and 14.3% on an organic basis versus last year, benefiting from the continuous ramp-up in the UK, in Italy and in the US as well as a solid level of execution in Canada.

In Signalling, Alstom reported €2.6 billion sales, up 8.9% on a reported basis and 11.8% on an organic basis versus last year, led by a consistent execution across all regions, mainly in Europe and in APAC.

Systems sales grew 6.9% on a reported basis and 9.3% on an organic basis, and stood at €1.6 billion, driven by a good performance of Turnkey Systems projects in Mexico, Egypt and Canada.

On 14 September 2023, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US department of Treasury added JSC Transmashholding (TMH AO) to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Person (SDN) List. TMH AO is the Russian holding company of TMH Group and is 100% owned by TMH Limited, and Alstom was holding a 20% stake in TMH limited. The Group further assessed potential exposures arising from the new OFAC sanctions and made the decision to sell its stake in TMH. The transaction was closed early January 2024 for an amount of €75 million, carrying value was nil as result of previous impairment, contributing to the de-risking of the company's portfolio.

On 19 April 2024, Alstom announced that it had entered into a binding agreement with Knorr-Bremse AG, to sell Alstom's North American conventional signalling business for a purchase price of around €630 million. Closing of the transaction is only subject to customary conditions, including regulatory approval, and is expected to take place as soon as summer 2024. Proceeds for Alstom at closing, net of expected tax and transaction costs, are expected to be around €620 million.

2. Innovation by Pioneering Smarter and Greener Mobility for All

As of end of March 2024, research and development gross costs amounted to €749 million, i.e. 4.3% of sales, delivering on the Alstom In Motion strategy which is based on three pillars: Autonomous mobility, Data factory and Mobility orchestration. Net R&D amounts to €549 million before PPA amortisation.

Programs funded by IPCEI Hydrogen are ongoing. This important European program supports the development of new hydrogen trains for regional applications, shunting locos and freight, leveraging on the experience collected with Coradia iLint™ regional trains that are now in revenue service.

Homologation tests of Avelia Horizon™ are planned in 2024 to enable a start of revenue service in 2025. The development of international configurations is ongoing. Alstom has launched the development of Avelia stream™ 300, addressing the high-speed single deck segment with a first project for Italy.

The replacement of Adessia™ commuter train has been launched to address the U.K. and USA markets. This new product range will include EMU, BMU, BEMU and HMU versions to also replace the existing Diesel trains.

TRAXX™ Multi-system 3 - locomotives is pursuing homologation tests in 2024 to enable it to run on the different European corridors. It includes the passenger version which can be operated at 200kph.

Services product line is focused on addressing green, sustainable and more efficient operation concepts. Green re-tractioning initiatives include for example the retrofit with hydrogen-fuelled internal combustion engines for locomotives and the ability to provide autonomy for non-electrified lines via the so-called ""Last-mile"" functionality supported by the IPCEI H2 program.

Signalling Product Line worked on Onvia Control™ L2 A and Onvia Control™ L2 B European Standard convergence, driving market presence with its integration into TRAXX platform and securing new contracts for cross border operation, Onvia Cab™ level 2 and level 3 on-board solution together with Automatic Train Operation, and it continued its footprint expansion with a new contract in Canada.

Alstom Innovations cluster continued to develop Autonomous Mobility solutions for Passengers & Freight trains. Major milestones on the roadmap to achieve GoA4 (Grade of Automation 4) have been successfully passed under real mainline operating conditions on passengers and freight train with SNCF in France, and for operation in yard in the Netherlands.

Alstom has also made great strides in developing a new SaaS platform that will enhance its global digital offering. The platform streamlines applications integration and deployment in a trusted and future-proof ecosystem.

The adjusted EBIT margin has progressed from 5.2% over the fiscal year 2022/23 to 5.7% over the fiscal year 2023/24, benefiting from further synergies for 30bps, a steady reduction of non-performing legacy contracts sales for an impact of 30bps, an increased volume and favourable mix delivering 20bps gross margin expansion, partially offset by the negative gross margin impact related to the legacy portfolio deviations for (30)bps.

Alstom recorded restructuring and rationalisation charges of €(147) million mainly related to the reduction of overhead costs for €(115) million (""Autumn"" plan) and adaptation of the production setup for €(32) million, including the United Kingdom for €(14) million, Germany for €(8) million, France for €(3) million, Spain for €(3) million and the U.S.A. for €(2) million.

Costs related to the integration of Bombardier Transportation were recorded for an amount of €(142) million. €(118) million charges were related to some legal proceedings outside the ordinary course of business mainly for two projects - in U.S.A. and in Turkey, and for legal fees in the context of the claim against Bombardier Inc. €(30) million were related to impairment of assets due to the exit from Russia. Other exceptional expenses were recorded for €(73) million, of which €(36) million of consequential impacts from restructuring plan already initiated in Germany.

Alstom's EBIT before amortisation and impairment of assets exclusively valued when determining the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") stood at €356 million. This compares to €366 million for the last fiscal year.

The share in net income from equity investments amounted to €7 million, excluding the amortisation of the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") from Chinese joint ventures of €(10) million.

Adjusted net profit, representing the group's share of net profit from continued operations excluding PPA net of tax, amounts to €44 million for the fiscal year 2023/24. This compares to an adjusted net profit of €292 million during the last fiscal year.

The Group's Net profit/(loss) (Group share) stood at €(309) million for the fiscal year 2023/24, compared to €(132) million last fiscal year.

4. Financial structure

The Group's Free Cash Flow stands at €(557) million for the fiscal year 2023/24 as compared to €199 million during the last fiscal year and €(1,119) million at the first half of fiscal year 2023/24. Cash generation was impacted over the full year by an unfavourable €(856) million change in working capital compared to €(219) million in the last fiscal year; mostly due to change in Trade Working Capital as well as the reversal effect of the change in law on VAT in France for €(380) million. The Contract Working Capital is positively impacted by the acceleration of deliveries from major contracts in the second half of the year, strong collections of down payments as well as reduction of provision for risk on contracts.

On 31 March 2024, the Group recorded a net debt position of €(2,994) million.

In addition to its available cash and cash equivalents, amounting to €976 million on 31 March 2024, the Group benefits from strong liquidity with:

The first facility has two six-month extension options remaining at borrowers' discretion. Alstom will, however, terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following execution of the deleveraging plan.

The last two facilities have been successfully extended by one year. On 31 March 2024, the €1.75 billion RCF line had been drawn down for €175 million, while the other two lines remained undrawn.

As per its conservative liquidity policy, the €2.5 billion Revolving Credit Facility serves as a back-up of the Group €2.5 billion Negotiable European Commercial Papers program in place. With these RCF lines (€175 million drawn on the RCF on 31 March 2024), the €1.03 billion of Neu CP outstanding on 31 March 2024, the Group benefitted from a €6.3 billion liquidity available.

5. One Alstom team - Agile, Inclusive and Responsible

Decarbonization is at the heart of Alstom's strategy. The Group is reducing its Scope 1 & 2 emissions reaching 139 ktonCO2e (representing a 39% decrease compared to March 2022), while collaborating with suppliers and customers on reducing its Scope 3 footprint. First results of this collaboration can be seen through the reduction of emissions intensity of sold product reaching 4.0 gCO2e/pass.km (i.e. (13)% compared to March 2022). Alstom CO2e emissions reduction targets had been validated on the 6 of July 2023 by the independent Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) as in line with requirements to reach Paris Agreement commitments.

The supply of electricity from renewable sources has also been expanded. Alstom signed a significant Power Purchase Agreement focused on solar development in Spain. The solar farm is expected to begin operations early 2025 with a 10-years contract. The project will cover the equivalent of 80% of Alstom's electricity consumption in Europe, so this is a major step in reaching the target of 100% electricity consumption from renewables.

Regarding Diversity & Inclusion, the Alstom in Motion (AiM) 2025 strategy targets to reach 28% of women managers, engineers and professionals' roles by 2025. As of end of March 2024, 24.7% of manager, engineer and professional roles are held by women. Alstom will continue to accelerate its efforts in the coming months.

Alstom's Corporate Social Responsibility performance is regularly evaluated by various rating agencies; the Group maintained its presence among the CAC40 ESG index for the third consecutive year and the DJSI for the 13 consecutive year. Alstom improved is scoring to ECOVADIS questionnaire with a score of 77/100 and kept AA score with MSCI agency. In addition, in 2024, Alstom improved is CDP rating, moving from B to A-. Those results reflect its strong position and strategy on Sustainability.

In addition, Alstom published for the second year European Taxonomy-aligned KPIs about Sales, Capex and Opex, pursuing strong analysis initiated last year. EU Taxonomy-aligned sales amounted to 60% and ranked Alstom among best in class, confirming the importance of the sector in which Alstom operates in achieving the EU's ambition of carbon neutrality by 2050. The EU Taxonomy purpose is to redirect capital flows towards sustainable activities and help navigate transition to a low carbon economy.

The outlook for FY 2024/25 is based on following main assumptions:

Considering the slight dilution from disposals and the revised timing of the impact from industrial optimisation, the Group expects to reach this profitability range in FY 2026/27, versus FY 2025/26 previously.

APPENDIX 4 - NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INDICATORS DEFINITIONS

This section presents financial indicators used by the Group that are not defined by accounting standard setters.

Orders received

A new order is recognised as an order received only when the contract creates enforceable obligations between the Group and its customer. When this condition is met, the order is recognised at the contract value. If the contract is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the reporting unit, the Group requires the immediate elimination of currency exposure using forward currency sales. Orders are then measured using the spot rate at inception of hedging instruments.

Book-to-Bill

The book-to-bill ratio is the ratio of orders received to the amount of sales traded for a specific period.

Gross margin % on backlog

Gross Margin % on backlog is a KPI that presents the expected performance level of firm contracts in backlog. It represents the difference between the sales not yet recognized and the cost of sales not yet incurred from the contracts in backlog. This % is an average of the portfolio of contracts in backlog and is meaningful to project mid- and long-term profitability.

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA is a KPI that presents the level of recurring operational performance. It represents the sales minus the cost of sales, adjusted to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination as well as significant, non-recurring ""one off"" items that are not expected to occur again in subsequent years.

EBIT before PPA

Following the Bombardier Transportation acquisition and with effect from the fiscal year 2021/22 condensed consolidated financial statements, Alstom decided to introduce the ""EBIT before PPA"" KPI aimed at restating its Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (""EBIT"") to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination. This KPI is also aligned with market practice.

Adjusted EBIT

Adjusted EBIT (""aEBIT"") is the Key Performance Indicator to present the level of recurring operational performance. This indicator is also aligned with market practice and comparable to direct competitors.

Starting September 2019, Alstom has opted for the inclusion of the share in net income of the equity-accounted investments into the aEBIT when these are considered to be part of the operating activities of the Group (because there are significant operational flows and/or common project execution with these entities). This mainly includes Chinese joint-ventures, namely CASCO joint-venture for Alstom as well as, following the integration of Bombardier Transportation, Alstom Sifang (Qingdao) Transportation Ltd. (formerly Bombardier Sifang), Bombardier NUG Propulsion System Co. Ltd and Changchun Changke Alstom Railway Vehicles Company Ltd (formerly Changchun Bombardier).

aEBIT corresponds to Earning Before Interests and Tax adjusted for the following elements:

A non-recurring item is a ""one-off"" exceptional item that is not supposed to occur again in following years and that is significant.

Adjusted EBIT margin corresponds to Adjusted EBIT expressed as a percentage of sales.

EBITDA + JV dividends

EBITDA before PPA plus dividends from joint ventures is the EBIT before PPA, before depreciation and amortisation, with the addition of the dividends received from joint ventures.

Adjusted net profit

The ""Adjusted Net Profit"" KPI restates Alstom's net profit from continued operations (Group share) to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination, net of the corresponding tax effect. This indicator is also aligned with market practice.

Free cash flow

Free Cash Flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures including capitalised development costs, net of proceeds from disposals of tangible and intangible assets. Free Cash Flow does not include any proceeds from disposals of activity.

The most directly comparable financial measure to Free Cash Flow calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS is net cash provided by operating activities.

Funds from Operations

Funds from Operations ""FFO"" in the EBIT to FCF statement refers to the Free Cash Flow generated by Operations, before Working Capital variations.

Contract and Trade Working Capital

Contract Working Capital is the sum of:

Trade Working Capital is the Working Capital that is not strictly related to contract. It includes all the elements of the working capital but

Net cash/(debt)

The net cash/(debt) is defined as cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and other current financial asset, less borrowings.

Pay-out ratio

The pay-out ratio is calculated by dividing the amount of the overall dividend with the ""Adjusted Net profit from continuing operations attributable to equity holders of the parent, Group share"" as presented in the management report in the consolidated financial statements.

Organic basis

This press release includes performance indicators presented on a reported basis and on an organic basis. Figures given on an organic basis eliminate the impact of changes in scope of consolidation and changes resulting from the translation of the accounts into Euro following the variation of foreign currencies against the Euro.

The Group uses figures prepared on an organic basis both for internal analysis and for external communication, as it believes they provide means to analyse and explain variations from one period to another. However, these figures are not measurements of performance under IFRS.",marketscreener.com,news,Market Screener,,0.1686274509803922,452842765,8,https://www.marketscreener.com/images/twitter_MS_fdblanc.png,

The backlog reached €92 billion, providing strong visibility on future sales. Gross margin on backlog reached 17.5% as of 31 March 2024, compared to 16.9% on 31 March 2023.

In the fiscal year 2023/24, Alstom's adjusted EBIT was €997 million, up 17%, equivalent to a 5.7% aEBIT margin, and EBIT before PPA was €356 million. Adjusted net profit was €44 million, net income (group share) was €(309) million, and free cash flow was €(557) million for the full year.

On 31 March 2024, the Group's net debt position stood at €(2,994) million, compared to the €(2,135) million the Group reported on 31 March 2023. Alstom benefits from a solid €6.3 billion liquidity position and equity amounting to €8,778 million on 31 March 2024.

The Board of Directors, in its meeting of 7 May 2024, proposed that no dividend will be paid with regards to the fiscal year 2023/24.

""Alstom recorded a strong rebound during the second half of the year, with solid order intake, strong organic growth, improved profitability and €562 million free cash-flow generation. Thanks to the support of our reference shareholders, we will swiftly execute the €2 billion deleveraging plan, allowing for the stabilization of its Investment Grade rating. In April, we announced the sale of Alstom's conventional signalling business in North America at a favourable valuation, demonstrating the quality and attractiveness of the Group's assets. We are confident in the strength of our backlog and our strategy of selectivity and mix evolution towards services. The Group is capitalizing on the solid operational progress made over the last three years and is launching new initiatives to improve its industrial performance and reduce overheads and indirect procurement costs. Altogether, Alstom is now set on stronger foundations to deliver sustainable profit and cash generation."" said Henri Poupart-Lafarge, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Alstom.

Progress on Alstom's action plan to support its financial targets

During the second half of fiscal year 2023/24, the Group mobilised around the operational, commercial, and cost efficiency plan:

The €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan highlighting commitment to Investment Grade

As announced in November 2023 and reiterated in January 2024, Alstom's Board of Directors is committed to a conservative financial policy and to protect the Group's Investment Grade rating, in particular through a ca. €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan.

This plan and its execution, which have been unanimously approved by Alstom's Board of Directors, has the following components:

The ca. €2.4 billion proceeds correspond to ca. €2 billion of deleveraging, mainly due to the hybrid bond's 50% Moody's debt content.

Each of CDPQ and Bpifrance, holding respectively 17.4% and 7.5% of Alstom's capital, has declared to the Company its intention to subscribe for its pro-rata share of the capital increase.

In addition, Alstom has entered into a standby underwriting commitment with BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, J.P. Morgan and Société Générale, acting as Joint Global Coordinators, pursuant to which they have undertaken to underwrite the remainder of the capital raise (i.e. ca. €750 million), subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions precedent.

Circa €1.2 billion of the proceeds of asset disposals and of the capital markets transactions will be used to repay financial debt by September 2024:

The remainder of the proceeds will be invested in highly liquid short-term investment (cash equivalent treatment) and will be earmarked for gross debt reduction at maturity.

Alstom Baa3 long-term issuer rating is reaffirmed, and the outlook will be changed to stable upon successful closing of the hybrid bond issuance and the rights issue.

Alstom will terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following the execution of the deleveraging plan.

During the fiscal year 2023/24, the Group recorded €18.9 billion in orders, with commercial success across multiple geographies, notably in Europe, Asia/Pacific and in Americas. During the last fiscal year, Alstom reported an order intake of €20.7 billion. The (8)% decrease is mostly driven by last year's landmark contract awarded by Landesanstalt Schienenfahrzeuge Baden Württemberg (SFBW) network in Germany of almost €2.5 billion.

In Europe, Alstom recorded €11.3 billion order intake during the fiscal year 2023/24, compared with €12.8 billion over the last fiscal year.

In the U.K, Alstom has signed an eight-year extension to its Train Services Agreement (TSA) with CrossCountry. The contract extension, valued at around €950 million, further secures this long-term partnership and is evidence of the trust placed by the customer.

In France, Alstom will supply île-de-France Mobilités and RATP with 103 new MF19 trainsets, which is the new generation metro on rail, for a total contract value of more than €800 million, 100% financed by Île-de-France Mobilités. This new fleet will replace the existing rolling stock on lines 13, 12 and 8 of the Île-de-France metro as of 2027. The Group also signed a framework contract with Akiem European rolling stock leasing company for 100 Traxx Universal multi-system (MS3) locomotives, together with an initial firm order for 65 locomotives. The total amount of the framework agreement is up €500 million.

In Germany, Alstom was awarded a contract to supply 40 Coradia Stream High-Capacity electric multiple units together with full maintenance for 30 years to Nahverkehrsverbund Schleswig-Holstein (NAH.SH), valued at close to €900 million, and including an option for up to 55 additional trains with a corresponding full-service package. The Group also signed a contract with RAILPOOL for 50 Traxx Universal multi-purpose locomotives.

In Romania, Alstom, as part of a consortium with the civil works companies Gulermak and Arcada, also signed a contract with the Cluj-Napoca City Hall in Romania for the construction of the Cluj-Napoca Metro Line 1.

In Italy, Alstom was awarded a contract for the supply of high-speed trains.

In Americas, Alstom reported €2.0 billion order intake, compared with €2.7 billion over the last fiscal year, driven by a contract with the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) in the United States to deliver 130 full low floor electric streetcars for Philadelphia, valued at over €667 million and with options to build an additional 30 streetcars. And the Group was awarded a contract by the Connecticut Department of Transportation (CTDOT) in the United States to supply 60 single-level rail coach cars valued at approximately €285 million with options to build an additional 313 cars, as part of CTDOT's coach renewal program for its statewide rail system.

In Asia/Pacific, the order intake stood at €3.2 billion, compared to €3.0 billion for the last fiscal year. In the Philippines, Alstom in consortium with Colas Rail has been awarded by Mitsubishi Corporation a contract to provide an integrated railway system for the extension of the North-South Commuter Railway project (NSCR). Alstom's contract share is worth approximately €1 billion. In Australia, Alstom has been awarded a contract worth around €900 million to maintain the regional rolling stock VLocity and Classic fleets in Victoria, Australia for the next decade.

In Africa/Middle East/Central Asia, the Group reported €2.4 billion order intake, compared with €2.2 billion over the last fiscal year. In Israel, Alstom, a member of the TMT Consortium (TLV Metropolitan Tramway Ltd.) and its partners Electra Ltd. & Dan Public Transportation Ltd., have reached financial closure on the contract, awarded in May 2022, to design, build, maintain, and finance the Tel Aviv Metropolitan LRT Green line by Metropolitan Mass Transit System Ltd (NTA). Alstom's share is valued at €858 million. In Saudi Arabia, Alstom signed a contract of over €500 million with The Royal Commission for AlUla (RCU) for AlUla's pioneering battery-powered tramway - the world's longest catenary-free line.

As of 31 March 2024, the backlog stood at €92 billion, providing the Group with strong visibility over future sales.

Alstom's sales amounted to €17.6 billion for the fiscal year 2023/24, representing a growth of 6.7% on a reported basis and a strong 9.4% on an organic basis compared with Alstom sales in the last fiscal year. Sales related to non-performing backlog, corresponding to sales on legacy projects with a negative margin at completion, amounted to €1.7 billion during the fiscal year 2023/24.

Rolling stock sales reached €9.1 billion, representing an increase of 3.9% on a reported basis and 6.5% on an organic basis, driven by contracts ramp-up in France, Belgium and in the US, and the solid level of execution in South Africa, India and Europe.

Services sales stood at €4.3 billion, up 11.9% on a reported basis and 14.3% on an organic basis versus last year, benefiting from the continuous ramp-up in the UK, in Italy and in the US as well as a solid level of execution in Canada.

In Signalling, Alstom reported €2.6 billion sales, up 8.9% on a reported basis and 11.8% on an organic basis versus last year, led by a consistent execution across all regions, mainly in Europe and in APAC.

Systems sales grew 6.9% on a reported basis and 9.3% on an organic basis, and stood at €1.6 billion, driven by a good performance of Turnkey Systems projects in Mexico, Egypt and Canada.

On 14 September 2023, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US department of Treasury added JSC Transmashholding (TMH AO) to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Person (SDN) List. TMH AO is the Russian holding company of TMH Group and is 100% owned by TMH Limited, and Alstom was holding a 20% stake in TMH limited. The Group further assessed potential exposures arising from the new OFAC sanctions and made the decision to sell its stake in TMH. The transaction was closed early January 2024 for an amount of €75 million, carrying value was nil as result of previous impairment, contributing to the de-risking of the company's portfolio.

On 19 April 2024, Alstom announced that it had entered into a binding agreement with Knorr-Bremse AG, to sell Alstom's North American conventional signalling business for a purchase price of around €630 million. Closing of the transaction is only subject to customary conditions, including regulatory approval, and is expected to take place as soon as summer 2024. Proceeds for Alstom at closing, net of expected tax and transaction costs, are expected to be around €620 million.

As of end of March 2024, research and development gross costs amounted to €749 million, i.e. 4.3% of sales, delivering on the Alstom In Motion strategy which is based on three pillars: Autonomous mobility, Data factory and Mobility orchestration. Net R&D amounts to €549 million before PPA amortisation.

Programs funded by IPCEI Hydrogen are ongoing. This important European program supports the development of new hydrogen trains for regional applications, shunting locos and freight, leveraging on the experience collected with Coradia iLint™ regional trains that are now in revenue service.

Homologation tests of Avelia Horizon™ are planned in 2024 to enable a start of revenue service in 2025. The development of international configurations is ongoing. Alstom has launched the development of Avelia stream™ 300, addressing the high-speed single deck segment with a first project for Italy.

The replacement of Adessia™ commuter train has been launched to address the U.K. and USA markets. This new product range will include EMU, BMU, BEMU and HMU versions to also replace the existing Diesel trains.

TRAXX™ Multi-system 3 - locomotives is pursuing homologation tests in 2024 to enable it to run on the different European corridors. It includes the passenger version which can be operated at 200kph.

Services product line is focused on addressing green, sustainable and more efficient operation concepts. Green re-tractioning initiatives include for example the retrofit with hydrogen-fuelled internal combustion engines for locomotives and the ability to provide autonomy for non-electrified lines via the so-called ""Last-mile"" functionality supported by the IPCEI H2 program.

Signalling Product Line worked on Onvia Control™ L2 A and Onvia Control™ L2 B European Standard convergence, driving market presence with its integration into TRAXX platform and securing new contracts for cross border operation, Onvia Cab™ level 2 and level 3 on-board solution together with Automatic Train Operation, and it continued its footprint expansion with a new contract in Canada.

Alstom Innovations cluster continued to develop Autonomous Mobility solutions for Passengers & Freight trains. Major milestones on the roadmap to achieve GoA4 (Grade of Automation 4) have been successfully passed under real mainline operating conditions on passengers and freight train with SNCF in France, and for operation in yard in the Netherlands.

Alstom has also made great strides in developing a new SaaS platform that will enhance its global digital offering. The platform streamlines applications integration and deployment in a trusted and future-proof ecosystem.

The adjusted EBIT margin has progressed from 5.2% over the fiscal year 2022/23 to 5.7% over the fiscal year 2023/24, benefiting from further synergies for 30bps, a steady reduction of non-performing legacy contracts sales for an impact of 30bps, an increased volume and favourable mix delivering 20bps gross margin expansion, partially offset by the negative gross margin impact related to the legacy portfolio deviations for (30)bps.

Alstom recorded restructuring and rationalisation charges of €(147) million mainly related to the reduction of overhead costs for €(115) million (""Autumn"" plan) and adaptation of the production setup for €(32) million, including the United Kingdom for €(14) million, Germany for €(8) million, France for €(3) million, Spain for €(3) million and the U.S.A. for €(2) million.

Costs related to the integration of Bombardier Transportation were recorded for an amount of €(142) million. €(118) million charges were related to some legal proceedings outside the ordinary course of business mainly for two projects - in U.S.A. and in Turkey, and for legal fees in the context of the claim against Bombardier Inc. €(30) million were related to impairment of assets due to the exit from Russia. Other exceptional expenses were recorded for €(73) million, of which €(36) million of consequential impacts from restructuring plan already initiated in Germany.

Alstom's EBIT before amortisation and impairment of assets exclusively valued when determining the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") stood at €356 million. This compares to €366 million for the last fiscal year.

The share in net income from equity investments amounted to €7 million, excluding the amortisation of the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") from Chinese joint ventures of €(10) million.

Adjusted net profit, representing the group's share of net profit from continued operations excluding PPA net of tax, amounts to €44 million for the fiscal year 2023/24. This compares to an adjusted net profit of €292 million during the last fiscal year.

The Group's Net profit/(loss) (Group share) stood at €(309) million for the fiscal year 2023/24, compared to €(132) million last fiscal year.

4. Financial structure

The Group's Free Cash Flow stands at €(557) million for the fiscal year 2023/24 as compared to €199 million during the last fiscal year and €(1,119) million at the first half of fiscal year 2023/24. Cash generation was impacted over the full year by an unfavourable €(856) million change in working capital compared to €(219) million in the last fiscal year; mostly due to change in Trade Working Capital as well as the reversal effect of the change in law on VAT in France for €(380) million. The Contract Working Capital is positively impacted by the acceleration of deliveries from major contracts in the second half of the year, strong collections of down payments as well as reduction of provision for risk on contracts.

On 31 March 2024, the Group recorded a net debt position of €(2,994) million.

In addition to its available cash and cash equivalents, amounting to €976 million on 31 March 2024, the Group benefits from strong liquidity with:

The first facility has two six-month extension options remaining at borrowers' discretion. Alstom will, however, terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following execution of the deleveraging plan.

The last two facilities have been successfully extended by one year. On 31 March 2024, the €1.75 billion RCF line had been drawn down for €175 million, while the other two lines remained undrawn.

As per its conservative liquidity policy, the €2.5 billion Revolving Credit Facility serves as a back-up of the Group €2.5 billion Negotiable European Commercial Papers program in place. With these RCF lines (€175 million drawn on the RCF on 31 March 2024), the €1.03 billion of Neu CP outstanding on 31 March 2024, the Group benefitted from a €6.3 billion liquidity available.

5. One Alstom team - Agile, Inclusive and Responsible

Decarbonization is at the heart of Alstom's strategy. The Group is reducing its Scope 1 & 2 emissions reaching 139 ktonCO2e (representing a 39% decrease compared to March 2022), while collaborating with suppliers and customers on reducing its Scope 3 footprint. First results of this collaboration can be seen through the reduction of emissions intensity of sold product reaching 4.0 gCO2e/pass.km (i.e. (13)% compared to March 2022). Alstom CO2e emissions reduction targets had been validated on the 6 of July 2023 by the independent Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) as in line with requirements to reach Paris Agreement commitments.

The supply of electricity from renewable sources has also been expanded. Alstom signed a significant Power Purchase Agreement focused on solar development in Spain. The solar farm is expected to begin operations early 2025 with a 10-years contract. The project will cover the equivalent of 80% of Alstom's electricity consumption in Europe, so this is a major step in reaching the target of 100% electricity consumption from renewables.

Regarding Diversity & Inclusion, the Alstom in Motion (AiM) 2025 strategy targets to reach 28% of women managers, engineers and professionals' roles by 2025. As of end of March 2024, 24.7% of manager, engineer and professional roles are held by women. Alstom will continue to accelerate its efforts in the coming months.

Alstom's Corporate Social Responsibility performance is regularly evaluated by various rating agencies; the Group maintained its presence among the CAC40 ESG index for the third consecutive year and the DJSI for the 13 consecutive year. Alstom improved is scoring to ECOVADIS questionnaire with a score of 77/100 and kept AA score with MSCI agency. In addition, in 2024, Alstom improved is CDP rating, moving from B to A-. Those results reflect its strong position and strategy on Sustainability.

In addition, Alstom published for the second year European Taxonomy-aligned KPIs about Sales, Capex and Opex, pursuing strong analysis initiated last year. EU Taxonomy-aligned sales amounted to 60% and ranked Alstom among best in class, confirming the importance of the sector in which Alstom operates in achieving the EU's ambition of carbon neutrality by 2050. The EU Taxonomy purpose is to redirect capital flows towards sustainable activities and help navigate transition to a low carbon economy.

The outlook for FY 2024/25 is based on following main assumptions:

FY 2024/25 Outlook:

Considering the slight dilution from disposals and the revised timing of the impact from industrial optimisation, the Group expects to reach this profitability range in FY 2026/27, versus FY 2025/26 previously.

APPENDIX 4 - NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INDICATORS DEFINITIONS

This section presents financial indicators used by the Group that are not defined by accounting standard setters.

Orders received

A new order is recognised as an order received only when the contract creates enforceable obligations between the Group and its customer. When this condition is met, the order is recognised at the contract value. If the contract is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the reporting unit, the Group requires the immediate elimination of currency exposure using forward currency sales. Orders are then measured using the spot rate at inception of hedging instruments.

Book-to-Bill

The book-to-bill ratio is the ratio of orders received to the amount of sales traded for a specific period.

Gross margin % on backlog

Gross Margin % on backlog is a KPI that presents the expected performance level of firm contracts in backlog. It represents the difference between the sales not yet recognized and the cost of sales not yet incurred from the contracts in backlog. This % is an average of the portfolio of contracts in backlog and is meaningful to project mid- and long-term profitability.

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA is a KPI that presents the level of recurring operational performance. It represents the sales minus the cost of sales, adjusted to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination as well as significant, non-recurring ""one off"" items that are not expected to occur again in subsequent years.

EBIT before PPA

Following the Bombardier Transportation acquisition and with effect from the fiscal year 2021/22 condensed consolidated financial statements, Alstom decided to introduce the ""EBIT before PPA"" KPI aimed at restating its Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (""EBIT"") to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination. This KPI is also aligned with market practice.

Adjusted EBIT

Adjusted EBIT (""aEBIT"") is the Key Performance Indicator to present the level of recurring operational performance. This indicator is also aligned with market practice and comparable to direct competitors.

Starting September 2019, Alstom has opted for the inclusion of the share in net income of the equity-accounted investments into the aEBIT when these are considered to be part of the operating activities of the Group (because there are significant operational flows and/or common project execution with these entities). This mainly includes Chinese joint-ventures, namely CASCO joint-venture for Alstom as well as, following the integration of Bombardier Transportation, Alstom Sifang (Qingdao) Transportation Ltd. (formerly Bombardier Sifang), Bombardier NUG Propulsion System Co. Ltd and Changchun Changke Alstom Railway Vehicles Company Ltd (formerly Changchun Bombardier).

aEBIT corresponds to Earning Before Interests and Tax adjusted for the following elements:

A non-recurring item is a ""one-off"" exceptional item that is not supposed to occur again in following years and that is significant.

Adjusted EBIT margin corresponds to Adjusted EBIT expressed as a percentage of sales.

EBITDA + JV dividends

EBITDA before PPA plus dividends from joint ventures is the EBIT before PPA, before depreciation and amortisation, with the addition of the dividends received from joint ventures.

Adjusted net profit

The ""Adjusted Net Profit"" KPI restates Alstom's net profit from continued operations (Group share) to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination, net of the corresponding tax effect. This indicator is also aligned with market practice.

Free cash flow

Free Cash Flow is de?ned as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures including capitalised development costs, net of proceeds from disposals of tangible and intangible assets. Free Cash Flow does not include any proceeds from disposals of activity.

The most directly comparable financial measure to Free Cash Flow calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS is net cash provided by operating activities.

Funds from Operations

Funds from Operations ""FFO"" in the EBIT to FCF statement refers to the Free Cash Flow generated by Operations, before Working Capital variations.

Contract and Trade Working Capital

Contract Working Capital is the sum of:

Trade Working Capital is the Working Capital that is not strictly related to contract. It includes all the elements of the working capital but

Net cash/(debt)

The net cash/(debt) is defined as cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and other current financial asset, less borrowings.

Pay-out ratio

The pay-out ratio is calculated by dividing the amount of the overall dividend with the ""Adjusted Net profit from continuing operations attributable to equity holders of the parent, Group share"" as presented in the management report in the consolidated financial statements.

Organic basis

This press release includes performance indicators presented on a reported basis and on an organic basis. Figures given on an organic basis eliminate the impact of changes in scope of consolidation and changes resulting from the translation of the accounts into Euro following the variation of foreign currencies against the Euro.

The Group uses figures prepared on an organic basis both for internal analysis and for external communication, as it believes they provide means to analyse and explain variations from one period to another. However, these figures are not measurements of performance under IFRS.",finanzen.at,news,finanzen.at,,0.223529411764706,452842634,8,https://www.finanzen.at/Images/FacebookIcon.jpg,eng-9548481

The backlog reached €92 billion, providing strong visibility on future sales. Gross margin on backlog reached 17.5% as of 31 March 2024, compared to 16.9% on 31 March 2023.

In the fiscal year 2023/24, Alstom's adjusted EBIT was €997 million, up 17%, equivalent to a 5.7% aEBIT margin, and EBIT before PPA was €356 million. Adjusted net profit was €44 million, net income (group share) was €(309) million, and free cash flow was €(557) million for the full year.

On 31 March 2024, the Group's net debt position stood at €(2,994) million, compared to the €(2,135) million the Group reported on 31 March 2023. Alstom benefits from a solid €6.3 billion liquidity position and equity amounting to €8,778 million on 31 March 2024.

The Board of Directors, in its meeting of 7 May 2024, proposed that no dividend will be paid with regards to the fiscal year 2023/24.

""Alstom recorded a strong rebound during the second half of the year, with solid order intake, strong organic growth, improved profitability and €562 million free cash-flow generation. Thanks to the support of our reference shareholders, we will swiftly execute the €2 billion deleveraging plan, allowing for the stabilization of its Investment Grade rating. In April, we announced the sale of Alstom's conventional signalling business in North America at a favourable valuation, demonstrating the quality and attractiveness of the Group's assets. We are confident in the strength of our backlog and our strategy of selectivity and mix evolution towards services. The Group is capitalizing on the solid operational progress made over the last three years and is launching new initiatives to improve its industrial performance and reduce overheads and indirect procurement costs. Altogether, Alstom is now set on stronger foundations to deliver sustainable profit and cash generation."" said Henri Poupart-Lafarge, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Alstom.

Progress on Alstom's action plan to support its financial targets

During the second half of fiscal year 2023/24, the Group mobilised around the operational, commercial, and cost efficiency plan:

The €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan highlighting commitment to Investment Grade

As announced in November 2023 and reiterated in January 2024, Alstom's Board of Directors is committed to a conservative financial policy and to protect the Group's Investment Grade rating, in particular through a ca. €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan.

This plan and its execution, which have been unanimously approved by Alstom's Board of Directors, has the following components:

The ca. €2.4 billion proceeds correspond to ca. €2 billion of deleveraging, mainly due to the hybrid bond's 50% Moody's debt content.

Each of CDPQ and Bpifrance, holding respectively 17.4% and 7.5% of Alstom's capital, has declared to the Company its intention to subscribe for its pro-rata share of the capital increase.

In addition, Alstom has entered into a standby underwriting commitment with BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, J.P. Morgan and Société Générale, acting as Joint Global Coordinators, pursuant to which they have undertaken to underwrite the remainder of the capital raise (i.e. ca. €750 million), subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions precedent.

Circa €1.2 billion of the proceeds of asset disposals and of the capital markets transactions will be used to repay financial debt by September 2024:

The remainder of the proceeds will be invested in highly liquid short-term investment (cash equivalent treatment) and will be earmarked for gross debt reduction at maturity.

Alstom Baa3 long-term issuer rating is reaffirmed, and the outlook will be changed to stable upon successful closing of the hybrid bond issuance and the rights issue.

Alstom will terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following the execution of the deleveraging plan.

During the fiscal year 2023/24, the Group recorded €18.9 billion in orders, with commercial success across multiple geographies, notably in Europe, Asia/Pacific and in Americas. During the last fiscal year, Alstom reported an order intake of €20.7 billion. The (8)% decrease is mostly driven by last year's landmark contract awarded by Landesanstalt Schienenfahrzeuge Baden Württemberg (SFBW) network in Germany of almost €2.5 billion.

In Europe, Alstom recorded €11.3 billion order intake during the fiscal year 2023/24, compared with €12.8 billion over the last fiscal year.

In the U.K, Alstom has signed an eight-year extension to its Train Services Agreement (TSA) with CrossCountry. The contract extension, valued at around €950 million, further secures this long-term partnership and is evidence of the trust placed by the customer.

In France, Alstom will supply île-de-France Mobilités and RATP with 103 new MF19 trainsets, which is the new generation metro on rail, for a total contract value of more than €800 million, 100% financed by Île-de-France Mobilités. This new fleet will replace the existing rolling stock on lines 13, 12 and 8 of the Île-de-France metro as of 2027. The Group also signed a framework contract with Akiem European rolling stock leasing company for 100 Traxx Universal multi-system (MS3) locomotives, together with an initial firm order for 65 locomotives. The total amount of the framework agreement is up €500 million.

In Germany, Alstom was awarded a contract to supply 40 Coradia Stream High-Capacity electric multiple units together with full maintenance for 30 years to Nahverkehrsverbund Schleswig-Holstein (NAH.SH), valued at close to €900 million, and including an option for up to 55 additional trains with a corresponding full-service package. The Group also signed a contract with RAILPOOL for 50 Traxx Universal multi-purpose locomotives.

In Romania, Alstom, as part of a consortium with the civil works companies Gulermak and Arcada, also signed a contract with the Cluj-Napoca City Hall in Romania for the construction of the Cluj-Napoca Metro Line 1. Alstom's share of this state-of-the-art turnkey project reaches approximately €400 million.

In Italy, Alstom was awarded a contract for the supply of high-speed trains.

In Americas, Alstom reported €2.0 billion order intake, compared with €2.7 billion over the last fiscal year, driven by a contract with the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) in the United States to deliver 130 full low floor electric streetcars for Philadelphia, valued at over €667 million and with options to build an additional 30 streetcars. And the Group was awarded a contract by the Connecticut Department of Transportation (CTDOT) in the United States to supply 60 single-level rail coach cars valued at approximately €285 million with options to build an additional 313 cars, as part of CTDOT's coach renewal program for its statewide rail system.

In Asia/Pacific, the order intake stood at €3.2 billion, compared to €3.0 billion for the last fiscal year. In the Philippines, Alstom in consortium with Colas Rail has been awarded by Mitsubishi Corporation a contract to provide an integrated railway system for the extension of the North-South Commuter Railway project (NSCR). Alstom's contract share is worth approximately €1 billion. In Australia, Alstom has been awarded a contract worth around €900 million to maintain the regional rolling stock VLocity and Classic fleets in Victoria, Australia for the next decade.

In Africa/Middle East/Central Asia, the Group reported €2.4 billion order intake, compared with €2.2 billion over the last fiscal year. In Israel, Alstom, a member of the TMT Consortium (TLV Metropolitan Tramway Ltd.) and its partners Electra Ltd. & Dan Public Transportation Ltd., have reached financial closure on the contract, awarded in May 2022, to design, build, maintain, and finance the Tel Aviv Metropolitan LRT Green line by Metropolitan Mass Transit System Ltd (NTA). Alstom's share is valued at €858 million. In Saudi Arabia, Alstom signed a contract of over €500 million with The Royal Commission for AlUla (RCU) for AlUla's pioneering battery-powered tramway - the world's longest catenary-free line.

As of 31 March 2024, the backlog stood at €92 billion, providing the Group with strong visibility over future sales.

Alstom's sales amounted to €17.6 billion for the fiscal year 2023/24, representing a growth of 6.7% on a reported basis and a strong 9.4% on an organic basis compared with Alstom sales in the last fiscal year. Sales related to non-performing backlog, corresponding to sales on legacy projects with a negative margin at completion, amounted to €1.7 billion during the fiscal year 2023/24.

Rolling stock sales reached €9.1 billion, representing an increase of 3.9% on a reported basis and 6.5% on an organic basis, driven by contracts ramp-up in France, Belgium and in the US, and the solid level of execution in South Africa, India and Europe.

Services sales stood at €4.3 billion, up 11.9% on a reported basis and 14.3% on an organic basis versus last year, benefiting from the continuous ramp-up in the UK, in Italy and in the US as well as a solid level of execution in Canada.

In Signalling, Alstom reported €2.6 billion sales, up 8.9% on a reported basis and 11.8% on an organic basis versus last year, led by a consistent execution across all regions, mainly in Europe and in APAC.

Systems sales grew 6.9% on a reported basis and 9.3% on an organic basis, and stood at €1.6 billion, driven by a good performance of Turnkey Systems projects in Mexico, Egypt and Canada.

On 14 September 2023, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US department of Treasury added JSC Transmashholding (TMH AO) to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Person (SDN) List. TMH AO is the Russian holding company of TMH Group and is 100% owned by TMH Limited, and Alstom was holding a 20% stake in TMH limited. The Group further assessed potential exposures arising from the new OFAC sanctions and made the decision to sell its stake in TMH. The transaction was closed early January 2024 for an amount of €75 million, carrying value was nil as result of previous impairment, contributing to the de-risking of the company's portfolio.

On 19 April 2024, Alstom announced that it had entered into a binding agreement with Knorr-Bremse AG, to sell Alstom's North American conventional signalling business for a purchase price of around €630 million. Closing of the transaction is only subject to customary conditions, including regulatory approval, and is expected to take place as soon as summer 2024. Proceeds for Alstom at closing, net of expected tax and transaction costs, are expected to be around €620 million.

As of end of March 2024, research and development gross costs amounted to €749 million, i.e. 4.3% of sales, delivering on the Alstom In Motion strategy which is based on three pillars: Autonomous mobility, Data factory and Mobility orchestration. Net R&D amounts to €549 million before PPA amortisation.

Programs funded by IPCEI Hydrogen are ongoing. This important European program supports the development of new hydrogen trains for regional applications, shunting locos and freight, leveraging on the experience collected with Coradia iLint™ regional trains that are now in revenue service.

Homologation tests of Avelia Horizon™ are planned in 2024 to enable a start of revenue service in 2025. The development of international configurations is ongoing. Alstom has launched the development of Avelia stream™ 300, addressing the high-speed single deck segment with a first project for Italy.

The replacement of Adessia™ commuter train has been launched to address the U.K. and USA markets. This new product range will include EMU, BMU, BEMU and HMU versions to also replace the existing Diesel trains.

TRAXX™ Multi-system 3 - locomotives is pursuing homologation tests in 2024 to enable it to run on the different European corridors. It includes the passenger version which can be operated at 200kph.

Services product line is focused on addressing green, sustainable and more efficient operation concepts. Green re-tractioning initiatives include for example the retrofit with hydrogen-fuelled internal combustion engines for locomotives and the ability to provide autonomy for non-electrified lines via the so-called ""Last-mile"" functionality supported by the IPCEI H2 program.

Signalling Product Line worked on Onvia Control™ L2 A and Onvia Control™ L2 B European Standard convergence, driving market presence with its integration into TRAXX platform and securing new contracts for cross border operation, Onvia Cab™ level 2 and level 3 on-board solution together with Automatic Train Operation, and it continued its footprint expansion with a new contract in Canada.

Alstom Innovations cluster continued to develop Autonomous Mobility solutions for Passengers & Freight trains. Major milestones on the roadmap to achieve GoA4 (Grade of Automation 4) have been successfully passed under real mainline operating conditions on passengers and freight train with SNCF in France, and for operation in yard in the Netherlands.

Alstom has also made great strides in developing a new SaaS platform that will enhance its global digital offering. The platform streamlines applications integration and deployment in a trusted and future-proof ecosystem.

The adjusted EBIT margin has progressed from 5.2% over the fiscal year 2022/23 to 5.7% over the fiscal year 2023/24, benefiting from further synergies for 30bps, a steady reduction of non-performing legacy contracts sales for an impact of 30bps, an increased volume and favourable mix delivering 20bps gross margin expansion, partially offset by the negative gross margin impact related to the legacy portfolio deviations for (30)bps.

Alstom recorded restructuring and rationalisation charges of €(147) million mainly related to the reduction of overhead costs for €(115) million (""Autumn"" plan) and adaptation of the production setup for €(32) million, including the United Kingdom for €(14) million, Germany for €(8) million, France for €(3) million, Spain for €(3) million and the U.S.A. for €(2) million.

Costs related to the integration of Bombardier Transportation were recorded for an amount of €(142) million. €(118) million charges were related to some legal proceedings outside the ordinary course of business mainly for two projects - in U.S.A. and in Turkey, and for legal fees in the context of the claim against Bombardier Inc. €(30) million were related to impairment of assets due to the exit from Russia. Other exceptional expenses were recorded for €(73) million, of which €(36) million of consequential impacts from restructuring plan already initiated in Germany.

Alstom's EBIT before amortisation and impairment of assets exclusively valued when determining the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") stood at €356 million. This compares to €366 million for the last fiscal year.

The share in net income from equity investments amounted to €7 million, excluding the amortisation of the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") from Chinese joint ventures of €(10) million.

Adjusted net profit, representing the group's share of net profit from continued operations excluding PPA net of tax, amounts to €44 million for the fiscal year 2023/24. This compares to an adjusted net profit of €292 million during the last fiscal year.

The Group's Net profit/(loss) (Group share) stood at €(309) million for the fiscal year 2023/24, compared to €(132) million last fiscal year.

4. Financial structure

The Group's Free Cash Flow stands at €(557) million for the fiscal year 2023/24 as compared to €199 million during the last fiscal year and €(1,119) million at the first half of fiscal year 2023/24. Cash generation was impacted over the full year by an unfavourable €(856) million change in working capital compared to €(219) million in the last fiscal year; mostly due to change in Trade Working Capital as well as the reversal effect of the change in law on VAT in France for €(380) million. The Contract Working Capital is positively impacted by the acceleration of deliveries from major contracts in the second half of the year, strong collections of down payments as well as reduction of provision for risk on contracts.

On 31 March 2024, the Group recorded a net debt position of €(2,994) million.

In addition to its available cash and cash equivalents, amounting to €976 million on 31 March 2024, the Group benefits from strong liquidity with:

The first facility has two six-month extension options remaining at borrowers' discretion. Alstom will, however, terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following execution of the deleveraging plan.

The last two facilities have been successfully extended by one year. On 31 March 2024, the €1.75 billion RCF line had been drawn down for €175 million, while the other two lines remained undrawn.

As per its conservative liquidity policy, the €2.5 billion Revolving Credit Facility serves as a back-up of the Group €2.5 billion Negotiable European Commercial Papers program in place. With these RCF lines (€175 million drawn on the RCF on 31 March 2024), the €1.03 billion of Neu CP outstanding on 31 March 2024, the Group benefitted from a €6.3 billion liquidity available.

5. One Alstom team - Agile, Inclusive and Responsible

Decarbonization is at the heart of Alstom's strategy. The Group is reducing its Scope 1 & 2 emissions reaching 139 ktonCO2e (representing a 39% decrease compared to March 2022), while collaborating with suppliers and customers on reducing its Scope 3 footprint. First results of this collaboration can be seen through the reduction of emissions intensity of sold product reaching 4.0 gCO2e/pass.km (i.e. (13)% compared to March 2022). Alstom CO2e emissions reduction targets had been validated on the 6 of July 2023 by the independent Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) as in line with requirements to reach Paris Agreement commitments.

The supply of electricity from renewable sources has also been expanded. Alstom signed a significant Power Purchase Agreement focused on solar development in Spain. The solar farm is expected to begin operations early 2025 with a 10-years contract. The project will cover the equivalent of 80% of Alstom's electricity consumption in Europe, so this is a major step in reaching the target of 100% electricity consumption from renewables.

Regarding Diversity & Inclusion, the Alstom in Motion (AiM) 2025 strategy targets to reach 28% of women managers, engineers and professionals' roles by 2025. As of end of March 2024, 24.7% of manager, engineer and professional roles are held by women. Alstom will continue to accelerate its efforts in the coming months.

Alstom's Corporate Social Responsibility performance is regularly evaluated by various rating agencies; the Group maintained its presence among the CAC40 ESG index for the third consecutive year and the DJSI for the 13 consecutive year. Alstom improved is scoring to ECOVADIS questionnaire with a score of 77/100 and kept AA score with MSCI agency. In addition, in 2024, Alstom improved is CDP rating, moving from B to A-. Those results reflect its strong position and strategy on Sustainability.

In addition, Alstom published for the second year European Taxonomy-aligned KPIs about Sales, Capex and Opex, pursuing strong analysis initiated last year. EU Taxonomy-aligned sales amounted to 60% and ranked Alstom among best in class, confirming the importance of the sector in which Alstom operates in achieving the EU's ambition of carbon neutrality by 2050. The EU Taxonomy purpose is to redirect capital flows towards sustainable activities and help navigate transition to a low carbon economy.

The outlook for FY 2024/25 is based on following main assumptions:

FY 2024/25 Outlook:

Considering the slight dilution from disposals and the revised timing of the impact from industrial optimisation, the Group expects to reach this profitability range in FY 2026/27, versus FY 2025/26 previously.

APPENDIX 4 - NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INDICATORS DEFINITIONS

This section presents financial indicators used by the Group that are not defined by accounting standard setters.

Orders received

A new order is recognised as an order received only when the contract creates enforceable obligations between the Group and its customer. When this condition is met, the order is recognised at the contract value. If the contract is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the reporting unit, the Group requires the immediate elimination of currency exposure using forward currency sales. Orders are then measured using the spot rate at inception of hedging instruments.

Book-to-Bill

The book-to-bill ratio is the ratio of orders received to the amount of sales traded for a specific period.

Gross margin % on backlog

Gross Margin % on backlog is a KPI that presents the expected performance level of firm contracts in backlog. It represents the difference between the sales not yet recognized and the cost of sales not yet incurred from the contracts in backlog. This % is an average of the portfolio of contracts in backlog and is meaningful to project mid- and long-term profitability.

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA is a KPI that presents the level of recurring operational performance. It represents the sales minus the cost of sales, adjusted to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination as well as significant, non-recurring ""one off"" items that are not expected to occur again in subsequent years.

EBIT before PPA

Following the Bombardier Transportation acquisition and with effect from the fiscal year 2021/22 condensed consolidated financial statements, Alstom decided to introduce the ""EBIT before PPA"" KPI aimed at restating its Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (""EBIT"") to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination. This KPI is also aligned with market practice.

Adjusted EBIT

Adjusted EBIT (""aEBIT"") is the Key Performance Indicator to present the level of recurring operational performance. This indicator is also aligned with market practice and comparable to direct competitors.

Starting September 2019, Alstom has opted for the inclusion of the share in net income of the equity-accounted investments into the aEBIT when these are considered to be part of the operating activities of the Group (because there are significant operational flows and/or common project execution with these entities). This mainly includes Chinese joint-ventures, namely CASCO joint-venture for Alstom as well as, following the integration of Bombardier Transportation, Alstom Sifang (Qingdao) Transportation Ltd. (formerly Bombardier Sifang), Bombardier NUG Propulsion System Co. Ltd and Changchun Changke Alstom Railway Vehicles Company Ltd (formerly Changchun Bombardier).

aEBIT corresponds to Earning Before Interests and Tax adjusted for the following elements:

A non-recurring item is a ""one-off"" exceptional item that is not supposed to occur again in following years and that is significant.

Adjusted EBIT margin corresponds to Adjusted EBIT expressed as a percentage of sales.

EBITDA + JV dividends

EBITDA before PPA plus dividends from joint ventures is the EBIT before PPA, before depreciation and amortisation, with the addition of the dividends received from joint ventures.

Adjusted net profit

The ""Adjusted Net Profit"" KPI restates Alstom's net profit from continued operations (Group share) to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination, net of the corresponding tax effect. This indicator is also aligned with market practice.

Free cash flow

Free Cash Flow is de?ned as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures including capitalised development costs, net of proceeds from disposals of tangible and intangible assets. Free Cash Flow does not include any proceeds from disposals of activity.

The most directly comparable financial measure to Free Cash Flow calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS is net cash provided by operating activities.

Funds from Operations

Funds from Operations ""FFO"" in the EBIT to FCF statement refers to the Free Cash Flow generated by Operations, before Working Capital variations.

Contract and Trade Working Capital

Contract Working Capital is the sum of:

Trade Working Capital is the Working Capital that is not strictly related to contract. It includes all the elements of the working capital but

Net cash/(debt)

The net cash/(debt) is defined as cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and other current financial asset, less borrowings.

Pay-out ratio

The pay-out ratio is calculated by dividing the amount of the overall dividend with the ""Adjusted Net profit from continuing operations attributable to equity holders of the parent, Group share"" as presented in the management report in the consolidated financial statements.

Organic basis

This press release includes performance indicators presented on a reported basis and on an organic basis. Figures given on an organic basis eliminate the impact of changes in scope of consolidation and changes resulting from the translation of the accounts into Euro following the variation of foreign currencies against the Euro.

The Group uses figures prepared on an organic basis both for internal analysis and for external communication, as it believes they provide means to analyse and explain variations from one period to another. However, these figures are not measurements of performance under IFRS.",finanzen.ch,news,finanzen.ch,,0.223529411764706,452842602,8,https://images.finanzen.net/mediacenter/unsortiert/facebookicon.jpg,

8 May 2024 - Between 1 April 2023 and 31 March 2024, Alstom booked €18.9 billion of orders. Sales were €17.6 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio at 1.1.

The backlog reached €92 billion, providing strong visibility on future sales. Gross margin on backlog reached 17.5% as of 31 March 2024, compared to 16.9% on 31 March 2023.

In the fiscal year 2023/24, Alstom's adjusted EBIT was €997 million, up 17%, equivalent to a 5.7% aEBIT margin, and EBIT before PPA was €356 million. Adjusted net profit was €44 million, net income (group share) was €(309) million, and free cash flow was €(557) million for the full year.

On 31 March 2024, the Group's net debt position stood at €(2,994) million, compared to the €(2,135) million the Group reported on 31 March 2023. Alstom benefits from a solid €6.3 billion liquidity position and equity amounting to €8,778 million on 31 March 2024.

The Board of Directors, in its meeting of 7 May 2024, proposed that no dividend will be paid with regards to the fiscal year 2023/24.

""Alstom recorded a strong rebound during the second half of the year, with solid order intake, strong organic growth, improved profitability and €562 million free cash-flow generation. Thanks to the support of our reference shareholders, we will swiftly execute the €2 billion deleveraging plan, allowing for the stabilization of its Investment Grade rating. In April, we announced the sale of Alstom's conventional signalling business in North America at a favourable valuation, demonstrating the quality and attractiveness of the Group's assets. We are confident in the strength of our backlog and our strategy of selectivity and mix evolution towards services. The Group is capitalizing on the solid operational progress made over the last three years and is launching new initiatives to improve its industrial performance and reduce overheads and indirect procurement costs. Altogether, Alstom is now set on stronger foundations to deliver sustainable profit and cash generation."" said Henri Poupart-Lafarge, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Alstom.

Progress on Alstom's action plan to support its financial targets

During the second half of fiscal year 2023/24, the Group mobilised around the operational, commercial, and cost efficiency plan:

The €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan highlighting commitment to Investment Grade

As announced in November 2023 and reiterated in January 2024, Alstom's Board of Directors is committed to a conservative financial policy and to protect the Group's Investment Grade rating, in particular through a ca. €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan.

This plan and its execution, which have been unanimously approved by Alstom's Board of Directors, has the following components:

The ca. €2.4 billion proceeds correspond to ca. €2 billion of deleveraging, mainly due to the hybrid bond's 50% Moody's debt content.

Each of CDPQ and Bpifrance, holding respectively 17.4% and 7.5% of Alstom's capital, has declared to the Company its intention to subscribe for its pro-rata share of the capital increase.

In addition, Alstom has entered into a standby underwriting commitment with BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, J.P. Morgan and Société Générale, acting as Joint Global Coordinators, pursuant to which they have undertaken to underwrite the remainder of the capital raise (i.e. ca. €750 million), subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions precedent.

Circa €1.2 billion of the proceeds of asset disposals and of the capital markets transactions will be used to repay financial debt by September 2024:

The remainder of the proceeds will be invested in highly liquid short-term investment (cash equivalent treatment) and will be earmarked for gross debt reduction at maturity.

Alstom Baa3 long-term issuer rating is reaffirmed, and the outlook will be changed to stable upon successful closing of the hybrid bond issuance and the rights issue.

Alstom will terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following the execution of the deleveraging plan.

During the fiscal year 2023/24, the Group recorded €18.9 billion in orders, with commercial success across multiple geographies, notably in Europe, Asia/Pacific and in Americas. During the last fiscal year, Alstom reported an order intake of €20.7 billion. The (8)% decrease is mostly driven by last year's landmark contract awarded by Landesanstalt Schienenfahrzeuge Baden Württemberg (SFBW) network in Germany of almost €2.5 billion.

In Europe, Alstom recorded €11.3 billion order intake during the fiscal year 2023/24, compared with €12.8 billion over the last fiscal year.

In the U.K, Alstom has signed an eight-year extension to its Train Services Agreement (TSA) with CrossCountry. The contract extension, valued at around €950 million, further secures this long-term partnership and is evidence of the trust placed by the customer.

In France, Alstom will supply île-de-France Mobilités and RATP with 103 new MF19 trainsets, which is the new generation metro on rail, for a total contract value of more than €800 million, 100% financed by Île-de-France Mobilités. This new fleet will replace the existing rolling stock on lines 13, 12 and 8 of the Île-de-France metro as of 2027. The Group also signed a framework contract with Akiem European rolling stock leasing company for 100 Traxx Universal multi-system (MS3) locomotives, together with an initial firm order for 65 locomotives. The total amount of the framework agreement is up €500 million.

In Germany, Alstom was awarded a contract to supply 40 Coradia Stream High-Capacity electric multiple units together with full maintenance for 30 years to Nahverkehrsverbund Schleswig-Holstein (NAH.SH), valued at close to €900 million, and including an option for up to 55 additional trains with a corresponding full-service package. The Group also signed a contract with RAILPOOL for 50 Traxx Universal multi-purpose locomotives.

In Romania, Alstom, as part of a consortium with the civil works companies Gulermak and Arcada, also signed a contract with the Cluj-Napoca City Hall in Romania for the construction of the Cluj-Napoca Metro Line 1. Alstom's share of this state-of-the-art turnkey project reaches approximately €400 million.

In Italy, Alstom was awarded a contract for the supply of high-speed trains.

In Americas, Alstom reported €2.0 billion order intake, compared with €2.7 billion over the last fiscal year, driven by a contract with the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) in the United States to deliver 130 full low floor electric streetcars for Philadelphia, valued at over €667 million and with options to build an additional 30 streetcars. And the Group was awarded a contract by the Connecticut Department of Transportation (CTDOT) in the United States to supply 60 single-level rail coach cars valued at approximately €285 million with options to build an additional 313 cars, as part of CTDOT's coach renewal program for its statewide rail system.

In Asia/Pacific, the order intake stood at €3.2 billion, compared to €3.0 billion for the last fiscal year. In the Philippines, Alstom in consortium with Colas Rail has been awarded by Mitsubishi Corporation a contract to provide an integrated railway system for the extension of the North-South Commuter Railway project (NSCR). Alstom's contract share is worth approximately €1 billion. In Australia, Alstom has been awarded a contract worth around €900 million to maintain the regional rolling stock VLocity and Classic fleets in Victoria, Australia for the next decade.

In Africa/Middle East/Central Asia, the Group reported €2.4 billion order intake, compared with €2.2 billion over the last fiscal year. In Israel, Alstom, a member of the TMT Consortium (TLV Metropolitan Tramway Ltd.) and its partners Electra Ltd. & Dan Public Transportation Ltd., have reached financial closure on the contract, awarded in May 2022, to design, build, maintain, and finance the Tel Aviv Metropolitan LRT Green line by Metropolitan Mass Transit System Ltd (NTA). Alstom's share is valued at €858 million. In Saudi Arabia, Alstom signed a contract of over €500 million with The Royal Commission for AlUla (RCU) for AlUla's pioneering battery-powered tramway - the world's longest catenary-free line.

As of 31 March 2024, the backlog stood at €92 billion, providing the Group with strong visibility over future sales.

Alstom's sales amounted to €17.6 billion for the fiscal year 2023/24, representing a growth of 6.7% on a reported basis and a strong 9.4% on an organic basis compared with Alstom sales in the last fiscal year. Sales related to non-performing backlog, corresponding to sales on legacy projects with a negative margin at completion, amounted to €1.7 billion during the fiscal year 2023/24.

Rolling stock sales reached €9.1 billion, representing an increase of 3.9% on a reported basis and 6.5% on an organic basis, driven by contracts ramp-up in France, Belgium and in the US, and the solid level of execution in South Africa, India and Europe.

Services sales stood at €4.3 billion, up 11.9% on a reported basis and 14.3% on an organic basis versus last year, benefiting from the continuous ramp-up in the UK, in Italy and in the US as well as a solid level of execution in Canada.

In Signalling, Alstom reported €2.6 billion sales, up 8.9% on a reported basis and 11.8% on an organic basis versus last year, led by a consistent execution across all regions, mainly in Europe and in APAC.

Systems sales grew 6.9% on a reported basis and 9.3% on an organic basis, and stood at €1.6 billion, driven by a good performance of Turnkey Systems projects in Mexico, Egypt and Canada.

On 14 September 2023, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US department of Treasury added JSC Transmashholding (TMH AO) to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Person (SDN) List. TMH AO is the Russian holding company of TMH Group and is 100% owned by TMH Limited, and Alstom was holding a 20% stake in TMH limited. The Group further assessed potential exposures arising from the new OFAC sanctions and made the decision to sell its stake in TMH. The transaction was closed early January 2024 for an amount of €75 million, carrying value was nil as result of previous impairment, contributing to the de-risking of the company's portfolio.

On 19 April 2024, Alstom announced that it had entered into a binding agreement with Knorr-Bremse AG, to sell Alstom's North American conventional signalling business for a purchase price of around €630 million. Closing of the transaction is only subject to customary conditions, including regulatory approval, and is expected to take place as soon as summer 2024. Proceeds for Alstom at closing, net of expected tax and transaction costs, are expected to be around €620 million.

As of end of March 2024, research and development gross costs amounted to €749 million, i.e. 4.3% of sales, delivering on the Alstom In Motion strategy which is based on three pillars: Autonomous mobility, Data factory and Mobility orchestration. Net R&D amounts to €549 million before PPA amortisation.

Programs funded by IPCEI Hydrogen are ongoing. This important European program supports the development of new hydrogen trains for regional applications, shunting locos and freight, leveraging on the experience collected with Coradia iLint™ regional trains that are now in revenue service.

Homologation tests of Avelia Horizon™ are planned in 2024 to enable a start of revenue service in 2025. The development of international configurations is ongoing. Alstom has launched the development of Avelia stream™ 300, addressing the high-speed single deck segment with a first project for Italy.

The replacement of Adessia™ commuter train has been launched to address the U.K. and USA markets. This new product range will include EMU, BMU, BEMU and HMU versions to also replace the existing Diesel trains.

TRAXX™ Multi-system 3 - locomotives is pursuing homologation tests in 2024 to enable it to run on the different European corridors. It includes the passenger version which can be operated at 200kph.

Services product line is focused on addressing green, sustainable and more efficient operation concepts. Green re-tractioning initiatives include for example the retrofit with hydrogen-fuelled internal combustion engines for locomotives and the ability to provide autonomy for non-electrified lines via the so-called ""Last-mile"" functionality supported by the IPCEI H2 program.

Signalling Product Line worked on Onvia Control™ L2 A and Onvia Control™ L2 B European Standard convergence, driving market presence with its integration into TRAXX platform and securing new contracts for cross border operation, Onvia Cab™ level 2 and level 3 on-board solution together with Automatic Train Operation, and it continued its footprint expansion with a new contract in Canada.

Alstom Innovations cluster continued to develop Autonomous Mobility solutions for Passengers & Freight trains. Major milestones on the roadmap to achieve GoA4 (Grade of Automation 4) have been successfully passed under real mainline operating conditions on passengers and freight train with SNCF in France, and for operation in yard in the Netherlands.

Alstom has also made great strides in developing a new SaaS platform that will enhance its global digital offering. The platform streamlines applications integration and deployment in a trusted and future-proof ecosystem.

The adjusted EBIT margin has progressed from 5.2% over the fiscal year 2022/23 to 5.7% over the fiscal year 2023/24, benefiting from further synergies for 30bps, a steady reduction of non-performing legacy contracts sales for an impact of 30bps, an increased volume and favourable mix delivering 20bps gross margin expansion, partially offset by the negative gross margin impact related to the legacy portfolio deviations for (30)bps.

Alstom recorded restructuring and rationalisation charges of €(147) million mainly related to the reduction of overhead costs for €(115) million (""Autumn"" plan) and adaptation of the production setup for €(32) million, including the United Kingdom for €(14) million, Germany for €(8) million, France for €(3) million, Spain for €(3) million and the U.S.A. for €(2) million.

Costs related to the integration of Bombardier Transportation were recorded for an amount of €(142) million. €(118) million charges were related to some legal proceedings outside the ordinary course of business mainly for two projects - in U.S.A. and in Turkey, and for legal fees in the context of the claim against Bombardier Inc. €(30) million were related to impairment of assets due to the exit from Russia. Other exceptional expenses were recorded for €(73) million, of which €(36) million of consequential impacts from restructuring plan already initiated in Germany.

Alstom's EBIT before amortisation and impairment of assets exclusively valued when determining the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") stood at €356 million. This compares to €366 million for the last fiscal year.

The share in net income from equity investments amounted to €7 million, excluding the amortisation of the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") from Chinese joint ventures of €(10) million.

Adjusted net profit, representing the group's share of net profit from continued operations excluding PPA net of tax, amounts to €44 million for the fiscal year 2023/24. This compares to an adjusted net profit of €292 million during the last fiscal year.

The Group's Net profit/(loss) (Group share) stood at €(309) million for the fiscal year 2023/24, compared to €(132) million last fiscal year.

4. Financial structure

The Group's Free Cash Flow stands at €(557) million for the fiscal year 2023/24 as compared to €199 million during the last fiscal year and €(1,119) million at the first half of fiscal year 2023/24. Cash generation was impacted over the full year by an unfavourable €(856) million change in working capital compared to €(219) million in the last fiscal year; mostly due to change in Trade Working Capital as well as the reversal effect of the change in law on VAT in France for €(380) million. The Contract Working Capital is positively impacted by the acceleration of deliveries from major contracts in the second half of the year, strong collections of down payments as well as reduction of provision for risk on contracts.

On 31 March 2024, the Group recorded a net debt position of €(2,994) million.

In addition to its available cash and cash equivalents, amounting to €976 million on 31 March 2024, the Group benefits from strong liquidity with:

The first facility has two six-month extension options remaining at borrowers' discretion. Alstom will, however, terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following execution of the deleveraging plan.

The last two facilities have been successfully extended by one year. On 31 March 2024, the €1.75 billion RCF line had been drawn down for €175 million, while the other two lines remained undrawn.

As per its conservative liquidity policy, the €2.5 billion Revolving Credit Facility serves as a back-up of the Group €2.5 billion Negotiable European Commercial Papers program in place. With these RCF lines (€175 million drawn on the RCF on 31 March 2024), the €1.03 billion of Neu CP outstanding on 31 March 2024, the Group benefitted from a €6.3 billion liquidity available.

5. One Alstom team - Agile, Inclusive and Responsible

Decarbonization is at the heart of Alstom's strategy. The Group is reducing its Scope 1 & 2 emissions reaching 139 ktonCO2e (representing a 39% decrease compared to March 2022), while collaborating with suppliers and customers on reducing its Scope 3 footprint. First results of this collaboration can be seen through the reduction of emissions intensity of sold product reaching 4.0 gCO2e/pass.km (i.e. (13)% compared to March 2022). Alstom CO2e emissions reduction targets had been validated on the 6 of July 2023 by the independent Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) as in line with requirements to reach Paris Agreement commitments.

The supply of electricity from renewable sources has also been expanded. Alstom signed a significant Power Purchase Agreement focused on solar development in Spain. The solar farm is expected to begin operations early 2025 with a 10-years contract. The project will cover the equivalent of 80% of Alstom's electricity consumption in Europe, so this is a major step in reaching the target of 100% electricity consumption from renewables.

Regarding Diversity & Inclusion, the Alstom in Motion (AiM) 2025 strategy targets to reach 28% of women managers, engineers and professionals' roles by 2025. As of end of March 2024, 24.7% of manager, engineer and professional roles are held by women. Alstom will continue to accelerate its efforts in the coming months.

Alstom's Corporate Social Responsibility performance is regularly evaluated by various rating agencies; the Group maintained its presence among the CAC40 ESG index for the third consecutive year and the DJSI for the 13 consecutive year. Alstom improved is scoring to ECOVADIS questionnaire with a score of 77/100 and kept AA score with MSCI agency. In addition, in 2024, Alstom improved is CDP rating, moving from B to A-. Those results reflect its strong position and strategy on Sustainability.

In addition, Alstom published for the second year European Taxonomy-aligned KPIs about Sales, Capex and Opex, pursuing strong analysis initiated last year. EU Taxonomy-aligned sales amounted to 60% and ranked Alstom among best in class, confirming the importance of the sector in which Alstom operates in achieving the EU's ambition of carbon neutrality by 2050. The EU Taxonomy purpose is to redirect capital flows towards sustainable activities and help navigate transition to a low carbon economy.

The outlook for FY 2024/25 is based on following main assumptions:

FY 2024/25 Outlook:

Considering the slight dilution from disposals and the revised timing of the impact from industrial optimisation, the Group expects to reach this profitability range in FY 2026/27, versus FY 2025/26 previously.

APPENDIX 4 - NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INDICATORS DEFINITIONS

This section presents financial indicators used by the Group that are not defined by accounting standard setters.

Orders received

A new order is recognised as an order received only when the contract creates enforceable obligations between the Group and its customer. When this condition is met, the order is recognised at the contract value. If the contract is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the reporting unit, the Group requires the immediate elimination of currency exposure using forward currency sales. Orders are then measured using the spot rate at inception of hedging instruments.

Book-to-Bill

The book-to-bill ratio is the ratio of orders received to the amount of sales traded for a specific period.

Gross margin % on backlog

Gross Margin % on backlog is a KPI that presents the expected performance level of firm contracts in backlog. It represents the difference between the sales not yet recognized and the cost of sales not yet incurred from the contracts in backlog. This % is an average of the portfolio of contracts in backlog and is meaningful to project mid- and long-term profitability.

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA is a KPI that presents the level of recurring operational performance. It represents the sales minus the cost of sales, adjusted to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination as well as significant, non-recurring ""one off"" items that are not expected to occur again in subsequent years.

EBIT before PPA

Following the Bombardier Transportation acquisition and with effect from the fiscal year 2021/22 condensed consolidated financial statements, Alstom decided to introduce the ""EBIT before PPA"" KPI aimed at restating its Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (""EBIT"") to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination. This KPI is also aligned with market practice.

Adjusted EBIT

Adjusted EBIT (""aEBIT"") is the Key Performance Indicator to present the level of recurring operational performance. This indicator is also aligned with market practice and comparable to direct competitors.

Starting September 2019, Alstom has opted for the inclusion of the share in net income of the equity-accounted investments into the aEBIT when these are considered to be part of the operating activities of the Group (because there are significant operational flows and/or common project execution with these entities). This mainly includes Chinese joint-ventures, namely CASCO joint-venture for Alstom as well as, following the integration of Bombardier Transportation, Alstom Sifang (Qingdao) Transportation Ltd. (formerly Bombardier Sifang), Bombardier NUG Propulsion System Co. Ltd and Changchun Changke Alstom Railway Vehicles Company Ltd (formerly Changchun Bombardier).

aEBIT corresponds to Earning Before Interests and Tax adjusted for the following elements:

A non-recurring item is a ""one-off"" exceptional item that is not supposed to occur again in following years and that is significant.

Adjusted EBIT margin corresponds to Adjusted EBIT expressed as a percentage of sales.

EBITDA + JV dividends

EBITDA before PPA plus dividends from joint ventures is the EBIT before PPA, before depreciation and amortisation, with the addition of the dividends received from joint ventures.

Adjusted net profit

The ""Adjusted Net Profit"" KPI restates Alstom's net profit from continued operations (Group share) to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination, net of the corresponding tax effect. This indicator is also aligned with market practice.

Free cash flow

Free Cash Flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures including capitalised development costs, net of proceeds from disposals of tangible and intangible assets. Free Cash Flow does not include any proceeds from disposals of activity.

The most directly comparable financial measure to Free Cash Flow calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS is net cash provided by operating activities.

Funds from Operations

Funds from Operations ""FFO"" in the EBIT to FCF statement refers to the Free Cash Flow generated by Operations, before Working Capital variations.

Contract and Trade Working Capital

Contract Working Capital is the sum of:

Trade Working Capital is the Working Capital that is not strictly related to contract. It includes all the elements of the working capital but

Net cash/(debt)

The net cash/(debt) is defined as cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and other current financial asset, less borrowings.

Pay-out ratio

The pay-out ratio is calculated by dividing the amount of the overall dividend with the ""Adjusted Net profit from continuing operations attributable to equity holders of the parent, Group share"" as presented in the management report in the consolidated financial statements.

Organic basis

This press release includes performance indicators presented on a reported basis and on an organic basis. Figures given on an organic basis eliminate the impact of changes in scope of consolidation and changes resulting from the translation of the accounts into Euro following the variation of foreign currencies against the Euro.

The Group uses figures prepared on an organic basis both for internal analysis and for external communication, as it believes they provide means to analyse and explain variations from one period to another. However, these figures are not measurements of performance under IFRS.",streetinsider.com,news,StreetInsider.com,,0.1607843137254903,452842387,8,http://www.streetinsider.com/images/silogo-new.png,eng-9548481

Sales were €17.6 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio at 1.1.

The backlog reached €92 billion, providing strong visibility on future sales. Gross margin on backlog reached 17.5% as of 31 March 2024, compared to 16.9% on 31 March 2023.

In the fiscal year 2023/24, Alstom's adjusted EBIT was €997 million, up 17%, equivalent to a 5.7% aEBIT margin, and EBIT before PPA was €356 million. Adjusted net profit was €44 million, net income (group share) was €(309) million, and free cash flow was €(557) million for the full year.

On 31 March 2024, the Group's net debt position stood at €(2,994) million, compared to the €(2,135) million the Group reported on 31 March 2023. Alstom benefits from a solid €6.3 billion liquidity position and equity amounting to €8,778 million on 31 March 2024.

The Board of Directors, in its meeting of 7 May 2024, proposed that no dividend will be paid with regards to the fiscal year 2023/24.

""Alstom recorded a strong rebound during the second half of the year, with solid order intake, strong organic growth, improved profitability and €562 million free cash-flow generation. Thanks to the support of our reference shareholders, we will swiftly execute the €2 billion deleveraging plan, allowing for the stabilization of its Investment Grade rating. In April, we announced the sale of Alstom's conventional signalling business in North America at a favourable valuation, demonstrating the quality and attractiveness of the Group's assets. We are confident in the strength of our backlog and our strategy of selectivity and mix evolution towards services. The Group is capitalizing on the solid operational progress made over the last three years and is launching new initiatives to improve its industrial performance and reduce overheads and indirect procurement costs. Altogether, Alstom is now set on stronger foundations to deliver sustainable profit and cash generation."" said Henri Poupart-Lafarge, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Alstom.

During the second half of fiscal year 2023/24, the Group mobilised around the operational, commercial, and cost efficiency plan:

As announced in November 2023 and reiterated in January 2024, Alstom's Board of Directors is committed to a conservative financial policy and to protect the Group's Investment Grade rating, in particular through a ca. €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan.

This plan and its execution, which have been unanimously approved by Alstom's Board of Directors, has the following components:

The ca. €2.4 billion proceeds correspond to ca. €2 billion of deleveraging, mainly due to the hybrid bond's 50% Moody's debt content.

Each of CDPQ[6] and Bpifrance, holding respectively 17.4% and 7.5% of Alstom's capital, has declared to the Company its intention to subscribe for its pro-rata share of the capital increase.

In addition, Alstom has entered into a standby underwriting commitment with BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, J.P. Morgan and Société Générale, acting as Joint Global Coordinators, pursuant to which they have undertaken to underwrite the remainder of the capital raise (i.e. ca. €750 million), subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions precedent.

Circa €1.2 billion of the proceeds of asset disposals and of the capital markets transactions will be used to repay financial debt by September 2024:

The remainder of the proceeds will be invested in highly liquid short-term investment (cash equivalent treatment) and will be earmarked for gross debt reduction at maturity.

Alstom Baa3 long-term issuer rating is reaffirmed, and the outlook will be changed to stable upon successful closing of the hybrid bond issuance and the rights issue.

Alstom will terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following the execution of the deleveraging plan.

***

During the fiscal year 2023/24, the Group recorded €18.9 billion in orders, with commercial success across multiple geographies, notably in Europe, Asia/Pacific and in Americas. During the last fiscal year, Alstom reported an order intake of €20.7 billion. The (8)% decrease is mostly driven by last year's landmark contract awarded by Landesanstalt Schienenfahrzeuge Baden Württemberg (SFBW) network in Germany of almost €2.5 billion.

In Europe, Alstom recorded €11.3 billion order intake during the fiscal year 2023/24, compared with €12.8 billion over the last fiscal year.

In the U.K, Alstom has signed an eight-year extension to its Train Services Agreement (TSA) with CrossCountry. The contract extension, valued at around €950 million, further secures this long-term partnership and is evidence of the trust placed by the customer.

In France, Alstom will supply île-de-France Mobilités and RATP with 103 new MF19 trainsets, which is the new generation metro on rail, for a total contract value of more than €800 million, 100% financed by Île-de-France Mobilités. This new fleet will replace the existing rolling stock on lines 13, 12 and 8 of the Île-de-France metro as of 2027. The Group also signed a framework contract with Akiem European rolling stock leasing company for 100 Traxx Universal multi-system (MS3) locomotives, together with an initial firm order for 65 locomotives. The total amount of the framework agreement is up €500 million.

Alstom's contract share is worth approximately €1 billion. In Australia, Alstom has been awarded a contract worth around €900 million to maintain the regional rolling stock VLocity and Classic fleets in Victoria, Australia for the next decade.

In Africa/Middle East/Central Asia, the Group reported €2.4 billion order intake, compared with €2.2 billion over the last fiscal year. In Israel, Alstom, a member of the TMT Consortium (TLV Metropolitan Tramway Ltd.) and its partners Electra Ltd. & Dan Public Transportation Ltd., have reached financial closure on the contract, awarded in May 2022, to design, build, maintain, and finance the Tel Aviv Metropolitan LRT Green line by Metropolitan Mass Transit System Ltd (NTA). Alstom's share is valued at €858 million. In Saudi Arabia, Alstom signed a contract of over €500 million with The Royal Commission for AlUla (RCU) for AlUla's pioneering battery-powered tramway - the world's longest catenary-free line.

As of 31 March 2024, the backlog stood at €92 billion, providing the Group with strong visibility over future sales.

Alstom's sales amounted to €17.6 billion for the fiscal year 2023/24, representing a growth of 6.7% on a reported basis and a strong 9.4% on an organic basis compared with Alstom sales in the last fiscal year. Sales related to non-performing backlog, corresponding to sales on legacy projects with a negative margin at completion, amounted to €1.7 billion during the fiscal year 2023/24.

Rolling stock sales reached €9.1 billion, representing an increase of 3.9% on a reported basis and 6.5% on an organic basis, driven by contracts ramp-up in France, Belgium and in the US, and the solid level of execution in South Africa, India and Europe.

Services sales stood at €4.3 billion, up 11.9% on a reported basis and 14.3% on an organic basis versus last year, benefiting from the continuous ramp-up in the UK, in Italy and in the US as well as a solid level of execution in Canada.

Systems sales grew 6.9% on a reported basis and 9.3% on an organic basis, and stood at €1.6 billion, driven by a good performance of Turnkey Systems projects in Mexico, Egypt and Canada.

On 14 September 2023, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US department of Treasury added JSC Transmashholding (TMH AO) to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Person (SDN) List. TMH AO is the Russian holding company of TMH Group and is 100% owned by TMH Limited, and Alstom was holding a 20% stake in TMH limited. The Group further assessed potential exposures arising from the new OFAC sanctions and made the decision to sell its stake in TMH. The transaction was closed early January 2024 for an amount of €75 million, carrying value was nil as result of previous impairment, contributing to the de-risking of the company's portfolio.

On 19 April 2024, Alstom announced that it had entered into a binding agreement with Knorr-Bremse AG, to sell Alstom's North American conventional signalling business for a purchase price of around €630 million. Closing of the transaction is only subject to customary conditions, including regulatory approval, and is expected to take place as soon as summer 2024. Proceeds for Alstom at closing, net of expected tax and transaction costs, are expected to be around €620 million.

***

As of end of March 2024, research and development gross costs amounted to €749 million, i.e. 4.3% of sales, delivering on the Alstom In Motion strategy which is based on three pillars: Autonomous mobility, Data factory and Mobility orchestration. Net R&D amounts to €549 million before PPA amortisation.

Programs funded by IPCEI Hydrogen are ongoing. This important European program supports the development of new hydrogen trains for regional applications, shunting locos and freight, leveraging on the experience collected with Coradia iLint™ regional trains that are now in revenue service.

Homologation tests of Avelia Horizon™ are planned in 2024 to enable a start of revenue service in 2025. The development of international configurations is ongoing. Alstom has launched the development of Avelia Stream™ 300, addressing the high-speed single deck segment with a first project for Italy.

The replacement of Adessia™ commuter train has been launched to address the U.K. and USA markets. This new product range will include EMU, BMU, BEMU and HMU versions to also replace the existing Diesel trains.

Traxx™ Multi-system 3 - locomotives is pursuing homologation tests in 2024 to enable it to run on the different European corridors. It includes the passenger version which can be operated at 200kph.

Services product line is focused on addressing green, sustainable and more efficient operation concepts. Green re-tractioning initiatives include for example the retrofit with hydrogen-fuelled internal combustion engines for locomotives and the ability to provide autonomy for non-electrified lines via the so-called ""Last-mile"" functionality supported by the IPCEI H2 program.

Signalling Product Line worked on Onvia Control™ L2 A and Onvia Control™ L2 B European Standard convergence, driving market presence with its integration into TRAXX platform and securing new contracts for cross border operation, Onvia Cab™ level 2 and level 3 on-board solution together with Automatic Train Operation, and it continued its footprint expansion with a new contract in Canada.

Alstom Innovations cluster continued to develop Autonomous Mobility solutions for Passengers & Freight trains. Major milestones on the roadmap to achieve GoA4 (Grade of Automation 4) have been successfully passed under real mainline operating conditions on passengers and freight train with SNCF in France, and for operation in yard in the Netherlands.

Alstom has also made great strides in developing a new SaaS platform that will enhance its global digital offering. The platform streamlines applications integration and deployment in a trusted and future-proof ecosystem.

The adjusted EBIT margin has progressed from 5.2% over the fiscal year 2022/23 to 5.7% over the fiscal year 2023/24, benefiting from further synergies for 30bps, a steady reduction of non-performing legacy contracts sales for an impact of 30bps, an increased volume and favourable mix delivering 20bps gross margin expansion, partially offset by the negative gross margin impact related to the legacy portfolio deviations for (30)bps.

Alstom recorded restructuring and rationalisation charges of €(147) million mainly related to the reduction of overhead costs for €(115) million (""Autumn"" plan) and adaptation of the production setup for €(32) million, including the United Kingdom for €(14) million, Germany for €(8) million, France for €(3) million, Spain for €(3) million and the U.S.A. for €(2) million.

Costs related to the integration of Bombardier Transportation were recorded for an amount of €(142) million. €(118) million charges were related to some legal proceedings outside the ordinary course of business mainly for two projects - in U.S.A. and in Turkey, and for legal fees in the context of the claim against Bombardier Inc. €(30) million were related to impairment of assets due to the exit from Russia. Other exceptional expenses were recorded for €(73) million, of which €(36) million of consequential impacts from restructuring plan already initiated in Germany.

Alstom's EBIT before amortisation and impairment of assets exclusively valued when determining the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") stood at €356 million. This compares to €366 million for the last fiscal year.

The share in net income from equity investments amounted to €7 million, excluding the amortisation of the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") from Chinese joint ventures of €(10) million.

Adjusted net profit, representing the group's share of net profit from continued operations excluding PPA net of tax, amounts to €44 million for the fiscal year 2023/24. This compares to an adjusted net profit of €292 million during the last fiscal year.

The Group's Net profit/(loss) (Group share) stood at €(309) million for the fiscal year 2023/24, compared to €(132) million last fiscal year.

***

The Group's Free Cash Flow stands at €(557) million for the fiscal year 2023/24 as compared to €199 million during the last fiscal year and €(1,119) million at the first half of fiscal year 2023/24. Cash generation was impacted over the full year by an unfavourable €(856) million change in working capital compared to €(219) million in the last fiscal year; mostly due to change in Trade Working Capital as well as the reversal effect of the change in law on VAT in France for €(380) million. The Contract Working Capital is positively impacted by the acceleration of deliveries from major contracts in the second half of the year, strong collections of down payments as well as reduction of provision for risk on contracts.

On 31 March 2024, the Group recorded a net debt position of €(2,994) million.

In addition to its available cash and cash equivalents, amounting to €976 million on 31 March 2024, the Group benefits from strong liquidity with:

The first facility has two six-month extension options remaining at borrowers' discretion. Alstom will, however, terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following execution of the deleveraging plan.

The last two facilities have been successfully extended by one year. On 31 March 2024, the €1.75 billion RCF line had been drawn down for €175 million, while the other two lines remained undrawn.

As per its conservative liquidity policy, the €2.5 billion Revolving Credit Facility serves as a back-up of the Group €2.5 billion Negotiable European Commercial Papers program in place. With these RCF lines (€175 million drawn on the RCF on 31 March 2024), the €1.03 billion of Neu CP outstanding on 31 March 2024, the Group benefitted from a €6.3 billion liquidity available.

***

Decarbonization is at the heart of Alstom's strategy. The Group is reducing its Scope 1 & 2 emissions reaching 139 ktonCO2e (representing a 39% decrease compared to March 2022), while collaborating with suppliers and customers on reducing its Scope 3 footprint. First results of this collaboration can be seen through the reduction of emissions intensity of sold product reaching 4.0 gCO2e/pass.km (i.e. (13)% compared to March 2022). Alstom CO2e emissions reduction targets had been validated on the 6 of July 2023 by the independent Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) as in line with requirements to reach Paris Agreement commitments.

The supply of electricity from renewable sources has also been expanded. Alstom signed a significant Power Purchase Agreement focused on solar development in Spain. The solar farm is expected to begin operations early 2025 with a 10-years contract. The project will cover the equivalent of 80% of Alstom's electricity consumption in Europe, so this is a major step in reaching the target of 100% electricity consumption from renewables.

Regarding Diversity & Inclusion, the Alstom in Motion (AiM) 2025 strategy targets to reach 28% of women managers, engineers and professionals' roles by 2025. As of end of March 2024, 24.7% of manager, engineer and professional roles are held by women. Alstom will continue to accelerate its efforts in the coming months.

Alstom's Corporate Social Responsibility performance is regularly evaluated by various rating agencies; the Group maintained its presence among the CAC40 ESG index for the third consecutive year and the DJSI for the 13 consecutive year. Alstom improved is scoring to ECOVADIS questionnaire with a score of 77/100 and kept AA score with MSCI agency. In addition, in 2024, Alstom improved is CDP rating, moving from B to A-. Those results reflect its strong position and strategy on Sustainability.

In addition, Alstom published for the second year European Taxonomy-aligned KPIs about Sales, Capex and Opex, pursuing strong analysis initiated last year. EU Taxonomy-aligned sales amounted to 60% and ranked Alstom among best in class, confirming the importance of the sector in which Alstom operates in achieving the EU's ambition of carbon neutrality by 2050. The EU Taxonomy purpose is to redirect capital flows towards sustainable activities and help navigate transition to a low carbon economy.

***

The outlook for FY 2024/25 is based on following main assumptions:

Considering the slight dilution from disposals and the revised timing of the impact from industrial optimisation, the Group expects to reach this profitability range in FY 2026/27, versus FY 2025/26 previously.

APPENDIX 4 - NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INDICATORS DEFINITIONS

This section presents financial indicators used by the Group that are not defined by accounting standard setters.

Orders received

A new order is recognised as an order received only when the contract creates enforceable obligations between the Group and its customer. When this condition is met, the order is recognised at the contract value. If the contract is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the reporting unit, the Group requires the immediate elimination of currency exposure using forward currency sales. Orders are then measured using the spot rate at inception of hedging instruments.

Book-to-Bill

The book-to-bill ratio is the ratio of orders received to the amount of sales traded for a specific period.

Gross margin % on backlog

Gross Margin % on backlog is a KPI that presents the expected performance level of firm contracts in backlog. It represents the difference between the sales not yet recognized and the cost of sales not yet incurred from the contracts in backlog. This % is an average of the portfolio of contracts in backlog and is meaningful to project mid- and long-term profitability.

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA is a KPI that presents the level of recurring operational performance. It represents the sales minus the cost of sales, adjusted to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination as well as significant, non-recurring ""one off"" items that are not expected to occur again in subsequent years.

EBIT before PPA

Following the Bombardier Transportation acquisition and with effect from the fiscal year 2021/22 condensed consolidated financial statements, Alstom decided to introduce the ""EBIT before PPA"" KPI aimed at restating its Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (""EBIT"") to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination. This KPI is also aligned with market practice.

Adjusted EBIT

Adjusted EBIT (""aEBIT"") is the Key Performance Indicator to present the level of recurring operational performance. This indicator is also aligned with market practice and comparable to direct competitors.

Starting September 2019, Alstom has opted for the inclusion of the share in net income of the equity-accounted investments into the aEBIT when these are considered to be part of the operating activities of the Group (because there are significant operational flows and/or common project execution with these entities). This mainly includes Chinese joint-ventures, namely CASCO joint-venture for Alstom as well as, following the integration of Bombardier Transportation, Alstom Sifang (Qingdao) Transportation Ltd. (formerly Bombardier Sifang), Bombardier NUG Propulsion System Co. Ltd and Changchun Changke Alstom Railway Vehicles Company Ltd (formerly Changchun Bombardier).

aEBIT corresponds to Earning Before Interests and Tax adjusted for the following elements:

A non-recurring item is a ""one-off"" exceptional item that is not supposed to occur again in following years and that is significant.

Adjusted EBIT margin corresponds to Adjusted EBIT expressed as a percentage of sales.

EBITDA + JV dividends

EBITDA before PPA plus dividends from joint ventures is the EBIT before PPA, before depreciation and amortisation, with the addition of the dividends received from joint ventures.

Adjusted net profit

The ""Adjusted Net Profit"" KPI restates Alstom's net profit from continued operations (Group share) to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination, net of the corresponding tax effect. This indicator is also aligned with market practice.

Free cash flow

Free Cash Flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures including capitalised development costs, net of proceeds from disposals of tangible and intangible assets. Free Cash Flow does not include any proceeds from disposals of activity.

The most directly comparable financial measure to Free Cash Flow calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS is net cash provided by operating activities.

Funds from Operations

Funds from Operations ""FFO"" in the EBIT to FCF statement refers to the Free Cash Flow generated by Operations, before Working Capital variations.

Trade Working Capital is the Working Capital that is not strictly related to contract. It includes all the elements of the working capital but

Net cash/(debt)

The net cash/(debt) is defined as cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and other current financial asset, less borrowings.

Pay-out ratio

The pay-out ratio is calculated by dividing the amount of the overall dividend with the ""Adjusted Net profit from continuing operations attributable to equity holders of the parent, Group share"" as presented in the management report in the consolidated financial statements.

Organic basis

This press release includes performance indicators presented on a reported basis and on an organic basis. Figures given on an organic basis eliminate the impact of changes in scope of consolidation and changes resulting from the translation of the accounts into Euro following the variation of foreign currencies against the Euro.

The Group uses figures prepared on an organic basis both for internal analysis and for external communication, as it believes they provide means to analyse and explain variations from one period to another. However, these figures are not measurements of performance under IFRS.

Editorial credit: Wafa

In the early morning of Friday 12 April, an incident occurred in the occupied West Bank. Benjamin Achimeir, a 14-year-old Israeli teenager, went missing while tending to a flock of sheep near his family's illegal settlement, the 2015-established ""Malachei Hashalom"". [1]

ContentsWhatsApp used to co-ordinate ""collective punishment""Achimeir's death taken as basis for mass killings and destructionZionist forces aided settler attacks with protection, intelligence, and active supportAnalysisAlso read

The disappearance of the boy, which was initially suspected to be a kidnapping, prompted an extensive search involving Israeli authorities, the military, and numerous settlers.

However, it took 24 hours before Achimeir's body was discovered near the ""outpost"", signalling the start of a sequence of events that would lead to a deadly escalation of violence. [2]

WhatsApp used to co-ordinate ""collective punishment""

Israeli authorities state that Achimeir was killed on that particular morning, although it took some time for his body to be found. They inaccurately concluded that he was killed in a ""terror attack"". [1]

Simultaneously, disturbing messages started circulating within settler WhatsApp groups, encouraging retaliatory attacks on neighbouring Palestinian villages.

These messages, originating from individuals with extreme views, promoted activities such as obstructing villages, conducting house-to-house searches, and imposing collective penalties on Palestinians.

One such message, attributed to the terrorist Elisha Yered -- a former spokesman for MP Limor Son Har-Melech and extreme settler suspected in the murder of a Palestinian man last August -- called for ""crowning"" nearby Palestinian villages. [3]

In addition, he urged fellow occupiers to conduct ""home to home searches,"" and impose ""collective punishment against the murderous Arab population."" [3]

This message contained a list of meeting points, some of which were marked with fire emojis, indicating potential targets for violence. [4]

Achimeir's death taken as basis for mass killings and destruction

The response to Achimeir's death was immediate and brutal.

In the following days, settlers carried out shooting and arson attacks against Palestinian neighbourhoods. Homes were set ablaze, cars were set on fire, and lives were lost.

According to Palestinian officials and witnesses, the attacks were highly organised and targeted specific individuals and groups near the illegal settler community.

In al-Mughayyir village, which is close to Achimeir's ""outpost"", residents said they were pelted with stones, burned cars, and shot at by armed settlers as they tried to defend their homes. [3]

A BBC report noted that construction worker Abdellatif Abu Aliya's house was stormed by settlers. They damaged his property and killed his cousin, Jihad.

''The settlers cut the electricity to the house and drained the property's water tanks by shooting them.

""Jihad, who had come to defend the house, threw rocks back from the roof towards the settlers. But the settlers returned gunfire, killing Jihad with a shot to the head.'' [3]

In other villages, similar scenes played out, with innocent Palestinian families caught in the middle of settler reprisals.

50-year-old Shehade Abu Rasheed's family suffered attacks on their home. His daughter, Noor, was shot twice in the legs while seeking refuge with her wounded mother. [3]

Another young villager, 17-year-old Yaqoub Nasan, was shot multiple times in the neck while he was unarmed. [3]

According to the Palestinian Health Ministry, 32 people in al-Mughayyir were wounded by gunfire. By Saturday afternoon, after the body of Achimeir was discovered, two more Palestinians had been killed. In property damage, more than 20 houses and 100 vehicles had been set ablaze. [3]

Zionist forces aided settler attacks with protection, intelligence, and active support

In the wake of the violence, lives were lost, houses were destroyed, and entire communities were traumatised.

At the same time, the Israeli regime came under criticism for its failure to prevent the violence and to hold the perpetrators of the attacks accountable. In addition, some of the attacks were unsurprisingly carried out by soldiers of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). [5]

According to one family's video, armed settlers were seen walking around their property before the attack began. At least two of them were wearing what appear to be IDF uniforms.

Abu Aliya said,

""They worked in groups and were following orders from two men, one in uniform and one not. They covered their faces, then one group came forward to throw rocks and set fire to the cars.

""Another group stood at the edge of the property with pistols. Behind them was a group with M16s who fired at the house from the olive groves."" [3]

The involvement of soldiers in some of the attacks, which were witnessed by the villagers and recorded on video, has added to the complexity of the situation.

But as the dust begins to settle in the wake of these terrible events, it is essential that the voices of the victims must not be silenced.

The Palestinian villagers who have suffered the most from settler violence deserve recognition and assistance as they begin to rebuild their lives after what they have endured.

Similarly, justice and human rights advocates who are fighting for peace and reconciliation must continue to stand up against Israel's terrorism against the Palestinian people.

Analysis ANALYSIS Shaheer Choudhury Head of Editorial

Pay attention to the entire Palestinian cause!

Over the past (nearly) eight months, the world has taken a painstaking amount of time to recognise the true situation in the Gaza Strip.

In that time, the Zionist entity has been unleashing untold mayhem upon the Palestinians, with tens of thousands of women and children killed under the pretext of eliminating Hamas.

Arguably, this is one of the most foolish positions that an authoritarian, oppressive, occupying power has ever held in recent history. One cannot simply eradicate the hearts and minds that yearn to resist occupation and that understand defeat is not in the least in the loss of people or property.

Imagine if the situation was reversed

Our role as Muslims in the West must be to continue to speak out about the situation of the whole of Palestine, all of the occupied territories, all of those who we know to be languishing behind bars, and all of those who have gone missing.

Illegal settlers -- such as those who responded with barbarism to the death of one boy -- question why Palestinian resistance fighters are determined to protect their homeland, but they will never see how the situation is many times worse for them.

It is not right that Benjamin Achimeir has been killed -- according to Israeli sources, by a Palestinian hand -- but this level of response is a microcosm of what the Zionist regime has been doing in Gaza.

And this is while vast parts of Palestine are illegally occupied, have been occupied, and more areas are being stolen as we speak. The international community recognises the illegality, and yet barely anything is mentioned about such cases.

The governor of kentucky declared a state of emergency early this morning, citing multiple reports of wind damage and tornadoes. Now, forecasters say the greatest risk for weather will shift to the east today, with severe storms expected anywhere from alabama as far as new york city. Strong winds and heavy rain pounded the coastal regions of bangladesh and india as a severe cyclone made landfall. Millions of people are without electricity after a power poles fell and trees were uprooted by gusty winds. Dozens of bangladeshi villages were flooded after a flood protection. Embankments either washed away or were damaged by the storm surge. Nearly 800,000 people had been evacuated from vulnerable areas in bangladesh on sunday. The india meteorological department says the storm is likely to weaken further throughout the day, but warns heavy showers will remain over the next two days. 12 people were injured by severe turbulence on a qatar airways flight from doha to dublin. It happened while flying over turkey. The plane, a boeing 787 dreamliner, still managed to land safely as scheduled, but passengers on board say the turbulence lasted less than 20s and occurred during food and drink service. This incident follows similarly severe turbulence on a singapore airlines flight nearly a week ago, where dozens of passengers were injured and a man died of a suspected heart attack.

Progress on Alstom's action plan to support its financial targets

During the second half of fiscal year 2023/24, the Group mobilised around the operational, commercial, and cost efficiency plan:

Quality of order intake during the second half provides comfort in continuing to grow the margin in backlog: +60bps in FY 2023/24 versus last year, and expected +50bps per year in the coming three yearsIn FY 2023/24, Alstom continued to ramp-up production rates, delivering 4,645 cars, compared to 4,151 in 2022/23Supply chain efficiencies allowed to decrease inventory days since 30 September 2023Costs efficiency programs now launched across overheads and indirect procurement, with notably the aim to reduce SG&A over sales by ca. 1pp over three years vs FY 2022/23.

The €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan highlighting commitment to Investment Grade

As announced in November 2023 and reiterated in January 2024, Alstom's Board of Directors is committed to a conservative financial policy and to protect the Group's Investment Grade rating, in particular through a ca. €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan.

This plan and its execution, which have been unanimously approved by Alstom's Board of Directors, has the following components:

Divestments for ca. €700 million:Sale of TMH for €75 million realized in January 2024The announced sale of conventional signalling business in North America to Knorr-Bremse AG, which will generate proceeds of ca. €630 million upon closing expected during Summer 2024The issuance of hybrid bonds with 50% equity content for Moody's5 in an amount of ca. €750 million to be executed no later than September 2024 subject to market conditions and AMF approvalA capital increase with preferential subscription rights in an amount of ca. €1 billion to be executed no later than September 2024 subject to market conditions and AMF approval

The ca. €2.4 billion proceeds correspond to ca. €2 billion of deleveraging, mainly due to the hybrid bond's 50% Moody's debt content.

Each of CDPQ6 and Bpifrance, holding respectively 17.4% and 7.5% of Alstom's capital, has declared to the Company its intention to subscribe for its pro-rata share of the capital increase.

In addition, Alstom has entered into a standby underwriting commitment with BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, J.P. Morgan and Société Générale, acting as Joint Global Coordinators, pursuant to which they have undertaken to underwrite the remainder of the capital raise (i.e. ca. €750 million), subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions precedent.

Circa €1.2 billion of the proceeds of asset disposals and of the capital markets transactions will be used to repay financial debt by September 2024:

repayment of Neu CP by €1,033 million repayment of RCF drawings by €175 million

The remainder of the proceeds will be invested in highly liquid short-term investment (cash equivalent treatment) and will be earmarked for gross debt reduction at maturity.

Alstom Baa3 long-term issuer rating is reaffirmed, and the outlook will be changed to stable upon successful closing of the hybrid bond issuance and the rights issue.

Alstom will terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following the execution of the deleveraging plan.

Business update

Growth by offering greater value to customersOrders

During the fiscal year 2023/24, the Group recorded €18.9 billion in orders, with commercial success across multiple geographies, notably in Europe, Asia/Pacific and in Americas. During the last fiscal year, Alstom reported an order intake of €20.7 billion. The (8)% decrease is mostly driven by last year's landmark contract awarded by Landesanstalt Schienenfahrzeuge Baden Württemberg (SFBW) network in Germany of almost €2.5 billion.

In Europe, Alstom recorded €11.3 billion order intake during the fiscal year 2023/24, compared with €12.8 billion over the last fiscal year.

In the U.K, Alstom has signed an eight-year extension to its Train Services Agreement (TSA) with CrossCountry. The contract extension, valued at around €950 million, further secures this long-term partnership and is evidence of the trust placed by the customer.

In France, Alstom will supply île-de-France Mobilités and RATP with 103 new MF19 trainsets, which is the new generation metro on rail, for a total contract value of more than €800 million, 100% financed by Île-de-France Mobilités. This new fleet will replace the existing rolling stock on lines 13, 12 and 8 of the Île-de-France metro as of 2027. The Group also signed a framework contract with Akiem European rolling stock leasing company for 100 TraxxTM Universal multi-system (MS3) locomotives, together with an initial firm order for 65 locomotives. The total amount of the framework agreement is up €500 million.

In Germany, Alstom was awarded a contract to supply 40 Coradia StreamTM High-Capacity electric multiple units together with full maintenance for 30 years to Nahverkehrsverbund Schleswig-Holstein (NAH.SH), valued at close to €900 million, and including an option for up to 55 additional trains with a corresponding full-service package. The Group also signed a contract with RAILPOOL for 50 TraxxTM Universal multi-purpose locomotives.

In Romania, Alstom, as part of a consortium with the civil works companies Gulermak and Arcada, also signed a contract with the Cluj-Napoca City Hall in Romania for the construction of the Cluj-Napoca Metro Line 1. Alstom's share of this state-of-the-art turnkey project reaches approximately €400 million.

In Italy, Alstom was awarded a contract for the supply of high-speed trains.

In Americas, Alstom reported €2.0 billion order intake, compared with €2.7 billion over the last fiscal year, driven by a contract with the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) in the United States to deliver 130 full low floor electric streetcars for Philadelphia, valued at over €667 million and with options to build an additional 30 streetcars. And the Group was awarded a contract by the Connecticut Department of Transportation (CTDOT) in the United States to supply 60 single-level rail coach cars valued at approximately €285 million with options to build an additional 313 cars, as part of CTDOT's coach renewal program for its statewide rail system.

In Asia/Pacific, the order intake stood at €3.2 billion, compared to €3.0 billion for the last fiscal year. In the Philippines, Alstom in consortium with Colas Rail has been awarded by Mitsubishi Corporation a contract to provide an integrated railway system for the extension of the North-South Commuter Railway project (NSCR). Alstom's contract share is worth approximately €1 billion. In Australia, Alstom has been awarded a contract worth around €900 million to maintain the regional rolling stock VLocity and Classic fleets in Victoria, Australia for the next decade.

In Africa/Middle East/Central Asia, the Group reported €2.4 billion order intake, compared with €2.2 billion over the last fiscal year. In Israel, Alstom, a member of the TMT Consortium (TLV Metropolitan Tramway Ltd.) and its partners Electra Ltd. & Dan Public Transportation Ltd., have reached financial closure on the contract, awarded in May 2022, to design, build, maintain, and finance the Tel Aviv Metropolitan LRT Green line by Metropolitan Mass Transit System Ltd (NTA). Alstom's share is valued at €858 million. In Saudi Arabia, Alstom signed a contract of over €500 million with The Royal Commission for AlUla (RCU) for AlUla's pioneering battery-powered tramway - the world's longest catenary-free line.

As of 31 March 2024, the backlog stood at €92 billion, providing the Group with strong visibility over future sales.

Sales

Alstom's sales amounted to €17.6 billion for the fiscal year 2023/24, representing a growth of 6.7% on a reported basis and a strong 9.4% on an organic basis compared with Alstom sales in the last fiscal year. Sales related to non-performing backlog, corresponding to sales on legacy projects with a negative margin at completion, amounted to €1.7 billion during the fiscal year 2023/24.

Rolling stock sales reached €9.1 billion, representing an increase of 3.9% on a reported basis and 6.5% on an organic basis, driven by contracts ramp-up in France, Belgium and in the US, and the solid level of execution in South Africa, India and Europe.

Services sales stood at €4.3 billion, up 11.9% on a reported basis and 14.3% on an organic basis versus last year, benefiting from the continuous ramp-up in the UK, in Italy and in the US as well as a solid level of execution in Canada.

In Signalling, Alstom reported €2.6 billion sales, up 8.9% on a reported basis and 11.8% on an organic basis versus last year, led by a consistent execution across all regions, mainly in Europe and in APAC.

Systems sales grew 6.9% on a reported basis and 9.3% on an organic basis, and stood at €1.6 billion, driven by a good performance of Turnkey Systems projects in Mexico, Egypt and Canada.

Divestments

On 14 September 2023, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US department of Treasury added JSC Transmashholding (TMH AO) to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Person (SDN) List. TMH AO is the Russian holding company of TMH Group and is 100% owned by TMH Limited, and Alstom was holding a 20% stake in TMH limited. The Group further assessed potential exposures arising from the new OFAC sanctions and made the decision to sell its stake in TMH. The transaction was closed early January 2024 for an amount of €75 million, carrying value was nil as result of previous impairment, contributing to the de-risking of the company's portfolio.

On 19 April 2024, Alstom announced that it had entered into a binding agreement with Knorr-Bremse AG, to sell Alstom's North American conventional signalling business for a purchase price of around €630 million. Closing of the transaction is only subject to customary conditions, including regulatory approval, and is expected to take place as soon as summer 2024. Proceeds for Alstom at closing, net of expected tax and transaction costs, are expected to be around €620 million.

2.Innovation by Pioneering Smarter and Greener Mobility for All

As of end of March 2024, research and development gross costs amounted to €749 million, i.e. 4.3% of sales, delivering on the Alstom In Motion strategy which is based on three pillars: Autonomous mobility, Data factory and Mobility orchestration. Net R&D amounts to €549 million before PPA amortisation.

Programs funded by IPCEI Hydrogen are ongoing. This important European program supports the development of new hydrogen trains for regional applications, shunting locos and freight, leveraging on the experience collected with Coradia iLint regional trains that are now in revenue service.

Homologation tests of Avelia Horizon are planned in 2024 to enable a start of revenue service in 2025. The development of international configurations is ongoing. Alstom has launched the development of Avelia stream 300, addressing the high-speed single deck segment with a first project for Italy.

The replacement of Adessia commuter train has been launched to address the U.K. and USA markets. This new product range will include EMU, BMU, BEMU and HMU versions to also replace the existing Diesel trains.

TRAXX Multi-system 3 - locomotives is pursuing homologation tests in 2024 to enable it to run on the different European corridors. It includes the passenger version which can be operated at 200kph.

Services product line is focused on addressing green, sustainable and more efficient operation concepts. Green re-tractioning initiatives include for example the retrofit with hydrogen-fuelled internal combustion engines for locomotives and the ability to provide autonomy for non-electrified lines via the so-called ""Last-mile"" functionality supported by the IPCEI H2 program.

Signalling Product Line worked on Onvia Control L2 A and Onvia Control L2 B European Standard convergence, driving market presence with its integration into TRAXX platform and securing new contracts for cross border operation, Onvia Cab level 2 and level 3 on-board solution together with Automatic Train Operation, and it continued its footprint expansion with a new contract in Canada.

Alstom Innovations cluster continued to develop Autonomous Mobility solutions for Passengers & Freight trains. Major milestones on the roadmap to achieve GoA4 (Grade of Automation 4) have been successfully passed under real mainline operating conditions on passengers and freight train with SNCF in France, and for operation in yard in the Netherlands.

Alstom has also made great strides in developing a new SaaS platform that will enhance its global digital offering. The platform streamlines applications integration and deployment in a trusted and future-proof ecosystem.

3.Profitability

The adjusted EBIT margin has progressed from 5.2% over the fiscal year 2022/23 to 5.7% over the fiscal year 2023/24, benefiting from further synergies for 30bps, a steady reduction of non-performing legacy contracts sales for an impact of 30bps, an increased volume and favourable mix delivering 20bps gross margin expansion, partially offset by the negative gross margin impact related to the legacy portfolio deviations for (30)bps.

Alstom recorded restructuring and rationalisation charges of €(147) million mainly related to the reduction of overhead costs for €(115) million (""Autumn"" plan) and adaptation of the production setup for €(32) million, including the United Kingdom for €(14) million, Germany for €(8) million, France for €(3) million, Spain for €(3) million and the U.S.A. for €(2) million.

Costs related to the integration of Bombardier Transportation were recorded for an amount of €(142) million. €(118) million charges were related to some legal proceedings outside the ordinary course of business mainly for two projects - in U.S.A. and in Turkey, and for legal fees in the context of the claim against Bombardier Inc. €(30) million were related to impairment of assets due to the exit from Russia. Other exceptional expenses were recorded for €(73) million, of which €(36) million of consequential impacts from restructuring plan already initiated in Germany.

Alstom's EBIT before amortisation and impairment of assets exclusively valued when determining the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") stood at €356 million. This compares to €366 million for the last fiscal year.

The share in net income from equity investments amounted to €7 million, excluding the amortisation of the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") from Chinese joint ventures of €(10) million.

Adjusted net profit, representing the group's share of net profit from continued operations excluding PPA net of tax, amounts to €44 million for the fiscal year 2023/24. This compares to an adjusted net profit of €292 million during the last fiscal year.

The Group's Net profit/(loss) (Group share) stood at €(309) million for the fiscal year 2023/24, compared to €(132) million last fiscal year.

***

4.Financial structure

The Group's Free Cash Flow stands at €(557) million for the fiscal year 2023/24 as compared to €199 million during the last fiscal year and €(1,119) million at the first half of fiscal year 2023/24. Cash generation was impacted over the full year by an unfavourable €(856) million change in working capital compared to €(219) million in the last fiscal year; mostly due to change in Trade Working Capital as well as the reversal effect of the change in law on VAT in France for €(380) million. The Contract Working Capital is positively impacted by the acceleration of deliveries from major contracts in the second half of the year, strong collections of down payments as well as reduction of provision for risk on contracts.

On 31 March 2024, the Group recorded a net debt position of €(2,994) million.

In addition to its available cash and cash equivalents, amounting to €976 million on 31 March 2024, the Group benefits from strong liquidity with:

€2.25 billion Revolving Credit Facility maturing in October 2024;€1.75 billion Revolving Credit Facility maturing in January 2027;€2.5 billion Revolving Credit Facility maturing in January 2029.

The first facility has two six-month extension options remaining at borrowers' discretion. Alstom will, however, terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following execution of the deleveraging plan.

The last two facilities have been successfully extended by one year. On 31 March 2024, the €1.75 billion RCF line had been drawn down for €175 million, while the other two lines remained undrawn.

As per its conservative liquidity policy, the €2.5 billion Revolving Credit Facility serves as a back-up of the Group €2.5 billion Negotiable European Commercial Papers program in place. With these RCF lines (€175 million drawn on the RCF on 31 March 2024), the €1.03 billion of Neu CP outstanding on 31 March 2024, the Group benefitted from a €6.3 billion liquidity available.

5.One Alstom team - Agile, Inclusive and Responsible

Decarbonization is at the heart of Alstom's strategy. The Group is reducing its Scope 1 & 2 emissions reaching 139 ktonCO2e (representing a 39% decrease compared to March 2022), while collaborating with suppliers and customers on reducing its Scope 3 footprint. First results of this collaboration can be seen through the reduction of emissions intensity of sold product reaching 4.0 gCO2e/pass.km (i.e. (13)% compared to March 2022). Alstom CO2e emissions reduction targets had been validated on the 6th of July 2023 by the independent Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) as in line with requirements to reach Paris Agreement commitments.

The supply of electricity from renewable sources has also been expanded. Alstom signed a significant Power Purchase Agreement focused on solar development in Spain. The solar farm is expected to begin operations early 2025 with a 10-years contract. The project will cover the equivalent of 80% of Alstom's electricity consumption in Europe, so this is a major step in reaching the target of 100% electricity consumption from renewables.

Regarding Diversity & Inclusion, the Alstom in Motion (AiM) 2025 strategy targets to reach 28% of women managers, engineers and professionals' roles by 2025. As of end of March 2024, 24.7% of manager, engineer and professional roles are held by women. Alstom will continue to accelerate its efforts in the coming months.

Alstom's Corporate Social Responsibility performance is regularly evaluated by various rating agencies; the Group maintained its presence among the CAC40 ESG index for the third consecutive year and the DJSI for the 13th consecutive year. Alstom improved is scoring to ECOVADIS questionnaire with a score of 77/100 and kept AA score with MSCI agency. In addition, in 2024, Alstom improved is CDP rating, moving from B to A-. Those results reflect its strong position and strategy on Sustainability.

In addition, Alstom published for the second year European Taxonomy-aligned KPIs about Sales, Capex and Opex, pursuing strong analysis initiated last year. EU Taxonomy-aligned sales amounted to 60% and ranked Alstom among best in class, confirming the importance of the sector in which Alstom operates in achieving the EU's ambition of carbon neutrality by 2050. The EU Taxonomy purpose is to redirect capital flows towards sustainable activities and help navigate transition to a low carbon economy.

***

Mid to long-term ambitions

The Group's ambition is to deliver around 5% average sales growth over the mid to long term, thanks to a book-to-bill above 1, largely driven by Services, Signalling and Systems product lines. Rolling stock is expected to grow above market rate, Services and Signalling at high-single digit rates and Systems at double digit rates.

On profitability, Alstom's ambition is to consistently deliver an adjusted EBIT margin between 8% and 10% over the mid to long term. This improvement from 5.7% in fiscal year 2023/24 will be driven by:

Continuous improvement of gross margin in backlog thanks to quality order intake and completion of legacy projects.Improved execution through operational excellence initiatives and industrial optimisation.Cost efficiency programs across indirect procurement and overheads.

Considering the slight dilution from disposals and the revised timing of the impact from industrial optimisation, the Group expects to reach this profitability range in FY 2026/27, versus FY 2025/26 previously.

Free Cash Flow:Alstom expects free cash flow conversion to trend towards 100% of adjusted net income over the cycle. Yearly performance is subject to short-term working capital volatility, notably from the phasing of downpayments.Over the next three years, the Group expects to deliver at least €1.5 billion in free cash-flow over FY 2024/25 to FY 2026/27, despite Contract Working Capital being a headwind over that period.

APPENDIX 4 - NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INDICATORS DEFINITIONS

This section presents financial indicators used by the Group that are not defined by accounting standard setters.

Orders received

A new order is recognised as an order received only when the contract creates enforceable obligations between the Group and its customer. When this condition is met, the order is recognised at the contract value. If the contract is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the reporting unit, the Group requires the immediate elimination of currency exposure using forward currency sales. Orders are then measured using the spot rate at inception of hedging instruments.

Book-to-Bill

The book-to-bill ratio is the ratio of orders received to the amount of sales traded for a specific period.

Gross margin % on backlog

Gross Margin % on backlog is a KPI that presents the expected performance level of firm contracts in backlog. It represents the difference between the sales not yet recognized and the cost of sales not yet incurred from the contracts in backlog. This % is an average of the portfolio of contracts in backlog and is meaningful to project mid- and long-term profitability.

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA is a KPI that presents the level of recurring operational performance. It represents the sales minus the cost of sales, adjusted to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination as well as significant, non-recurring ""one off"" items that are not expected to occur again in subsequent years.

EBIT before PPA

Following the Bombardier Transportation acquisition and with effect from the fiscal year 2021/22 condensed consolidated financial statements, Alstom decided to introduce the ""EBIT before PPA"" KPI aimed at restating its Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (""EBIT"") to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination. This KPI is also aligned with market practice.

Adjusted EBIT

Adjusted EBIT (""aEBIT"") is the Key Performance Indicator to present the level of recurring operational performance. This indicator is also aligned with market practice and comparable to direct competitors.

Starting September 2019, Alstom has opted for the inclusion of the share in net income of the equity-accounted investments into the aEBIT when these are considered to be part of the operating activities of the Group (because there are significant operational flows and/or common project execution with these entities). This mainly includes Chinese joint-ventures, namely CASCO joint-venture for Alstom as well as, following the integration of Bombardier Transportation, Alstom Sifang (Qingdao) Transportation Ltd. (formerly Bombardier Sifang), Bombardier NUG Propulsion System Co. Ltd and Changchun Changke Alstom Railway Vehicles Company Ltd (formerly Changchun Bombardier).

aEBIT corresponds to Earning Before Interests and Tax adjusted for the following elements:

net restructuring expenses (including rationalization costs)tangibles and intangibles impairmentcapital gains or loss/revaluation on investments disposals or controls changes of an entityany other non-recurring items, such as some costs incurred to realize business combinations and amortization of an asset exclusively valued in the context of business combination, as well as litigation costs that have arisen outside the ordinary course of businessand including the share in net income of the operational equity-accounted investments

A non-recurring item is a ""one-off"" exceptional item that is not supposed to occur again in following years and that is significant.

Adjusted EBIT margin corresponds to Adjusted EBIT expressed as a percentage of sales.

EBITDA + JV dividends

EBITDA before PPA plus dividends from joint ventures is the EBIT before PPA, before depreciation and amortisation, with the addition of the dividends received from joint ventures.

Adjusted net profit

The ""Adjusted Net Profit"" KPI restates Alstom's net profit from continued operations (Group share) to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination, net of the corresponding tax effect. This indicator is also aligned with market practice.

Free cash flow

Free Cash Flow is de?ned as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures including capitalised development costs, net of proceeds from disposals of tangible and intangible assets. Free Cash Flow does not include any proceeds from disposals of activity.

The most directly comparable financial measure to Free Cash Flow calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS is net cash provided by operating activities.

Funds from Operations

Funds from Operations ""FFO"" in the EBIT to FCF statement refers to the Free Cash Flow generated by Operations, before Working Capital variations.

Contract and Trade Working Capital

Contract Working Capital is the sum of:

Contract Assets & Liabilities, which includes the Customer Down-PaymentsCurrent provisions, which includes Risks on contracts and Warranties

Trade Working Capital is the Working Capital that is not strictly related to contract. It includes all the elements of the working capital but

Contract Working Capital Income Tax receivables and payablesRestructuring provisions

Net cash/(debt)

The net cash/(debt) is defined as cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and other current financial asset, less borrowings.

Pay-out ratio

The pay-out ratio is calculated by dividing the amount of the overall dividend with the ""Adjusted Net profit from continuing operations attributable to equity holders of the parent, Group share"" as presented in the management report in the consolidated financial statements.

Organic basis

This press release includes performance indicators presented on a reported basis and on an organic basis. Figures given on an organic basis eliminate the impact of changes in scope of consolidation and changes resulting from the translation of the accounts into Euro following the variation of foreign currencies against the Euro.

The Group uses figures prepared on an organic basis both for internal analysis and for external communication, as it believes they provide means to analyse and explain variations from one period to another. However, these figures are not measurements of performance under IFRS.

Sales were €17.6 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio at 1.1.

The backlog reached €92 billion, providing strong visibility on future sales. Gross margin on backlog reached 17.5% as of 31 March 2024, compared to 16.9% on 31 March 2023.

In the fiscal year 2023/24, Alstom's adjusted EBIT was €997 million, up 17%, equivalent to a 5.7% aEBIT margin, and EBIT before PPA was €356 million. Adjusted net profit was €44 million, net income (group share) was €(309) million, and free cash flow was €(557) million for the full year.

On 31 March 2024, the Group's net debt position stood at €(2,994) million, compared to the €(2,135) million the Group reported on 31 March 2023. Alstom benefits from a solid €6.3 billion liquidity position and equity amounting to €8,778 million on 31 March 2024.

The Board of Directors, in its meeting of 7 May 2024, proposed that no dividend will be paid with regards to the fiscal year 2023/24.

""Alstom recorded a strong rebound during the second half of the year, with solid order intake, strong organic growth, improved profitability and €562 million free cash-flow generation. Thanks to the support of our reference shareholders, we will swiftly execute the €2 billion deleveraging plan, allowing for the stabilization of its Investment Grade rating. In April, we announced the sale of Alstom's conventional signalling business in North America at a favourable valuation, demonstrating the quality and attractiveness of the Group's assets. We are confident in the strength of our backlog and our strategy of selectivity and mix evolution towards services. The Group is capitalizing on the solid operational progress made over the last three years and is launching new initiatives to improve its industrial performance and reduce overheads and indirect procurement costs. Altogether, Alstom is now set on stronger foundations to deliver sustainable profit and cash generation."" said Henri Poupart-Lafarge, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Alstom.

Progress on Alstom's action plan to support its financial targets

During the second half of fiscal year 2023/24, the Group mobilised around the operational, commercial, and cost efficiency plan:

The €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan highlighting commitment to Investment Grade

As announced in November 2023 and reiterated in January 2024, Alstom's Board of Directors is committed to a conservative financial policy and to protect the Group's Investment Grade rating, in particular through a ca. €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan.

This plan and its execution, which have been unanimously approved by Alstom's Board of Directors, has the following components:

The ca. €2.4 billion proceeds correspond to ca. €2 billion of deleveraging, mainly due to the hybrid bond's 50% Moody's debt content.

Each of CDPQ and Bpifrance, holding respectively 17.4% and 7.5% of Alstom's capital, has declared to the Company its intention to subscribe for its pro-rata share of the capital increase.

In addition, Alstom has entered into a standby underwriting commitment with BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, J.P. Morgan and Société Générale, acting as Joint Global Coordinators, pursuant to which they have undertaken to underwrite the remainder of the capital raise (i.e. ca. €750 million), subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions precedent.

Circa €1.2 billion of the proceeds of asset disposals and of the capital markets transactions will be used to repay financial debt by September 2024:

The remainder of the proceeds will be invested in highly liquid short-term investment (cash equivalent treatment) and will be earmarked for gross debt reduction at maturity.

Alstom Baa3 long-term issuer rating is reaffirmed, and the outlook will be changed to stable upon successful closing of the hybrid bond issuance and the rights issue.

Alstom will terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following the execution of the deleveraging plan.

During the fiscal year 2023/24, the Group recorded €18.9 billion in orders, with commercial success across multiple geographies, notably in Europe, Asia/Pacific and in Americas. During the last fiscal year, Alstom reported an order intake of €20.7 billion. The (8)% decrease is mostly driven by last year's landmark contract awarded by Landesanstalt Schienenfahrzeuge Baden Württemberg (SFBW) network in Germany of almost €2.5 billion.

In Europe, Alstom recorded €11.3 billion order intake during the fiscal year 2023/24, compared with €12.8 billion over the last fiscal year.

In the U.K, Alstom has signed an eight-year extension to its Train Services Agreement (TSA) with CrossCountry. The contract extension, valued at around €950 million, further secures this long-term partnership and is evidence of the trust placed by the customer.

In France, Alstom will supply île-de-France Mobilités and RATP with 103 new MF19 trainsets, which is the new generation metro on rail, for a total contract value of more than €800 million, 100% financed by Île-de-France Mobilités. This new fleet will replace the existing rolling stock on lines 13, 12 and 8 of the Île-de-France metro as of 2027. The Group also signed a framework contract with Akiem European rolling stock leasing company for 100 Traxx Universal multi-system (MS3) locomotives, together with an initial firm order for 65 locomotives. The total amount of the framework agreement is up €500 million.

In Germany, Alstom was awarded a contract to supply 40 Coradia Stream High-Capacity electric multiple units together with full maintenance for 30 years to Nahverkehrsverbund Schleswig-Holstein (NAH.SH), valued at close to €900 million, and including an option for up to 55 additional trains with a corresponding full-service package. The Group also signed a contract with RAILPOOL for 50 Traxx Universal multi-purpose locomotives.

In Romania, Alstom, as part of a consortium with the civil works companies Gulermak and Arcada, also signed a contract with the Cluj-Napoca City Hall in Romania for the construction of the Cluj-Napoca Metro Line 1. Alstom's share of this state-of-the-art turnkey project reaches approximately €400 million.

In Italy, Alstom was awarded a contract for the supply of high-speed trains.

In Americas, Alstom reported €2.0 billion order intake, compared with €2.7 billion over the last fiscal year, driven by a contract with the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) in the United States to deliver 130 full low floor electric streetcars for Philadelphia, valued at over €667 million and with options to build an additional 30 streetcars. And the Group was awarded a contract by the Connecticut Department of Transportation (CTDOT) in the United States to supply 60 single-level rail coach cars valued at approximately €285 million with options to build an additional 313 cars, as part of CTDOT's coach renewal program for its statewide rail system.

In Asia/Pacific, the order intake stood at €3.2 billion, compared to €3.0 billion for the last fiscal year. In the Philippines, Alstom in consortium with Colas Rail has been awarded by Mitsubishi Corporation a contract to provide an integrated railway system for the extension of the North-South Commuter Railway project (NSCR). Alstom's contract share is worth approximately €1 billion. In Australia, Alstom has been awarded a contract worth around €900 million to maintain the regional rolling stock VLocity and Classic fleets in Victoria, Australia for the next decade.

In Africa/Middle East/Central Asia, the Group reported €2.4 billion order intake, compared with €2.2 billion over the last fiscal year. In Israel, Alstom, a member of the TMT Consortium (TLV Metropolitan Tramway Ltd.) and its partners Electra Ltd. & Dan Public Transportation Ltd., have reached financial closure on the contract, awarded in May 2022, to design, build, maintain, and finance the Tel Aviv Metropolitan LRT Green line by Metropolitan Mass Transit System Ltd (NTA). Alstom's share is valued at €858 million. In Saudi Arabia, Alstom signed a contract of over €500 million with The Royal Commission for AlUla (RCU) for AlUla's pioneering battery-powered tramway - the world's longest catenary-free line.

As of 31 March 2024, the backlog stood at €92 billion, providing the Group with strong visibility over future sales.

Alstom's sales amounted to €17.6 billion for the fiscal year 2023/24, representing a growth of 6.7% on a reported basis and a strong 9.4% on an organic basis compared with Alstom sales in the last fiscal year. Sales related to non-performing backlog, corresponding to sales on legacy projects with a negative margin at completion, amounted to €1.7 billion during the fiscal year 2023/24.

Rolling stock sales reached €9.1 billion, representing an increase of 3.9% on a reported basis and 6.5% on an organic basis, driven by contracts ramp-up in France, Belgium and in the US, and the solid level of execution in South Africa, India and Europe.

Services sales stood at €4.3 billion, up 11.9% on a reported basis and 14.3% on an organic basis versus last year, benefiting from the continuous ramp-up in the UK, in Italy and in the US as well as a solid level of execution in Canada.

In Signalling, Alstom reported €2.6 billion sales, up 8.9% on a reported basis and 11.8% on an organic basis versus last year, led by a consistent execution across all regions, mainly in Europe and in APAC.

Systems sales grew 6.9% on a reported basis and 9.3% on an organic basis, and stood at €1.6 billion, driven by a good performance of Turnkey Systems projects in Mexico, Egypt and Canada.

On 14 September 2023, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US department of Treasury added JSC Transmashholding (TMH AO) to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Person (SDN) List. TMH AO is the Russian holding company of TMH Group and is 100% owned by TMH Limited, and Alstom was holding a 20% stake in TMH limited. The Group further assessed potential exposures arising from the new OFAC sanctions and made the decision to sell its stake in TMH. The transaction was closed early January 2024 for an amount of €75 million, carrying value was nil as result of previous impairment, contributing to the de-risking of the company's portfolio.

On 19 April 2024, Alstom announced that it had entered into a binding agreement with Knorr-Bremse AG, to sell Alstom's North American conventional signalling business for a purchase price of around €630 million. Closing of the transaction is only subject to customary conditions, including regulatory approval, and is expected to take place as soon as summer 2024. Proceeds for Alstom at closing, net of expected tax and transaction costs, are expected to be around €620 million.

2. Innovation by Pioneering Smarter and Greener Mobility for All

As of end of March 2024, research and development gross costs amounted to €749 million, i.e. 4.3% of sales, delivering on the Alstom In Motion strategy which is based on three pillars: Autonomous mobility, Data factory and Mobility orchestration. Net R&D amounts to €549 million before PPA amortisation.

Programs funded by IPCEI Hydrogen are ongoing. This important European program supports the development of new hydrogen trains for regional applications, shunting locos and freight, leveraging on the experience collected with Coradia iLint regional trains that are now in revenue service.

Homologation tests of Avelia Horizon are planned in 2024 to enable a start of revenue service in 2025. The development of international configurations is ongoing. Alstom has launched the development of Avelia stream 300, addressing the high-speed single deck segment with a first project for Italy.

The replacement of Adessia commuter train has been launched to address the U.K. and USA markets. This new product range will include EMU, BMU, BEMU and HMU versions to also replace the existing Diesel trains.

TRAXX Multi-system 3 - locomotives is pursuing homologation tests in 2024 to enable it to run on the different European corridors. It includes the passenger version which can be operated at 200kph.

Services product line is focused on addressing green, sustainable and more efficient operation concepts. Green re-tractioning initiatives include for example the retrofit with hydrogen-fuelled internal combustion engines for locomotives and the ability to provide autonomy for non-electrified lines via the so-called ""Last-mile"" functionality supported by the IPCEI H2 program.

Signalling Product Line worked on Onvia Control L2 A and Onvia Control L2 B European Standard convergence, driving market presence with its integration into TRAXX platform and securing new contracts for cross border operation, Onvia Cab level 2 and level 3 on-board solution together with Automatic Train Operation, and it continued its footprint expansion with a new contract in Canada.

Alstom Innovations cluster continued to develop Autonomous Mobility solutions for Passengers & Freight trains. Major milestones on the roadmap to achieve GoA4 (Grade of Automation 4) have been successfully passed under real mainline operating conditions on passengers and freight train with SNCF in France, and for operation in yard in the Netherlands.

Alstom has also made great strides in developing a new SaaS platform that will enhance its global digital offering. The platform streamlines applications integration and deployment in a trusted and future-proof ecosystem.

The adjusted EBIT margin has progressed from 5.2% over the fiscal year 2022/23 to 5.7% over the fiscal year 2023/24, benefiting from further synergies for 30bps, a steady reduction of non-performing legacy contracts sales for an impact of 30bps, an increased volume and favourable mix delivering 20bps gross margin expansion, partially offset by the negative gross margin impact related to the legacy portfolio deviations for (30)bps.

Alstom recorded restructuring and rationalisation charges of €(147) million mainly related to the reduction of overhead costs for €(115) million (""Autumn"" plan) and adaptation of the production setup for €(32) million, including the United Kingdom for €(14) million, Germany for €(8) million, France for €(3) million, Spain for €(3) million and the U.S.A. for €(2) million.

Costs related to the integration of Bombardier Transportation were recorded for an amount of €(142) million. €(118) million charges were related to some legal proceedings outside the ordinary course of business mainly for two projects - in U.S.A. and in Turkey, and for legal fees in the context of the claim against Bombardier Inc. €(30) million were related to impairment of assets due to the exit from Russia. Other exceptional expenses were recorded for €(73) million, of which €(36) million of consequential impacts from restructuring plan already initiated in Germany.

Alstom's EBIT before amortisation and impairment of assets exclusively valued when determining the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") stood at €356 million. This compares to €366 million for the last fiscal year.

The share in net income from equity investments amounted to €7 million, excluding the amortisation of the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") from Chinese joint ventures of €(10) million.

Adjusted net profit, representing the group's share of net profit from continued operations excluding PPA net of tax, amounts to €44 million for the fiscal year 2023/24. This compares to an adjusted net profit of €292 million during the last fiscal year.

The Group's Net profit/(loss) (Group share) stood at €(309) million for the fiscal year 2023/24, compared to €(132) million last fiscal year.

4. Financial structure

The Group's Free Cash Flow stands at €(557) million for the fiscal year 2023/24 as compared to €199 million during the last fiscal year and €(1,119) million at the first half of fiscal year 2023/24. Cash generation was impacted over the full year by an unfavourable €(856) million change in working capital compared to €(219) million in the last fiscal year; mostly due to change in Trade Working Capital as well as the reversal effect of the change in law on VAT in France for €(380) million. The Contract Working Capital is positively impacted by the acceleration of deliveries from major contracts in the second half of the year, strong collections of down payments as well as reduction of provision for risk on contracts.

On 31 March 2024, the Group recorded a net debt position of €(2,994) million.

In addition to its available cash and cash equivalents, amounting to €976 million on 31 March 2024, the Group benefits from strong liquidity with:

The first facility has two six-month extension options remaining at borrowers' discretion. Alstom will, however, terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following execution of the deleveraging plan.

The last two facilities have been successfully extended by one year. On 31 March 2024, the €1.75 billion RCF line had been drawn down for €175 million, while the other two lines remained undrawn.

As per its conservative liquidity policy, the €2.5 billion Revolving Credit Facility serves as a back-up of the Group €2.5 billion Negotiable European Commercial Papers program in place. With these RCF lines (€175 million drawn on the RCF on 31 March 2024), the €1.03 billion of Neu CP outstanding on 31 March 2024, the Group benefitted from a €6.3 billion liquidity available.

5. One Alstom team - Agile, Inclusive and Responsible

Decarbonization is at the heart of Alstom's strategy. The Group is reducing its Scope 1 & 2 emissions reaching 139 ktonCO2e (representing a 39% decrease compared to March 2022), while collaborating with suppliers and customers on reducing its Scope 3 footprint. First results of this collaboration can be seen through the reduction of emissions intensity of sold product reaching 4.0 gCO2e/pass.km (i.e. (13)% compared to March 2022). Alstom CO2e emissions reduction targets had been validated on the 6 of July 2023 by the independent Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) as in line with requirements to reach Paris Agreement commitments.

The supply of electricity from renewable sources has also been expanded. Alstom signed a significant Power Purchase Agreement focused on solar development in Spain. The solar farm is expected to begin operations early 2025 with a 10-years contract. The project will cover the equivalent of 80% of Alstom's electricity consumption in Europe, so this is a major step in reaching the target of 100% electricity consumption from renewables.

Regarding Diversity & Inclusion, the Alstom in Motion (AiM) 2025 strategy targets to reach 28% of women managers, engineers and professionals' roles by 2025. As of end of March 2024, 24.7% of manager, engineer and professional roles are held by women. Alstom will continue to accelerate its efforts in the coming months.

Alstom's Corporate Social Responsibility performance is regularly evaluated by various rating agencies; the Group maintained its presence among the CAC40 ESG index for the third consecutive year and the DJSI for the 13 consecutive year. Alstom improved is scoring to ECOVADIS questionnaire with a score of 77/100 and kept AA score with MSCI agency. In addition, in 2024, Alstom improved is CDP rating, moving from B to A-. Those results reflect its strong position and strategy on Sustainability.

In addition, Alstom published for the second year European Taxonomy-aligned KPIs about Sales, Capex and Opex, pursuing strong analysis initiated last year. EU Taxonomy-aligned sales amounted to 60% and ranked Alstom among best in class, confirming the importance of the sector in which Alstom operates in achieving the EU's ambition of carbon neutrality by 2050. The EU Taxonomy purpose is to redirect capital flows towards sustainable activities and help navigate transition to a low carbon economy.

The outlook for FY 2024/25 is based on following main assumptions:

Considering the slight dilution from disposals and the revised timing of the impact from industrial optimisation, the Group expects to reach this profitability range in FY 2026/27, versus FY 2025/26 previously.

Alstom is pleased to invite you to a conference call presenting its full year results for Fiscal Year 2023/24 on Wednesday 8 May at 08:30 am (Paris time), hosted by Henri Poupart-Lafarge, CEO and Bernard Delpit, CFO.

APPENDIX 4 - NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INDICATORS DEFINITIONS

This section presents financial indicators used by the Group that are not defined by accounting standard setters.

Orders received

A new order is recognised as an order received only when the contract creates enforceable obligations between the Group and its customer. When this condition is met, the order is recognised at the contract value. If the contract is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the reporting unit, the Group requires the immediate elimination of currency exposure using forward currency sales. Orders are then measured using the spot rate at inception of hedging instruments.

Book-to-Bill

The book-to-bill ratio is the ratio of orders received to the amount of sales traded for a specific period.

Gross margin % on backlog

Gross Margin % on backlog is a KPI that presents the expected performance level of firm contracts in backlog. It represents the difference between the sales not yet recognized and the cost of sales not yet incurred from the contracts in backlog. This % is an average of the portfolio of contracts in backlog and is meaningful to project mid- and long-term profitability.

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA is a KPI that presents the level of recurring operational performance. It represents the sales minus the cost of sales, adjusted to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination as well as significant, non-recurring ""one off"" items that are not expected to occur again in subsequent years.

EBIT before PPA

Following the Bombardier Transportation acquisition and with effect from the fiscal year 2021/22 condensed consolidated financial statements, Alstom decided to introduce the ""EBIT before PPA"" KPI aimed at restating its Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (""EBIT"") to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination. This KPI is also aligned with market practice.

Adjusted EBIT

Adjusted EBIT (""aEBIT"") is the Key Performance Indicator to present the level of recurring operational performance. This indicator is also aligned with market practice and comparable to direct competitors.

Starting September 2019, Alstom has opted for the inclusion of the share in net income of the equity-accounted investments into the aEBIT when these are considered to be part of the operating activities of the Group (because there are significant operational flows and/or common project execution with these entities). This mainly includes Chinese joint-ventures, namely CASCO joint-venture for Alstom as well as, following the integration of Bombardier Transportation, Alstom Sifang (Qingdao) Transportation Ltd. (formerly Bombardier Sifang), Bombardier NUG Propulsion System Co. Ltd and Changchun Changke Alstom Railway Vehicles Company Ltd (formerly Changchun Bombardier).

aEBIT corresponds to Earning Before Interests and Tax adjusted for the following elements:

A non-recurring item is a ""one-off"" exceptional item that is not supposed to occur again in following years and that is significant.

Adjusted EBIT margin corresponds to Adjusted EBIT expressed as a percentage of sales.

EBITDA + JV dividends

EBITDA before PPA plus dividends from joint ventures is the EBIT before PPA, before depreciation and amortisation, with the addition of the dividends received from joint ventures.

Adjusted net profit

The ""Adjusted Net Profit"" KPI restates Alstom's net profit from continued operations (Group share) to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination, net of the corresponding tax effect. This indicator is also aligned with market practice.

Free cash flow

Free Cash Flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures including capitalised development costs, net of proceeds from disposals of tangible and intangible assets. Free Cash Flow does not include any proceeds from disposals of activity.

The most directly comparable financial measure to Free Cash Flow calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS is net cash provided by operating activities.

Funds from Operations

Funds from Operations ""FFO"" in the EBIT to FCF statement refers to the Free Cash Flow generated by Operations, before Working Capital variations.

Contract and Trade Working Capital

Contract Working Capital is the sum of:

Trade Working Capital is the Working Capital that is not strictly related to contract. It includes all the elements of the working capital but

Net cash/(debt)

The net cash/(debt) is defined as cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and other current financial asset, less borrowings.

Pay-out ratio

The pay-out ratio is calculated by dividing the amount of the overall dividend with the ""Adjusted Net profit from continuing operations attributable to equity holders of the parent, Group share"" as presented in the management report in the consolidated financial statements.

Organic basis

This press release includes performance indicators presented on a reported basis and on an organic basis. Figures given on an organic basis eliminate the impact of changes in scope of consolidation and changes resulting from the translation of the accounts into Euro following the variation of foreign currencies against the Euro.

The Group uses figures prepared on an organic basis both for internal analysis and for external communication, as it believes they provide means to analyse and explain variations from one period to another.

Progress on Alstom's action plan to support its financial targets

During the second half of fiscal year 2023/24, the Group mobilised around the operational, commercial, and cost efficiency plan:

The €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan highlighting commitment to Investment Grade

As announced in November 2023 and reiterated in January 2024, Alstom's Board of Directors is committed to a conservative financial policy and to protect the Group's Investment Grade rating, in particular through a ca. €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan.

This plan and its execution, which have been unanimously approved by Alstom's Board of Directors, has the following components:

The ca. €2.4 billion proceeds correspond to ca. €2 billion of deleveraging, mainly due to the hybrid bond's 50% Moody's debt content.

Each of CDPQ and Bpifrance, holding respectively 17.4% and 7.5% of Alstom's capital, has declared to the Company its intention to subscribe for its pro-rata share of the capital increase.

In addition, Alstom has entered into a standby underwriting commitment with BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, J.P. Morgan and Société Générale, acting as Joint Global Coordinators, pursuant to which they have undertaken to underwrite the remainder of the capital raise (i.e. ca. €750 million), subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions precedent.

Circa €1.2 billion of the proceeds of asset disposals and of the capital markets transactions will be used to repay financial debt by September 2024:

The remainder of the proceeds will be invested in highly liquid short-term investment (cash equivalent treatment) and will be earmarked for gross debt reduction at maturity.

Alstom Baa3 long-term issuer rating is reaffirmed, and the outlook will be changed to stable upon successful closing of the hybrid bond issuance and the rights issue.

Alstom will terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following the execution of the deleveraging plan.

During the fiscal year 2023/24, the Group recorded €18.9 billion in orders, with commercial success across multiple geographies, notably in Europe, Asia/Pacific and in Americas. During the last fiscal year, Alstom reported an order intake of €20.7 billion. The (8)% decrease is mostly driven by last year's landmark contract awarded by Landesanstalt Schienenfahrzeuge Baden Württemberg (SFBW) network in Germany of almost €2.5 billion.

In Europe, Alstom recorded €11.3 billion order intake during the fiscal year 2023/24, compared with €12.8 billion over the last fiscal year.

In the U.K, Alstom has signed an eight-year extension to its Train Services Agreement (TSA) with CrossCountry. The contract extension, valued at around €950 million, further secures this long-term partnership and is evidence of the trust placed by the customer.

In France, Alstom will supply île-de-France Mobilités and RATP with 103 new MF19 trainsets, which is the new generation metro on rail, for a total contract value of more than €800 million, 100% financed by Île-de-France Mobilités. This new fleet will replace the existing rolling stock on lines 13, 12 and 8 of the Île-de-France metro as of 2027. The Group also signed a framework contract with Akiem European rolling stock leasing company for 100 Traxx Universal multi-system (MS3) locomotives, together with an initial firm order for 65 locomotives. The total amount of the framework agreement is up €500 million.

In Germany, Alstom was awarded a contract to supply 40 Coradia Stream High-Capacity electric multiple units together with full maintenance for 30 years to Nahverkehrsverbund Schleswig-Holstein (NAH.SH), valued at close to €900 million, and including an option for up to 55 additional trains with a corresponding full-service package. The Group also signed a contract with RAILPOOL for 50 Traxx Universal multi-purpose locomotives.

In Romania, Alstom, as part of a consortium with the civil works companies Gulermak and Arcada, also signed a contract with the Cluj-Napoca City Hall in Romania for the construction of the Cluj-Napoca Metro Line 1. Alstom's share of this state-of-the-art turnkey project reaches approximately €400 million.

In Italy, Alstom was awarded a contract for the supply of high-speed trains.

In Americas, Alstom reported €2.0 billion order intake, compared with €2.7 billion over the last fiscal year, driven by a contract with the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) in the United States to deliver 130 full low floor electric streetcars for Philadelphia, valued at over €667 million and with options to build an additional 30 streetcars. And the Group was awarded a contract by the Connecticut Department of Transportation (CTDOT) in the United States to supply 60 single-level rail coach cars valued at approximately €285 million with options to build an additional 313 cars, as part of CTDOT's coach renewal program for its statewide rail system.

In Asia/Pacific, the order intake stood at €3.2 billion, compared to €3.0 billion for the last fiscal year. In the Philippines, Alstom in consortium with Colas Rail has been awarded by Mitsubishi Corporation a contract to provide an integrated railway system for the extension of the North-South Commuter Railway project (NSCR). Alstom's contract share is worth approximately €1 billion. In Australia, Alstom has been awarded a contract worth around €900 million to maintain the regional rolling stock VLocity and Classic fleets in Victoria, Australia for the next decade.

In Africa/Middle East/Central Asia, the Group reported €2.4 billion order intake, compared with €2.2 billion over the last fiscal year. In Israel, Alstom, a member of the TMT Consortium (TLV Metropolitan Tramway Ltd.) and its partners Electra Ltd. & Dan Public Transportation Ltd., have reached financial closure on the contract, awarded in May 2022, to design, build, maintain, and finance the Tel Aviv Metropolitan LRT Green line by Metropolitan Mass Transit System Ltd (NTA). Alstom's share is valued at €858 million. In Saudi Arabia, Alstom signed a contract of over €500 million with The Royal Commission for AlUla (RCU) for AlUla's pioneering battery-powered tramway - the world's longest catenary-free line.

As of 31 March 2024, the backlog stood at €92 billion, providing the Group with strong visibility over future sales.

Alstom's sales amounted to €17.6 billion for the fiscal year 2023/24, representing a growth of 6.7% on a reported basis and a strong 9.4% on an organic basis compared with Alstom sales in the last fiscal year. Sales related to non-performing backlog, corresponding to sales on legacy projects with a negative margin at completion, amounted to €1.7 billion during the fiscal year 2023/24.

Rolling stock sales reached €9.1 billion, representing an increase of 3.9% on a reported basis and 6.5% on an organic basis, driven by contracts ramp-up in France, Belgium and in the US, and the solid level of execution in South Africa, India and Europe.

Services sales stood at €4.3 billion, up 11.9% on a reported basis and 14.3% on an organic basis versus last year, benefiting from the continuous ramp-up in the UK, in Italy and in the US as well as a solid level of execution in Canada.

In Signalling, Alstom reported €2.6 billion sales, up 8.9% on a reported basis and 11.8% on an organic basis versus last year, led by a consistent execution across all regions, mainly in Europe and in APAC.

Systems sales grew 6.9% on a reported basis and 9.3% on an organic basis, and stood at €1.6 billion, driven by a good performance of Turnkey Systems projects in Mexico, Egypt and Canada.

On 14 September 2023, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US department of Treasury added JSC Transmashholding (TMH AO) to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Person (SDN) List. TMH AO is the Russian holding company of TMH Group and is 100% owned by TMH Limited, and Alstom was holding a 20% stake in TMH limited. The Group further assessed potential exposures arising from the new OFAC sanctions and made the decision to sell its stake in TMH. The transaction was closed early January 2024 for an amount of €75 million, carrying value was nil as result of previous impairment, contributing to the de-risking of the company's portfolio.

On 19 April 2024, Alstom announced that it had entered into a binding agreement with Knorr-Bremse AG, to sell Alstom's North American conventional signalling business for a purchase price of around €630 million. Closing of the transaction is only subject to customary conditions, including regulatory approval, and is expected to take place as soon as summer 2024. Proceeds for Alstom at closing, net of expected tax and transaction costs, are expected to be around €620 million.

2. Innovation by Pioneering Smarter and Greener Mobility for All

As of end of March 2024, research and development gross costs amounted to €749 million, i.e. 4.3% of sales, delivering on the Alstom In Motion strategy which is based on three pillars: Autonomous mobility, Data factory and Mobility orchestration. Net R&D amounts to €549 million before PPA amortisation.

Programs funded by IPCEI Hydrogen are ongoing. This important European program supports the development of new hydrogen trains for regional applications, shunting locos and freight, leveraging on the experience collected with Coradia iLint™ regional trains that are now in revenue service.

Homologation tests of Avelia Horizon™ are planned in 2024 to enable a start of revenue service in 2025. The development of international configurations is ongoing. Alstom has launched the development of Avelia stream™ 300, addressing the high-speed single deck segment with a first project for Italy.

The replacement of Adessia™ commuter train has been launched to address the U.K. and USA markets. This new product range will include EMU, BMU, BEMU and HMU versions to also replace the existing Diesel trains.

TRAXX™ Multi-system 3 - locomotives is pursuing homologation tests in 2024 to enable it to run on the different European corridors. It includes the passenger version which can be operated at 200kph.

Services product line is focused on addressing green, sustainable and more efficient operation concepts. Green re-tractioning initiatives include for example the retrofit with hydrogen-fuelled internal combustion engines for locomotives and the ability to provide autonomy for non-electrified lines via the so-called ""Last-mile"" functionality supported by the IPCEI H2 program.

Signalling Product Line worked on Onvia Control™ L2 A and Onvia Control™ L2 B European Standard convergence, driving market presence with its integration into TRAXX platform and securing new contracts for cross border operation, Onvia Cab™ level 2 and level 3 on-board solution together with Automatic Train Operation, and it continued its footprint expansion with a new contract in Canada.

Alstom Innovations cluster continued to develop Autonomous Mobility solutions for Passengers & Freight trains. Major milestones on the roadmap to achieve GoA4 (Grade of Automation 4) have been successfully passed under real mainline operating conditions on passengers and freight train with SNCF in France, and for operation in yard in the Netherlands.

Alstom has also made great strides in developing a new SaaS platform that will enhance its global digital offering. The platform streamlines applications integration and deployment in a trusted and future-proof ecosystem.

The adjusted EBIT margin has progressed from 5.2% over the fiscal year 2022/23 to 5.7% over the fiscal year 2023/24, benefiting from further synergies for 30bps, a steady reduction of non-performing legacy contracts sales for an impact of 30bps, an increased volume and favourable mix delivering 20bps gross margin expansion, partially offset by the negative gross margin impact related to the legacy portfolio deviations for (30)bps.

Alstom recorded restructuring and rationalisation charges of €(147) million mainly related to the reduction of overhead costs for €(115) million (""Autumn"" plan) and adaptation of the production setup for €(32) million, including the United Kingdom for €(14) million, Germany for €(8) million, France for €(3) million, Spain for €(3) million and the U.S.A. for €(2) million.

Costs related to the integration of Bombardier Transportation were recorded for an amount of €(142) million. €(118) million charges were related to some legal proceedings outside the ordinary course of business mainly for two projects - in U.S.A. and in Turkey, and for legal fees in the context of the claim against Bombardier Inc. €(30) million were related to impairment of assets due to the exit from Russia. Other exceptional expenses were recorded for €(73) million, of which €(36) million of consequential impacts from restructuring plan already initiated in Germany.

Alstom's EBIT before amortisation and impairment of assets exclusively valued when determining the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") stood at €356 million. This compares to €366 million for the last fiscal year.

The share in net income from equity investments amounted to €7 million, excluding the amortisation of the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") from Chinese joint ventures of €(10) million.

Adjusted net profit, representing the group's share of net profit from continued operations excluding PPA net of tax, amounts to €44 million for the fiscal year 2023/24. This compares to an adjusted net profit of €292 million during the last fiscal year.

The Group's Net profit/(loss) (Group share) stood at €(309) million for the fiscal year 2023/24, compared to €(132) million last fiscal year.

4. Financial structure

The Group's Free Cash Flow stands at €(557) million for the fiscal year 2023/24 as compared to €199 million during the last fiscal year and €(1,119) million at the first half of fiscal year 2023/24. Cash generation was impacted over the full year by an unfavourable €(856) million change in working capital compared to €(219) million in the last fiscal year; mostly due to change in Trade Working Capital as well as the reversal effect of the change in law on VAT in France for €(380) million. The Contract Working Capital is positively impacted by the acceleration of deliveries from major contracts in the second half of the year, strong collections of down payments as well as reduction of provision for risk on contracts.

On 31 March 2024, the Group recorded a net debt position of €(2,994) million.

In addition to its available cash and cash equivalents, amounting to €976 million on 31 March 2024, the Group benefits from strong liquidity with:

The first facility has two six-month extension options remaining at borrowers' discretion. Alstom will, however, terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following execution of the deleveraging plan.

The last two facilities have been successfully extended by one year. On 31 March 2024, the €1.75 billion RCF line had been drawn down for €175 million, while the other two lines remained undrawn.

As per its conservative liquidity policy, the €2.5 billion Revolving Credit Facility serves as a back-up of the Group €2.5 billion Negotiable European Commercial Papers program in place. With these RCF lines (€175 million drawn on the RCF on 31 March 2024), the €1.03 billion of Neu CP outstanding on 31 March 2024, the Group benefitted from a €6.3 billion liquidity available.

5. One Alstom team - Agile, Inclusive and Responsible

Decarbonization is at the heart of Alstom's strategy. The Group is reducing its Scope 1 & 2 emissions reaching 139 ktonCO2e (representing a 39% decrease compared to March 2022), while collaborating with suppliers and customers on reducing its Scope 3 footprint. First results of this collaboration can be seen through the reduction of emissions intensity of sold product reaching 4.0 gCO2e/pass.km (i.e. (13)% compared to March 2022). Alstom CO2e emissions reduction targets had been validated on the 6 of July 2023 by the independent Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) as in line with requirements to reach Paris Agreement commitments.

The supply of electricity from renewable sources has also been expanded. Alstom signed a significant Power Purchase Agreement focused on solar development in Spain. The solar farm is expected to begin operations early 2025 with a 10-years contract. The project will cover the equivalent of 80% of Alstom's electricity consumption in Europe, so this is a major step in reaching the target of 100% electricity consumption from renewables.

Regarding Diversity & Inclusion, the Alstom in Motion (AiM) 2025 strategy targets to reach 28% of women managers, engineers and professionals' roles by 2025. As of end of March 2024, 24.7% of manager, engineer and professional roles are held by women. Alstom will continue to accelerate its efforts in the coming months.

Alstom's Corporate Social Responsibility performance is regularly evaluated by various rating agencies; the Group maintained its presence among the CAC40 ESG index for the third consecutive year and the DJSI for the 13 consecutive year. Alstom improved is scoring to ECOVADIS questionnaire with a score of 77/100 and kept AA score with MSCI agency. In addition, in 2024, Alstom improved is CDP rating, moving from B to A-. Those results reflect its strong position and strategy on Sustainability.

In addition, Alstom published for the second year European Taxonomy-aligned KPIs about Sales, Capex and Opex, pursuing strong analysis initiated last year. EU Taxonomy-aligned sales amounted to 60% and ranked Alstom among best in class, confirming the importance of the sector in which Alstom operates in achieving the EU's ambition of carbon neutrality by 2050. The EU Taxonomy purpose is to redirect capital flows towards sustainable activities and help navigate transition to a low carbon economy.

The outlook for FY 2024/25 is based on following main assumptions:

Considering the slight dilution from disposals and the revised timing of the impact from industrial optimisation, the Group expects to reach this profitability range in FY 2026/27, versus FY 2025/26 previously.

APPENDIX 4 - NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INDICATORS DEFINITIONS

This section presents financial indicators used by the Group that are not defined by accounting standard setters.

Orders received

A new order is recognised as an order received only when the contract creates enforceable obligations between the Group and its customer. When this condition is met, the order is recognised at the contract value. If the contract is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the reporting unit, the Group requires the immediate elimination of currency exposure using forward currency sales. Orders are then measured using the spot rate at inception of hedging instruments.

Book-to-Bill

The book-to-bill ratio is the ratio of orders received to the amount of sales traded for a specific period.

Gross margin % on backlog

Gross Margin % on backlog is a KPI that presents the expected performance level of firm contracts in backlog. It represents the difference between the sales not yet recognized and the cost of sales not yet incurred from the contracts in backlog. This % is an average of the portfolio of contracts in backlog and is meaningful to project mid- and long-term profitability.

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA is a KPI that presents the level of recurring operational performance. It represents the sales minus the cost of sales, adjusted to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination as well as significant, non-recurring ""one off"" items that are not expected to occur again in subsequent years.

EBIT before PPA

Following the Bombardier Transportation acquisition and with effect from the fiscal year 2021/22 condensed consolidated financial statements, Alstom decided to introduce the ""EBIT before PPA"" KPI aimed at restating its Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (""EBIT"") to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination. This KPI is also aligned with market practice.

Adjusted EBIT

Adjusted EBIT (""aEBIT"") is the Key Performance Indicator to present the level of recurring operational performance. This indicator is also aligned with market practice and comparable to direct competitors.

Starting September 2019, Alstom has opted for the inclusion of the share in net income of the equity-accounted investments into the aEBIT when these are considered to be part of the operating activities of the Group (because there are significant operational flows and/or common project execution with these entities). This mainly includes Chinese joint-ventures, namely CASCO joint-venture for Alstom as well as, following the integration of Bombardier Transportation, Alstom Sifang (Qingdao) Transportation Ltd. (formerly Bombardier Sifang), Bombardier NUG Propulsion System Co. Ltd and Changchun Changke Alstom Railway Vehicles Company Ltd (formerly Changchun Bombardier).

aEBIT corresponds to Earning Before Interests and Tax adjusted for the following elements:

A non-recurring item is a ""one-off"" exceptional item that is not supposed to occur again in following years and that is significant.

Adjusted EBIT margin corresponds to Adjusted EBIT expressed as a percentage of sales.

EBITDA + JV dividends

EBITDA before PPA plus dividends from joint ventures is the EBIT before PPA, before depreciation and amortisation, with the addition of the dividends received from joint ventures.

Adjusted net profit

The ""Adjusted Net Profit"" KPI restates Alstom's net profit from continued operations (Group share) to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination, net of the corresponding tax effect. This indicator is also aligned with market practice.

Free cash flow

Free Cash Flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures including capitalised development costs, net of proceeds from disposals of tangible and intangible assets. Free Cash Flow does not include any proceeds from disposals of activity.

The most directly comparable financial measure to Free Cash Flow calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS is net cash provided by operating activities.

Funds from Operations

Funds from Operations ""FFO"" in the EBIT to FCF statement refers to the Free Cash Flow generated by Operations, before Working Capital variations.

Contract and Trade Working Capital

Contract Working Capital is the sum of:

Trade Working Capital is the Working Capital that is not strictly related to contract. It includes all the elements of the working capital but

Net cash/(debt)

The net cash/(debt) is defined as cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and other current financial asset, less borrowings.

Pay-out ratio

The pay-out ratio is calculated by dividing the amount of the overall dividend with the ""Adjusted Net profit from continuing operations attributable to equity holders of the parent, Group share"" as presented in the management report in the consolidated financial statements.

Organic basis

This press release includes performance indicators presented on a reported basis and on an organic basis. Figures given on an organic basis eliminate the impact of changes in scope of consolidation and changes resulting from the translation of the accounts into Euro following the variation of foreign currencies against the Euro.

The Group uses figures prepared on an organic basis both for internal analysis and for external communication, as it believes they provide means to analyse and explain variations from one period to another. However, these figures are not measurements of performance under IFRS.",marketscreener.com,news,Market Screener,,0.1686274509803922,452842765,7,https://www.marketscreener.com/images/twitter_MS_fdblanc.png,

The backlog reached €92 billion, providing strong visibility on future sales. Gross margin on backlog reached 17.5% as of 31 March 2024, compared to 16.9% on 31 March 2023.

In the fiscal year 2023/24, Alstom's adjusted EBIT was €997 million, up 17%, equivalent to a 5.7% aEBIT margin, and EBIT before PPA was €356 million. Adjusted net profit was €44 million, net income (group share) was €(309) million, and free cash flow was €(557) million for the full year.

On 31 March 2024, the Group's net debt position stood at €(2,994) million, compared to the €(2,135) million the Group reported on 31 March 2023. Alstom benefits from a solid €6.3 billion liquidity position and equity amounting to €8,778 million on 31 March 2024.

The Board of Directors, in its meeting of 7 May 2024, proposed that no dividend will be paid with regards to the fiscal year 2023/24.

""Alstom recorded a strong rebound during the second half of the year, with solid order intake, strong organic growth, improved profitability and €562 million free cash-flow generation. Thanks to the support of our reference shareholders, we will swiftly execute the €2 billion deleveraging plan, allowing for the stabilization of its Investment Grade rating. In April, we announced the sale of Alstom's conventional signalling business in North America at a favourable valuation, demonstrating the quality and attractiveness of the Group's assets. We are confident in the strength of our backlog and our strategy of selectivity and mix evolution towards services. The Group is capitalizing on the solid operational progress made over the last three years and is launching new initiatives to improve its industrial performance and reduce overheads and indirect procurement costs. Altogether, Alstom is now set on stronger foundations to deliver sustainable profit and cash generation."" said Henri Poupart-Lafarge, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Alstom.

Progress on Alstom's action plan to support its financial targets

During the second half of fiscal year 2023/24, the Group mobilised around the operational, commercial, and cost efficiency plan:

The €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan highlighting commitment to Investment Grade

As announced in November 2023 and reiterated in January 2024, Alstom's Board of Directors is committed to a conservative financial policy and to protect the Group's Investment Grade rating, in particular through a ca. €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan.

This plan and its execution, which have been unanimously approved by Alstom's Board of Directors, has the following components:

The ca. €2.4 billion proceeds correspond to ca. €2 billion of deleveraging, mainly due to the hybrid bond's 50% Moody's debt content.

Each of CDPQ and Bpifrance, holding respectively 17.4% and 7.5% of Alstom's capital, has declared to the Company its intention to subscribe for its pro-rata share of the capital increase.

In addition, Alstom has entered into a standby underwriting commitment with BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, J.P. Morgan and Société Générale, acting as Joint Global Coordinators, pursuant to which they have undertaken to underwrite the remainder of the capital raise (i.e. ca. €750 million), subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions precedent.

Circa €1.2 billion of the proceeds of asset disposals and of the capital markets transactions will be used to repay financial debt by September 2024:

The remainder of the proceeds will be invested in highly liquid short-term investment (cash equivalent treatment) and will be earmarked for gross debt reduction at maturity.

Alstom Baa3 long-term issuer rating is reaffirmed, and the outlook will be changed to stable upon successful closing of the hybrid bond issuance and the rights issue.

Alstom will terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following the execution of the deleveraging plan.

During the fiscal year 2023/24, the Group recorded €18.9 billion in orders, with commercial success across multiple geographies, notably in Europe, Asia/Pacific and in Americas. During the last fiscal year, Alstom reported an order intake of €20.7 billion. The (8)% decrease is mostly driven by last year's landmark contract awarded by Landesanstalt Schienenfahrzeuge Baden Württemberg (SFBW) network in Germany of almost €2.5 billion.

In Europe, Alstom recorded €11.3 billion order intake during the fiscal year 2023/24, compared with €12.8 billion over the last fiscal year.

In the U.K, Alstom has signed an eight-year extension to its Train Services Agreement (TSA) with CrossCountry. The contract extension, valued at around €950 million, further secures this long-term partnership and is evidence of the trust placed by the customer.

In France, Alstom will supply île-de-France Mobilités and RATP with 103 new MF19 trainsets, which is the new generation metro on rail, for a total contract value of more than €800 million, 100% financed by Île-de-France Mobilités. This new fleet will replace the existing rolling stock on lines 13, 12 and 8 of the Île-de-France metro as of 2027. The Group also signed a framework contract with Akiem European rolling stock leasing company for 100 Traxx Universal multi-system (MS3) locomotives, together with an initial firm order for 65 locomotives. The total amount of the framework agreement is up €500 million.

In Germany, Alstom was awarded a contract to supply 40 Coradia Stream High-Capacity electric multiple units together with full maintenance for 30 years to Nahverkehrsverbund Schleswig-Holstein (NAH.SH), valued at close to €900 million, and including an option for up to 55 additional trains with a corresponding full-service package. The Group also signed a contract with RAILPOOL for 50 Traxx Universal multi-purpose locomotives.

In Romania, Alstom, as part of a consortium with the civil works companies Gulermak and Arcada, also signed a contract with the Cluj-Napoca City Hall in Romania for the construction of the Cluj-Napoca Metro Line 1. Alstom's share of this state-of-the-art turnkey project reaches approximately €400 million.

In Italy, Alstom was awarded a contract for the supply of high-speed trains.

In Americas, Alstom reported €2.0 billion order intake, compared with €2.7 billion over the last fiscal year, driven by a contract with the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) in the United States to deliver 130 full low floor electric streetcars for Philadelphia, valued at over €667 million and with options to build an additional 30 streetcars. And the Group was awarded a contract by the Connecticut Department of Transportation (CTDOT) in the United States to supply 60 single-level rail coach cars valued at approximately €285 million with options to build an additional 313 cars, as part of CTDOT's coach renewal program for its statewide rail system.

In Asia/Pacific, the order intake stood at €3.2 billion, compared to €3.0 billion for the last fiscal year. In the Philippines, Alstom in consortium with Colas Rail has been awarded by Mitsubishi Corporation a contract to provide an integrated railway system for the extension of the North-South Commuter Railway project (NSCR). Alstom's contract share is worth approximately €1 billion. In Australia, Alstom has been awarded a contract worth around €900 million to maintain the regional rolling stock VLocity and Classic fleets in Victoria, Australia for the next decade.

In Africa/Middle East/Central Asia, the Group reported €2.4 billion order intake, compared with €2.2 billion over the last fiscal year. In Israel, Alstom, a member of the TMT Consortium (TLV Metropolitan Tramway Ltd.) and its partners Electra Ltd. & Dan Public Transportation Ltd., have reached financial closure on the contract, awarded in May 2022, to design, build, maintain, and finance the Tel Aviv Metropolitan LRT Green line by Metropolitan Mass Transit System Ltd (NTA). Alstom's share is valued at €858 million. In Saudi Arabia, Alstom signed a contract of over €500 million with The Royal Commission for AlUla (RCU) for AlUla's pioneering battery-powered tramway - the world's longest catenary-free line.

As of 31 March 2024, the backlog stood at €92 billion, providing the Group with strong visibility over future sales.

Alstom's sales amounted to €17.6 billion for the fiscal year 2023/24, representing a growth of 6.7% on a reported basis and a strong 9.4% on an organic basis compared with Alstom sales in the last fiscal year. Sales related to non-performing backlog, corresponding to sales on legacy projects with a negative margin at completion, amounted to €1.7 billion during the fiscal year 2023/24.

Rolling stock sales reached €9.1 billion, representing an increase of 3.9% on a reported basis and 6.5% on an organic basis, driven by contracts ramp-up in France, Belgium and in the US, and the solid level of execution in South Africa, India and Europe.

Services sales stood at €4.3 billion, up 11.9% on a reported basis and 14.3% on an organic basis versus last year, benefiting from the continuous ramp-up in the UK, in Italy and in the US as well as a solid level of execution in Canada.

In Signalling, Alstom reported €2.6 billion sales, up 8.9% on a reported basis and 11.8% on an organic basis versus last year, led by a consistent execution across all regions, mainly in Europe and in APAC.

Systems sales grew 6.9% on a reported basis and 9.3% on an organic basis, and stood at €1.6 billion, driven by a good performance of Turnkey Systems projects in Mexico, Egypt and Canada.

On 14 September 2023, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US department of Treasury added JSC Transmashholding (TMH AO) to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Person (SDN) List. TMH AO is the Russian holding company of TMH Group and is 100% owned by TMH Limited, and Alstom was holding a 20% stake in TMH limited. The Group further assessed potential exposures arising from the new OFAC sanctions and made the decision to sell its stake in TMH. The transaction was closed early January 2024 for an amount of €75 million, carrying value was nil as result of previous impairment, contributing to the de-risking of the company's portfolio.

On 19 April 2024, Alstom announced that it had entered into a binding agreement with Knorr-Bremse AG, to sell Alstom's North American conventional signalling business for a purchase price of around €630 million. Closing of the transaction is only subject to customary conditions, including regulatory approval, and is expected to take place as soon as summer 2024. Proceeds for Alstom at closing, net of expected tax and transaction costs, are expected to be around €620 million.

As of end of March 2024, research and development gross costs amounted to €749 million, i.e. 4.3% of sales, delivering on the Alstom In Motion strategy which is based on three pillars: Autonomous mobility, Data factory and Mobility orchestration. Net R&D amounts to €549 million before PPA amortisation.

Programs funded by IPCEI Hydrogen are ongoing. This important European program supports the development of new hydrogen trains for regional applications, shunting locos and freight, leveraging on the experience collected with Coradia iLint™ regional trains that are now in revenue service.

Homologation tests of Avelia Horizon™ are planned in 2024 to enable a start of revenue service in 2025. The development of international configurations is ongoing. Alstom has launched the development of Avelia stream™ 300, addressing the high-speed single deck segment with a first project for Italy.

The replacement of Adessia™ commuter train has been launched to address the U.K. and USA markets. This new product range will include EMU, BMU, BEMU and HMU versions to also replace the existing Diesel trains.

TRAXX™ Multi-system 3 - locomotives is pursuing homologation tests in 2024 to enable it to run on the different European corridors. It includes the passenger version which can be operated at 200kph.

Services product line is focused on addressing green, sustainable and more efficient operation concepts. Green re-tractioning initiatives include for example the retrofit with hydrogen-fuelled internal combustion engines for locomotives and the ability to provide autonomy for non-electrified lines via the so-called ""Last-mile"" functionality supported by the IPCEI H2 program.

Signalling Product Line worked on Onvia Control™ L2 A and Onvia Control™ L2 B European Standard convergence, driving market presence with its integration into TRAXX platform and securing new contracts for cross border operation, Onvia Cab™ level 2 and level 3 on-board solution together with Automatic Train Operation, and it continued its footprint expansion with a new contract in Canada.

Alstom Innovations cluster continued to develop Autonomous Mobility solutions for Passengers & Freight trains. Major milestones on the roadmap to achieve GoA4 (Grade of Automation 4) have been successfully passed under real mainline operating conditions on passengers and freight train with SNCF in France, and for operation in yard in the Netherlands.

Alstom has also made great strides in developing a new SaaS platform that will enhance its global digital offering. The platform streamlines applications integration and deployment in a trusted and future-proof ecosystem.

The adjusted EBIT margin has progressed from 5.2% over the fiscal year 2022/23 to 5.7% over the fiscal year 2023/24, benefiting from further synergies for 30bps, a steady reduction of non-performing legacy contracts sales for an impact of 30bps, an increased volume and favourable mix delivering 20bps gross margin expansion, partially offset by the negative gross margin impact related to the legacy portfolio deviations for (30)bps.

Alstom recorded restructuring and rationalisation charges of €(147) million mainly related to the reduction of overhead costs for €(115) million (""Autumn"" plan) and adaptation of the production setup for €(32) million, including the United Kingdom for €(14) million, Germany for €(8) million, France for €(3) million, Spain for €(3) million and the U.S.A. for €(2) million.

Costs related to the integration of Bombardier Transportation were recorded for an amount of €(142) million. €(118) million charges were related to some legal proceedings outside the ordinary course of business mainly for two projects - in U.S.A. and in Turkey, and for legal fees in the context of the claim against Bombardier Inc. €(30) million were related to impairment of assets due to the exit from Russia. Other exceptional expenses were recorded for €(73) million, of which €(36) million of consequential impacts from restructuring plan already initiated in Germany.

Alstom's EBIT before amortisation and impairment of assets exclusively valued when determining the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") stood at €356 million. This compares to €366 million for the last fiscal year.

The share in net income from equity investments amounted to €7 million, excluding the amortisation of the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") from Chinese joint ventures of €(10) million.

Adjusted net profit, representing the group's share of net profit from continued operations excluding PPA net of tax, amounts to €44 million for the fiscal year 2023/24. This compares to an adjusted net profit of €292 million during the last fiscal year.

The Group's Net profit/(loss) (Group share) stood at €(309) million for the fiscal year 2023/24, compared to €(132) million last fiscal year.

4. Financial structure

The Group's Free Cash Flow stands at €(557) million for the fiscal year 2023/24 as compared to €199 million during the last fiscal year and €(1,119) million at the first half of fiscal year 2023/24. Cash generation was impacted over the full year by an unfavourable €(856) million change in working capital compared to €(219) million in the last fiscal year; mostly due to change in Trade Working Capital as well as the reversal effect of the change in law on VAT in France for €(380) million. The Contract Working Capital is positively impacted by the acceleration of deliveries from major contracts in the second half of the year, strong collections of down payments as well as reduction of provision for risk on contracts.

On 31 March 2024, the Group recorded a net debt position of €(2,994) million.

In addition to its available cash and cash equivalents, amounting to €976 million on 31 March 2024, the Group benefits from strong liquidity with:

The first facility has two six-month extension options remaining at borrowers' discretion. Alstom will, however, terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following execution of the deleveraging plan.

The last two facilities have been successfully extended by one year. On 31 March 2024, the €1.75 billion RCF line had been drawn down for €175 million, while the other two lines remained undrawn.

As per its conservative liquidity policy, the €2.5 billion Revolving Credit Facility serves as a back-up of the Group €2.5 billion Negotiable European Commercial Papers program in place. With these RCF lines (€175 million drawn on the RCF on 31 March 2024), the €1.03 billion of Neu CP outstanding on 31 March 2024, the Group benefitted from a €6.3 billion liquidity available.

5. One Alstom team - Agile, Inclusive and Responsible

Decarbonization is at the heart of Alstom's strategy. The Group is reducing its Scope 1 & 2 emissions reaching 139 ktonCO2e (representing a 39% decrease compared to March 2022), while collaborating with suppliers and customers on reducing its Scope 3 footprint. First results of this collaboration can be seen through the reduction of emissions intensity of sold product reaching 4.0 gCO2e/pass.km (i.e. (13)% compared to March 2022). Alstom CO2e emissions reduction targets had been validated on the 6 of July 2023 by the independent Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) as in line with requirements to reach Paris Agreement commitments.

The supply of electricity from renewable sources has also been expanded. Alstom signed a significant Power Purchase Agreement focused on solar development in Spain. The solar farm is expected to begin operations early 2025 with a 10-years contract. The project will cover the equivalent of 80% of Alstom's electricity consumption in Europe, so this is a major step in reaching the target of 100% electricity consumption from renewables.

Regarding Diversity & Inclusion, the Alstom in Motion (AiM) 2025 strategy targets to reach 28% of women managers, engineers and professionals' roles by 2025. As of end of March 2024, 24.7% of manager, engineer and professional roles are held by women. Alstom will continue to accelerate its efforts in the coming months.

Alstom's Corporate Social Responsibility performance is regularly evaluated by various rating agencies; the Group maintained its presence among the CAC40 ESG index for the third consecutive year and the DJSI for the 13 consecutive year. Alstom improved is scoring to ECOVADIS questionnaire with a score of 77/100 and kept AA score with MSCI agency. In addition, in 2024, Alstom improved is CDP rating, moving from B to A-. Those results reflect its strong position and strategy on Sustainability.

In addition, Alstom published for the second year European Taxonomy-aligned KPIs about Sales, Capex and Opex, pursuing strong analysis initiated last year. EU Taxonomy-aligned sales amounted to 60% and ranked Alstom among best in class, confirming the importance of the sector in which Alstom operates in achieving the EU's ambition of carbon neutrality by 2050. The EU Taxonomy purpose is to redirect capital flows towards sustainable activities and help navigate transition to a low carbon economy.

The outlook for FY 2024/25 is based on following main assumptions:

FY 2024/25 Outlook:

Considering the slight dilution from disposals and the revised timing of the impact from industrial optimisation, the Group expects to reach this profitability range in FY 2026/27, versus FY 2025/26 previously.

APPENDIX 4 - NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INDICATORS DEFINITIONS

This section presents financial indicators used by the Group that are not defined by accounting standard setters.

Orders received

A new order is recognised as an order received only when the contract creates enforceable obligations between the Group and its customer. When this condition is met, the order is recognised at the contract value. If the contract is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the reporting unit, the Group requires the immediate elimination of currency exposure using forward currency sales. Orders are then measured using the spot rate at inception of hedging instruments.

Book-to-Bill

The book-to-bill ratio is the ratio of orders received to the amount of sales traded for a specific period.

Gross margin % on backlog

Gross Margin % on backlog is a KPI that presents the expected performance level of firm contracts in backlog. It represents the difference between the sales not yet recognized and the cost of sales not yet incurred from the contracts in backlog. This % is an average of the portfolio of contracts in backlog and is meaningful to project mid- and long-term profitability.

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA is a KPI that presents the level of recurring operational performance. It represents the sales minus the cost of sales, adjusted to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination as well as significant, non-recurring ""one off"" items that are not expected to occur again in subsequent years.

EBIT before PPA

Following the Bombardier Transportation acquisition and with effect from the fiscal year 2021/22 condensed consolidated financial statements, Alstom decided to introduce the ""EBIT before PPA"" KPI aimed at restating its Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (""EBIT"") to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination. This KPI is also aligned with market practice.

Adjusted EBIT

Adjusted EBIT (""aEBIT"") is the Key Performance Indicator to present the level of recurring operational performance. This indicator is also aligned with market practice and comparable to direct competitors.

Starting September 2019, Alstom has opted for the inclusion of the share in net income of the equity-accounted investments into the aEBIT when these are considered to be part of the operating activities of the Group (because there are significant operational flows and/or common project execution with these entities). This mainly includes Chinese joint-ventures, namely CASCO joint-venture for Alstom as well as, following the integration of Bombardier Transportation, Alstom Sifang (Qingdao) Transportation Ltd. (formerly Bombardier Sifang), Bombardier NUG Propulsion System Co. Ltd and Changchun Changke Alstom Railway Vehicles Company Ltd (formerly Changchun Bombardier).

aEBIT corresponds to Earning Before Interests and Tax adjusted for the following elements:

A non-recurring item is a ""one-off"" exceptional item that is not supposed to occur again in following years and that is significant.

Adjusted EBIT margin corresponds to Adjusted EBIT expressed as a percentage of sales.

EBITDA + JV dividends

EBITDA before PPA plus dividends from joint ventures is the EBIT before PPA, before depreciation and amortisation, with the addition of the dividends received from joint ventures.

Adjusted net profit

The ""Adjusted Net Profit"" KPI restates Alstom's net profit from continued operations (Group share) to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination, net of the corresponding tax effect. This indicator is also aligned with market practice.

Free cash flow

Free Cash Flow is de?ned as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures including capitalised development costs, net of proceeds from disposals of tangible and intangible assets. Free Cash Flow does not include any proceeds from disposals of activity.

The most directly comparable financial measure to Free Cash Flow calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS is net cash provided by operating activities.

Funds from Operations

Funds from Operations ""FFO"" in the EBIT to FCF statement refers to the Free Cash Flow generated by Operations, before Working Capital variations.

Contract and Trade Working Capital

Contract Working Capital is the sum of:

Trade Working Capital is the Working Capital that is not strictly related to contract. It includes all the elements of the working capital but

Net cash/(debt)

The net cash/(debt) is defined as cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and other current financial asset, less borrowings.

Pay-out ratio

The pay-out ratio is calculated by dividing the amount of the overall dividend with the ""Adjusted Net profit from continuing operations attributable to equity holders of the parent, Group share"" as presented in the management report in the consolidated financial statements.

Organic basis

This press release includes performance indicators presented on a reported basis and on an organic basis. Figures given on an organic basis eliminate the impact of changes in scope of consolidation and changes resulting from the translation of the accounts into Euro following the variation of foreign currencies against the Euro.

The Group uses figures prepared on an organic basis both for internal analysis and for external communication, as it believes they provide means to analyse and explain variations from one period to another. However, these figures are not measurements of performance under IFRS.",finanzen.at,news,finanzen.at,,0.223529411764706,452842634,7,https://www.finanzen.at/Images/FacebookIcon.jpg,eng-9548481

The backlog reached €92 billion, providing strong visibility on future sales. Gross margin on backlog reached 17.5% as of 31 March 2024, compared to 16.9% on 31 March 2023.

In the fiscal year 2023/24, Alstom's adjusted EBIT was €997 million, up 17%, equivalent to a 5.7% aEBIT margin, and EBIT before PPA was €356 million. Adjusted net profit was €44 million, net income (group share) was €(309) million, and free cash flow was €(557) million for the full year.

On 31 March 2024, the Group's net debt position stood at €(2,994) million, compared to the €(2,135) million the Group reported on 31 March 2023. Alstom benefits from a solid €6.3 billion liquidity position and equity amounting to €8,778 million on 31 March 2024.

The Board of Directors, in its meeting of 7 May 2024, proposed that no dividend will be paid with regards to the fiscal year 2023/24.

""Alstom recorded a strong rebound during the second half of the year, with solid order intake, strong organic growth, improved profitability and €562 million free cash-flow generation. Thanks to the support of our reference shareholders, we will swiftly execute the €2 billion deleveraging plan, allowing for the stabilization of its Investment Grade rating. In April, we announced the sale of Alstom's conventional signalling business in North America at a favourable valuation, demonstrating the quality and attractiveness of the Group's assets. We are confident in the strength of our backlog and our strategy of selectivity and mix evolution towards services. The Group is capitalizing on the solid operational progress made over the last three years and is launching new initiatives to improve its industrial performance and reduce overheads and indirect procurement costs. Altogether, Alstom is now set on stronger foundations to deliver sustainable profit and cash generation."" said Henri Poupart-Lafarge, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Alstom.

Progress on Alstom's action plan to support its financial targets

During the second half of fiscal year 2023/24, the Group mobilised around the operational, commercial, and cost efficiency plan:

The €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan highlighting commitment to Investment Grade

As announced in November 2023 and reiterated in January 2024, Alstom's Board of Directors is committed to a conservative financial policy and to protect the Group's Investment Grade rating, in particular through a ca. €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan.

This plan and its execution, which have been unanimously approved by Alstom's Board of Directors, has the following components:

The ca. €2.4 billion proceeds correspond to ca. €2 billion of deleveraging, mainly due to the hybrid bond's 50% Moody's debt content.

Each of CDPQ and Bpifrance, holding respectively 17.4% and 7.5% of Alstom's capital, has declared to the Company its intention to subscribe for its pro-rata share of the capital increase.

In addition, Alstom has entered into a standby underwriting commitment with BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, J.P. Morgan and Société Générale, acting as Joint Global Coordinators, pursuant to which they have undertaken to underwrite the remainder of the capital raise (i.e. ca. €750 million), subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions precedent.

Circa €1.2 billion of the proceeds of asset disposals and of the capital markets transactions will be used to repay financial debt by September 2024:

The remainder of the proceeds will be invested in highly liquid short-term investment (cash equivalent treatment) and will be earmarked for gross debt reduction at maturity.

Alstom Baa3 long-term issuer rating is reaffirmed, and the outlook will be changed to stable upon successful closing of the hybrid bond issuance and the rights issue.

Alstom will terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following the execution of the deleveraging plan.

During the fiscal year 2023/24, the Group recorded €18.9 billion in orders, with commercial success across multiple geographies, notably in Europe, Asia/Pacific and in Americas. During the last fiscal year, Alstom reported an order intake of €20.7 billion. The (8)% decrease is mostly driven by last year's landmark contract awarded by Landesanstalt Schienenfahrzeuge Baden Württemberg (SFBW) network in Germany of almost €2.5 billion.

In Europe, Alstom recorded €11.3 billion order intake during the fiscal year 2023/24, compared with €12.8 billion over the last fiscal year.

In the U.K, Alstom has signed an eight-year extension to its Train Services Agreement (TSA) with CrossCountry. The contract extension, valued at around €950 million, further secures this long-term partnership and is evidence of the trust placed by the customer.

In France, Alstom will supply île-de-France Mobilités and RATP with 103 new MF19 trainsets, which is the new generation metro on rail, for a total contract value of more than €800 million, 100% financed by Île-de-France Mobilités. This new fleet will replace the existing rolling stock on lines 13, 12 and 8 of the Île-de-France metro as of 2027.

On 14 September 2023, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US department of Treasury added JSC Transmashholding (TMH AO) to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Person (SDN) List. TMH AO is the Russian holding company of TMH Group and is 100% owned by TMH Limited, and Alstom was holding a 20% stake in TMH limited. The Group further assessed potential exposures arising from the new OFAC sanctions and made the decision to sell its stake in TMH. The transaction was closed early January 2024 for an amount of €75 million, carrying value was nil as result of previous impairment, contributing to the de-risking of the company's portfolio.

Programs funded by IPCEI Hydrogen are ongoing. This important European program supports the development of new hydrogen trains for regional applications, shunting locos and freight, leveraging on the experience collected with Coradia iLint™ regional trains that are now in revenue service.

Homologation tests of Avelia Horizon™ are planned in 2024 to enable a start of revenue service in 2025. The development of international configurations is ongoing. Alstom has launched the development of Avelia stream™ 300, addressing the high-speed single deck segment with a first project for Italy.

The replacement of Adessia™ commuter train has been launched to address the U.K. and USA markets. This new product range will include EMU, BMU, BEMU and HMU versions to also replace the existing Diesel trains.

TRAXX™ Multi-system 3 - locomotives is pursuing homologation tests in 2024 to enable it to run on the different European corridors. It includes the passenger version which can be operated at 200kph.

Services product line is focused on addressing green, sustainable and more efficient operation concepts. Green re-tractioning initiatives include for example the retrofit with hydrogen-fuelled internal combustion engines for locomotives and the ability to provide autonomy for non-electrified lines via the so-called ""Last-mile"" functionality supported by the IPCEI H2 program.

Signalling Product Line worked on Onvia Control™ L2 A and Onvia Control™ L2 B European Standard convergence, driving market presence with its integration into TRAXX platform and securing new contracts for cross border operation, Onvia Cab™ level 2 and level 3 on-board solution together with Automatic Train Operation, and it continued its footprint expansion with a new contract in Canada.

Alstom Innovations cluster continued to develop Autonomous Mobility solutions for Passengers & Freight trains. Major milestones on the roadmap to achieve GoA4 (Grade of Automation 4) have been successfully passed under real mainline operating conditions on passengers and freight train with SNCF in France, and for operation in yard in the Netherlands.

Alstom has also made great strides in developing a new SaaS platform that will enhance its global digital offering. The platform streamlines applications integration and deployment in a trusted and future-proof ecosystem.

The adjusted EBIT margin has progressed from 5.2% over the fiscal year 2022/23 to 5.7% over the fiscal year 2023/24, benefiting from further synergies for 30bps, a steady reduction of non-performing legacy contracts sales for an impact of 30bps, an increased volume and favourable mix delivering 20bps gross margin expansion, partially offset by the negative gross margin impact related to the legacy portfolio deviations for (30)bps.

Alstom recorded restructuring and rationalisation charges of €(147) million mainly related to the reduction of overhead costs for €(115) million (""Autumn"" plan) and adaptation of the production setup for €(32) million, including the United Kingdom for €(14) million, Germany for €(8) million, France for €(3) million, Spain for €(3) million and the U.S.A. for €(2) million.

Costs related to the integration of Bombardier Transportation were recorded for an amount of €(142) million. €(118) million charges were related to some legal proceedings outside the ordinary course of business mainly for two projects - in U.S.A. and in Turkey, and for legal fees in the context of the claim against Bombardier Inc. €(30) million were related to impairment of assets due to the exit from Russia. Other exceptional expenses were recorded for €(73) million, of which €(36) million of consequential impacts from restructuring plan already initiated in Germany.

4. Financial structure

The Group's Free Cash Flow stands at €(557) million for the fiscal year 2023/24 as compared to €199 million during the last fiscal year and €(1,119) million at the first half of fiscal year 2023/24. Cash generation was impacted over the full year by an unfavourable €(856) million change in working capital compared to €(219) million in the last fiscal year; mostly due to change in Trade Working Capital as well as the reversal effect of the change in law on VAT in France for €(380) million. The Contract Working Capital is positively impacted by the acceleration of deliveries from major contracts in the second half of the year, strong collections of down payments as well as reduction of provision for risk on contracts.

On 31 March 2024, the Group recorded a net debt position of €(2,994) million.

In addition to its available cash and cash equivalents, amounting to €976 million on 31 March 2024, the Group benefits from strong liquidity with:

The first facility has two six-month extension options remaining at borrowers' discretion. Alstom will, however, terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following execution of the deleveraging plan.

The last two facilities have been successfully extended by one year. On 31 March 2024, the €1.75 billion RCF line had been drawn down for €175 million, while the other two lines remained undrawn.

As per its conservative liquidity policy, the €2.5 billion Revolving Credit Facility serves as a back-up of the Group €2.5 billion Negotiable European Commercial Papers program in place. With these RCF lines (€175 million drawn on the RCF on 31 March 2024), the €1.03 billion of Neu CP outstanding on 31 March 2024, the Group benefitted from a €6.3 billion liquidity available.

5. One Alstom team - Agile, Inclusive and Responsible

Decarbonization is at the heart of Alstom's strategy. The Group is reducing its Scope 1 & 2 emissions reaching 139 ktonCO2e (representing a 39% decrease compared to March 2022), while collaborating with suppliers and customers on reducing its Scope 3 footprint. First results of this collaboration can be seen through the reduction of emissions intensity of sold product reaching 4.0 gCO2e/pass.km (i.e. (13)% compared to March 2022). Alstom CO2e emissions reduction targets had been validated on the 6 of July 2023 by the independent Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) as in line with requirements to reach Paris Agreement commitments.

The supply of electricity from renewable sources has also been expanded. Alstom signed a significant Power Purchase Agreement focused on solar development in Spain. The solar farm is expected to begin operations early 2025 with a 10-years contract. The project will cover the equivalent of 80% of Alstom's electricity consumption in Europe, so this is a major step in reaching the target of 100% electricity consumption from renewables.

Regarding Diversity & Inclusion, the Alstom in Motion (AiM) 2025 strategy targets to reach 28% of women managers, engineers and professionals' roles by 2025. As of end of March 2024, 24.7% of manager, engineer and professional roles are held by women. Alstom will continue to accelerate its efforts in the coming months.

Alstom's Corporate Social Responsibility performance is regularly evaluated by various rating agencies; the Group maintained its presence among the CAC40 ESG index for the third consecutive year and the DJSI for the 13 consecutive year. Alstom improved is scoring to ECOVADIS questionnaire with a score of 77/100 and kept AA score with MSCI agency. In addition, in 2024, Alstom improved is CDP rating, moving from B to A-. Those results reflect its strong position and strategy on Sustainability.

In addition, Alstom published for the second year European Taxonomy-aligned KPIs about Sales, Capex and Opex, pursuing strong analysis initiated last year. EU Taxonomy-aligned sales amounted to 60% and ranked Alstom among best in class, confirming the importance of the sector in which Alstom operates in achieving the EU's ambition of carbon neutrality by 2050. The EU Taxonomy purpose is to redirect capital flows towards sustainable activities and help navigate transition to a low carbon economy.

The outlook for FY 2024/25 is based on following main assumptions:

FY 2024/25 Outlook:

Considering the slight dilution from disposals and the revised timing of the impact from industrial optimisation, the Group expects to reach this profitability range in FY 2026/27, versus FY 2025/26 previously.

APPENDIX 4 - NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INDICATORS DEFINITIONS

This section presents financial indicators used by the Group that are not defined by accounting standard setters.

Orders received

A new order is recognised as an order received only when the contract creates enforceable obligations between the Group and its customer. When this condition is met, the order is recognised at the contract value. If the contract is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the reporting unit, the Group requires the immediate elimination of currency exposure using forward currency sales. Orders are then measured using the spot rate at inception of hedging instruments.

Book-to-Bill

The book-to-bill ratio is the ratio of orders received to the amount of sales traded for a specific period.

Gross margin % on backlog

Gross Margin % on backlog is a KPI that presents the expected performance level of firm contracts in backlog. It represents the difference between the sales not yet recognized and the cost of sales not yet incurred from the contracts in backlog. This % is an average of the portfolio of contracts in backlog and is meaningful to project mid- and long-term profitability.

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA is a KPI that presents the level of recurring operational performance. It represents the sales minus the cost of sales, adjusted to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination as well as significant, non-recurring ""one off"" items that are not expected to occur again in subsequent years.

EBIT before PPA

Following the Bombardier Transportation acquisition and with effect from the fiscal year 2021/22 condensed consolidated financial statements, Alstom decided to introduce the ""EBIT before PPA"" KPI aimed at restating its Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (""EBIT"") to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination. This KPI is also aligned with market practice.

Adjusted EBIT

Adjusted EBIT (""aEBIT"") is the Key Performance Indicator to present the level of recurring operational performance. This indicator is also aligned with market practice and comparable to direct competitors.

Starting September 2019, Alstom has opted for the inclusion of the share in net income of the equity-accounted investments into the aEBIT when these are considered to be part of the operating activities of the Group (because there are significant operational flows and/or common project execution with these entities). This mainly includes Chinese joint-ventures, namely CASCO joint-venture for Alstom as well as, following the integration of Bombardier Transportation, Alstom Sifang (Qingdao) Transportation Ltd. (formerly Bombardier Sifang), Bombardier NUG Propulsion System Co. Ltd and Changchun Changke Alstom Railway Vehicles Company Ltd (formerly Changchun Bombardier).

aEBIT corresponds to Earning Before Interests and Tax adjusted for the following elements:

A non-recurring item is a ""one-off"" exceptional item that is not supposed to occur again in following years and that is significant.

Adjusted EBIT margin corresponds to Adjusted EBIT expressed as a percentage of sales.

EBITDA + JV dividends

EBITDA before PPA plus dividends from joint ventures is the EBIT before PPA, before depreciation and amortisation, with the addition of the dividends received from joint ventures.

Adjusted net profit

The ""Adjusted Net Profit"" KPI restates Alstom's net profit from continued operations (Group share) to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination, net of the corresponding tax effect. This indicator is also aligned with market practice.

Free cash flow

Free Cash Flow is de?ned as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures including capitalised development costs, net of proceeds from disposals of tangible and intangible assets. Free Cash Flow does not include any proceeds from disposals of activity.

The most directly comparable financial measure to Free Cash Flow calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS is net cash provided by operating activities.

Funds from Operations

Funds from Operations ""FFO"" in the EBIT to FCF statement refers to the Free Cash Flow generated by Operations, before Working Capital variations.

Contract and Trade Working Capital

Contract Working Capital is the sum of:

Trade Working Capital is the Working Capital that is not strictly related to contract. It includes all the elements of the working capital but

Net cash/(debt)

The net cash/(debt) is defined as cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and other current financial asset, less borrowings.

Pay-out ratio

The pay-out ratio is calculated by dividing the amount of the overall dividend with the ""Adjusted Net profit from continuing operations attributable to equity holders of the parent, Group share"" as presented in the management report in the consolidated financial statements.

Organic basis

This press release includes performance indicators presented on a reported basis and on an organic basis. Figures given on an organic basis eliminate the impact of changes in scope of consolidation and changes resulting from the translation of the accounts into Euro following the variation of foreign currencies against the Euro.

The Group uses figures prepared on an organic basis both for internal analysis and for external communication, as it believes they provide means to analyse and explain variations from one period to another. However, these figures are not measurements of performance under IFRS.",finanzen.ch,news,finanzen.ch,,0.223529411764706,452842602,7,https://images.finanzen.net/mediacenter/unsortiert/facebookicon.jpg,

On 31 March 2024, the Group's net debt position stood at €(2,994) million, compared to the €(2,135) million the Group reported on 31 March 2023. Alstom benefits from a solid €6.3 billion liquidity position and equity amounting to €8,778 million on 31 March 2024.

The Board of Directors, in its meeting of 7 May 2024, proposed that no dividend will be paid with regards to the fiscal year 2023/24.

""Alstom recorded a strong rebound during the second half of the year, with solid order intake, strong organic growth, improved profitability and €562 million free cash-flow generation. Thanks to the support of our reference shareholders, we will swiftly execute the €2 billion deleveraging plan, allowing for the stabilization of its Investment Grade rating. In April, we announced the sale of Alstom's conventional signalling business in North America at a favourable valuation, demonstrating the quality and attractiveness of the Group's assets. We are confident in the strength of our backlog and our strategy of selectivity and mix evolution towards services. The Group is capitalizing on the solid operational progress made over the last three years and is launching new initiatives to improve its industrial performance and reduce overheads and indirect procurement costs. Altogether, Alstom is now set on stronger foundations to deliver sustainable profit and cash generation."" said Henri Poupart-Lafarge, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Alstom.

Progress on Alstom's action plan to support its financial targets

During the second half of fiscal year 2023/24, the Group mobilised around the operational, commercial, and cost efficiency plan:

The €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan highlighting commitment to Investment Grade

As announced in November 2023 and reiterated in January 2024, Alstom's Board of Directors is committed to a conservative financial policy and to protect the Group's Investment Grade rating, in particular through a ca. €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan.

This plan and its execution, which have been unanimously approved by Alstom's Board of Directors, has the following components:

The ca. €2.4 billion proceeds correspond to ca. €2 billion of deleveraging, mainly due to the hybrid bond's 50% Moody's debt content.

Each of CDPQ and Bpifrance, holding respectively 17.4% and 7.5% of Alstom's capital, has declared to the Company its intention to subscribe for its pro-rata share of the capital increase.

In addition, Alstom has entered into a standby underwriting commitment with BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, J.P. Morgan and Société Générale, acting as Joint Global Coordinators, pursuant to which they have undertaken to underwrite the remainder of the capital raise (i.e. ca. €750 million), subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions precedent.

Circa €1.2 billion of the proceeds of asset disposals and of the capital markets transactions will be used to repay financial debt by September 2024:

The remainder of the proceeds will be invested in highly liquid short-term investment (cash equivalent treatment) and will be earmarked for gross debt reduction at maturity.

Alstom Baa3 long-term issuer rating is reaffirmed, and the outlook will be changed to stable upon successful closing of the hybrid bond issuance and the rights issue.

Alstom will terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following the execution of the deleveraging plan.

During the fiscal year 2023/24, the Group recorded €18.9 billion in orders, with commercial success across multiple geographies, notably in Europe, Asia/Pacific and in Americas. During the last fiscal year, Alstom reported an order intake of €20.7 billion. The (8)% decrease is mostly driven by last year's landmark contract awarded by Landesanstalt Schienenfahrzeuge Baden Württemberg (SFBW) network in Germany of almost €2.5 billion.

In Europe, Alstom recorded €11.3 billion order intake during the fiscal year 2023/24, compared with €12.8 billion over the last fiscal year.

In the U.K, Alstom has signed an eight-year extension to its Train Services Agreement (TSA) with CrossCountry. The contract extension, valued at around €950 million, further secures this long-term partnership and is evidence of the trust placed by the customer.

In France, Alstom will supply île-de-France Mobilités and RATP with 103 new MF19 trainsets, which is the new generation metro on rail, for a total contract value of more than €800 million, 100% financed by Île-de-France Mobilités. This new fleet will replace the existing rolling stock on lines 13, 12 and 8 of the Île-de-France metro as of 2027. The Group also signed a framework contract with Akiem European rolling stock leasing company for 100 Traxx Universal multi-system (MS3) locomotives, together with an initial firm order for 65 locomotives.

The Group also signed a contract with RAILPOOL for 50 Traxx Universal multi-purpose locomotives.

In Romania, Alstom, as part of a consortium with the civil works companies Gulermak and Arcada, also signed a contract with the Cluj-Napoca City Hall in Romania for the construction of the Cluj-Napoca Metro Line 1. Alstom's share of this state-of-the-art turnkey project reaches approximately €400 million.

In Italy, Alstom was awarded a contract for the supply of high-speed trains.

In Americas, Alstom reported €2.0 billion order intake, compared with €2.7 billion over the last fiscal year, driven by a contract with the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) in the United States to deliver 130 full low floor electric streetcars for Philadelphia, valued at over €667 million and with options to build an additional 30 streetcars. And the Group was awarded a contract by the Connecticut Department of Transportation (CTDOT) in the United States to supply 60 single-level rail coach cars valued at approximately €285 million with options to build an additional 313 cars, as part of CTDOT's coach renewal program for its statewide rail system.

In Asia/Pacific, the order intake stood at €3.2 billion, compared to €3.0 billion for the last fiscal year. In the Philippines, Alstom in consortium with Colas Rail has been awarded by Mitsubishi Corporation a contract to provide an integrated railway system for the extension of the North-South Commuter Railway project (NSCR). Alstom's contract share is worth approximately €1 billion. In Australia, Alstom has been awarded a contract worth around €900 million to maintain the regional rolling stock VLocity and Classic fleets in Victoria, Australia for the next decade.

In Africa/Middle East/Central Asia, the Group reported €2.4 billion order intake, compared with €2.2 billion over the last fiscal year. In Israel, Alstom, a member of the TMT Consortium (TLV Metropolitan Tramway Ltd.) and its partners Electra Ltd. & Dan Public Transportation Ltd., have reached financial closure on the contract, awarded in May 2022, to design, build, maintain, and finance the Tel Aviv Metropolitan LRT Green line by Metropolitan Mass Transit System Ltd (NTA). Alstom's share is valued at €858 million. In Saudi Arabia, Alstom signed a contract of over €500 million with The Royal Commission for AlUla (RCU) for AlUla's pioneering battery-powered tramway - the world's longest catenary-free line.

As of 31 March 2024, the backlog stood at €92 billion, providing the Group with strong visibility over future sales.

Alstom's sales amounted to €17.6 billion for the fiscal year 2023/24, representing a growth of 6.7% on a reported basis and a strong 9.4% on an organic basis compared with Alstom sales in the last fiscal year. Sales related to non-performing backlog, corresponding to sales on legacy projects with a negative margin at completion, amounted to €1.7 billion during the fiscal year 2023/24.

Rolling stock sales reached €9.1 billion, representing an increase of 3.9% on a reported basis and 6.5% on an organic basis, driven by contracts ramp-up in France, Belgium and in the US, and the solid level of execution in South Africa, India and Europe.

Services sales stood at €4.3 billion, up 11.9% on a reported basis and 14.3% on an organic basis versus last year, benefiting from the continuous ramp-up in the UK, in Italy and in the US as well as a solid level of execution in Canada.

In Signalling, Alstom reported €2.6 billion sales, up 8.9% on a reported basis and 11.8% on an organic basis versus last year, led by a consistent execution across all regions, mainly in Europe and in APAC.

Systems sales grew 6.9% on a reported basis and 9.3% on an organic basis, and stood at €1.6 billion, driven by a good performance of Turnkey Systems projects in Mexico, Egypt and Canada.

On 14 September 2023, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US department of Treasury added JSC Transmashholding (TMH AO) to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Person (SDN) List. TMH AO is the Russian holding company of TMH Group and is 100% owned by TMH Limited, and Alstom was holding a 20% stake in TMH limited. The Group further assessed potential exposures arising from the new OFAC sanctions and made the decision to sell its stake in TMH. The transaction was closed early January 2024 for an amount of €75 million, carrying value was nil as result of previous impairment, contributing to the de-risking of the company's portfolio.

On 19 April 2024, Alstom announced that it had entered into a binding agreement with Knorr-Bremse AG, to sell Alstom's North American conventional signalling business for a purchase price of around €630 million. Closing of the transaction is only subject to customary conditions, including regulatory approval, and is expected to take place as soon as summer 2024. Proceeds for Alstom at closing, net of expected tax and transaction costs, are expected to be around €620 million.

As of end of March 2024, research and development gross costs amounted to €749 million, i.e. 4.3% of sales, delivering on the Alstom In Motion strategy which is based on three pillars: Autonomous mobility, Data factory and Mobility orchestration. Net R&D amounts to €549 million before PPA amortisation.

Programs funded by IPCEI Hydrogen are ongoing. This important European program supports the development of new hydrogen trains for regional applications, shunting locos and freight, leveraging on the experience collected with Coradia iLint™ regional trains that are now in revenue service.

Homologation tests of Avelia Horizon™ are planned in 2024 to enable a start of revenue service in 2025. The development of international configurations is ongoing. Alstom has launched the development of Avelia stream™ 300, addressing the high-speed single deck segment with a first project for Italy.

The replacement of Adessia™ commuter train has been launched to address the U.K. and USA markets. This new product range will include EMU, BMU, BEMU and HMU versions to also replace the existing Diesel trains.

TRAXX™ Multi-system 3 - locomotives is pursuing homologation tests in 2024 to enable it to run on the different European corridors. It includes the passenger version which can be operated at 200kph.

Services product line is focused on addressing green, sustainable and more efficient operation concepts. Green re-tractioning initiatives include for example the retrofit with hydrogen-fuelled internal combustion engines for locomotives and the ability to provide autonomy for non-electrified lines via the so-called ""Last-mile"" functionality supported by the IPCEI H2 program.

Signalling Product Line worked on Onvia Control™ L2 A and Onvia Control™ L2 B European Standard convergence, driving market presence with its integration into TRAXX platform and securing new contracts for cross border operation, Onvia Cab™ level 2 and level 3 on-board solution together with Automatic Train Operation, and it continued its footprint expansion with a new contract in Canada.

Alstom Innovations cluster continued to develop Autonomous Mobility solutions for Passengers & Freight trains. Major milestones on the roadmap to achieve GoA4 (Grade of Automation 4) have been successfully passed under real mainline operating conditions on passengers and freight train with SNCF in France, and for operation in yard in the Netherlands.

Alstom has also made great strides in developing a new SaaS platform that will enhance its global digital offering. The platform streamlines applications integration and deployment in a trusted and future-proof ecosystem.

The adjusted EBIT margin has progressed from 5.2% over the fiscal year 2022/23 to 5.7% over the fiscal year 2023/24, benefiting from further synergies for 30bps, a steady reduction of non-performing legacy contracts sales for an impact of 30bps, an increased volume and favourable mix delivering 20bps gross margin expansion, partially offset by the negative gross margin impact related to the legacy portfolio deviations for (30)bps.

Alstom recorded restructuring and rationalisation charges of €(147) million mainly related to the reduction of overhead costs for €(115) million (""Autumn"" plan) and adaptation of the production setup for €(32) million, including the United Kingdom for €(14) million, Germany for €(8) million, France for €(3) million, Spain for €(3) million and the U.S.A. for €(2) million.

Costs related to the integration of Bombardier Transportation were recorded for an amount of €(142) million. €(118) million charges were related to some legal proceedings outside the ordinary course of business mainly for two projects - in U.S.A. and in Turkey, and for legal fees in the context of the claim against Bombardier Inc. €(30) million were related to impairment of assets due to the exit from Russia. Other exceptional expenses were recorded for €(73) million, of which €(36) million of consequential impacts from restructuring plan already initiated in Germany.

Alstom's EBIT before amortisation and impairment of assets exclusively valued when determining the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") stood at €356 million. This compares to €366 million for the last fiscal year.

The share in net income from equity investments amounted to €7 million, excluding the amortisation of the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") from Chinese joint ventures of €(10) million.

Adjusted net profit, representing the group's share of net profit from continued operations excluding PPA net of tax, amounts to €44 million for the fiscal year 2023/24. This compares to an adjusted net profit of €292 million during the last fiscal year.

The Group's Net profit/(loss) (Group share) stood at €(309) million for the fiscal year 2023/24, compared to €(132) million last fiscal year.

4. Financial structure

The Group's Free Cash Flow stands at €(557) million for the fiscal year 2023/24 as compared to €199 million during the last fiscal year and €(1,119) million at the first half of fiscal year 2023/24. Cash generation was impacted over the full year by an unfavourable €(856) million change in working capital compared to €(219) million in the last fiscal year; mostly due to change in Trade Working Capital as well as the reversal effect of the change in law on VAT in France for €(380) million. The Contract Working Capital is positively impacted by the acceleration of deliveries from major contracts in the second half of the year, strong collections of down payments as well as reduction of provision for risk on contracts.

On 31 March 2024, the Group recorded a net debt position of €(2,994) million.

In addition to its available cash and cash equivalents, amounting to €976 million on 31 March 2024, the Group benefits from strong liquidity with:

The first facility has two six-month extension options remaining at borrowers' discretion. Alstom will, however, terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following execution of the deleveraging plan.

The last two facilities have been successfully extended by one year. On 31 March 2024, the €1.75 billion RCF line had been drawn down for €175 million, while the other two lines remained undrawn.

As per its conservative liquidity policy, the €2.5 billion Revolving Credit Facility serves as a back-up of the Group €2.5 billion Negotiable European Commercial Papers program in place. With these RCF lines (€175 million drawn on the RCF on 31 March 2024), the €1.03 billion of Neu CP outstanding on 31 March 2024, the Group benefitted from a €6.3 billion liquidity available.

5. One Alstom team - Agile, Inclusive and Responsible

Decarbonization is at the heart of Alstom's strategy. The Group is reducing its Scope 1 & 2 emissions reaching 139 ktonCO2e (representing a 39% decrease compared to March 2022), while collaborating with suppliers and customers on reducing its Scope 3 footprint. First results of this collaboration can be seen through the reduction of emissions intensity of sold product reaching 4.0 gCO2e/pass.km (i.e. (13)% compared to March 2022). Alstom CO2e emissions reduction targets had been validated on the 6 of July 2023 by the independent Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) as in line with requirements to reach Paris Agreement commitments.

The supply of electricity from renewable sources has also been expanded. Alstom signed a significant Power Purchase Agreement focused on solar development in Spain. The solar farm is expected to begin operations early 2025 with a 10-years contract. The project will cover the equivalent of 80% of Alstom's electricity consumption in Europe, so this is a major step in reaching the target of 100% electricity consumption from renewables.

Regarding Diversity & Inclusion, the Alstom in Motion (AiM) 2025 strategy targets to reach 28% of women managers, engineers and professionals' roles by 2025. As of end of March 2024, 24.7% of manager, engineer and professional roles are held by women. Alstom will continue to accelerate its efforts in the coming months.

Alstom's Corporate Social Responsibility performance is regularly evaluated by various rating agencies; the Group maintained its presence among the CAC40 ESG index for the third consecutive year and the DJSI for the 13 consecutive year. Alstom improved is scoring to ECOVADIS questionnaire with a score of 77/100 and kept AA score with MSCI agency. In addition, in 2024, Alstom improved is CDP rating, moving from B to A-. Those results reflect its strong position and strategy on Sustainability.

In addition, Alstom published for the second year European Taxonomy-aligned KPIs about Sales, Capex and Opex, pursuing strong analysis initiated last year. EU Taxonomy-aligned sales amounted to 60% and ranked Alstom among best in class, confirming the importance of the sector in which Alstom operates in achieving the EU's ambition of carbon neutrality by 2050. The EU Taxonomy purpose is to redirect capital flows towards sustainable activities and help navigate transition to a low carbon economy.

The outlook for FY 2024/25 is based on following main assumptions:

FY 2024/25 Outlook:

Considering the slight dilution from disposals and the revised timing of the impact from industrial optimisation, the Group expects to reach this profitability range in FY 2026/27, versus FY 2025/26 previously.

APPENDIX 4 - NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INDICATORS DEFINITIONS

This section presents financial indicators used by the Group that are not defined by accounting standard setters.

Orders received

A new order is recognised as an order received only when the contract creates enforceable obligations between the Group and its customer. When this condition is met, the order is recognised at the contract value. If the contract is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the reporting unit, the Group requires the immediate elimination of currency exposure using forward currency sales. Orders are then measured using the spot rate at inception of hedging instruments.

Book-to-Bill

The book-to-bill ratio is the ratio of orders received to the amount of sales traded for a specific period.

Gross margin % on backlog

Gross Margin % on backlog is a KPI that presents the expected performance level of firm contracts in backlog. It represents the difference between the sales not yet recognized and the cost of sales not yet incurred from the contracts in backlog. This % is an average of the portfolio of contracts in backlog and is meaningful to project mid- and long-term profitability.

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA is a KPI that presents the level of recurring operational performance. It represents the sales minus the cost of sales, adjusted to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination as well as significant, non-recurring ""one off"" items that are not expected to occur again in subsequent years.

EBIT before PPA

Following the Bombardier Transportation acquisition and with effect from the fiscal year 2021/22 condensed consolidated financial statements, Alstom decided to introduce the ""EBIT before PPA"" KPI aimed at restating its Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (""EBIT"") to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination. This KPI is also aligned with market practice.

Adjusted EBIT

Adjusted EBIT (""aEBIT"") is the Key Performance Indicator to present the level of recurring operational performance. This indicator is also aligned with market practice and comparable to direct competitors.

Starting September 2019, Alstom has opted for the inclusion of the share in net income of the equity-accounted investments into the aEBIT when these are considered to be part of the operating activities of the Group (because there are significant operational flows and/or common project execution with these entities). This mainly includes Chinese joint-ventures, namely CASCO joint-venture for Alstom as well as, following the integration of Bombardier Transportation, Alstom Sifang (Qingdao) Transportation Ltd. (formerly Bombardier Sifang), Bombardier NUG Propulsion System Co. Ltd and Changchun Changke Alstom Railway Vehicles Company Ltd (formerly Changchun Bombardier).

aEBIT corresponds to Earning Before Interests and Tax adjusted for the following elements:

A non-recurring item is a ""one-off"" exceptional item that is not supposed to occur again in following years and that is significant.

Adjusted EBIT margin corresponds to Adjusted EBIT expressed as a percentage of sales.

EBITDA + JV dividends

EBITDA before PPA plus dividends from joint ventures is the EBIT before PPA, before depreciation and amortisation, with the addition of the dividends received from joint ventures.

Adjusted net profit

The ""Adjusted Net Profit"" KPI restates Alstom's net profit from continued operations (Group share) to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination, net of the corresponding tax effect. This indicator is also aligned with market practice.

Free cash flow

Free Cash Flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures including capitalised development costs, net of proceeds from disposals of tangible and intangible assets. Free Cash Flow does not include any proceeds from disposals of activity.

The most directly comparable financial measure to Free Cash Flow calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS is net cash provided by operating activities.

Funds from Operations

Funds from Operations ""FFO"" in the EBIT to FCF statement refers to the Free Cash Flow generated by Operations, before Working Capital variations.

Contract and Trade Working Capital

Contract Working Capital is the sum of:

Trade Working Capital is the Working Capital that is not strictly related to contract. It includes all the elements of the working capital but

Net cash/(debt)

The net cash/(debt) is defined as cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and other current financial asset, less borrowings.

Pay-out ratio

The pay-out ratio is calculated by dividing the amount of the overall dividend with the ""Adjusted Net profit from continuing operations attributable to equity holders of the parent, Group share"" as presented in the management report in the consolidated financial statements.

Organic basis

This press release includes performance indicators presented on a reported basis and on an organic basis. Figures given on an organic basis eliminate the impact of changes in scope of consolidation and changes resulting from the translation of the accounts into Euro following the variation of foreign currencies against the Euro.

The Group uses figures prepared on an organic basis both for internal analysis and for external communication, as it believes they provide means to analyse and explain variations from one period to another. However, these figures are not measurements of performance under IFRS.",streetinsider.com,news,StreetInsider.com,,0.1607843137254903,452842387,7,http://www.streetinsider.com/images/silogo-new.png,eng-9548481

Sales were €17.6 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio at 1.1.

The backlog reached €92 billion, providing strong visibility on future sales. Gross margin on backlog reached 17.5% as of 31 March 2024, compared to 16.9% on 31 March 2023.

In the fiscal year 2023/24, Alstom's adjusted EBIT was €997 million, up 17%, equivalent to a 5.7% aEBIT margin, and EBIT before PPA was €356 million. Adjusted net profit was €44 million, net income (group share) was €(309) million, and free cash flow was €(557) million for the full year.

On 31 March 2024, the Group's net debt position stood at €(2,994) million, compared to the €(2,135) million the Group reported on 31 March 2023. Alstom benefits from a solid €6.3 billion liquidity position and equity amounting to €8,778 million on 31 March 2024.

The Board of Directors, in its meeting of 7 May 2024, proposed that no dividend will be paid with regards to the fiscal year 2023/24.

""Alstom recorded a strong rebound during the second half of the year, with solid order intake, strong organic growth, improved profitability and €562 million free cash-flow generation. Thanks to the support of our reference shareholders, we will swiftly execute the €2 billion deleveraging plan, allowing for the stabilization of its Investment Grade rating. In April, we announced the sale of Alstom's conventional signalling business in North America at a favourable valuation, demonstrating the quality and attractiveness of the Group's assets. We are confident in the strength of our backlog and our strategy of selectivity and mix evolution towards services. The Group is capitalizing on the solid operational progress made over the last three years and is launching new initiatives to improve its industrial performance and reduce overheads and indirect procurement costs. Altogether, Alstom is now set on stronger foundations to deliver sustainable profit and cash generation."" said Henri Poupart-Lafarge, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Alstom.

During the second half of fiscal year 2023/24, the Group mobilised around the operational, commercial, and cost efficiency plan:

As announced in November 2023 and reiterated in January 2024, Alstom's Board of Directors is committed to a conservative financial policy and to protect the Group's Investment Grade rating, in particular through a ca. €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan.

This plan and its execution, which have been unanimously approved by Alstom's Board of Directors, has the following components:

The ca. €2.4 billion proceeds correspond to ca. €2 billion of deleveraging, mainly due to the hybrid bond's 50% Moody's debt content.

Each of CDPQ[6] and Bpifrance, holding respectively 17.4% and 7.5% of Alstom's capital, has declared to the Company its intention to subscribe for its pro-rata share of the capital increase.

In addition, Alstom has entered into a standby underwriting commitment with BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, J.P. Morgan and Société Générale, acting as Joint Global Coordinators, pursuant to which they have undertaken to underwrite the remainder of the capital raise (i.e. ca. €750 million), subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions precedent.

Circa €1.2 billion of the proceeds of asset disposals and of the capital markets transactions will be used to repay financial debt by September 2024:

The remainder of the proceeds will be invested in highly liquid short-term investment (cash equivalent treatment) and will be earmarked for gross debt reduction at maturity.

Alstom Baa3 long-term issuer rating is reaffirmed, and the outlook will be changed to stable upon successful closing of the hybrid bond issuance and the rights issue.

Alstom will terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following the execution of the deleveraging plan.

***

During the fiscal year 2023/24, the Group recorded €18.9 billion in orders, with commercial success across multiple geographies, notably in Europe, Asia/Pacific and in Americas. During the last fiscal year, Alstom reported an order intake of €20.7 billion. The (8)% decrease is mostly driven by last year's landmark contract awarded by Landesanstalt Schienenfahrzeuge Baden Württemberg (SFBW) network in Germany of almost €2.5 billion.

In Europe, Alstom recorded €11.3 billion order intake during the fiscal year 2023/24, compared with €12.8 billion over the last fiscal year.

In the U.K, Alstom has signed an eight-year extension to its Train Services Agreement (TSA) with CrossCountry. The contract extension, valued at around €950 million, further secures this long-term partnership and is evidence of the trust placed by the customer.

In France, Alstom will supply île-de-France Mobilités and RATP with 103 new MF19 trainsets, which is the new generation metro on rail, for a total contract value of more than €800 million, 100% financed by Île-de-France Mobilités. This new fleet will replace the existing rolling stock on lines 13, 12 and 8 of the Île-de-France metro as of 2027. The Group also signed a framework contract with Akiem European rolling stock leasing company for 100 Traxx Universal multi-system (MS3) locomotives, together with an initial firm order for 65 locomotives. The total amount of the framework agreement is up €500 million.

In Germany, Alstom was awarded a contract to supply 40 Coradia Stream High-Capacity electric multiple units together with full maintenance for 30 years to Nahverkehrsverbund Schleswig-Holstein (NAH.SH), valued at close to €900 million, and including an option for up to 55 additional trains with a corresponding full-service package. The Group also signed a contract with RAILPOOL for 50 Traxx Universal multi-purpose locomotives.

In Romania, Alstom, as part of a consortium with the civil works companies Gulermak and Arcada, also signed a contract with the Cluj-Napoca City Hall in Romania for the construction of the Cluj-Napoca Metro Line 1. Alstom's share of this state-of-the-art turnkey project reaches approximately €400 million.

In Italy, Alstom was awarded a contract for the supply of high-speed trains.

In Americas, Alstom reported €2.0 billion order intake, compared with €2.7 billion over the last fiscal year, driven by a contract with the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) in the United States to deliver 130 full low floor electric streetcars for Philadelphia, valued at over €667 million and with options to build an additional 30 streetcars. And the Group was awarded a contract by the Connecticut Department of Transportation (CTDOT) in the United States to supply 60 single-level rail coach cars valued at approximately €285 million with options to build an additional 313 cars, as part of CTDOT's coach renewal program for its statewide rail system.

In Asia/Pacific, the order intake stood at €3.2 billion, compared to €3.0 billion for the last fiscal year. In the Philippines, Alstom in consortium with Colas Rail has been awarded by Mitsubishi Corporation a contract to provide an integrated railway system for the extension of the North-South Commuter Railway project (NSCR). Alstom's contract share is worth approximately €1 billion.

In Africa/Middle East/Central Asia, the Group reported €2.4 billion order intake, compared with €2.2 billion over the last fiscal year. In Israel, Alstom, a member of the TMT Consortium (TLV Metropolitan Tramway Ltd.) and its partners Electra Ltd. & Dan Public Transportation Ltd., have reached financial closure on the contract, awarded in May 2022, to design, build, maintain, and finance the Tel Aviv Metropolitan LRT Green line by Metropolitan Mass Transit System Ltd (NTA). Alstom's share is valued at €858 million. In Saudi Arabia, Alstom signed a contract of over €500 million with The Royal Commission for AlUla (RCU) for AlUla's pioneering battery-powered tramway - the world's longest catenary-free line.

As of 31 March 2024, the backlog stood at €92 billion, providing the Group with strong visibility over future sales.

Alstom's sales amounted to €17.6 billion for the fiscal year 2023/24, representing a growth of 6.7% on a reported basis and a strong 9.4% on an organic basis compared with Alstom sales in the last fiscal year. Sales related to non-performing backlog, corresponding to sales on legacy projects with a negative margin at completion, amounted to €1.7 billion during the fiscal year 2023/24.

Rolling stock sales reached €9.1 billion, representing an increase of 3.9% on a reported basis and 6.5% on an organic basis, driven by contracts ramp-up in France, Belgium and in the US, and the solid level of execution in South Africa, India and Europe.

Services sales stood at €4.3 billion, up 11.9% on a reported basis and 14.3% on an organic basis versus last year, benefiting from the continuous ramp-up in the UK, in Italy and in the US as well as a solid level of execution in Canada.

In Signalling, Alstom reported €2.6 billion sales, up 8.9% on a reported basis and 11.8% on an organic basis versus last year, led by a consistent execution across all regions, mainly in Europe and in APAC.

Systems sales grew 6.9% on a reported basis and 9.3% on an organic basis, and stood at €1.6 billion, driven by a good performance of Turnkey Systems projects in Mexico, Egypt and Canada.

On 14 September 2023, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US department of Treasury added JSC Transmashholding (TMH AO) to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Person (SDN) List. TMH AO is the Russian holding company of TMH Group and is 100% owned by TMH Limited, and Alstom was holding a 20% stake in TMH limited. The Group further assessed potential exposures arising from the new OFAC sanctions and made the decision to sell its stake in TMH. The transaction was closed early January 2024 for an amount of €75 million, carrying value was nil as result of previous impairment, contributing to the de-risking of the company's portfolio.

On 19 April 2024, Alstom announced that it had entered into a binding agreement with Knorr-Bremse AG, to sell Alstom's North American conventional signalling business for a purchase price of around €630 million. Closing of the transaction is only subject to customary conditions, including regulatory approval, and is expected to take place as soon as summer 2024. Proceeds for Alstom at closing, net of expected tax and transaction costs, are expected to be around €620 million.

The adjusted EBIT margin has progressed from 5.2% over the fiscal year 2022/23 to 5.7% over the fiscal year 2023/24, benefiting from further synergies for 30bps, a steady reduction of non-performing legacy contracts sales for an impact of 30bps, an increased volume and favourable mix delivering 20bps gross margin expansion, partially offset by the negative gross margin impact related to the legacy portfolio deviations for (30)bps.

Alstom recorded restructuring and rationalisation charges of €(147) million mainly related to the reduction of overhead costs for €(115) million (""Autumn"" plan) and adaptation of the production setup for €(32) million, including the United Kingdom for €(14) million, Germany for €(8) million, France for €(3) million, Spain for €(3) million and the U.S.A. for €(2) million.

Costs related to the integration of Bombardier Transportation were recorded for an amount of €(142) million. €(118) million charges were related to some legal proceedings outside the ordinary course of business mainly for two projects - in U.S.A. and in Turkey, and for legal fees in the context of the claim against Bombardier Inc. €(30) million were related to impairment of assets due to the exit from Russia. Other exceptional expenses were recorded for €(73) million, of which €(36) million of consequential impacts from restructuring plan already initiated in Germany.

Alstom's EBIT before amortisation and impairment of assets exclusively valued when determining the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") stood at €356 million. This compares to €366 million for the last fiscal year.

The share in net income from equity investments amounted to €7 million, excluding the amortisation of the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") from Chinese joint ventures of €(10) million.

Adjusted net profit, representing the group's share of net profit from continued operations excluding PPA net of tax, amounts to €44 million for the fiscal year 2023/24. This compares to an adjusted net profit of €292 million during the last fiscal year.

The Group's Net profit/(loss) (Group share) stood at €(309) million for the fiscal year 2023/24, compared to €(132) million last fiscal year.

***

The Group's Free Cash Flow stands at €(557) million for the fiscal year 2023/24 as compared to €199 million during the last fiscal year and €(1,119) million at the first half of fiscal year 2023/24. Cash generation was impacted over the full year by an unfavourable €(856) million change in working capital compared to €(219) million in the last fiscal year; mostly due to change in Trade Working Capital as well as the reversal effect of the change in law on VAT in France for €(380) million. The Contract Working Capital is positively impacted by the acceleration of deliveries from major contracts in the second half of the year, strong collections of down payments as well as reduction of provision for risk on contracts.

On 31 March 2024, the Group recorded a net debt position of €(2,994) million.

In addition to its available cash and cash equivalents, amounting to €976 million on 31 March 2024, the Group benefits from strong liquidity with:

The first facility has two six-month extension options remaining at borrowers' discretion. Alstom will, however, terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following execution of the deleveraging plan.

The last two facilities have been successfully extended by one year. On 31 March 2024, the €1.75 billion RCF line had been drawn down for €175 million, while the other two lines remained undrawn.

As per its conservative liquidity policy, the €2.5 billion Revolving Credit Facility serves as a back-up of the Group €2.5 billion Negotiable European Commercial Papers program in place. With these RCF lines (€175 million drawn on the RCF on 31 March 2024), the €1.03 billion of Neu CP outstanding on 31 March 2024, the Group benefitted from a €6.3 billion liquidity available.

***

Decarbonization is at the heart of Alstom's strategy. The Group is reducing its Scope 1 & 2 emissions reaching 139 ktonCO2e (representing a 39% decrease compared to March 2022), while collaborating with suppliers and customers on reducing its Scope 3 footprint. First results of this collaboration can be seen through the reduction of emissions intensity of sold product reaching 4.0 gCO2e/pass.km (i.e. (13)% compared to March 2022). Alstom CO2e emissions reduction targets had been validated on the 6 of July 2023 by the independent Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) as in line with requirements to reach Paris Agreement commitments.

The supply of electricity from renewable sources has also been expanded. Alstom signed a significant Power Purchase Agreement focused on solar development in Spain. The solar farm is expected to begin operations early 2025 with a 10-years contract. The project will cover the equivalent of 80% of Alstom's electricity consumption in Europe, so this is a major step in reaching the target of 100% electricity consumption from renewables.

Regarding Diversity & Inclusion, the Alstom in Motion (AiM) 2025 strategy targets to reach 28% of women managers, engineers and professionals' roles by 2025. As of end of March 2024, 24.7% of manager, engineer and professional roles are held by women. Alstom will continue to accelerate its efforts in the coming months.

Alstom's Corporate Social Responsibility performance is regularly evaluated by various rating agencies; the Group maintained its presence among the CAC40 ESG index for the third consecutive year and the DJSI for the 13 consecutive year. Alstom improved is scoring to ECOVADIS questionnaire with a score of 77/100 and kept AA score with MSCI agency. In addition, in 2024, Alstom improved is CDP rating, moving from B to A-. Those results reflect its strong position and strategy on Sustainability.

In addition, Alstom published for the second year European Taxonomy-aligned KPIs about Sales, Capex and Opex, pursuing strong analysis initiated last year. EU Taxonomy-aligned sales amounted to 60% and ranked Alstom among best in class, confirming the importance of the sector in which Alstom operates in achieving the EU's ambition of carbon neutrality by 2050. The EU Taxonomy purpose is to redirect capital flows towards sustainable activities and help navigate transition to a low carbon economy.

The outlook for FY 2024/25 is based on following main assumptions:

Considering the slight dilution from disposals and the revised timing of the impact from industrial optimisation, the Group expects to reach this profitability range in FY 2026/27, versus FY 2025/26 previously.

APPENDIX 4 - NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INDICATORS DEFINITIONS

This section presents financial indicators used by the Group that are not defined by accounting standard setters.

Orders received

A new order is recognised as an order received only when the contract creates enforceable obligations between the Group and its customer. When this condition is met, the order is recognised at the contract value. If the contract is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the reporting unit, the Group requires the immediate elimination of currency exposure using forward currency sales. Orders are then measured using the spot rate at inception of hedging instruments.

Book-to-Bill

The book-to-bill ratio is the ratio of orders received to the amount of sales traded for a specific period.

Gross margin % on backlog

Gross Margin % on backlog is a KPI that presents the expected performance level of firm contracts in backlog. It represents the difference between the sales not yet recognized and the cost of sales not yet incurred from the contracts in backlog. This % is an average of the portfolio of contracts in backlog and is meaningful to project mid- and long-term profitability.

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA is a KPI that presents the level of recurring operational performance. It represents the sales minus the cost of sales, adjusted to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination as well as significant, non-recurring ""one off"" items that are not expected to occur again in subsequent years.

EBIT before PPA

Following the Bombardier Transportation acquisition and with effect from the fiscal year 2021/22 condensed consolidated financial statements, Alstom decided to introduce the ""EBIT before PPA"" KPI aimed at restating its Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (""EBIT"") to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination. This KPI is also aligned with market practice.

Adjusted EBIT

Adjusted EBIT (""aEBIT"") is the Key Performance Indicator to present the level of recurring operational performance. This indicator is also aligned with market practice and comparable to direct competitors.

Starting September 2019, Alstom has opted for the inclusion of the share in net income of the equity-accounted investments into the aEBIT when these are considered to be part of the operating activities of the Group (because there are significant operational flows and/or common project execution with these entities). This mainly includes Chinese joint-ventures, namely CASCO joint-venture for Alstom as well as, following the integration of Bombardier Transportation, Alstom Sifang (Qingdao) Transportation Ltd. (formerly Bombardier Sifang), Bombardier NUG Propulsion System Co. Ltd and Changchun Changke Alstom Railway Vehicles Company Ltd (formerly Changchun Bombardier).

aEBIT corresponds to Earning Before Interests and Tax adjusted for the following elements:

A non-recurring item is a ""one-off"" exceptional item that is not supposed to occur again in following years and that is significant.

Adjusted EBIT margin corresponds to Adjusted EBIT expressed as a percentage of sales.

EBITDA + JV dividends

EBITDA before PPA plus dividends from joint ventures is the EBIT before PPA, before depreciation and amortisation, with the addition of the dividends received from joint ventures.

Adjusted net profit

The ""Adjusted Net Profit"" KPI restates Alstom's net profit from continued operations (Group share) to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination, net of the corresponding tax effect. This indicator is also aligned with market practice.

Free cash flow

Free Cash Flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures including capitalised development costs, net of proceeds from disposals of tangible and intangible assets. Free Cash Flow does not include any proceeds from disposals of activity.

The most directly comparable financial measure to Free Cash Flow calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS is net cash provided by operating activities.

Funds from Operations

Funds from Operations ""FFO"" in the EBIT to FCF statement refers to the Free Cash Flow generated by Operations, before Working Capital variations.

Trade Working Capital is the Working Capital that is not strictly related to contract. It includes all the elements of the working capital but

Net cash/(debt)

The net cash/(debt) is defined as cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and other current financial asset, less borrowings.

Pay-out ratio

The pay-out ratio is calculated by dividing the amount of the overall dividend with the ""Adjusted Net profit from continuing operations attributable to equity holders of the parent, Group share"" as presented in the management report in the consolidated financial statements.

Organic basis

This press release includes performance indicators presented on a reported basis and on an organic basis. Figures given on an organic basis eliminate the impact of changes in scope of consolidation and changes resulting from the translation of the accounts into Euro following the variation of foreign currencies against the Euro.

The Group uses figures prepared on an organic basis both for internal analysis and for external communication, as it believes they provide means to analyse and explain variations from one period to another. However, these figures are not measurements of performance under IFRS.

Meanwhile, Blue Capsule has signed a partnership agreement with the French Alternative Energies & Atomic Energy Commission, from which it was spun off, for the development of its small modular reactor.

Thorizon - a spin-off from NRG, which operates the High Flux Reactor in Petten - is developing a 250 MWt/100 MWe molten salt reactor (MSR), targeted at large industrial customers and utilities. Thorizon aims to construct a pilot reactor system before 2035.

MSRs use molten fluoride salts as primary coolant, at low pressure. They may operate with epithermal or fast neutron spectrums, and with a variety of fuels. Much of the interest today in reviving the MSR concept relates to using thorium (to breed fissile uranium-233), where an initial source of fissile material such as plutonium-239 needs to be provided. There are a number of different MSR design concepts, and a number of interesting challenges in the commercialisation of many, especially with thorium.

The molten salt fuel adopted by Thorizon uses a combination of long-lived elements from reprocessed used nuclear fuel and thorium. The reactor will be able to recycle long-lived waste from existing nuclear facilities. The Thorizon One concept is unique in that the core is composed of a set of cartridges that is replaced every five to ten years. This, the company says, overcomes two molten salt design obstacles: material corrosion and handling of used fuel volumes.

Under the new agreement, EDF R&D will review Thorizon's neutronic core calculations and conduct scenario analyses to determine how the Thorizon One could help to close the fuel cycle in the European reactor fleet.

Thorizon said it will ""benefit from EDF's expertise as the French leader in electricity production, and in particular from the recognised skills of its R&D researchers"".

""The R&D team covers all disciplines from neutronics and fuel to safety and construction,"" said Bernard Salha, EDF R&D Director and EDF Group Chief Technical Officer. ""We are actively supporting several start-ups in the France 2030 programme. The cartridge-based approach of Thorizon is interesting and promising.""

""It is a pleasure to work with the EDF team which has more experience in nuclear than any company across the globe,"" added Thorizon CEO Kiki Lauwers. ""Thanks to EDF R&D, start-ups like us benefit from access to unique industry experts that can very quickly spot the strengths and areas for improvements in our design. We hope we can continue to work with the EDF R&D team on the realisation of our technology in the future. We believe all solutions are needed to empower the energy transition and the Thorizon One can be a great compliment to the existing and planned nuclear fleet.""

Horizon says its ambition is to develop an MSR that ""can be realised rapidly and smartly, is 'walk-away' safe, and takes a first step towards circularity by using long-lived nuclear waste as a fuel source"". The company aims to build a non-nuclear molten salt demonstrator in the short-term and finalise the detailed design to start building a first-of-a-kind Thorizon One reactor by 2030.

Decarbonising industry

Blue Capsule - a spin-off from France's Alternative Energies & Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) - has announced the signing of a partnership agreement with the CEA for the development of its small modular reactor (SMR) that will supply heat and power to industry.

Aix-en-Provence-based Blue Capsule is developing a sodium-cooled, high-temperature SMR which can provide 150 MW of heat at 700°C, along with high-temperature steam and electricity. The company aims to decarbonise industrial sites used for ammonia and soda ash production, with subterranean capsules co-located onsite, close to demand.

Under the new agreement - with financial support from French public investment bank Bpifrance - CEA's support for Blue Capsule will extend to fields such as equipment and components, materials, calculation codes and TRISO-based fuel.

""France's leadership in the fields of nuclear energy and low-carbon solutions is creating big opportunities for industry right across the country,"" said Blue Capsule's reactor architect Domnin Erard. ""And for Blue Capsule, collaboration with the French nuclear sector is front and centre of our strategy.

""This vital partnership with the CEA means that Blue Capsule benefits from world-class expertise across the board. It lays the foundations for our future industrial cooperation with the French nuclear supply chain, for manufacturing and assembling Blue Capsule units.

""It all comes down to cutting industrial CO2 emissions and of course the re-industrialisation of communities in France and beyond. For our part, we'll do everything we can to help achieve that objective.""

Blue Capsule is planning to build a proof-of-concept sodium loop and a non-nuclear prototype by 2030. The company's first-of-a-kind SMR is scheduled for construction by 2035 and is set to be built in France.",world-nuclear-news.org,news,World Nuclear News (WNN),,0.1372549019607843,454689557,3,,

Chinese universities have been gaining popularity among African students thanks to the offering of scholarships as well as China's growing reputation in technology and development.30 Therefore, as Figure 4 shows, China is the second-most popular destination for Africans seeking higher education abroad, with roughly 81,600 students; France is the most popular (126,300 students) and the United States is the third-most popular (48,300 students). However, China's immigration policy is much tighter than the policies in European and North American countries. Therefore, most Africans studying in China tend to return home upon the completion of their studies instead of staying abroad, significantly reducing the prospects of ""brain drain"" for Africa.

China-Africa educational institutions are also maintaining strong collaboration. Sixty-one Confucius Institutes and forty-eight programs have been established in forty-eight African countries as of 2021. Additionally, China has supported over thirty African universities to set up departments or programs to study Chinese language. Luban Workshops in Djibouti, Egypt, Kenya, and South Africa have provided Chinese-style vocational training to African technicians, even when international travel has been restricted due to the COVID pandemic. Conversely, universities in China have added new courses for African languages, such as Amharic, Malagasy, and Zulu. Furthermore, the Plan for China-Africa Cooperation on Talent Development, announced in August 2023, has pledged to train 500 principals and high-calibre teachers of vocational colleges every year, as well as 10,000 technical personnel with both Chinese language and vocational skills for Africa. The number of cooperating Chinese and African universities will be increased from 20+20 to 50+50. However, there are occasionally reports about African students' complaints related to Chinese teachers' English proficiency, internship and employment opportunities, as well as administrative services. If the education quality does not improve, the quantitative growth in cooperating universities may not be sustainable.

Media and cultural exchanges between African countries and China have increased since the start of the pandemic, largely due to the use of digital technologies. The Chinese cable television operator StarTimes provided 13 million subscribers in Africa with programs in eleven languages as of November 2021. TikTok, cell phone maker Transsion, and other Chinese internet companies greatly boost the formation of Africa's mobile media sphere. Chinese and African entertainment industries have been deepening their collaboration as well, with the joint production and broadcasting of movies and television series. Two notable series, Welcome to Milele Village (2023) and Ebola Fighters (2021), depicted Chinese medical teams in Africa and gained popularity among Chinese audiences. Soccer players from Angola, Cameroon, Ghana, and Nigeria have joined clubs in China's Premier league and A-level league. Chinese tourists are now also interested in taking historical tours and immersing themselves in African culture, as well as exploring the country's natural landscape. A number of African countries, including most recently Egypt, Mauritius, Morocco, and Tunisia, have been providing visa-free or visa-on-arrival entries to Chinese visitors to foster tourism. Echoing the movement, China's Ministry of Culture and Tourism has listed thirty-four African countries as destinations for group tours.

Conclusion

China's economic growth is slowing from the double digits of previous decades as policymakers steer the economy toward a more high-tech, consumption-oriented, and environmentally sustainable growth model with reduced exposure to geopolitical shocks. And this economic transition will increasingly have implications for China's international economic relations with the rest of the world. As discussed above, across the five domains of China's economic engagement with Africa -- trade, investment, fiscal stabilization, RMB internationalization, and people-to-people ties -- both strong continuities and changes are evident. But this engagement is not happening in a vacuum. Policy directions within African countries and third parties such as the United States will greatly shape how these changes in the China-Africa relationship continue to unfold.

The changing patterns of trade between African countries and China will be shaped by policies in both advanced economies and African countries themselves. Rising barriers to market access in advanced economies are likely to push African countries further into the embrace of China. Between 2021 and 2024, the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden has suspended a record eight African countries from the U.S. trade preference program, the African Growth and Opportunity Act. Meanwhile, the European Union's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, which began its initial transitional phase in October 2023, could make it even more difficult for African manufacturers to export to the European market and reduce the continent's GDP by up to $25 billion. Although individual European countries like France seek to expand their trade with Anglophone African countries, for instance, and the United Kingdom recently signed a trade deal with Kenya, this may not be sufficient to offset the wide-ranging impacts of market-restricting policies like the CBAM. Furthermore, growing China-Africa trade volumes will continue to be characterized by trade deficits. To address these deficits, African countries need to make a concerted effort to diversify their exports to China. Important steps to take include implementing the AfCFTA to create regional value chains, utilizing trade preference programs particularly the green lanes initiative -- as Kenya and Namibia are doing -- to export semi-processed agriculture produce to China and emulating the Indonesian approach to pressure Chinese companies to invest in the refining and processing of minerals in African countries.

As Chinese investments in Africa shift from infrastructure-oriented projects toward industrialization-oriented projects, African policy responses and the ability of Western countries to fill infrastructure financing gaps will be crucial. Chinese FDI flows for processing and manufacturing in various sectors -- whether related to agriculture, minerals and metals, construction material, or apparel -- are contingent on requirements in the domestic business environment that are within the remit of African governments. Basic requirements include the availability of affordable and reliable electricity, good transportation networks, skilled local workers, security, and the ability to compel Chinese companies to enter into joint ventures with local African firms for technology transfer. Whether the United States and its allies in Europe and Japan can step into the space being vacated by Chinese policy banks to provide infrastructure financing in Africa is an open question. Implementation of the Lobito Corridor project, a signature initiative of the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII), will test the G7's commitment to the scaling up of infrastructure investments in Africa. Whether the United States continues to prioritize the PGII by ensuring the program's continuity or incorporating new infrastructure projects remains to be seen -- especially if a new U.S. administration comes into office in January 2025.

Expansion of China's rescue-lending efforts and internationalization of the RMB in Africa are significantly dependent on African countries' own demand for and uptake of these initiatives. Will a growing number of African countries look to China, as an alternative to the IMF, for emergency liquidity support as their ability to finance imports diminish due to fiscal crises? Will there be a growing appetite among African countries for more central bank currency swap lines with the PBOC, and will there be increased drawdowns of yuan reserves? As African countries struggle to find scarce foreign exchange resources to settle and invoice their trade, will they follow the trend among some Asian countries in using the RMB for their bilateral trade with China? The answer to these questions may lie largely in whether the United States and its allies in Europe will provide sufficient measures to support African countries to overcome the latest bout of debt distress and fiscal crises.

Finally, China's loosening of pandemic-era travel restrictions and the phenomenon of digitalization will accelerate the increasing trend of people-to-people exchanges with African countries in higher education, media, and culture. Developments in China's immigration policy will be important to track as it begins to roll out visa-free travel for a select number of European and Asian countries. The hardening of visa regimes in Canada, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the United States, and other Western countries will also be important to monitor, as it could affect these countries' historically robust people-to-people exchanges with African countries.

Chinese universities have been gaining popularity among African students thanks to the offering of scholarships as well as China's growing reputation in technology and development.30 Therefore, as Figure 4 shows, China is the second-most popular destination for Africans seeking higher education abroad, with roughly 81,600 students; France is the most popular (126,300 students) and the United States is the third-most popular (48,300 students). However, China's immigration policy is much tighter than the policies in European and North American countries. Therefore, most Africans studying in China tend to return home upon the completion of their studies instead of staying abroad, significantly reducing the prospects of ""brain drain"" for Africa.

China-Africa educational institutions are also maintaining strong collaboration. Sixty-one Confucius Institutes and forty-eight programs have been established in forty-eight African countries as of 2021. Additionally, China has supported over thirty African universities to set up departments or programs to study Chinese language. Luban Workshops in Djibouti, Egypt, Kenya, and South Africa have provided Chinese-style vocational training to African technicians, even when international travel has been restricted due to the COVID pandemic. Conversely, universities in China have added new courses for African languages, such as Amharic, Malagasy, and Zulu. Furthermore, the Plan for China-Africa Cooperation on Talent Development, announced in August 2023, has pledged to train 500 principals and high-calibre teachers of vocational colleges every year, as well as 10,000 technical personnel with both Chinese language and vocational skills for Africa. The number of cooperating Chinese and African universities will be increased from 20+20 to 50+50. However, there are occasionally reports about African students' complaints related to Chinese teachers' English proficiency, internship and employment opportunities, as well as administrative services. If the education quality does not improve, the quantitative growth in cooperating universities may not be sustainable.

Media and cultural exchanges between African countries and China have increased since the start of the pandemic, largely due to the use of digital technologies. The Chinese cable television operator StarTimes provided 13 million subscribers in Africa with programs in eleven languages as of November 2021. TikTok, cell phone maker Transsion, and other Chinese internet companies greatly boost the formation of Africa's mobile media sphere. Chinese and African entertainment industries have been deepening their collaboration as well, with the joint production and broadcasting of movies and television series. Two notable series, Welcome to Milele Village (2023) and Ebola Fighters (2021), depicted Chinese medical teams in Africa and gained popularity among Chinese audiences. Soccer players from Angola, Cameroon, Ghana, and Nigeria have joined clubs in China's Premier league and A-level league. Chinese tourists are now also interested in taking historical tours and immersing themselves in African culture, as well as exploring the country's natural landscape. A number of African countries, including most recently Egypt, Mauritius, Morocco, and Tunisia, have been providing visa-free or visa-on-arrival entries to Chinese visitors to foster tourism. Echoing the movement, China's Ministry of Culture and Tourism has listed thirty-four African countries as destinations for group tours.

Conclusion

China's economic growth is slowing from the double digits of previous decades as policymakers steer the economy toward a more high-tech, consumption-oriented, and environmentally sustainable growth model with reduced exposure to geopolitical shocks. And this economic transition will increasingly have implications for China's international economic relations with the rest of the world. As discussed above, across the five domains of China's economic engagement with Africa -- trade, investment, fiscal stabilization, RMB internationalization, and people-to-people ties -- both strong continuities and changes are evident. But this engagement is not happening in a vacuum. Policy directions within African countries and third parties such as the United States will greatly shape how these changes in the China-Africa relationship continue to unfold.

The changing patterns of trade between African countries and China will be shaped by policies in both advanced economies and African countries themselves. Rising barriers to market access in advanced economies are likely to push African countries further into the embrace of China. Between 2021 and 2024, the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden has suspended a record eight African countries from the U.S. trade preference program, the African Growth and Opportunity Act. Meanwhile, the European Union's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, which began its initial transitional phase in October 2023, could make it even more difficult for African manufacturers to export to the European market and reduce the continent's GDP by up to $25 billion. Although individual European countries like France seek to expand their trade with Anglophone African countries, for instance, and the United Kingdom recently signed a trade deal with Kenya, this may not be sufficient to offset the wide-ranging impacts of market-restricting policies like the CBAM. Furthermore, growing China-Africa trade volumes will continue to be characterized by trade deficits. To address these deficits, African countries need to make a concerted effort to diversify their exports to China. Important steps to take include implementing the AfCFTA to create regional value chains, utilizing trade preference programs particularly the green lanes initiative -- as Kenya and Namibia are doing -- to export semi-processed agriculture produce to China and emulating the Indonesian approach to pressure Chinese companies to invest in the refining and processing of minerals in African countries.

As Chinese investments in Africa shift from infrastructure-oriented projects toward industrialization-oriented projects, African policy responses and the ability of Western countries to fill infrastructure financing gaps will be crucial. Chinese FDI flows for processing and manufacturing in various sectors -- whether related to agriculture, minerals and metals, construction material, or apparel -- are contingent on requirements in the domestic business environment that are within the remit of African governments. Basic requirements include the availability of affordable and reliable electricity, good transportation networks, skilled local workers, security, and the ability to compel Chinese companies to enter into joint ventures with local African firms for technology transfer. Whether the United States and its allies in Europe and Japan can step into the space being vacated by Chinese policy banks to provide infrastructure financing in Africa is an open question. Implementation of the Lobito Corridor project, a signature initiative of the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII), will test the G7's commitment to the scaling up of infrastructure investments in Africa. Whether the United States continues to prioritize the PGII by ensuring the program's continuity or incorporating new infrastructure projects remains to be seen -- especially if a new U.S. administration comes into office in January 2025.

Expansion of China's rescue-lending efforts and internationalization of the RMB in Africa are significantly dependent on African countries' own demand for and uptake of these initiatives. Will a growing number of African countries look to China, as an alternative to the IMF, for emergency liquidity support as their ability to finance imports diminish due to fiscal crises? Will there be a growing appetite among African countries for more central bank currency swap lines with the PBOC, and will there be increased drawdowns of yuan reserves? As African countries struggle to find scarce foreign exchange resources to settle and invoice their trade, will they follow the trend among some Asian countries in using the RMB for their bilateral trade with China? The answer to these questions may lie largely in whether the United States and its allies in Europe will provide sufficient measures to support African countries to overcome the latest bout of debt distress and fiscal crises.

Finally, China's loosening of pandemic-era travel restrictions and the phenomenon of digitalization will accelerate the increasing trend of people-to-people exchanges with African countries in higher education, media, and culture. Developments in China's immigration policy will be important to track as it begins to roll out visa-free travel for a select number of European and Asian countries. The hardening of visa regimes in Canada, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the United States, and other Western countries will also be important to monitor, as it could affect these countries' historically robust people-to-people exchanges with African countries.

Chinese universities have been gaining popularity among African students thanks to the offering of scholarships as well as China's growing reputation in technology and development.30 Therefore, as Figure 4 shows, China is the second-most popular destination for Africans seeking higher education abroad, with roughly 81,600 students; France is the most popular (126,300 students) and the United States is the third-most popular (48,300 students). However, China's immigration policy is much tighter than the policies in European and North American countries. Therefore, most Africans studying in China tend to return home upon the completion of their studies instead of staying abroad, significantly reducing the prospects of ""brain drain"" for Africa.

China-Africa educational institutions are also maintaining strong collaboration. Sixty-one Confucius Institutes and forty-eight programs have been established in forty-eight African countries as of 2021. Additionally, China has supported over thirty African universities to set up departments or programs to study Chinese language. Luban Workshops in Djibouti, Egypt, Kenya, and South Africa have provided Chinese-style vocational training to African technicians, even when international travel has been restricted due to the COVID pandemic. Conversely, universities in China have added new courses for African languages, such as Amharic, Malagasy, and Zulu. Furthermore, the Plan for China-Africa Cooperation on Talent Development, announced in August 2023, has pledged to train 500 principals and high-calibre teachers of vocational colleges every year, as well as 10,000 technical personnel with both Chinese language and vocational skills for Africa. The number of cooperating Chinese and African universities will be increased from 20+20 to 50+50. However, there are occasionally reports about African students' complaints related to Chinese teachers' English proficiency, internship and employment opportunities, as well as administrative services. If the education quality does not improve, the quantitative growth in cooperating universities may not be sustainable.

Media and cultural exchanges between African countries and China have increased since the start of the pandemic, largely due to the use of digital technologies. The Chinese cable television operator StarTimes provided 13 million subscribers in Africa with programs in eleven languages as of November 2021. TikTok, cell phone maker Transsion, and other Chinese internet companies greatly boost the formation of Africa's mobile media sphere. Chinese and African entertainment industries have been deepening their collaboration as well, with the joint production and broadcasting of movies and television series. Two notable series, Welcome to Milele Village (2023) and Ebola Fighters (2021), depicted Chinese medical teams in Africa and gained popularity among Chinese audiences. Soccer players from Angola, Cameroon, Ghana, and Nigeria have joined clubs in China's Premier league and A-level league. Chinese tourists are now also interested in taking historical tours and immersing themselves in African culture, as well as exploring the country's natural landscape. A number of African countries, including most recently Egypt, Mauritius, Morocco, and Tunisia, have been providing visa-free or visa-on-arrival entries to Chinese visitors to foster tourism. Echoing the movement, China's Ministry of Culture and Tourism has listed thirty-four African countries as destinations for group tours.

Conclusion

China's economic growth is slowing from the double digits of previous decades as policymakers steer the economy toward a more high-tech, consumption-oriented, and environmentally sustainable growth model with reduced exposure to geopolitical shocks. And this economic transition will increasingly have implications for China's international economic relations with the rest of the world. As discussed above, across the five domains of China's economic engagement with Africa -- trade, investment, fiscal stabilization, RMB internationalization, and people-to-people ties -- both strong continuities and changes are evident. But this engagement is not happening in a vacuum. Policy directions within African countries and third parties such as the United States will greatly shape how these changes in the China-Africa relationship continue to unfold.

The changing patterns of trade between African countries and China will be shaped by policies in both advanced economies and African countries themselves. Rising barriers to market access in advanced economies are likely to push African countries further into the embrace of China. Between 2021 and 2024, the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden has suspended a record eight African countries from the U.S. trade preference program, the African Growth and Opportunity Act. Meanwhile, the European Union's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, which began its initial transitional phase in October 2023, could make it even more difficult for African manufacturers to export to the European market and reduce the continent's GDP by up to $25 billion. Although individual European countries like France seek to expand their trade with Anglophone African countries, for instance, and the United Kingdom recently signed a trade deal with Kenya, this may not be sufficient to offset the wide-ranging impacts of market-restricting policies like the CBAM. Furthermore, growing China-Africa trade volumes will continue to be characterized by trade deficits. To address these deficits, African countries need to make a concerted effort to diversify their exports to China. Important steps to take include implementing the AfCFTA to create regional value chains, utilizing trade preference programs particularly the green lanes initiative -- as Kenya and Namibia are doing -- to export semi-processed agriculture produce to China and emulating the Indonesian approach to pressure Chinese companies to invest in the refining and processing of minerals in African countries.

As Chinese investments in Africa shift from infrastructure-oriented projects toward industrialization-oriented projects, African policy responses and the ability of Western countries to fill infrastructure financing gaps will be crucial. Chinese FDI flows for processing and manufacturing in various sectors -- whether related to agriculture, minerals and metals, construction material, or apparel -- are contingent on requirements in the domestic business environment that are within the remit of African governments. Basic requirements include the availability of affordable and reliable electricity, good transportation networks, skilled local workers, security, and the ability to compel Chinese companies to enter into joint ventures with local African firms for technology transfer. Whether the United States and its allies in Europe and Japan can step into the space being vacated by Chinese policy banks to provide infrastructure financing in Africa is an open question. Implementation of the Lobito Corridor project, a signature initiative of the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII), will test the G7's commitment to the scaling up of infrastructure investments in Africa. Whether the United States continues to prioritize the PGII by ensuring the program's continuity or incorporating new infrastructure projects remains to be seen -- especially if a new U.S. administration comes into office in January 2025.

Expansion of China's rescue-lending efforts and internationalization of the RMB in Africa are significantly dependent on African countries' own demand for and uptake of these initiatives. Will a growing number of African countries look to China, as an alternative to the IMF, for emergency liquidity support as their ability to finance imports diminish due to fiscal crises? Will there be a growing appetite among African countries for more central bank currency swap lines with the PBOC, and will there be increased drawdowns of yuan reserves? As African countries struggle to find scarce foreign exchange resources to settle and invoice their trade, will they follow the trend among some Asian countries in using the RMB for their bilateral trade with China? The answer to these questions may lie largely in whether the United States and its allies in Europe will provide sufficient measures to support African countries to overcome the latest bout of debt distress and fiscal crises.

Finally, China's loosening of pandemic-era travel restrictions and the phenomenon of digitalization will accelerate the increasing trend of people-to-people exchanges with African countries in higher education, media, and culture. Developments in China's immigration policy will be important to track as it begins to roll out visa-free travel for a select number of European and Asian countries. The hardening of visa regimes in Canada, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the United States, and other Western countries will also be important to monitor, as it could affect these countries' historically robust people-to-people exchanges with African countries.

This ranking, launched by ""Les Echos"" in partnership with Statista, aims to highlight French companies that excel in innovation and best practices.

Gilles David, CEO of ENERTIME, affirms: ""Being in the TOP 5 of Innovation Leaders in France is a great source of pride for all ENERTIME employees, past and present, who have developed over the past fifteen years, a unique proprietary technology in high-power turbomachinery and thermodynamic machines essential for the energy transition. This success is due not only to our teams but also to our shareholders who have supported us and to our clients who took the risk of trusting a young independent SME.""

Innovation Rooted in French Scientific Excellence

ENERTIME's technologies, based on thermodynamics combined with rotating machinery design, exploit a science born in France 200 years ago that is essential to the energy transition. They offer decarbonized and decentralized solutions as an alternative to centralized production solutions.

Tailored Solutions for Industrial Needs

ENERTIME provides customized systems for industrial clients, developing a unique ability to understand and address their issues, which fosters continuous and sustainable innovation.

Strategic Vision Coupled with Innovation

With full ownership of its intellectual property and patents, ENERTIME can deploy its technologies, developed on Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) machines, in other fields. These capabilities are a significant asset for developing high-temperature, high-power heat pumps (HTHP). The natural gas expansion turbine installed for GRTgaz in Villiers-le-Bel and the partnership with STOLECT illustrate other successful applications of these technologies.

Inherently Competitive Technologies

A high-power ORC (typically 2 to 3 MW) for waste heat recovery is a very competitive solution with a typical LCOE[1] of €62/MWhe. A high temperature heat pump producing steam, reduces the CO2 emissions of steam production by a factor of ten in France and is 2 to 3 times more efficient than an electric boiler. It also avoids pollutant emissions associated with biomass or RDF[2] combustion. ENERTIME has developed these complex technologies without decarbonization subsidies, which were nonexistent before 2021, and plans to build 10 new machines in two years, in addition to the 12 commissioned between 2012 and 2023.

Strong International Ambition

To become competitive, decarbonization technologies must target a global market. ENERTIME has always aimed to develop relevant international solutions to compensate for a domestic market that take time to open. This strategy has led to successes on three continents and exports to eleven countries. ENERTIME expects most of its revenue to come from exports by 2030. In May 2024, ENERTIME was labeled an Efficient Solution for its ORC modules by the Solar Impulse Foundation and joined this global alliance.
