We know what it takes to get them,"Now the Energy Voucher Act, amending some laws to set prices for electricity, natural gas, and district heating, will be signed by the President.

Continued article below the video

The most important of the Senate amendments, supported by the Lower House of Parliament, is the temporary exemption (from July 1 to December 31 this year) for households from capacity charges, which would further limit the expected increase in electricity bills from July 1. . Capacity charges for 2024 for farms range from PLN 2.66 to PLN 14.90 net per month depending on electricity consumption, so for the entire second half of the year, the decrease in bills will range from PLN 15.96 to PLN 89.4.

While working on the bill in the Senate, Senator Stanisław Jawłowski (KO) said that exempting households from energy tariffs would reduce the increase in electricity bills expected from July 1 ""by a quarter or even a third"".

The rest of the amendments approved by the Senate were essentially technical in nature.

What do we know about the energy voucher?

Under the law, the energy voucher will be a one-time cash benefit intended for low-income households, paid in the second half of 2024. The amount of the voucher will depend on the number of people in the household. Thus: one-person households will receive support of PLN 300, two- and three-person households will receive PLN 400, households with four to five people will receive PLN 500, and households with six or more people will receive PLN 600. . If your household uses electricity-powered heating, the value of your energy voucher increases by 100%. Depending on the size of the farm, the amount will range from PLN 600 to PLN 1,200.

The new regulations stipulate two income limits: up to PLN 2,500 for single-person households and up to PLN 1,700 per person for multi-person households. When paying the voucher, the ""PLN for PLN"" principle will apply. This means that the voucher will be granted even if the income criterion is exceeded, but its value will decrease by the amount exceeded.

Energy voucher. Where to apply?

Under this law, an application for payment of an energy voucher must be submitted to the mayor, mayor or city chief of the applicant's place of residence. Applications must also be submitted between August 1 and September 30 of this year.

The law also assumes the introduction of the maximum electricity price in the period from July to December 2024, at the level of PLN 500/MWh for households and at the level of PLN 693/MWh for local government units and public utility entities as well. As for small and medium enterprises.

The impact of the law on gas and heat prices

In the case of gas, as of July 1, the law removes the price freeze for customers subject to the tariff at PLN 200.17 per MWh and introduces a price ceiling equal to the tariff of the largest retailer - PGNiG OD.

The act requires the so-called obligation of sellers to submit electricity and gas to the head of the Energy Regulatory Bureau to change their tariffs under the threat of losing compensation for selling energy below the tariff prices. The tariffs of the committed electricity sellers are currently PLN 739 per MWh, and the tariff of the committed gas seller, PGNiG OD, is PLN 291 per MWh.

The new regulations also limit the increase in heat costs, but with a gradual increase in maximum prices and rates. The compensation mechanism for the supplier's retention of specific heat prices is scheduled to remain in effect for one year, until the end of June 2025, but by the end of this year the price will be PLN 119.39 per gigajoule, and in the first half of next year - PLN 134.97 per gigajoule. .

Deputy Head of the Ministry of Climate and Environment, Miosz Mutica, noted that the law will cover 3.5 million families. He informed that the total cost of the new regulations in terms of supporting sensitive beneficiaries is about PLN 9 billion.",moviesonline.ca,news,MoviesOnline,Echo Richards,0.2941176470588236,454172056,9,https://ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/3vIk9kpTURBXy85OTMxZGM2MDNiYzg5YTg1NmIyNWI3YmM3NmUwODgxZC5qcGeTlQMAOM0D6M0CM5MJpmM2M2E3YgaTBc0EsM0Cdt4AAaEwAQ/bon-energetyczny-bedzie-wsparciem-dla-osob-potrzebujacych.jpg,eng-9590493

Poland's Ambassador Maciej Pisarkski on Thursday urged Pakistan to take immediate steps for making the life of foreign investors easier, who are badly suffering because of delay in payment of their dues and difficulties in keeping their machinery functioning.

The ambassador made the remarks at a time when Pakistani authorities were trying to bring foreign investment amid external sector and budgetary challenges that had created massive difficulties for the foreign investors working in Pakistan.

""Something has to be done to make the life of existing investors easier,"" remarked Pisarkski while talking to a group of journalists at the embassy.

Foreign investors are grappling with the problem of delay in payments for services rendered by them and even encountering hurdles in the way of arranging spare parts for their machinery due to non-payment, said the envoy. PGNiG - a leading Polish company - is one of the two foreign companies that are still engaged in gas exploration in Pakistan despite numerous challenges. However, the company has suffered due to the absence of payment for gas explored and supplied to the government.

PGNiG wants to reinvest in Pakistan but these efforts are undermined by the lack of settlement of its previous dues, he added. Another Polish company drilling wells in Pakistan is also experiencing difficulties.

The central bank has been keeping a tight control over the outflow of dollars due to the thin foreign currency reserves despite the International Monetary Fund (IMF) umbrella for Pakistan. This has created serious issues for the foreign investors and lenders. Pakistan's gross foreign exchange reserves remain low at $9.1 billion in spite of a $3 billion IMF injection and $6 billion in dollar purchases by the central bank from the open market.

The Polish envoy said that the embassy had repeatedly taken up the problems with the previous Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) government, the caretaker government and the new government. The embassy has also taken up the issues with the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC). Pakistan is a challenging market because of many reasons, said the ambassador while responding to a question about the prospects of new foreign investment.

UK's Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office Chief Economist Adnan Khan said last week that foreign investors were looking towards Pakistani investors, which were sitting on the fence. The SIFC has not yet been able to bring any major foreign investment, although it has helped in addressing some procedural irritants.

Pakistan's image abroad is not what it should be as this country also offers many opportunities, said the ambassador. However, despite the challenges being faced by the Polish companies in Pakistan, the embassy is arranging a visit of nine Polish firms working in the areas of construction, manufacturing, power, mining, coal production and wastewater.

Pisarkski said that bilateral trade between the two countries was less than a billion dollars but it was gradually inching up. Poland had a $666 million trade deficit last year, which it wishes to bridge through more exports to Pakistan. ""We want Polish companies to stay in Pakistan and expand their business, unlike many other foreign companies that are leaving,"" said the ambassador. ""Pakistan should take care of the companies that have not pulled out.""

He stressed that the Polish embassy was committed to developing business and economic ties between Poland and Pakistan. This year, the embassy is organising a business mission through the GreenEvo programme, which is led by the Polish Ministry of Climate and Environment.",tribune.com.pk,news,The Express Tribune,,-0.2470588235294118,453619845,9,https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/BeFunky-collageDEdssdsdd-21715923612-0/BeFunky-collageDEdssdsdd-21715923612-0.jpg,

Through the PFNteam100 scholarship programme, we have a real opportunity to support young sportsmen and sportswomen representing dozens of Olympic and Paralympic disciplines. Each medal won by a beneficiary of the PFNteam100 programme is a separate success story earned with self-discipline and dedication, passion and hard work through continuous development.

As the Polish National Foundation team, we are proud to support Polish Olympians and Paralympians who, by naturally representing Poland in the international arena, become sports ambassadors of Poland.

PFNteam100 is a proprietary scholarship programme dedicated to sportspeople developing their talents. It is aimed to provide direct support, outside sporting associations, to young sportspeople in developing their careers and making their sports dreams come true. Under the team100 -- and then PFNteam100 -- project, the Polish National Foundation has supported as many as 433 sportspeople representing 49 Olympic and Paralympic disciplines. This support has contributed to achieving a result of 582 medals won at European as well as World Championships. The above number includes nine Olympic and seven Paralympic medals won by PFN beneficiaries. The scholarship programme implemented by PFN has benefited such world sports stars as the tennis player Iga Świątek, the athletes Sofia Ennaoui, Ewa Swoboda, Pia Skrzyszowska, Natalia Kaczmarek, Joanna Mazur, Konrad Bukowiecki, Patryk Dobek and Maciej Lepiato, the speed skater Natalia Maliszewska and the ski jumpers Aleksander Zniszczoł, Andrzej Stękała and Klemens Murańka.

A professional sports career generally entails huge financial outlays. The cost of equipment, training and expert support, as well as participation in sporting events itself is frequently beyond sportspeople's financial capabilities, often slowing down their careers or even putting an end to them altogether. PFNteam100 was the first programme of its kind in Poland, aimed towards launching scholarships for talented Polish sportspeople, National Team members. Our programme has allowed them to combine a sporting career with study, improve their skills, and at the same time to represent our country with dignity in the international arena. What made the project unique was the fact that its beneficiaries were free to decide on how to allocate the funds they received under the project. Thus, depending on their needs, it could have been the purchase of equipment, training, supplementation, medical support, housing rental or, for example, participation in sporting events.

Principles have also been an important element of the programme for the participating sportsmen and sportswomen, who confirmed their commitment to them by signing the ""Code of Ethics"", obligating the contestants to respect the fair play principles in sports competition, to represent Poland with dignity at home and abroad, and to champion the good name of our Homeland. Thus, our sportspeople have become ambassadors of Poland who have promoted our country around the world with their achievements and their attitude.

Given the programme's success, in 2022 the PFNteam100 project was transferred to the Ministry of Sport and Tourism.

Initially, the PFNteam100 programme envisaged supporting contestants representing Olympic disciplines only, but in 2022, after its core was transferred to the Ministry, it was decided to expand the project to include sportspeople from other disciplines as well.

The rally driver Mikołaj Marczyk, regarded as one of the best Polish rally drivers of the younger generation, has become one of the first beneficiaries of the new programme formula. In 2019, ""Miko"" became the youngest competitor ever to win the Polish Rally Champion title. He and his pilot, Szymon Gospodarczyk, are part of the PFNteam100. For example, the two gentlemen have won multiple times the Barbórka Rally - the most important rally event in Poland.

Mikołaj Marczyk summed up our collaboration as follows:

""Entering into cooperation with the Polish National Foundation is an honour and major support for me in organizing my debut season of competing in the WRC 2 World Rally Championship. National support is also part of my mission to achieve the best possible results and represent Poland internationally among competitors from around the world. As a Pole, I am proud to represent our white and red national colours abroad, so I am glad that with the support of the Polish National Foundation I will be able to achieve better results""-

In 2023, two new sportspeople joined the ranks of the programme's beneficiaries: Maja Dziarnowska, a bronze medalist at the 2022 iQFOiL European Windsurfing Championships, and Wiktor Przyjemski, 2022 Team Speedway Junior World Champion. It is worth noting here that Maja Dziarnowska, on the Polish National Team since 2009, will compete at the XXXIII Olympic Games in Paris in 2024, while Wiktor Przyjemski is credited with a talent of the same stature as Tomasz Gollob and Bartosz Zmarzlik. Already under the wings of the new version of the PFNteam100 scholarship programme, the speedway rider won the title of European Under-19 Individual Speedway Champion, and triumphed along with his teammates in the Team Speedway Junior World Championship final. Our speedway rider has also scored triumphs at the Team Speedway Junior European Championship and the European Pairs Speedway Junior Championship.

The above examples show that despite the change in its formula, the Polish National Foundation's scholarship programme does not lose its importance, providing a springboard for Polish sportspeople on their way to professional success, and giving their fans a chance to enjoy the sports successes of our white-and-red flag representatives.

The PFNteam100 project would not have been possible without our Donors. We would therefore like to extend our warmest thanks to the Founders of the Polish National Foundation: PKO BP S.A., Enea S.A., Energa S.A., WSE S.A., Grupa Azoty S.A., KGHM Polska Miedź S.A., Grupa LOTOS S.A., PKN ORLEN S.A., PGE S.A., PGNIG S.A., PGZ S.A., PHN S.A., PKP S.A., PWPW S.A., PZU S.A., Tauron Polska Energia S.A. and Totalizator Sportowy Sp. z o.o.",wpolityce.pl,news,wpolityce.pl,,0.615686274509804,453319178,1,https://media.wplm.pl/pictures/2024/05/13/1500/1000/737b37b55ace4613ab7100b0a2a524de.jpeg,

Expected to close in the third quarter, the transaction would result in DNO raising its stake in Var Energi-operated Marulk to 37 percent. Equinor ASA holds a 33 percent stake in the field, while the other partner is PGNiG Upstream Norway AS with a 30 percent stake.

Marulk, which sits 25 kilometers (15.5 miles) southwest of Norne at a water depth of 370 meters (1,213.9 feet), started producing 2012. Along with the Alve, Skuld and Urd fields, Marulk uses a subsea template tied back to the Norne floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) vessel.

In Norne, which is located 80 km (49.7 miles) north of the Heidrun field at a water depth of 380 meters (1,246.7 feet), Equinor ASA is the operator with a 39.1 percent stake, while 54 percent is held by Petoro AS. It was put onstream 1997.

Skuld, operated by majority state-owned Equinor with a 64 percent stake, came online 2013. It is 20 km (12.4 miles) north of Norne and has a water depth of 340 meters (1,115.5 feet). The other co-venturer is Petoro with a 24.5 percent stake.

Urd, which sits five km (3.1 miles) northeast of Norne at a water depth of 380 meters, started production 2005. Equinor is also the operator with a 64 percent stake, while Petoro owns 24.5 percent.

The non-producing Verdande was discovered 2017 at 10 km (6.2 miles) north of Norne at a water depth of 380 meters. Operator Equinor (59.1 percent) obtained government approval for the development plan last year. The plan involves installing a subsea template tied back to FPSO Norne. The other partners are Petoro (22.4 percent), Aker BP ASA (seven percent) and PGNiG (0.8 percent).

As part of the deal, DNO would transfer its 22.6 percent stake in the producing Ringhorne East field to Var Energi. After the completion of the transaction, Var Energi will increase its stake to 92.58 percent, while Kistos Energy (Norway) AS will retain 7.5 percent.

The North Sea field, which sits six km (3.7 miles) northeast of the Balder field at a water depth of 130 meters (426.5 feet), started production 2006. It has remaining reserves of 1.5 million cubic meters (53 million cubic feet) of oil equivalent, according to information on government website Norskpetroleum.no.

""In terms of production, the transaction (net to DNO, including divestment of Ringhorne East) is estimated to add 3,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) to DNO's output at closing, rising to above 5,000 boepd in 2026 as the Verdande contribution kicks in"", DNO said.

""This transaction is another step in the rebalancing of our North Sea business on the heels of the acquisition of a 25 percent stake in UK's Arran field announced in February"", DNO executive chair Bijan Mossavar-Rahmani said in a statement.",rigzone.com,news,Rigzone,,0.2470588235294118,452933186,9,https://images.rigzone.com/images/news/articles/Var-Energi-to-Sell-Stakes-in-Five-Fields-Offshore-Norway-to-DNO-176685-582x327.webp,

The curtailment, which has reached 6,000 mmscf (Million Standard Cubic Feet per Day), has resulted in a daily revenue loss of $2 million, with critical wells already loaded up, leading to a permanent loss of reserves.

""If the current situation of forced curtailment persists unresolved, then the E&P companies, especially the foreign companies, will have to reconsider their future investment plans in the country since their confidence in the government to protect their rights and interests would have been severely shaken,"" said a senior official who was part of the meeting held here on Monday on the forced curtailment of gas flows from local gas fields by the Sui gas companies to ease out the gas pressure in the pipeline distribution system that has reached over the dangerous mark of 5,000 mmcft.

The DG PC (petroleum concessions) and DG gas met with the top management of E&P companies -- OGDCL (Oil and Gas Development Company Limited), PPL (Pakistan Petroleum Limited), MPCL (Mari Petroleum Company Limited), POFL (Pakistan Oil Field Limited), ENI, PGNiG (Polish Oil & Gas Company), PSO (Pakistan State Oil), PLL (Pakistan LNG Limited), and MOL Pakistan, United Energy Limited (UEP), Pakistan and Sui Northern and Sui Southern. However, it was decided that another meeting would be held in the following week to seek a solution as all the stakeholders came up with their viewpoints.

The E&P companies also said that the current gas curtailment crisis could severely damage critical wells, leading to permanent loss of precious hydrocarbon reserves, and will also dampen the confidence of the E&P companies to invest in future exploration endeavors, thereby causing an accelerated decline of natural gas production in the country, which is a much-coveted indigenous source of energy due to its affordable prices.

The meeting revealed that the current situation is a result of gross mismanagement by the Ministry of Energy (Petroleum Division), which is unable to bring Sui Southern Company Limited (SSGC) and Sui Northern Gas Company (SNGPL) on the same page to manage the situation.

It became clear in the meeting that despite the fact that SSGC has both spare capacity in its transmission line as well as unfulfilled gas demand from its industrial and power generation consumers, yet both companies seem reluctant to work in a synergic and coordinated manner to swap the gas, even for a limited time, to ease the pressure in the network and provide a quick resolution to the issues due to the pricing differences between LNG and indigenous gas. It is clear that neither of the companies wants to take gas at the high-priced LNG from the network because their end consumers cannot afford it, and hence demand for gas at the high LNG price reduces significantly, resulting in its accumulation in the network and causing curtailment of indigenous production.

It was also unclear why both SNGPL and SSGC are persisting in rationing the supply to the domestic sector despite being in an oversupply environment for the past month.

When asked about it in the meeting, DG Gas had responded that the Sui companies are under strict instructions from the Petroleum Minister not to supply LNG to the domestic sector, which is baffling and not understandable at all since any LNG diverted to the domestic sector would be immediately replaced by gas from indigenous sources, thus netting off the position and simultaneously providing relief to the distressed E&P sector without any fiscal detriment to either the government or the Sui Companies themselves.

This is possible because the natural gas, either sourced from imported LNG or indigenously produced, is essentially the same commodity (with the same chemical composition and physical properties) and hence can be instantaneously swapped at different points in the network without causing any fiscal distortions due to its source-dependent price differentiation.

It appears that the Minister of Petroleum is unable to understand the basic fundamentals of the industry and is adamantly following a preconceived layman's approach with regards to this critical matter, exacerbating the problem and resulting in devastating and wide-ranging impacts on the industry, not just in the short term but also in the long term.",thenews.com.pk,news,The News International,,-0.2235294117647059,452725450,1,https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/akhbar/2024-05-07/l_1186129_015649_updates.jpg,eng-9545586

A dispute over what constitutes 'commissioning cargoes' from a new Calcasieu Pass LNG facility may yet shape the financing and sale of products from future LNG developments The dispute centres around the US LNG developer Venture Global LNG, its core sale and purchase agreement partners, and the sale of commissioning cargoes during a period of rapidly increasing LNG prices.

Venture Global styles itself as a long-term, low-cost provider of US LNG to be supplied from resource-rich North American natural gas basins. The company is currently constructing or developing 50 MTPA of production capacity in Louisiana. Part of the Venture Global LNG portfolio is the Calcasieu Pass LNG export facility located in Cameron, Louisiana.

The foundation partners of the Calcasieu Pass LNG export terminal include Shell, bp, Edison SpA, Galp, Repsol, and PGNiG. These partners have binding 20-year sale and purchase agreements with the terminal, representing 8 mtpa of the terminal's total planned 10 mtpa offtake under long-term agreements. It was reported that the pricing was concurrent with the long-term trend at that time, of around US$2 per mmBtu.

Calcasieu Pass has 18 liquefaction trains, each with a capacity of 0.626 mta, configured in nine blocks. The export facility has two ship-loading berths and two 200,000-m3 full containment LNG storage tanks.

In March 2022, Calcasieu Pass loaded its first export LNG cargo on the Greece-flagged, 174,000-m3 LNG carrier Yiannis, owned by Maran Gas and chartered by JERA Global Markets. This demonstrated that Calcasieu Pass had moved from FID to LNG production in just 29 months. ""Venture Global is honoured to partner with JERA, one of the world's largest buyers of LNG, on the inaugural commissioning cargo from Calcasieu Pass,"" said Venture Global chief executive, Mike Sabel, at the time.

In the same month, it was reported that Shell's existing contract for 2 mta from the Calcasieu Pass LNG export terminal, had been extend to 4 mta. ""Venture Global is honoured that Shell, our first foundational customer at Calcasieu Pass, has chosen to expand its existing co-operation with our company with a second partnership at Plaquemines,"" said Mr Sabel.

""Commissioning cargoes to test and tune an LNG facility are not counted as part of the long-term agreements""

That took place just days after Russia invaded Ukraine, which led to the imposition of sanctions on Russia. With Russian natural gas and LNG no longer welcome in Europe (but still imported) European countries scrambled to introduce FSRUs to process imported LNG.

The spot price of LNG soared, reaching a peak of US$89 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) in August 2023, many multiples of the estimated price in the long-term agreements with the foundation partners.",rivieramm.com,news,Riviera,,0.003921568627450966,452670887,1,https://dvzpv6x5302g1.cloudfront.net/AcuCustom/Sitename/DAM/163/12Calcasieu_Pass_liquafaction_modules_location_source_Ventu.png,eng-9538653

Credit: Harald Pettersen/Equinor.

The Valemon field is located between production licences 050 and 193 in the Norwegian Sea. The gas and condensate field lies at a water depth of 135m, approximately 160km west of Bergen.

It is operated by Equinor Energy (66.775%). Other stakeholders in the field include Petoro (30%) and PGNiG Upstream Norway (3.225%). The partners invested about Nkr22.6bn ($2.77bn) in the field development.

Statoil, now Equinor, submitted a development plan for the Valemon field in October 2010 and received state approval in June 2011.

First production from the field was achieved in January 2015. Valemon is expected to produce approximately 18 billion cubic metres of gas, 0.2 million cubic metres of natural gas liquids and 2.3 million cubic metres of condensate, according to the 2021 plan.

The Valemon field was discovered in 1985 by the 34/10-23 well. Statoil confirmed the presence of hydrocarbons with the drilling of the 34/11-5 S exploration well in June 2006.

The well was drilled from the Kvitebjørn platform to a depth of 4,370m under the sea. The 7,380m-deep well was the longest high-pressure/high-temperature (HPHT) well ever to be drilled by Statoil.

Valemon extracts both gas and condensate from the Lower Jurassic sandstone within the Cook Formation, as well as from the Middle Jurassic sandstone located in the Brent Group.

The deposit exhibits an intricate structure characterised by numerous fault blocks. The reservoirs are situated at depths ranging from 3,900m to 4,200m and are characterised by HPHT conditions. The field is estimated to contain 192 million barrels of oil equivalent.

The reserves make Valemon one of the biggest undeveloped gas fields in the North Sea.

The Valemon field was placed on fast-track development in May 2010. The partners planned to carry out further development work on the field, but scrapped.

In July 2012, the Petroleum Safety Authority Norway permitted Statoil to use the West Elara jack-up rig for drilling on the Valemon field.

The field was developed using a fixed steel platform. Ten production wells and two injection wells were drilled from the unstaffed platform in 2017.

The second drilling campaign, comprising four new production wells, commenced in 2021, due to a significant decline in the estimated recoverable volumes. By mid-2023, all four wells were operational and are contributing to production.

The Valemon platform consists of a steel jacket and features separation facilities for gas, condensate and water. The 160m-tall steel jacket of the platform was installed at the field in June 2012.

The jacket weighs 9,000 tonnes and is installed at a water depth of 135m. It has a footprint of 45m x 45m, with its top measuring 26m x 30m.

The topsides feature amenities for the partial processing and export of unstabilised condensate and rich gas.

The platform includes an eight-storey living quarters building featuring a helideck. The building accommodates 40 single-bed cabins, a medical facility, a control room, and other facilities.

Statoil envisaged a basic separation and export strategy for the field.

The hydrocarbons produced are separated at the Valemon platform into rich gas and condensate.

Since the Valemon field is located close to the Kvitebjørn and Gullfaks South fields, their existing infrastructure is used for production in the Valemon field.

The gas produced in the field is sent to Kvitebjørn for processing. Rich gas is transported to the Kollsnes terminal through the Kvitebjørn Gas Pipeline, for further processing while a separate pipeline, linked to the Troll Oil Pipeline II, transports condensate to the 203,000 barrels of oil per day Mongstad refinery near Bergen.

The Valemon platform was the first remotely controlled platform operated by Equinor.

Alliance Engineering completed the feasibility study for the fixed jacket platform for the Valemon field in 2008.

Alliance, a unit of the John Wood Group, conducted pre-front-end engineering design (FEED) for the platform's jacket and topsides.

Heerema Vlissingen, a unit of the Heerema Fabrication Group, was awarded the contract in October 2010 to construct and install the steel jacket for the Valemon platform, following a FEED study by HFG Engineering Europe, another unit of Heerema Fabrication Group.

Statoil awarded Samsung Heavy Industries (SHI) an EPC contract valued at Nkr2.3bn in May 2011 to construct the topsides, including living quarters.

Hertel Marine was subcontracted to design and construct the living quarters for the Valemon field in June 2011.

SHI subcontracted Technip in November 2011 to provide detailed engineering, procurement engineering, and follow-on engineering support for the platform's topsides. Samsung subcontracted Grenland Group for detailed engineering and construction of the topsides.

Technip won another contract in February 2012 from Statoil for the installation and tie-in of spools and power cables at the field.

IKM Ocean Design secured the contract to design the new pipeline, with Vulcan SFM supplying cast-nodes for the Valemon jacket. Saipem completed the topside installation in July 2014.

Parker Hannifin was contracted in May 2012 to design, manufacture, and supply 1.5km of subsea power cable (24kV) with built-in fibreoptic communication lines.",offshore-technology.com,news,Offshore Technology,,0.1058823529411765,452668427,1,https://www.offshore-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2024/05/Featured-Image-Valemon-Gas-Field-Project.jpg,

These firms have told the government this action can result in sinking of oil and gas wells and the current gas reserves in the said wells due to loss of natural gas pressure. They say the recharging of the wells despite wasting time and money in terms of US dollars may not yield the required results.

""The authorities in Petroleum Division are also upset over the development and they have directed DGPC (Director General Petroleum Concessions) and DG Gas (Director General Gas) to hold a meeting today (Monday) with the top management of exploration and production (E&P) companies and gas companies to resolve the issue of natural gas curtailment,"" senior officials of the Energy Ministry told The News.

As per the official document, the government representatives would hold the meeting with MD of OGDCL (Oil and Gas Development Company Limited), PPL (Pakistan Petroleum Limited), MPCL (Mari Petroleum Company Limited), POFL (Pakistan Oil Feld Limited), ENI, PGNiG (Polish Oil & Gas Company), PSO (Pakistan State Oil), PLL (Pakistan LNG Limited) and General Manager of MOL Pakistan, President United Energy Limited (UEP), Pakistan and managing directors of Sui Northern and Sui Southern.

Sui Southern and Sui Northern, officials said, are the entities responsible for managing the line pack pressure but so far they have failed to maintain it as per the SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures), putting the existence of some oil and gas fields wells operations in jeopardy. The reduction of 350 mmcfd natural gas flows from the major local gas field has irritated the management of E&P companies as this can inflict a huge damage to the wells. ""The old gas fields are more vulnerable as they cannot be recharged when the gas flows from them are massively decreased.""

Pakistan is under long-term agreements for the import of 9 LNG cargoes from Qatar and one from ENI per month, meaning that 1 billion cubic feet per day is being taken in the system while the country has the local production of 3.2 bcfd. The RLNG is not being used by the stakeholders (power and industrial sector) because of less demand and high tariffs of gas. The Sui gas companies, PSO and PLL, are part of the long-term agreement for import of LNG with Qatar and ENI. The said companies cannot delay or deny the cargoes from Qatar and ENI because of high pressure in the line pack due to less consumption of imported gas. Also the said companies under the agreement cannot deny intake of any LNG cargo as it will put the agreements in doldrums.

The said companies also avoid denying the delay in berthing of LNG cargoes as it can cause huge demurrages to PSO, PLL and gas companies. So to ease the gas pressure in the system, the authorities are left to curtail the gas flows from the local gas fields, which also poses a threat to the very existence of oil and gas wells.

""This has virtually put the government's top mandarins in the catch-22 situation. So, all the top officials of exploration and production companies, gas companies, PSO and PLL will assemble under one roof and put their heads together to find out a solution to the line pack issue problems as it has gone over 5 bcfd, which is dangerous to the gas pipeline distribution system.""

According to the Central Power Purchase Agency (CPPA), the use of RLNG power plants comes at the lower side of the Economic Merit Order as the electricity generated by RLNG as a fuel is costly and when the use of RLNG is increased in power plants, electricity tariff in the head of monthly fuel adjustment increases. ""So CPPA avoids using RLNG in power plants at the maximum. Since the mercury has not gone up, the current power generation stands at 12,000MW.""

The CPPA officials said that first of all, it is mandatory to first operate the first-run plants such as hydel, wind, solar and nuclear power plants and then plants that consume natural gas, local coal, then comes imported coal and then RLNG as fuel for power generation as per the Economic Merit Order (EMO). ""This is why RLNG is not being used at the maximum by the power sector,"" the CPPA official said.

However, soon the temperature across the country will increase, so the demand of electricity will generate, then the use of RLNG will increase manifold, helping ease the gas pressure in the system. This is how the gas flow from local gas fields will also increase up to the optimum level.

The data of line pack pressure from March 2024 up till now shows that most of the time gas pressure in the pipeline distribution system remained over 5,000 mmcfd, the mark which poses a threat to the whole system as under SOPs, gas pressure should be limited up to 4,500 mmcfd.

To maintain even at just over 5,000 mmcfd line pack pressure, in addition to decreasing the local gas flows by 350 mmcft on daily basis, authorities are diverting an average 150 mmcft RLNG per day to the domestic sector, knowing the fact that there is no need for gas in this sector in the summer season. However, the diversion of RLNG to the domestic sector would cause an increase in gas tariff as gas companies would include the diversion of RLNG in their revenue requirement petitions.

The latest data about line pack pressure as of May 05, 2024 (Sunday) shows the line pack pressure stands at 5,103 million cubic feet (mmcft). The power sector is using RLNG of 535 mmcfd against its demand of 650 mmcfd for the month of May.

The gas consumption in the fertilizer sector stood at 62 mmcf. However, gas consumption by Engro Fertiliser was suspended on April 22, 2024, due to the startup of annual turnaround of its plant for about 54 days. However, the blend of imported and local gas of 280 mmcfd is being provided to the industrial sector (Export and Non-Export).",thenews.com.pk,news,The News International,,0.2941176470588236,452653731,1,https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/akhbar/2024-05-06/l_1185864_055730_updates.jpg,eng-9545586
