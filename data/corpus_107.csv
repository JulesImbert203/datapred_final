In this concise report, you'll find a summary of the last week's significant news, and trends affecting the index, helping you stay ahead with timely insights for your investment decisions.

We update every Friday as soon as the London Stock Exchange (LSE) market closes at 4:30pm UK local time (GMT+1).

FTSE 100 Share Price Opening 8th May 2024

The opening share price for this week (opening after the Monday Bank Holiday), Tuesday 8th May, was 8,317.59, which sat 0.26% lower than at open on Friday 26th May, indicating that the FTSE has some ground to try and make up for the week ahead.

Investor Sentiment This Week For The FTSE 100

Investor sentiment for this week has proved overall bearish as news of the UK general election looms. Polls, however, have been consistently unanimous with little volatility to suggest sudden swings of sentiment change. Recently, the British Retail Consortium also found that shop price annual inflation softened to 0.6% in May, down from 0.8% in April and the lowest since November 2021. So why the caution?

Investors may be feeling the pinch thanks to seeing the equities retreat in the U.S. stock market, coupled with heavy headline news for a number of FTSE 100 darlings. Of course, this week's drops put the FTSE 100 back into May-start territory and it's important to remember that the index is still 6.671% up so far this year. Long-term investors are keeping an eye on the index and snapping up the value arbitrage wherever they can.

We can see that the investing.com UK community's sentiment towards the FTSE 100 index has also become more bearish over the last week compared to May as a whole. Could this indicate the start of summer pessimism, or simply a short-term loss of hope for a reversal of recent drops?

The Severn Trent PLC (LON:SVT) water utility company is still being rocked by multiple sewerage scandals, continuing its rapid downward trend which started back on May 22nd. Analysts are now considering this once-dividend-darling (still sitting at a hefty 4.9% despite its large debt burden) stock a Strong Sell.

Royal Mail (International Distribution Services) (IDSI)

The £3.5 billion Royal Mail (International Distributions Services PLC (LON:IDSI))) takeover bid from Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky has sparked various reactions. IDS has indicated it is ""minded"" to accept the offer, describing it as fair and reflective of the company's value. However, the proposal is subject to political and public scrutiny. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt and other officials have expressed concerns, emphasizing the need for safeguards to protect Royal Mail's role as a critical part of the UK's national infrastructure.

National Grid (NG)

After the National Grid PLC (LON:NG) ex-rights announcement this time last week, NG have continued to topple, with some analysts (including Mark Freshney from UBS) suggesting the key is the dividend cut and dividend preference theory, ""as the shareholder base has refocused on SOTP/growth rather than yield.""

The above investor sentiment and factors driving this week's Footsie volatility meant that today the FTSE 100 closed at [PRICE], which sits [HIGHER/LOWER] than the weekly opening price of 8,317.59.

Nasdaq 100 opened 1% lower this Friday to trade at 18,339 after the first hour of US trades.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.1% higher at 38,150, while the broader S&P 500 index dipped 0.4% to 5,214.

Among the top Nasdaq movers were Zscaler Inc, Warner Bros, Sirius XM, Walgreens and Lululemon.

On the macro calendar, the annual US PCE inflation rate steadied at 2.7% in April, pausing after an acceleration in March and matching market forecasts.

2.53pm: Santander hacked

Black-hat criminal hacker group ShinyHunters has allegedly stolen the data of 30 million Banco Santander (LSE:BNC) customers and staff across Spain, Chile and Uruguay.

Santander disclosed a security breach earlier this month, but the extent of the breach has just come to light after hackers put the data up for sale on the dark web.

According to X account 'Dark Web Informer', ShinyHunters is selling the data for $2 million (£1.57 million).

28 million credit card numbers and six million account numbers and balances are allegedly in the data package.

Santander told the BBC is ""proactively contacting affected customers and employees directly"".

ShinyHunters is linked to a Ticketmaster hack that stole hundreds of million of user details, ticket sales and even card data mere days ago.

Proactive has reached out to Santander to ask weather UK-based accounts have been affected.

2.24pm: European inflation comes in hotter-than-expected

European inflation rose to a fourth-month high in May, potentially throwing a wrench in the works ahead of the European Central Bank's interest rate decision next week.

Inflation rose to 2.6% from 2.4% in April, the largest rise in the figure since February.

Analysts had been preparing for prices to increase by 2.5%, meaning it could impact the ECB's decision on whether to cut interest rates at its meeting on Thursday.

ECB president Christine Lagarde said earlier this week that there was ""a strong likelihood"" of a June rate cut as long as ""the data reinforces the confidence level that we have"".

Markets had been hopeful the ECB would cut rates to 4.25% from its 22-year high of 4.5%.

2.02pm: FTSE 100 looking bullish in afternoon trades

The FTSE 100 has hit an intraday high of 8,281.48 in afternoon trades.

It brings the blue-chip index over 50 points higher from yesterday's close, supported by solid gains from National Grid, British Gas owner Centrica, Whitbread, BAE and GSK.

1.55pm: NatWest capital returns estimates increased following £1.24bn buyback

NatWest's £1.24 billion buyback of shares from the Treasury exceeded Peel Hunt analysts' expectations.

They had initially expected just £1.1 billion in buybacks for the whole of 2023; today's announcement has forced a rethink of the broker's full-year estimates.

""We view the larger size as a positive, perhaps especially as the parliamentary elections scheduled for 4th July could delay the retail offer,"" said analysts.

They now expect £1.4 billion in buybacks for the year. Coupled with a forecasted £1.34 billion in dividends, total capital returns are expected to come to £2.74 billion.

""This estimate now appears conservative and is supported by the 1Q results, which indicate that capital generation within the group remains strong,"" said Peel Hunt. ""Generally, we view the progressive elimination of the UK Government's holding as positive for the rating of the shares.""

The broker gave NatWest stock a Buy recommendation with a 370p price target.

Shares were swapping for 318p at the time of writing.

1.19pm: Bitcoin unfussed by Trump verdict

The prospect of presidential nominee Donald Trump facing prison time following his conviction on 34 counts of falsifying business records should have had negative consequences for the bitcoin markets.

Trump, who has pledged to fight the guilty verdict, has been increasingly vocal in garnering votes from cryptocurrency enthusiasts.

Talking at the Libertarian National Convention last week, he promised to ""stop Joe Biden's crusade to crush crypto"".

""I will ensure that the future of crypto and the future of Bitcoin will be made in the USA, not driven overseas,"" said Trump.

""I will support the right to self-custody to the nation's 50 million crypto holders. I say this with your vote. I will keep Elizabeth Warren and her goons away from your Bitcoin, and I will never allow the creation of a central bank digital currency.""

Democratic senator Warren has called for stricter anti-money laundering rules in the crypto sector.

Yet bitcoin seemed unfussed by these unprecedented political developments; in fact, it added 1% against the US dollar on Thursday and has remained buoyant at $68,380 today.

Perhaps, as has been theorised by pundits, Trump's conviction will only serve to galvanise his support base, thus increasing his chances of reclaiming the White House in November.

In the meantime, the BTC/USD pair is up 1.3% week on week, with Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, adding 2.4%.

Global cryptocurrency market capitalisation currently stands at $2.55 trillion, with bitcoin dominance at 52.9%.

12.51pm: Nasdaq, S&P to open lower, Trump conviction to command national discourse

Losses are expected to continue on the US stock market this Friday after the three main indexes closed lower on Thursday.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is tipped to open a touch lower at 38,082, while the Nasdaq 100 tech index is expected to open 0.3% lower at 18,481.

Meanwhile futures contracts for the broader S&P 500 index have it opening 0.15% lower at 5,226.

Undoubtedly, markets will take a backseat in the news cycle in favour of presidential nominee Donal Trump's conviction on 34 counts of falsifying business records.

Trump unsurprisingly called the trial ""rigged"" and a ""disgrace"", while Trump's lawyers confirmed they will appeal ""as soon as we can"".

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov chirped up following the guilty verdict, stating: ""The fact that a de-facto elimination of political rivals by all possible legal and illegal means is going on there is obvious.""

12.07pm: Rolls-Royce turbines to power Japanese warships

Another quick update on Thursday's late headlines- Rolls-Royce announced that its MT30 marine gas turbine has been selected to power Japan's new destroyer-class warships.

The MT30 is known for its high power density.

Rolls-Royce senior vice president for defence Sam Cameron said: ""The unique power density of the MT30 GT will ensure ship performance is not compromised and will meet the top ship speed requirements associated with the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) destroyers.""

""Rolls-Royce continues to be at the forefront of naval propulsion technology and we're proud to be providing the world's first twin-MT30 hybrid arrangement to power Japan's destroyer programme,"" Cameron added.

FTSE 100-listed Rolls-Royce shares were up 0.3% in Friday's early-afternoon trades.

11.47am: No bonuses for Burberry boss

Burberry chief executive Jonathan Akeroyd received zero annual bonuses last year due to a poor performance at the British luxury clothing brand.

An annual remuneration report published late on Thursday stated: ""The Committee judged that progress was made on refining our brand image, evolving our product and strengthening distribution, resulting in some of the strategic objectives being partially met.

""However, in light of the business performance and broader shareholder experience, the Committee and Jonathan Akeroyd agreed that it would not be appropriate for him to receive an annual bonus for FY 2023/24.""

Chief finance officer Kate Berry received a £121,500 bonus, representing 9% of her maximum potential reward.

Burberry's profits dove 34% in the year to 31 March amid a backdrop of plummeting luxury demand.

Despite announcing cost-saving measures, analysts remain lukewarm on Burberry's prospects in the current financial year.

Akeroyd's total earnings for the year, excluding potential share plan incentives, came to £1.19 million.

Burberry shares have been slashed in half over the past 12 months and dipped a further 1.4% this Friday.

The FTSE 100 is currently 33 points higher at 8,264.

11.20am: Vodafone completes Spanish asset sale to Zegona

Vodafone Group PLC (LSE:VOD) has officially completed the sale of Vodafone Spain to Zegona Communications (LSE:ZEG) plc for €4.10 billion in cash and €0.90 billion in redeemable preference shares.

The total enterprise value of €5 billion (£4.26 billion) represents a multiple of 5.6 times Adjusted EBITDAaL and 13 times operating free cash flow for the twelve months ending 30 September 2023.

As part of the transaction, Vodafone will continue to provide certain services to Vodafone Spain.

The disposal was first announced last October. It forms part of Vodafone boss Margherita Della Valle's strategy of streamlining Vodafone's global operations in the face of a burdensome debt pile.

Zegona, which was incorporated in 2015 by former Virgin Media executives Eamonn O'Hare and Robert Samuelson, previously said it hopes to ""improve efficiency by reducing complexity and driving productivity"".

Back in 2021, Zegona returned over £300 million to shareholders after exiting its investment in Basque Country telecoms group Euskaltel to Masmovil, which bought at a €3.5 billion valuation.

Vodafone shares were flat at 74.75p in Friday morning trades.

11.08am: Flutter officially shifts listing to US

Paddy Power owner Flutter Entertainment PLC (LSE:FLTR) has officially switched its primary listing from the London Stock Exchange to the New York Stock Exchange, effective today.

It marks an ""important milestone in the evolution of Flutter"", said chief executive Peter Jackson.

""This closely follows the recent move of our operational headquarters to New York, with both reflecting the increasing importance of the US sports betting and iGaming market to our business.""

Flutter owns and operates FanDuel, which is among the largest sportsbooks in the US. FanDuel's success was a primary motivator for Flutter's stateside shift, given its increasingly integral role in Flutter's revenue growth.

""We have a fantastic position in the US, with FanDuel the clear number one operator, and we look forward to this next step on our journey,"" said Jackson.

New CFO steps up

In conjunction with today's relisting, Flutter announced that group chief finance officer Paul Edgecliffe-Johnson will leave the Group in place of Rob Coldrake ""with immediate effect"".

Coldrake has been acting as Flutter International's CFO for four years.

Following Flutter's transatlantic relocations, there is a ""consequent need for extensive executive management time to be spent in the United States"", said Flutter.

""The board has recently engaged in a discussion with Paul Edgecliffe-Johnson concerning his ability to meet that requirement in light of his family commitments in the UK.

""Following this discussion, the board has concluded that it is in the Company's best interests for Paul Edgecliffe-Johnson to step down from his role as Group CFO and Executive Director.""

Flutter retains a secondary listing on the London Stock Exchange.

10.14am: Royal Mail's buyer could scrap jobs and postboxes

Royal Mail's buyer has said he plans to shake up the structure of the postal service, which could lead to thousands of jobs being cut and the removal of thousands of red pillar boxes.

Kretinsky, the Cezch billionaire who could become the owner of Royal Mail's parent company, said he sees Royal Mail's future in the out-of-home delivery market.

""It is important for logistics companies not to miss this out-of-home delivery wave, which means they need to be ready to invest now,"" he told Reuters.

Under his vision, Kretinsky said he would consider injecting up to £400 million into the company to help set up a network of dropboxes and delivery lockers, removing the need for post and packages to be sent directly to people's homes.

""We believe that if the group [IDS and Royal Mail] doesn't respond properly on the out-of-the-home solutions it may have a detrimental impact on its market share. And specifically in the UK, any shrinkage of the market share would be fatal,"" the 'Cezch Sphinx' added.

""It is a moment when the European postal market is once again evolving. It will be probably the next two to three years to come, which will decide what company will play what role in the out-of-home delivery solutions.""

9.57am: More proxy advisors come out aginst Musk's pay

A second of the world's leading proxy advisors has come out against Elon Musk's US$56 billion bonus, imploring shareholders to reject the pay package.

Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) said investors should reject Musk's record pay, claiming it is ""excessive"" and ""outsized"".

The largest-ever US pay deal was agreed upon back in 2018 but was subsequently dropped after a judge found that Tesla directors had failed to properly inform shareholders over the details.

ISS said: ""Although the achievement of the grant's performance hurdles and the substantial growth in the company's size and profitability are fully recognized, the award value was considered outsized from the start and it has failed to accomplish certain of the board's stated objectives from 2018.""

Stakeholders will now vote on whether to approve the bonus on June 13.

Earlier this week, proxy advisory giant Glass Lewis said it too told shareholders to reject the pay deal.

9.41am: Revolution Bars takes itself off market

Revolution Bars Group PLC, the struggling hospitality group, surged 13% higher after it said it will no longer look for a buyer after its deal with Nightcap fell through and instead will undergo restructuring.

Today will see the end of the bar group's formal sales process and the beginning of a reorganisation plan that the company says is ""in the best interests of all stakeholders.""

Part of the plan, which aims to return the company to profitability, includes ""exiting the leases of certain loss-making sites, and proposing a rent reduction on certain other sites to enable them to return to profitability at a sustainable level.""

A sales process was launched earlier this year as the company searched for emergency funding to keep part of its operations alive.

9.03am: The morning so far

JD Sports was among the worst-performing FTSE 100 stocks this morning.

The high-street retailer hit full-year sales targets but undershot on profits; the latter proved a sticking point for the market, with the stock getting slammed 11% lower in opening trades.

Paddy Power owner Flutter, which is in the process of moving its primary listing stateside, fell over 9%, extending a slump following a recent betting tax bill passed in Illinois.

Primark owner Associated British Foods PLC (LSE:ABF) shares are not responding well to news that controlling shareholder Wittington Investments has cut its stake in the company. Shares were off 3.1%.

Ocado Group PLC (LSE:OCDO), St James's Place plc and Burberry Group PLC (LSE:BRBY) were also among the biggest fallers.

National Grid PLC (LSE:NG.) has switched to recovery mode following a recent slump due to a discounted fundraise. The electricity and gas supplier added 1.8% in opening trades.

British Gas owner Centrica PLC (LSE:CNA) was also on the move, validating Barclays' recent assertion that the stock is oversold. Shares added 3.3% this morning.

Better-than-expected house price data failed to move the needle for housebuilding stocks.

Monthly house prices in the UK grew by 0.4% in May 2024, marking a reversal from a 0.4% decline in April and exceeding the market consensus of a 0.1% gain.

Yet housebuilding blue chips Persimmon and Taylor Wimpy were slightly down.

Elsewhere in company news, Nationwide is facing a competition probe into its Virgin Money takeover, while the government has sold down its stake in NatWest by another £1.24 billion.

8.44am: Nationwide to face competition probe over Virgin Money takeover

The Competition & Markets Authority (CMA) has launched an investigation into Nationwide Building Society's £2.9 billion takeover of Virgin Money.

Nationwide's surprise bid for the bank has already proved controversial, with some Nationwide members staging a revolt over the deal, while analysts consider the 220p-per-share offer opportunistic.

Now, the CMA is considering whether the merger ""will result in the creation of a relevant merger situation under the merger provisions of the Enterprise Act 2002 and, if so, whether the creation of that situation may be expected to result in a substantial lessening of competition within any market or markets in the United Kingdom for goods or services.""

The regulator is calling for comments from the public, with a window open until 24 June.

The blue-chip index added nine points to 8,240 in opening exchanges, following on from yesterday's 48-point gain.

Top morning risers include Centrica PLC (LSE:CNA), National Grid PLC (LSE:NG.) and GSK PLC (LSE:GSK, NYSE:GSK), while the biggest fallers include betting companies Flutter and Entain, JD Sports and Primark owner ABF.

8.04am: Government reduces NatWest stake by another £1.24 billion

The Treasury has sold £1.24 billion worth of shares back to NatWest Group PLC (LSE:NWG), bringing the government's stake down from 27% to 22.5%.

It comes after the government announced an expected delay in the eagerly awaited retail offer due to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announcing an election set for 4 July.

The Treasury has been steadily selling down the government's stake in the bank that it acquired as part of a bail-out package following the Global Financial Crisis.

7.47am: House prices outperform

Monthly house prices in the UK grew by 0.4% in May 2024, marking a reversal from a 0.4% decline in April and exceeding the market consensus of a 0.1% gain.

According to Nationwide data, house prices rose by 1.3% on a year-on-year basis, accelerating from a 0.6% increase in the prior period, which was the softest pace in three months.

This is the fourth consecutive month of rising home prices, driven by strong wage growth and lower inflation.

""Modest increases in mortgage rates since the Spring have slowed the housing market but not derailed it,"" said Rob Wood, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.

7.36am: JD Sports hits sales expectations, adjusted profit slightly undershoots

JD Sports brought in £10.54 billion worth of sales in the 2024 financial year, matching broker expectations leading up to the results.

Profit before tax and adjusting items fell 8% to £917.2 million, which was slightly below the guided range of £915-935 million previously laid out by the company.

On a statutory basis, profit before tax surged 67% to £811.2 million, helped by a reduction in adjusting items of £398.7 million.

One particular highlight was JD Sports' premium range, which saw 11% growth in organic sales.

Chief executive Régis Schultz painted the results as proof that JD Sports is making ""strategic progress"" in a challenging market, namely increased operating costs and a highly promotional market environment.

The company also experienced a net reduction of 73 stores, largely due to the divestment of non-core businesses and a strategic withdrawal from South Korea.

""We have started the new financial year with Q1 in line with our expectations in a volatile market and we are on track to deliver our profit guidance for the full year,"" said Schultz

""Looking further ahead, we have a strong business model and a clear strategy to deliver long-term growth and value creation for our shareholders.""

7.11am: Stocks to creep higher

Stocks should edge higher when trading commences this Friday, as the blue-chip index attempts to recover losses in what has been a ropey week for the market.

Shares recovered some lost ground yesterday when the FTSE 100 closed 48 points higher, but the index still remains around 90 points lower from last Friday's closing price.

Housebuilding stocks could provide support, given Nationwide housing prices increased 0.4% sequentially this month, beating the expected 0.1% list.

But, what does this mean? And what should shareholders be doing?

In basic terms, a rights issue is a way for a company to raise cash directly from its existing shareholders by giving them the option to buy new shares.

In National Grid's case, for every 24 shares owned investors will be given the option to purchase an additional seven - around 1 new share option for every 3.5 existing shares.

Of course, the first concern of stakeholders when new shares are issued is the dilution it will cause.

That's where nil-paid rights come in.

A nil-paid places a monetary value on the right to purchase the new shares and can be traded in the interim known as the ex-rights period.

In National Grid's case its nil-paid currently is worth around 190p.

It means that should an investor want to reject the offer to buy new shares, they can sell their nil-paid and receive compensation for the devaluation of their stake.

Source: UBS

So, what are the range of options available to investors?

Option 1: Do nothing

A shareholder may receive the nil-paid rights but choose to do nothing before the June 10 deadline.

If this is the case, their nil-paid rights will be sold for them at the best possible price and this cash will be returned to the investor's account, like receiving a dividend.

A small fee will be taken for administrative expenses, but there is no minimum requirement for how much an investor can receive.

A shareholder who takes this option must remember that while they receive up-front cash, their stake in National Grid will have been diluted, meaning they are entitled to less of the group's profits.

Option 2: Take up the rights

Shareholders who receive the nil-paid rights can decide to take up the offer, meaning they will continue to own the same percentage of the company, effectively avoiding dilution.

Investors who chose this route are required to pay their broker 645p for National Grid's newly issued share before the June 10 deadline.

A letter and email were sent out to National Grid shareholders detailing who they need to contact should they want to convert their share option.

Option 3: Sell National Grid

A shareholder who has been discouraged by the utility firm's performance and need for new cash may decide they want to cut their stake completely.

Should they sell their shares, the nil-paid rights will be sold with it, meaning that opportunistic investors cannot flog the shares and then later sell the option to make a free bit of cash.

Option 4: Sell nil-paid yourself

A similar route to doing nothing, however by selling it on the open market rather than at the deadline there is a chance for investors to make a little extra.

This is because the value of nil-paids are directly tethered to the value of National Grid.

It means that if the company's value increases, the value of the nil-paids will increase substantially more.

For example, on Friday, National Grid shares jumped close to 4%, resulting in its nil-paid rights surging 22.5%.

Therefore, a shareholder looking to sell may wait for a day when the group is doing particularly well to offload the nil-paid rights.

Option 5: Trade nil-paid rights

Day traders, brokerage firms and keen investors may opt for this choice for a chance to make an extra bit of cash but maintain the same percentage stake in the company.

Like option 4, shareholders can look to sell their rights at a point when the value is particularly high and hope to buy the nil-paid when they are low.

It would mean that when it comes to converting the nil-paid into shares, the investor would have made an extra bit of cash on the side.

Nil-paid rights started off at 200p when the issue was first announced and since then have slipped as low as 150p, highlighting the ample opportunity for traders.

Option 6: Buy nil-paid rights as a non-shareholder

Those who do not have a stake in National Grid may also look to the nil-paid market.

Again, investors who carefully monitor the share price movement may find the nil paid rights slip lower.

Converting a cheap nil-paid into a new share could result in the shareholder making a slight profit if the National Grid share price has lifted in the period between buying and selling.

If the price stays flat until the deadline but converts the right, they will become a shareholder in National Grid.

Option 7: Ignore completely

This option can only be taken up by those who do not have shares in National Grid.

It's pretty self-explanatory, but should an investor show no interest in the utility firm they can avoid the rights issue and look for opportunities elsewhere.

Although, this wouldn't be the recommendation of UBS analysts.

Losses are expected to continue on the US stock market this Friday after the three main indexes closed lower on Thursday.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is tipped to open a touch lower at 38,082, while the Nasdaq 100 tech index is expected to open 0.3% lower at 18,481.

Meanwhile futures contracts for the broader S&P 500 index have it opening 0.15% lower at 5,226.

Undoubtedly, markets will take a backseat in the news cycle in favour of presidential nominee Donal Trump's conviction on 34 counts of falsifying business records.

Trump unsurprisingly called the trial ""rigged"" and a ""disgrace"", while Trump's lawyers confirmed they will appeal ""as soon as we can"".

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov chirped up following the guilty verdict, stating: ""The fact that a de-facto elimination of political rivals by all possible legal and illegal means is going on there is obvious.""

12.07pm: Rolls-Royce turbines to power Japanese warships

Another quick update on Thursday's late headlines- Rolls-Royce announced that its MT30 marine gas turbine has been selected to power Japan's new destroyer-class warships.

The MT30 is known for its high power density.

Rolls-Royce senior vice president for defence Sam Cameron said: ""The unique power density of the MT30 GT will ensure ship performance is not compromised and will meet the top ship speed requirements associated with the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) destroyers.""

""Rolls-Royce continues to be at the forefront of naval propulsion technology and we're proud to be providing the world's first twin-MT30 hybrid arrangement to power Japan's destroyer programme,"" Cameron added.

FTSE 100-listed Rolls-Royce shares were up 0.3% in Friday's early-afternoon trades.

11.47am: No bonuses for Burberry boss

Burberry chief executive Jonathan Akeroyd received zero annual bonuses last year due to a poor performance at the British luxury clothing brand.

An annual remuneration report published late on Thursday stated: ""The Committee judged that progress was made on refining our brand image, evolving our product and strengthening distribution, resulting in some of the strategic objectives being partially met.

""However, in light of the business performance and broader shareholder experience, the Committee and Jonathan Akeroyd agreed that it would not be appropriate for him to receive an annual bonus for FY 2023/24.""

Chief finance officer Kate Berry received a £121,500 bonus, representing 9% of her maximum potential reward.

Burberry's profits dove 34% in the year to 31 March amid a backdrop of plummeting luxury demand.

Despite announcing cost-saving measures, analysts remain lukewarm on Burberry's prospects in the current financial year.

Akeroyd's total earnings for the year, excluding potential share plan incentives, came to £1.19 million.

Burberry shares have been slashed in half over the past 12 months and dipped a further 1.4% this Friday.

The FTSE 100 is currently 33 points higher at 8,264.

11.20am: Vodafone completes Spanish asset sale to Zegona

Vodafone Group PLC (LSE:VOD) has officially completed the sale of Vodafone Spain to Zegona Communications (LSE:ZEG) plc for €4.10 billion in cash and €0.90 billion in redeemable preference shares.

The total enterprise value of €5 billion (£4.26 billion) represents a multiple of 5.6 times Adjusted EBITDAaL and 13 times operating free cash flow for the twelve months ending 30 September 2023.

As part of the transaction, Vodafone will continue to provide certain services to Vodafone Spain.

The disposal was first announced last October. It forms part of Vodafone boss Margherita Della Valle's strategy of streamlining Vodafone's global operations in the face of a burdensome debt pile.

Zegona, which was incorporated in 2015 by former Virgin Media executives Eamonn O'Hare and Robert Samuelson, previously said it hopes to ""improve efficiency by reducing complexity and driving productivity"".

Back in 2021, Zegona returned over £300 million to shareholders after exiting its investment in Basque Country telecoms group Euskaltel to Masmovil, which bought at a €3.5 billion valuation.

Vodafone shares were flat at 74.75p in Friday morning trades.

11.08am: Flutter officially shifts listing to US

Paddy Power owner Flutter Entertainment PLC (LSE:FLTR) has officially switched its primary listing from the London Stock Exchange to the New York Stock Exchange, effective today.

It marks an ""important milestone in the evolution of Flutter"", said chief executive Peter Jackson.

""This closely follows the recent move of our operational headquarters to New York, with both reflecting the increasing importance of the US sports betting and iGaming market to our business.""

Flutter owns and operates FanDuel, which is among the largest sportsbooks in the US. FanDuel's success was a primary motivator for Flutter's stateside shift, given its increasingly integral role in Flutter's revenue growth.

""We have a fantastic position in the US, with FanDuel the clear number one operator, and we look forward to this next step on our journey,"" said Jackson.

New CFO steps up

In conjunction with today's relisting, Flutter announced that group chief finance officer Paul Edgecliffe-Johnson will leave the Group in place of Rob Coldrake ""with immediate effect"".

Coldrake has been acting as Flutter International's CFO for four years.

Following Flutter's transatlantic relocations, there is a ""consequent need for extensive executive management time to be spent in the United States"", said Flutter.

""The board has recently engaged in a discussion with Paul Edgecliffe-Johnson concerning his ability to meet that requirement in light of his family commitments in the UK.

""Following this discussion, the board has concluded that it is in the Company's best interests for Paul Edgecliffe-Johnson to step down from his role as Group CFO and Executive Director.""

Flutter retains a secondary listing on the London Stock Exchange.

10.14am: Royal Mail's buyer could scrap jobs and postboxes

Vodafone Group PLC (LSE:VOD) has officially completed the sale of Vodafone Spain to Zegona Communications (LSE:ZEG) plc for €4.10 billion in cash and €0.90 billion in redeemable preference shares.

The total enterprise value of €5 billion (£4.26 billion) represents a multiple of 5.6 times Adjusted EBITDAaL and 13 times operating free cash flow for the twelve months ending 30 September 2023.

As part of the transaction, Vodafone will continue to provide certain services to Vodafone Spain.

The disposal was first announced last October. It forms part of Vodafone boss Margherita Della Valle's strategy of streamlining Vodafone's global operations in the face of a burdensome debt pile.

Zegona, which was incorporated in 2015 by former Virgin Media executives Eamonn O'Hare and Robert Samuelson, previously said it hopes to ""improve efficiency by reducing complexity and driving productivity"".

Back in 2021, Zegona returned over £300 million to shareholders after exiting its investment in Basque Country telecoms group Euskaltel to Masmovil, which bought at a €3.5 billion valuation.

Vodafone shares were flat at 74.75p in Friday morning trades.

11.08am: Flutter officially shifts listing to US

Paddy Power owner Flutter Entertainment PLC (LSE:FLTR) has officially switched its primary listing from the London Stock Exchange to the New York Stock Exchange, effective today.

It marks an ""important milestone in the evolution of Flutter"", said chief executive Peter Jackson.

""This closely follows the recent move of our operational headquarters to New York, with both reflecting the increasing importance of the US sports betting and iGaming market to our business.""

Flutter owns and operates FanDuel, which is among the largest sportsbooks in the US. FanDuel's success was a primary motivator for Flutter's stateside shift, given its increasingly integral role in Flutter's revenue growth.

""We have a fantastic position in the US, with FanDuel the clear number one operator, and we look forward to this next step on our journey,"" said Jackson.

New CFO steps up

In conjunction with today's relisting, Flutter announced that group chief finance officer Paul Edgecliffe-Johnson will leave the Group in place of Rob Coldrake ""with immediate effect"".

Coldrake has been acting as Flutter International's CFO for four years.

Following Flutter's transatlantic relocations, there is a ""consequent need for extensive executive management time to be spent in the United States"", said Flutter.

""The board has recently engaged in a discussion with Paul Edgecliffe-Johnson concerning his ability to meet that requirement in light of his family commitments in the UK.

""Following this discussion, the board has concluded that it is in the Company's best interests for Paul Edgecliffe-Johnson to step down from his role as Group CFO and Executive Director.""

Flutter retains a secondary listing on the London Stock Exchange.

10.14am: Royal Mail's buyer could scrap jobs and postboxes

Royal Mail's buyer has said he plans to shake up the structure of the postal service, which could lead to thousands of jobs being cut and the removal of thousands of red pillar boxes.

Kretinsky, the Cezch billionaire who could become the owner of Royal Mail's parent company, said he sees Royal Mail's future in the out-of-home delivery market.

""It is important for logistics companies not to miss this out-of-home delivery wave, which means they need to be ready to invest now,"" he told Reuters.

Under his vision, Kretinsky said he would consider injecting up to £400 million into the company to help set up a network of dropboxes and delivery lockers, removing the need for post and packages to be sent directly to people's homes.

""We believe that if the group [IDS and Royal Mail] doesn't respond properly on the out-of-the-home solutions it may have a detrimental impact on its market share. And specifically in the UK, any shrinkage of the market share would be fatal,"" the 'Cezch Sphinx' added.

""It is a moment when the European postal market is once again evolving. It will be probably the next two to three years to come, which will decide what company will play what role in the out-of-home delivery solutions.""

9.57am: More proxy advisors come out aginst Musk's pay

A second of the world's leading proxy advisors has come out against Elon Musk's US$56 billion bonus, imploring shareholders to reject the pay package.

Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) said investors should reject Musk's record pay, claiming it is ""excessive"" and ""outsized"".

The largest-ever US pay deal was agreed upon back in 2018 but was subsequently dropped after a judge found that Tesla directors had failed to properly inform shareholders over the details.

ISS said: ""Although the achievement of the grant's performance hurdles and the substantial growth in the company's size and profitability are fully recognized, the award value was considered outsized from the start and it has failed to accomplish certain of the board's stated objectives from 2018.""

Stakeholders will now vote on whether to approve the bonus on June 13.

Earlier this week, proxy advisory giant Glass Lewis said it too told shareholders to reject the pay deal.

9.41am: Revolution Bars takes itself off market

Revolution Bars Group PLC, the struggling hospitality group, surged 13% higher after it said it will no longer look for a buyer after its deal with Nightcap fell through and instead will undergo restructuring.

Today will see the end of the bar group's formal sales process and the beginning of a reorganisation plan that the company says is ""in the best interests of all stakeholders.""

Part of the plan, which aims to return the company to profitability, includes ""exiting the leases of certain loss-making sites, and proposing a rent reduction on certain other sites to enable them to return to profitability at a sustainable level.""

A sales process was launched earlier this year as the company searched for emergency funding to keep part of its operations alive.

9.03am: The morning so far

JD Sports was among the worst-performing FTSE 100 stocks this morning.

The high-street retailer hit full-year sales targets but undershot on profits; the latter proved a sticking point for the market, with the stock getting slammed 11% lower in opening trades.

Paddy Power owner Flutter, which is in the process of moving its primary listing stateside, fell over 9%, extending a slump following a recent betting tax bill passed in Illinois.

Primark owner Associated British Foods PLC (LSE:ABF) shares are not responding well to news that controlling shareholder Wittington Investments has cut its stake in the company. Shares were off 3.1%.

Ocado Group PLC (LSE:OCDO), St James's Place plc and Burberry Group PLC (LSE:BRBY) were also among the biggest fallers.

National Grid PLC (LSE:NG.) has switched to recovery mode following a recent slump due to a discounted fundraise. The electricity and gas supplier added 1.8% in opening trades.

British Gas owner Centrica PLC (LSE:CNA) was also on the move, validating Barclays' recent assertion that the stock is oversold. Shares added 3.3% this morning.

Better-than-expected house price data failed to move the needle for housebuilding stocks.

Monthly house prices in the UK grew by 0.4% in May 2024, marking a reversal from a 0.4% decline in April and exceeding the market consensus of a 0.1% gain.

Yet housebuilding blue chips Persimmon and Taylor Wimpy were slightly down.

Elsewhere in company news, Nationwide is facing a competition probe into its Virgin Money takeover, while the government has sold down its stake in NatWest by another £1.24 billion.

8.44am: Nationwide to face competition probe over Virgin Money takeover

The Competition & Markets Authority (CMA) has launched an investigation into Nationwide Building Society's £2.9 billion takeover of Virgin Money.

Nationwide's surprise bid for the bank has already proved controversial, with some Nationwide members staging a revolt over the deal, while analysts consider the 220p-per-share offer opportunistic.

Now, the CMA is considering whether the merger ""will result in the creation of a relevant merger situation under the merger provisions of the Enterprise Act 2002 and, if so, whether the creation of that situation may be expected to result in a substantial lessening of competition within any market or markets in the United Kingdom for goods or services.""

The regulator is calling for comments from the public, with a window open until 24 June.

8.29am: FTSE 100 inches higher

The blue-chip index added nine points to 8,240 in opening exchanges, following on from yesterday's 48-point gain.

Top morning risers include Centrica PLC (LSE:CNA), National Grid PLC (LSE:NG.) and GSK PLC (LSE:GSK, NYSE:GSK), while the biggest fallers include betting companies Flutter and Entain, JD Sports and Primark owner ABF.

8.04am: Government reduces NatWest stake by another £1.24 billion

The Treasury has sold £1.24 billion worth of shares back to NatWest Group PLC (LSE:NWG), bringing the government's stake down from 27% to 22.5%.

It comes after the government announced an expected delay in the eagerly awaited retail offer due to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announcing an election set for 4 July.

The Treasury has been steadily selling down the government's stake in the bank that it acquired as part of a bail-out package following the Global Financial Crisis.

7.47am: House prices outperform

Monthly house prices in the UK grew by 0.4% in May 2024, marking a reversal from a 0.4% decline in April and exceeding the market consensus of a 0.1% gain.

According to Nationwide data, house prices rose by 1.3% on a year-on-year basis, accelerating from a 0.6% increase in the prior period, which was the softest pace in three months.

This is the fourth consecutive month of rising home prices, driven by strong wage growth and lower inflation.

""Modest increases in mortgage rates since the Spring have slowed the housing market but not derailed it,"" said Rob Wood, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.

7.36am: JD Sports hits sales expectations, adjusted profit slightly undershoots

JD Sports brought in £10.54 billion worth of sales in the 2024 financial year, matching broker expectations leading up to the results.

Profit before tax and adjusting items fell 8% to £917.2 million, which was slightly below the guided range of £915-935 million previously laid out by the company.

On a statutory basis, profit before tax surged 67% to £811.2 million, helped by a reduction in adjusting items of £398.7 million.

One particular highlight was JD Sports' premium range, which saw 11% growth in organic sales.

Chief executive Régis Schultz painted the results as proof that JD Sports is making ""strategic progress"" in a challenging market, namely increased operating costs and a highly promotional market environment.

The company also experienced a net reduction of 73 stores, largely due to the divestment of non-core businesses and a strategic withdrawal from South Korea.

""We have started the new financial year with Q1 in line with our expectations in a volatile market and we are on track to deliver our profit guidance for the full year,"" said Schultz

""Looking further ahead, we have a strong business model and a clear strategy to deliver long-term growth and value creation for our shareholders.""

7.11am: Stocks to creep higher

Stocks should edge higher when trading commences this Friday, as the blue-chip index attempts to recover losses in what has been a ropey week for the market.

Shares recovered some lost ground yesterday when the FTSE 100 closed 48 points higher, but the index still remains around 90 points lower from last Friday's closing price.

Housebuilding stocks could provide support, given Nationwide housing prices increased 0.4% sequentially this month, beating the expected 0.1% list.

LONDON -(Dow Jones)- U.K. engineering and construction company Costain Group PLC (COST.LN) Monday said it has won a contract worth about GBP200 million from National Grid PLC (NG.LN) to build a new high-voltage electricity cable tunnel as part of an upgrade to London's power infrastructure.

Costain said the contract forms part of National Grid's London investment plans to ensure a continued safe and reliable electricity transmission network.

The 33 kilometer-long London Cable Replacement Tunnel will be built between Hackney and Willesden (via Kensal Green), and Kensal Green and Wimbledon.

Work will start later this year, with the tunneling being completed by the end of 2014 and all associated works by November 2018.",wallstreet-online.de,news,wallstreet:online,,0.2705882352941176,454847126,1,,

Revolution Bars Group PLC, the struggling hospitality group, surged 13% higher after it said it will no longer look for a buyer after its deal with Nightcap fell through and instead will undergo restructuring.

Today will see the end of the bar group's formal sales process and the beginning of a reorganisation plan that the company says is ""in the best interests of all stakeholders.""

Part of the plan, which aims to return the company to profitability, includes ""exiting the leases of certain loss-making sites, and proposing a rent reduction on certain other sites to enable them to return to profitability at a sustainable level.""

A sales process was launched earlier this year as the company searched for emergency funding to keep part of its operations alive.

9.03am: The morning so far

JD Sports was among the worst-performing FTSE 100 stocks this morning.

The high-street retailer hit full-year sales targets but undershot on profits; the latter proved a sticking point for the market, with the stock getting slammed 11% lower in opening trades.

Paddy Power owner Flutter, which is in the process of moving its primary listing stateside, fell over 9%, extending a slump following a recent betting tax bill passed in Illinois.

Primark owner Associated British Foods PLC (LSE:ABF) shares are not responding well to news that controlling shareholder Wittington Investments has cut its stake in the company. Shares were off 3.1%.

Ocado Group PLC (LSE:OCDO), St James's Place plc and Burberry Group PLC (LSE:BRBY) were also among the biggest fallers.

National Grid PLC (LSE:NG.) has switched to recovery mode following a recent slump due to a discounted fundraise. The electricity and gas supplier added 1.8% in opening trades.

British Gas owner Centrica PLC (LSE:CNA) was also on the move, validating Barclays' recent assertion that the stock is oversold. Shares added 3.3% this morning.

Better-than-expected house price data failed to move the needle for housebuilding stocks.

Monthly house prices in the UK grew by 0.4% in May 2024, marking a reversal from a 0.4% decline in April and exceeding the market consensus of a 0.1% gain.

Yet housebuilding blue chips Persimmon and Taylor Wimpy were slightly down.

Elsewhere in company news, Nationwide is facing a competition probe into its Virgin Money takeover, while the government has sold down its stake in NatWest by another £1.24 billion.

8.44am: Nationwide to face competition probe over Virgin Money takeover

The Competition & Markets Authority (CMA) has launched an investigation into Nationwide Building Society's £2.9 billion takeover of Virgin Money.

Nationwide's surprise bid for the bank has already proved controversial, with some Nationwide members staging a revolt over the deal, while analysts consider the 220p-per-share offer opportunistic.

Now, the CMA is considering whether the merger ""will result in the creation of a relevant merger situation under the merger provisions of the Enterprise Act 2002 and, if so, whether the creation of that situation may be expected to result in a substantial lessening of competition within any market or markets in the United Kingdom for goods or services.""

The regulator is calling for comments from the public, with a window open until 24 June.

8.29am: FTSE 100 inches higher

The blue-chip index added nine points to 8,240 in opening exchanges, following on from yesterday's 48-point gain.

Top morning risers include Centrica PLC (LSE:CNA), National Grid PLC (LSE:NG.) and GSK PLC (LSE:GSK, NYSE:GSK), while the biggest fallers include betting companies Flutter and Entain, JD Sports and Primark owner ABF.

8.04am: Government reduces NatWest stake by another £1.24 billion

The Treasury has sold £1.24 billion worth of shares back to NatWest Group PLC (LSE:NWG), bringing the government's stake down from 27% to 22.5%.

It comes after the government announced an expected delay in the eagerly awaited retail offer due to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announcing an election set for 4 July.

The Treasury has been steadily selling down the government's stake in the bank that it acquired as part of a bail-out package following the Global Financial Crisis.

7.47am: House prices outperform

Monthly house prices in the UK grew by 0.4% in May 2024, marking a reversal from a 0.4% decline in April and exceeding the market consensus of a 0.1% gain.

According to Nationwide data, house prices rose by 1.3% on a year-on-year basis, accelerating from a 0.6% increase in the prior period, which was the softest pace in three months.

This is the fourth consecutive month of rising home prices, driven by strong wage growth and lower inflation.

""Modest increases in mortgage rates since the Spring have slowed the housing market but not derailed it,"" said Rob Wood, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.

7.36am: JD Sports hits sales expectations, adjusted profit slightly undershoots

JD Sports brought in £10.54 billion worth of sales in the 2024 financial year, matching broker expectations leading up to the results.

Profit before tax and adjusting items fell 8% to £917.2 million, which was slightly below the guided range of £915-935 million previously laid out by the company.

On a statutory basis, profit before tax surged 67% to £811.2 million, helped by a reduction in adjusting items of £398.7 million.

One particular highlight was JD Sports' premium range, which saw 11% growth in organic sales.

Chief executive Régis Schultz painted the results as proof that JD Sports is making ""strategic progress"" in a challenging market, namely increased operating costs and a highly promotional market environment.

The company also experienced a net reduction of 73 stores, largely due to the divestment of non-core businesses and a strategic withdrawal from South Korea.

""We have started the new financial year with Q1 in line with our expectations in a volatile market and we are on track to deliver our profit guidance for the full year,"" said Schultz

""Looking further ahead, we have a strong business model and a clear strategy to deliver long-term growth and value creation for our shareholders.""

Stocks should edge higher when trading commences this Friday, as the blue-chip index attempts to recover losses in what has been a ropey week for the market.

Shares recovered some lost ground yesterday when the FTSE 100 closed 48 points higher, but the index still remains around 90 points lower from last Friday's closing price.

But it can't commission the vessel until it gets a power upgrade.

The company carries 4 million islanders, holidaymakers and festival goers every year on a five nautical mile crossing between England's picturesque southern coast and the Isle of Wight. The strait, known as the Solent, is popular with yachts and leisure craft, while much of the coastline is protected.

Wightlink has funding in place for a electric-powered car ferry that would reduce emissions both at sea and in port, following in the path of pioneer Norway, which introduced the world's first in 2015.

The government has said decarbonising maritime transport is essential to achieving Britain's net zero target by 2050. Domestic maritime vessels represented around 5% of Britain's greenhouse gas emissions from transport in 2020, more than rail and buses combined, the government said in a 2022 report.

And the long average lifespan of vessels means that greener ships must start being deployed by next year to achieve a green fleet by the 2050 deadline.

But interviews with 22 people - including investors, power company employees, government officials, Wightlink staff and countryside campaigners - revealed that long waits for grid connections combined with planning obstacles are putting millions of pounds of green transport investment at risk.

""We want to go electric. We think it's the right thing,"" Wightlink Chief Executive Keith Greenfield told Reuters onboard a hybrid ferry, which uses diesel to charge electric batteries, saving around 20% in emissions. ""We're held back by a lack of shore power.""

Wightlink needs to order its next ship within 12-18 months to replace an ageing vessel, but cannot commit to go solely electric without a legally binding power contract, Greenfield said.

Regional network operator Scottish & Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) told Wightlink two years ago that a new connection at its Portsmouth terminal would require infrastructure upgrades, including at a nearby substation on the national high-voltage network, according to a document reviewed by Reuters and ferry company executives.

The substation improvements by National Grid were not scheduled to be completed until 2037.

After Reuters interviewed Wightlink executives, SSEN said this month enough power may be available without the National Grid work, and it would hold new talks with the ferry company.

If Wightlink accepts a new quote from SSEN, it will be able to guarantee the capacity and confirm its place in the connections queue.

""We look forward to meeting them early next month to progress proposals,"" a SSEN spokesperson told Reuters. The company declined to comment on the change.

Britain will hold a general election on July 4 with polls predicting a victory for the opposition Labour party after 14 years of Conservative rule.

Wightlink's dilemma underscores the challenge Britain's next government will face in delivering the renewable energy and grid infrastructure needed to power a shift to electric ferries, cars and domestic heating in Europe's second-largest economy.

Britain was the first major economy to create a legally binding 2050 net zero target. It's a leader in offshore wind and it has halved emissions since 1990 after closing coal power plants.

Central to the net zero target is a plan to decarbonise the electricity system by 2035. But the state adviser, the Climate Change Committee, said in a progress report in June 2023 that the government lacked a full strategy to get there.

How to achieve net zero, and at what cost, has become a battleground both nationally and locally.

Britons support the policy of net zero but they often baulk at the costs and infrastructure that may be required to get there, surveys show. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak scrapped some targets last year, saying he needed to retain public support in the face of ""unacceptable costs"".

Labour has pledged to decarbonise the electricity grid by 2030, five years ahead of the Conservatives' target of 2035. Reforming grid connections is one part of its ambitious plan.

To hit net zero, Britain needs to expand the high-voltage network in England and Wales carried overhead on large pylons, which then connect to regional distribution networks.

The grid, owned and operated by London-listed National Grid Plc, was built to transmit power generated from coalfields in areas like Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire across the country.

Today more electricity is coming from wind farms in Scotland and off Britain's east coast, and new infrastructure is needed to transmit it to London and the south.

Currently wind farms are being paid to switch off in strong winds, when the grid cannot absorb all the generated power, data from the country's electricity system operator shows.

The government has said reinforcements needed to increase capacity, including new substations, power lines or supergrid transformers, could take up to 13 years to complete, in part due to regulatory and planning approval.

It wants to halve that time, and is working with the regulator, Ofgem, network operators and the industry to accelerate connections.

National Grid said in May it would spend more than 30 billion pounds ($38 billion) on the grid over the next five years.

""We're driving forward the biggest reforms to our electricity grid since the 1950s,"" the Department for Energy Security & Net Zero told Reuters.

It set a target in November to cut the average delay faced by viable net zero-aligned projects like Wightlink for connections from around five years to six months, saying a faster system needed to be in place by 2025.

One issue that stands in the way of developing the grid and the renewable energy projects needed to power it are Britain's planning laws.

Approval times have ballooned in recent years, as local councils struggle to process applications and rural communities bring legal challenges to oppose major works.

The time it takes to secure consent for large-scale projects like wind farms has increased by 65% since 2012, stretching to 4.2 years, according to a government-requested report by the National Infrastructure Commission in 2023.

The rate of schemes subject to lengthy judicial reviews has leapt to 58%, from a long-term average of 10%, it said.

That pushes up project costs, threatening investment.

Fiera Infrastructure, the Canadian co-owner of Wightlink, warned that investors can always spend their capital elsewhere.

""Global investors are not yet at the point of turning their backs on UK infrastructure, but missteps around policy have eroded investor confidence,"" President Alina Osorio told Reuters.

The sentiment was echoed by other infrastructure investors, including one of the biggest in Britain, which has backed a company building electric vehicle chargers at motorways.

The fund manager, who asked not to be named, said a lack of new power had forced the company to adapt some of its projects.

Minal Patel, a partner at Schroders Greencoat, a renewable investment manager, said strong investor demand for renewable assets showed Britain remained attractive, but slow grid connections were a challenge.

For Wightlink, the hunt for a connection has been fraught.

In 2022, SSEN quoted Wightlink 4.6 million pounds for 12MW connections to power the chargers it needs to install in Portsmouth and Fishbourne, according to documents seen by Reuters. The units must charge the electric ferry in the 20 minutes it has between sailings.

Work could be completed in around 12 months in Fishbourne - one of Wightlink's terminals on the Isle of Wight - but there was no timeline given for the Portsmouth connection.

Under the rules, a project like Wightlink's must accept a quote from the distribution network provider to secure a place in the connections queue.

But Wightlink's Greenfield said it could not order a 50 million pound ferry without a guarantee of power.

In the last week, SSEN said there could be enough capacity to deliver more than the power Wightlink initially wanted.

Wightlink's Head of Engineering & Estates Charlie Field is hoping that a contract can finally be agreed.

But it can't commission the vessel until it gets a power upgrade.

The company carries 4 million islanders, holidaymakers and festival goers every year on a five nautical mile crossing between England's picturesque southern coast and the Isle of Wight. The strait, known as the Solent, is popular with yachts and leisure craft, while much of the coastline is protected.

Wightlink has funding in place for a electric-powered car ferry that would reduce emissions both at sea and in port, following in the path of pioneer Norway, which introduced the world's first in 2015.

The government has said decarbonising maritime transport is essential to achieving Britain's net zero target by 2050. Domestic maritime vessels represented around 5% of Britain's greenhouse gas emissions from transport in 2020, more than rail and buses combined, the government said in a 2022 report.

And the long average lifespan of vessels means that greener ships must start being deployed by next year to achieve a green fleet by the 2050 deadline.

But interviews with 22 people - including investors, power company employees, government officials, Wightlink staff and countryside campaigners - revealed that long waits for grid connections combined with planning obstacles are putting millions of pounds of green transport investment at risk.

""We want to go electric. We think it's the right thing,"" Wightlink Chief Executive Keith Greenfield told Reuters onboard a hybrid ferry, which uses diesel to charge electric batteries, saving around 20% in emissions. ""We're held back by a lack of shore power.""

Wightlink needs to order its next ship within 12-18 months to replace an ageing vessel, but cannot commit to go solely electric without a legally binding power contract, Greenfield said.

Regional network operator Scottish & Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) (SSE.L)New Tab, opens new tab told Wightlink two years ago that a new connection at its Portsmouth terminal would require infrastructure upgrades, including at a nearby substation on the national high-voltage network, according to a document reviewed by Reuters and ferry company executives.

The substation improvements by National Grid were not scheduled to be completed until 2037.

After Reuters interviewed Wightlink executives, SSEN said this month enough power may be available without the National Grid work, and it would hold new talks with the ferry company.

If Wightlink accepts a new quote from SSEN, it will be able to guarantee the capacity and confirm its place in the connections queue.

""We look forward to meeting them early next month to progress proposals,"" a SSEN spokesperson told Reuters, adding that there could be more network capacity available than previously forecast so the company had ""potential to progress"" with Wightlink's request.

Britain will hold a general election on July 4 with polls predicting a victory for the opposition Labour party after 14 years of Conservative rule.

Wightlink's dilemma underscores the challenge Britain's next government will face in delivering the renewable energy and grid infrastructure needed to power a shift to electric ferries, cars and domestic heating in Europe's second-largest economy.

Britain was the first major economy to create a legally binding 2050 net zero target. It's a leader in offshore wind and it has halved emissions since 1990 after closing coal power plants.

Central to the net zero target is a plan to decarbonise the electricity system by 2035. But the state adviser, the Climate Change Committee, said in a progress report in June 2023 that the government lacked a full strategy to get there.

CHANGING DATES

How to achieve net zero, and at what cost, has become a battleground both nationally and locally.

Britons support the policy of net zero but they often baulk at the costs and infrastructure that may be required to get there, surveys show. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak scrapped some targets last year, saying he needed to retain public support in the face of ""unacceptable costs"".

Labour has pledged to decarbonise the electricity grid by 2030, five years ahead of the Conservatives' target of 2035. Reforming grid connections is one part of its ambitious plan.

To hit net zero, Britain needs to expand the high-voltage network in England and Wales carried overhead on large pylons, which then connect to regional distribution networks.

The grid, owned and operated by London-listed National Grid Plc (NG.L)New Tab, opens new tab, was built to transmit power generated from coalfields in areas like Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire across the country.

Today more electricity is coming from wind farms in Scotland and off Britain's east coast, and new infrastructure is needed to transmit it to London and the south.

Currently wind farms are being paid to switch off in strong winds, when the grid cannot absorb all the generated power, data from the country's electricity system operator shows.

The government has said reinforcements needed to increase capacity, including new substations, power lines or supergrid transformers, could take up to 13 years to complete, in part due to regulatory and planning approval.

It wants to halve that time, and is working with the regulator, Ofgem, network operators and the industry to accelerate connections.

National Grid said in May it would spend more than 30 billion pounds ($38 billion) on the grid over the next five years.

""We're driving forward the biggest reforms to our electricity grid since the 1950s,"" the Department for Energy Security & Net Zero told Reuters.

It set a target in November to cut the average delay faced by viable net zero-aligned projects like Wightlink for connections from around five years to six months, saying a faster system needed to be in place by 2025.

INFRASTRUCTURE V CONSERVATION

One issue that stands in the way of developing the grid and the renewable energy projects needed to power it are Britain's planning laws.

Approval times have ballooned in recent years, as local councils struggle to process applications and rural communities bring legal challenges to oppose major works.

The time it takes to secure consent for large-scale projects like wind farms has increased by 65% since 2012, stretching to 4.2 years, according to a government-requested report by the National Infrastructure Commission in 2023.

The rate of schemes subject to lengthy judicial reviews has leapt to 58%, from a long-term average of 10%, it said.

That pushes up project costs, threatening investment.

Fiera Infrastructure, the Canadian co-owner of Wightlink, warned that investors can always spend their capital elsewhere.

""Global investors are not yet at the point of turning their backs on UK infrastructure, but missteps around policy have eroded investor confidence,"" President Alina Osorio told Reuters.

The sentiment was echoed by other infrastructure investors, including one of the biggest in Britain, which has backed a company building electric vehicle chargers at motorways.

The fund manager, who asked not to be named, said a lack of new power had forced the company to adapt some of its projects.

Minal Patel, a partner at Schroders Greencoat, a renewable investment manager, said strong investor demand for renewable assets showed Britain remained attractive, but slow grid connections were a challenge.

CONNECTION

For Wightlink, the hunt for a connection has been fraught.

In 2022, SSEN quoted Wightlink 4.6 million pounds for 12MW connections to power the chargers it needs to install in Portsmouth and Fishbourne, according to documents seen by Reuters. The units must charge the electric ferry in the 20 minutes it has between sailings.

Work could be completed in around 12 months in Fishbourne - one of Wightlink's terminals on the Isle of Wight - but there was no timeline given for the Portsmouth connection.

Under the rules, a project like Wightlink's must accept a quote from the distribution network provider to secure a place in the connections queue.

But Wightlink's Greenfield said it could not order a 50 million pound ferry without a guarantee of power.

In the last week, SSEN said there could be enough capacity to deliver more than the power Wightlink initially wanted.

Wightlink's Head of Engineering & Estates Charlie Field is hoping that a contract can finally be agreed.

""A few weeks ago, all deals were off as far as we were concerned. We had to wait until 2037,"" said. ""Now that might not be the case.""

The time it takes to secure consent for large-scale projects like wind farms has increased by 65% since 2012, stretching to 4.2 years, according to a government-requested report by the National Infrastructure Commission in 2023.

The rate of schemes subject to lengthy judicial reviews has leapt to 58%, from a long-term average of 10%, it said.

That pushes up project costs, threatening investment.

Fiera Infrastructure, the Canadian co-owner of Wightlink, warned that investors can always spend their capital elsewhere.

""Global investors are not yet at the point of turning their backs on UK infrastructure, but missteps around policy have eroded investor confidence,"" President Alina Osorio told Reuters.

The sentiment was echoed by other infrastructure investors, including one of the biggest in Britain, which has backed a company building electric vehicle chargers at motorways.

The fund manager, who asked not to be named, said a lack of new power had forced the company to adapt some of its projects.

Minal Patel, a partner at Schroders Greencoat, a renewable investment manager, said strong investor demand for renewable assets showed Britain remained attractive, but slow grid connections were a challenge.

CONNECTION

For Wightlink, the hunt for a connection has been fraught.

In 2022, SSEN quoted Wightlink 4.6 million pounds for 12MW connections to power the chargers it needs to install in Portsmouth and Fishbourne, according to documents seen by Reuters. The units must charge the electric ferry in the 20 minutes it has between sailings.

Work could be completed in around 12 months in Fishbourne - one of Wightlink's terminals on the Isle of Wight - but there was no timeline given for the Portsmouth connection.

Under the rules, a project like Wightlink's must accept a quote from the distribution network provider to secure a place in the connections queue.

But Wightlink's Greenfield said it could not order a 50 million pound ferry without a guarantee of power.

In the last week, SSEN said there could be enough capacity to deliver more than the power Wightlink initially wanted.

Wightlink's Head of Engineering & Estates Charlie Field is hoping that a contract can finally be agreed.

Facing power infrastructure delays, the company cannot proceed without a guaranteed power upgrade. Wightlink's situation highlights broader challenges in grid connectivity necessary for Britain's net zero 2050 target.

British ferry operator Wightlink wants to order a $60 million, state-of-the-art electric ferry to make its crossings cleaner and greener. But it can't commission the vessel until it gets a power upgrade. The company carries 4 million islanders, holidaymakers and festival goers every year on a five nautical mile crossing between England's picturesque southern coast and the Isle of Wight. The strait, known as the Solent, is popular with yachts and leisure craft, while much of the coastline is protected.

Wightlink has funding in place for a electric-powered car ferry that would reduce emissions both at sea and in port, following in the path of pioneer Norway, which introduced the world's first in 2015. The government has said decarbonising maritime transport is essential to achieving Britain's net zero target by 2050. Domestic maritime vessels represented around 5% of Britain's greenhouse gas emissions from transport in 2020, more than rail and buses combined, the government said in a 2022 report.

And the long average lifespan of vessels means that greener ships must start being deployed by next year to achieve a green fleet by the 2050 deadline. But interviews with 22 people - including investors, power company employees, government officials, Wightlink staff and countryside campaigners - revealed that long waits for grid connections combined with planning obstacles are putting millions of pounds of green transport investment at risk.

""We want to go electric. We think it's the right thing,"" Wightlink Chief Executive Keith Greenfield told Reuters onboard a hybrid ferry, which uses diesel to charge electric batteries, saving around 20% in emissions. ""We're held back by a lack of shore power."" Wightlink needs to order its next ship within 12-18 months to replace an ageing vessel, but cannot commit to go solely electric without a legally binding power contract, Greenfield said.

Regional network operator Scottish & Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) told Wightlink two years ago that a new connection at its Portsmouth terminal would require infrastructure upgrades, including at a nearby substation on the national high-voltage network, according to a document reviewed by Reuters and ferry company executives. The substation improvements by National Grid were not scheduled to be completed until 2037.

After Reuters interviewed Wightlink executives, SSEN said this month enough power may be available without the National Grid work, and it would hold new talks with the ferry company. If Wightlink accepts a new quote from SSEN, it will be able to guarantee the capacity and confirm its place in the connections queue.

""We look forward to meeting them early next month to progress proposals,"" a SSEN spokesperson told Reuters, adding that there could be more network capacity available than previously forecast so the company had ""potential to progress"" with Wightlink's request. Britain will hold a general election on July 4 with polls predicting a victory for the opposition Labour party after 14 years of Conservative rule.

Wightlink's dilemma underscores the challenge Britain's next government will face in delivering the renewable energy and grid infrastructure needed to power a shift to electric ferries, cars and domestic heating in Europe's second-largest economy. Britain was the first major economy to create a legally binding 2050 net zero target. It's a leader in offshore wind and it has halved emissions since 1990 after closing coal power plants.

Central to the net zero target is a plan to decarbonise the electricity system by 2035. But the state adviser, the Climate Change Committee, said in a progress report in June 2023 that the government lacked a full strategy to get there. CHANGING DATES

How to achieve net zero, and at what cost, has become a battleground both nationally and locally. Britons support the policy of net zero but they often baulk at the costs and infrastructure that may be required to get there, surveys show. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak scrapped some targets last year, saying he needed to retain public support in the face of ""unacceptable costs"".

Labour has pledged to decarbonise the electricity grid by 2030, five years ahead of the Conservatives' target of 2035. Reforming grid connections is one part of its ambitious plan. To hit net zero, Britain needs to expand the high-voltage network in England and Wales carried overhead on large pylons, which then connect to regional distribution networks.

The grid, owned and operated by London-listed National Grid Plc, was built to transmit power generated from coalfields in areas like Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire across the country. Today more electricity is coming from wind farms in Scotland and off Britain's east coast, and new infrastructure is needed to transmit it to London and the south.

Currently wind farms are being paid to switch off in strong winds, when the grid cannot absorb all the generated power, data from the country's electricity system operator shows. The government has said reinforcements needed to increase capacity, including new substations, power lines or supergrid transformers, could take up to 13 years to complete, in part due to regulatory and planning approval.

It wants to halve that time, and is working with the regulator, Ofgem, network operators and the industry to accelerate connections. National Grid said in May it would spend more than 30 billion pounds ($38 billion) on the grid over the next five years.

""We're driving forward the biggest reforms to our electricity grid since the 1950s,"" the Department for Energy Security & Net Zero told Reuters. It set a target in November to cut the average delay faced by viable net zero-aligned projects like Wightlink for connections from around five years to six months, saying a faster system needed to be in place by 2025.

Britain was the first major economy to create a legally binding 2050 net zero target. It's a leader in offshore wind and it has halved emissions since 1990 after closing coal power plants.

Central to the net zero target is a plan to decarbonise the electricity system by 2035. But the state adviser, the Climate Change Committee, said in a progress report in June 2023 that the government lacked a full strategy to get there.

CHANGING DATES

How to achieve net zero, and at what cost, has become a battleground both nationally and locally.

Britons support the policy of net zero but they often baulk at the costs and infrastructure that may be required to get there, surveys show. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak scrapped some targets last year, saying he needed to retain public support in the face of ""unacceptable costs"".

Labour has pledged to decarbonise the electricity grid by 2030, five years ahead of the Conservatives' target of 2035. Reforming grid connections is one part of its ambitious plan.

To hit net zero, Britain needs to expand the high-voltage network in England and Wales carried overhead on large pylons, which then connect to regional distribution networks.

The grid, owned and operated by London-listed National Grid Plc, was built to transmit power generated from coalfields in areas like Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire across the country.

Today more electricity is coming from wind farms in Scotland and off Britain's east coast, and new infrastructure is needed to transmit it to London and the south.

Currently wind farms are being paid to switch off in strong winds, when the grid cannot absorb all the generated power, data from the country's electricity system operator shows.

The government has said reinforcements needed to increase capacity, including new substations, power lines or supergrid transformers, could take up to 13 years to complete, in part due to regulatory and planning approval.

It wants to halve that time, and is working with the regulator, Ofgem, network operators and the industry to accelerate connections.

National Grid said in May it would spend more than 30 billion pounds ($38 billion) on the grid over the next five years.

""We're driving forward the biggest reforms to our electricity grid since the 1950s,"" the Department for Energy Security &amp; Net Zero told Reuters.

It set a target in November to cut the average delay faced by viable net zero-aligned projects like Wightlink for connections from around five years to six months, saying a faster system needed to be in place by 2025.

INFRASTRUCTURE V CONSERVATION

One issue that stands in the way of developing the grid and the renewable energy projects needed to power it are Britain's planning laws.

Approval times have ballooned in recent years, as local councils struggle to process applications and rural communities bring legal challenges to oppose major works.

The time it takes to secure consent for large-scale projects like wind farms has increased by 65% since 2012, stretching to 4.2 years, according to a government-requested report by the National Infrastructure Commission in 2023.

The rate of schemes subject to lengthy judicial reviews has leapt to 58%, from a long-term average of 10%, it said.

That pushes up project costs, threatening investment.

Fiera Infrastructure, the Canadian co-owner of Wightlink, warned that investors can always spend their capital elsewhere.

""Global investors are not yet at the point of turning their backs on UK infrastructure, but missteps around policy have eroded investor confidence,"" President Alina Osorio told Reuters.

The sentiment was echoed by other infrastructure investors, including one of the biggest in Britain, which has backed a company building electric vehicle chargers at motorways.

The fund manager, who asked not to be named, said a lack of new power had forced the company to adapt some of its projects.

Minal Patel, a partner at Schroders Greencoat, a renewable investment manager, said strong investor demand for renewable assets showed Britain remained attractive, but slow grid connections were a challenge.

CONNECTION

For Wightlink, the hunt for a connection has been fraught.

In 2022, SSEN quoted Wightlink 4.6 million pounds for 12MW connections to power the chargers it needs to install in Portsmouth and Fishbourne, according to documents seen by Reuters. The units must charge the electric ferry in the 20 minutes it has between sailings.

Work could be completed in around 12 months in Fishbourne - one of Wightlink's terminals on the Isle of Wight - but there was no timeline given for the Portsmouth connection.

Under the rules, a project like Wightlink's must accept a quote from the distribution network provider to secure a place in the connections queue.

But Wightlink's Greenfield said it could not order a 50 million pound ferry without a guarantee of power.

In the last week, SSEN said there could be enough capacity to deliver more than the power Wightlink initially wanted.

Wightlink's Head of Engineering &amp; Estates Charlie Field is hoping that a contract can finally be agreed.

However, grid connection delays threaten the project, jeopardizing investment. Despite funding, Wightlink requires a power contract before proceeding. The difficulties highlight the challenges in achieving Britain's net zero target by 2050.

British ferry operator Wightlink wants to order a $60 million, state-of-the-art electric ferry to make its crossings cleaner and greener. But it can't commission the vessel until it gets a power upgrade.

The company carries 4 million islanders, holidaymakers and festival goers every year on a five nautical mile crossing between England's picturesque southern coast and the Isle of Wight. The strait, known as the Solent, is popular with yachts and leisure craft, while much of the coastline is protected. Wightlink has funding in place for a electric-powered car ferry that would reduce emissions both at sea and in port, following in the path of pioneer Norway, which introduced the world's first in 2015.

The government has said decarbonising maritime transport is essential to achieving Britain's net zero target by 2050. Domestic maritime vessels represented around 5% of Britain's greenhouse gas emissions from transport in 2020, more than rail and buses combined, the government said in a 2022 report. And the long average lifespan of vessels means that greener ships must start being deployed by next year to achieve a green fleet by the 2050 deadline.

But interviews with 22 people - including investors, power company employees, government officials, Wightlink staff and countryside campaigners - revealed that long waits for grid connections combined with planning obstacles are putting millions of pounds of green transport investment at risk. ""We want to go electric. We think it's the right thing,"" Wightlink Chief Executive Keith Greenfield told Reuters onboard a hybrid ferry, which uses diesel to charge electric batteries, saving around 20% in emissions. ""We're held back by a lack of shore power.""

Wightlink needs to order its next ship within 12-18 months to replace an ageing vessel, but cannot commit to go solely electric without a legally binding power contract, Greenfield said. Regional network operator Scottish & Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) told Wightlink two years ago that a new connection at its Portsmouth terminal would require infrastructure upgrades, including at a nearby substation on the national high-voltage network, according to a document reviewed by Reuters and ferry company executives.

The substation improvements by National Grid were not scheduled to be completed until 2037. After Reuters interviewed Wightlink executives, SSEN said this month enough power may be available without the National Grid work, and it would hold new talks with the ferry company.

If Wightlink accepts a new quote from SSEN, it will be able to guarantee the capacity and confirm its place in the connections queue. ""We look forward to meeting them early next month to progress proposals,"" a SSEN spokesperson told Reuters. The comment declined to comment on the change.

The British bank -- which recently helped CVC Capital Partners Plc raise €2.3 billion in Europe's third-biggest initial public offering this year -- sees ""more to come"" from clients looking to do such deals, said Tom Swerling, who leads the stock underwriting business globally at Barclays.

""We are coming off a low-volume environment because the market was still concerned about interest rate visibility,"" Swerling said in an interview. ""But with more conviction on that both in Europe and in the US, investors are increasingly looking at IPOs as a source of alpha.""

Corporates chiefs across Europe are slowly tapping equity capital markets again, with companies on the continent raising $12.4 billion by IPOs this year, more than double the amount in the same period last year. Globally, though, IPO volume is still down over that time.

In the US, investors have spent much of the year furiously debating when the Federal Reserve will cut rates and by how much after inflation has proven to be much stickier than almost anyone predicted at the start of the year.

The ongoing uncertainty has stymied dealmaking and underwriting, crimping revenue at Wall Street's biggest banks. But Fed officials earlier this month coalesced around a desire to hold interest rates higher for longer, giving some bank executives hope that the additional clarity might bring a long-awaited rebound in activity.

European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde, meanwhile, recently indicated that an interest-rate cut is probable next month with the rapid gain in consumer-price growth now largely contained in the region.

""We are at the early stages of capital inflows into Europe,"" Swerling said. ""Investors are looking at policy divergence between the US and Europe with respect to rates as a potential entry point.""

Barclays, for its part, is expected to post about £80 million in equity underwriting revenue in the second quarter, according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That would be a 15% increase from a year earlier and more than double the £37 million in revenue the business generated in 2022.

The bank recently served as joint global coordinator on National Grid Plc's push to raise £6.8 billion, the UK's biggest equity deal in more than a decade. The firm also was appointed joint bookrunner on Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.'s plans to raise $4.5 billion from a convertible bond sale, which was the largest such offering globally in over 15 years.

Swerling said the flurry of investors looking to make a bet on artificial intelligence in some way should also support underwriting activity in the coming months. Already, companies involved in the semiconductor ecosystem, data centers and energy supply are looking to capital markets for help as they expand to meet growing demand for the technology as well as the AI firms themselves.

""These companies have ambitious plans,"" Swerling said. ""There is more to come in terms of equity raising. We see a good amount across the entirety of that industrial chain.""

Most Read from Bloomberg

The British bank -- which recently helped CVC Capital Partners Plc raise €2.3 billion in Europe's third-biggest initial public offering this year -- sees ""more to come"" from clients looking to do such deals, said Tom Swerling, who leads the stock underwriting business globally at Barclays.

""We are coming off a low-volume environment because the market was still concerned about interest rate visibility,"" Swerling said in an interview. ""But with more conviction on that both in Europe and in the US, investors are increasingly looking at IPOs as a source of alpha.""

Corporates chiefs across Europe are slowly tapping equity capital markets again, with companies on the continent raising $12.4 billion by IPOs this year, more than double the amount in the same period last year. Globally, though, IPO volume is still down over that time.

In the US, investors have spent much of the year furiously debating when the Federal Reserve will cut rates and by how much after inflation has proven to be much stickier than almost anyone predicted at the start of the year.

The ongoing uncertainty has stymied dealmaking and underwriting, crimping revenue at Wall Street's biggest banks. But Fed officials earlier this month coalesced around a desire to hold interest rates higher for longer, giving some bank executives hope that the additional clarity might bring a long-awaited rebound in activity.

If you're wondering why stock markets are down everywhere, the reason is they are recoiling by the big bully of the global financial system: the bond market.

Rising bond yields are putting downside pressure on stock indices, say analysts and traders.

""Asian, European and US stock indices slid on Wednesday following slightly hawkish Fed commentary and a disappointing bond auction on Tuesday,"" says market analyst Axel Rudolph at IG.

Samuel Springett, trading floor manager at Accendo says: ""The markets are a bit lacklustre ahead of the US GDP data tomorrow. Bond yields have hit four week highs which is causing the FTSE to sell off today.

""Rate cut worries are also resurfacing after the stronger than expected US consumer confidence data we had yesterday.""

Rapidly rising bond yields are doing the damage, with the US 2-year yield nearly hit the 5% mark and the 10-year nearly a four-week high around 4.60%, while the German 10-year yield touched its November 2023 peak at 2.66%.

Partly this is to do with central bank expectations, which are again being recalibrated due to inflation and other data like consumer confidence.

Ahead of Friday's big US PCE inflation gauge, Australian inflation came in stronger-than-expected overnight and hit a five-month high, practically ruling out a RBA rate cut this year, with German inflation rising, although in line with expectations.

3.16pm: More M&A news

The board of John Wood Group PLC (LSE:WG.) said it is ""evaluating"" a new takeover bid from Sidara, its Dubai-based rival, at 230p per share.

Dar Al-Handasah Consultants Shair and Partners, known as Sidara, has made what it is calling a ""fourth and final"" proposed offer, which the London-listed outfit says is unsolicited, preliminary and conditional.

The directors say they will make an announcement on their response shortly.

2.57pm: Political angles

After Royal Mail owner IDS agreed to a formal offer from Daniel Kretinsky's EP Group earlier, the deal is far from signed, sealed and delivered, with significant political roadblocks to overcome, my colleague Billy Farringdon write.

Both major parties have raised concerns over the takeover, though the Tories have made some supportive sounds.

But with Labour the overwhelming favourite to win the upcoming election, a political showdown with a Keir Starmer-fronted, union-aligned government is in store.

Elsewhere, water company shares have improved, with United Utilities Group PLC (LSE:UU.) top of the Footsie leaderboard, on reports that the industry regulator is keen for debt-laden utilities to face smaller fines for sewage dumping to allow time for them to ""recover"".

Ofwat reportedly intends to draw up a regime to enable water companies that need a major financial restructuring such as Thames Water to keep going but under tighter regulatory scrutiny.

2.39pm: FTSE tumbles lower

The FTSE 100 is slithering lower as the session wears on, a similar pattern to that seen in recent days, not helped as US sentiment seems downbeat today.

Most of the gains in the month have been wiped out, with the index having now sunk to its lowest since the first week of the month, down 0.8% today.

Of the top 30 largest companies in Footsie, 26 are in the red, with miners Rio Tinto down 2% and Glencore 1.4% among the larger moves.

National Grid is down another 3.2%.

It's not the worst performance in Europe though, with the French and Italian benchmarks down more than 1.4% and Germany's DAX down 1.1%.

US stocks have opened in the red just now, with the S&P 500 down 0.76% and the Nasdaq falling 0.70%, while the Dow Jones loses around 1% in initial trades.

2.20pm: A London IPO

Exciting news, we've had a new IPO in London today, on the Aquis Stock Exchange rather than the LSE.

Time to ACT PLC, an energy transition supply chain specialist, started trading this morning, brought to market by Novum Securities.

The Middlesbrough-based engineer was founded at GreenSpur, which provides electricity generator technology, in 2011 and then was renamed after the 2019 acquisition of Diffusion Alloys, a provider of metal coating services that is looking to specialise in low carbon-impact coatings for clean and renewable industries.

Both businesses are generating revenue, with the group reporting that it was profitable in 2023 and had £1.9 million cash in the bank on March 31.

In its IPO announcement earlier this month, Time to ACT said it hoped to raise up to £1 million of new cash ""to de-risk growth and in support of its strategy of coupling organic growth and acquisition"".

Executive chairman Chris Heminway says the listing ""marks a significant milestone"" for the company.

1.45pm: German inflation points to worrying 'stickiness'

German inflation rose slightly more than forecast to 2.8% in May, initial data from the federal statistics office shows.

Inflation hit a four-month high, up from 2.4% last month, driven by some one-off factors

The federal statistics office said German services prices rose 3.9% year on year, up from 3.4%, which offset a slowdown in goods inflation.

This flash data ""illustrates the stickiness of inflation in the entire eurozone"", said economists at ING, noting that the increase was mainly triggered by higher services inflation ""as a result of a reversed base effect from last year's introduction of cheap public transportation"", with most other components mainly stable.

Claus Vistesen at Pantheon Macro says: ""This is a well-telegraphed increase and it almost surely was driven by one-off factors in services, which don't change the overall downtrend in core inflation.

""That said, we still think this sets the tone for a relatively stick EZ report on Friday, and a further blow to hopes of two rate cuts over the summer.""

The euro has strengthened, erasing earlier losses against the US dollar and sterling.

1.36pm: Stake 'n chips

Activist hedge fund firm Elliott Investment Management has written to US chipmaker Texas Instruments Inc (NASDAQ:TXN) after building a stake worth more than $2.5bn.

In the letter to the company's board, Elliott called for Texas to ""adopt a dynamic capacity-management strategy"" and introduce a free cash flow per share target of $9-plus in 2026.

As well as picking out flaws it perceives in the company's strategy, Elliott says it believes in the ""strategic merit of American semiconductor manufacturing leadership"" and that ""TI is positioned as the only analogue company with proven industry leadership and proven technology to achieve this goal at scale"".

""Our diagnosis is simple,"" the activist said, ""investors are concerned that TI appears to have deviated from its longstanding commitment to drive growth of free cash flow per share.""

1.07pm: US to open lower

US stocks are expected to join the sell-off, and engage in a wide retreat when formal trading begins shortly.

S&P 500 futures are down 0.58%, Nasdaq 100 futures are 0.62% lower and those for the Dow Jones have fallen 0.59%.

European markets are bathed in red so far, led by a 1.2% fall in Paris for the CAC 40 and 1.1% decline for the FTSE MIB in Milan.

The FTSE 100 is down 0.4% and Germany's DAX has lost 0.8%.

Nvidia is just above the flatline in premarket trading, while Microsoft is down 0.8% and Amazon down 0.7%, while Apple is up 0.3%.

Market analyst David Morrison at Trade Nation said: ""There's been a big jump in US Treasury yields since Friday, and this appears to be weighing on sentiment.

""It's also fair to say that there's nothing out there which is undeniably positive. The first quarter earnings season is pretty much done now, so there's a risk that the market has lost one significant leg of support.""

""In the absence of fresh corporate results, investors will have to take their lead from upcoming economic data and comments from Federal Reserve members. The latter will be in short supply now as Fed members go into purdah in the week before the next monetary policy meeting which finishes on 12th June.""

Fed rate expectations are around their lowest this year, edging closer to just one 25-basis-point cut for the whole of 2024.

12.49pm: Anti-greenwashing rule starts this week

The FCA's anti-greenwashing rule for investment funds is coming into effect this Friday, designed to protect consumers by ensuring that only products and services can only be described as green or sustainable if claims can be backed up.

UK-based fund managers can use four new investment labels from 31 July 2024.

The four new labels are 'Sustainability Impact' (for funds investing in activities to achieve a real-world impact), 'Sustainability Focus' (funds that invest mainly in assets considered to be sustainable for the environment/society now), 'Sustainability Improvers' (investments in activities that are on a path to improving their sustainability for the environment/society over time), or 'Sustainability Mixed Goals'.

Last month, the FCA confirmed the date that the new rule begins to have an effect on 31 May, with naming and marketing rules for UK-based fund managers coming into effect from the start of this December.

Research as part of the regulator's Financial Lives survey found 81% of adults surveyed would like their investments to do some good as well as provide a financial return.

Lucy Blake, partner and ESG legal expert at law firm Jenner & Block, warned that the FCA is ""prepared to act against firms posing consumer harm or serious misconduct, with potential penalties including fines and suspensions,"" with greenwashing also potentially leading to actions from other UK regulators such as the Competition & Markets Authority and the Advertising Standards Authority, civil claims from consumers and reputational damage.

12.38pm: Trade union numbers rising

As we hear about a new doctor's strike, the trade union movement saw membership grew by 90,000 last year, according to the latest ONS data.

This is being hailed by the TUC, where general secretary Paul Nowak says: ""We need to get more people into trade unions - especially younger workers.

""Being a member of a union gives you an independent voice at work and remains the best way to win better pay and conditions. Every day unions reach agreements with employers that protect and enhance members' jobs and livelihoods and keep workplaces safer.""

He says employers and the economy ""benefit from the productivity gains motivated and well-organised workforces bring"".

The ONS stats also reveal that the union wage premium in the private sector increased in 2023 due to faster growth of average hourly wages for union members.

Earlier today, the FT reported that the ONS itself has been hit by a staff exodus in recent years, with around a fifth of the workforce leaving the official statistics agency, more than twice the number who joined.

The departures were up significantly on pre-pandemic levels.

12.17pm: Market sentiment 'hit by rates concerns'

The FTSE is falling due to stronger-than-expected US data and hawkish Fed comments that have hurt risk sentiment across the markets, says Fiona Cincotta, market analyst at City Index.

She also notes that the IMF has upwardly revised China's growth forecast to 5% after a solid first quarter and recent supportive policy measures from Beijing.

This has boosted oil companies but not miners, she says.

""Meanwhile, the UK economic calendar is quiet. Attention will be on Fed speakers later today for further clarification on the likelihood of the Fed cutting rates,"" Cincotta says.

12pm: Investment trust buybacks

Share buybacks from investment trusts are set to reach a record high this year as the UK's listed funds continue to capitalise on the wide gaps between their market and underlying value.

Investment trusts and funds bought back a total of £2.2 billion worth of shares in the first four months of 2024, a 106% jump compared to the same period last year, data from Winterfloods has revealed.

Last year a record £3.6 billion worth of shares was bought back by the sector.

11.55am: Big oil deal and junior doctors

ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP, ETR:YCP) is in advanced talks to acquire Marathon Oil Corp in a $15 billion all-paper deal, according to the Financial Times.

The takeover could be announced soon, though there is still a chance it could fall apart or face a rival bid, the newspaper added.

Elsewhere, junior doctors are going on a five-day strike in the run-up to the general election.

The British Medical Association, the main doctors' union, said there had been a failure to reach an agreement with the government to secure a better pay offer.

Junior doctors will walk out from June 27 to July 2.

They are looking for a 35% pay rise as pay between 2008 and 2022 has fallen by 26% once rising costs are taken into account, with a 35% increase now needed to reverse that drop.

11.16am: European watchdog clamps down on insider information

The European financial markets watchdog has issued a warning to companies having chats with analysts before they issue results publicly.

Companies should not disclose inside information on these pre-close calls, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) said, warning that they carry ""inherent risks of inadvertent unlawful disclosure.""

These pre-close calls are common practice in Europe prior to the blackout period before results, and often the timing mysteriously coincides with spikes or drops in the shares.

Or as ESMA said, they ""can influence market expectations and instrument prices"", with financial media having reported on volatile trading days around the time companies engaged in pre-close calls.

10.33am: Anglo denies BHP more time

The Anglo American PLC (LSE:AAL) board thinks BHP has not addressed its concerns about the ""disproportionate execution risk"" associated with the proposed takeover structure and the value for shareholders and so has unanimously decided to reject a further extension to the takeover deadline.

This means BHP has to 'put up or shut up' by 5pm today.

Anglo reckons BHP's proposal ""includes the same highly complex and unattractive structure as the proposals previously rejected"" over a month ago, including carrying out two demergers of Anglo's publicly listed subsidiaries side by side, while also completing the takeover.

The ""inter-conditional nature of the three transactions is unprecedented"", it said.

Anglo says its own restructuring plan is ""simpler"", though it is very similar to the BHP double-demerger proposal.

10.22am: Why are markets down?

The FTSE 100 is trading at a three-week low, with the dsix-day losing streak on track to be the longest losing streak since August last year.

Analyst chatter points to the index ""teetering on the edge of a correction phase,"" reports Reuters. If the Footsie retreat to the 8,000 mark it would confirm this trend.

""It's just investor concerns. It's been pessimistic over the last few days. It's also a very data-light week,"" Christopher Peters, trading floor manager at Accendo Markets tells the newswire.

He says the ""chunky, solid information coming next week"" is enough to prompt investors into taking ""a bit of a pause"".

10.15am: 'ChatGPT, analyse these accounts for me'

Accounting giant PwC is rolling out ChatGPT to its 100,000 US and UK staff, the Wall Street Journal is reporting.

In doing so, the big four auditor is set to become OpenAI's largest ChatGPT Enterprise customer and the first reseller of the business-facing AI model.

ChatGPT Enterprise is a version of the chatbot aimed at large companies.

Industry media say that many accounting professionals are already combining their existing spreadsheet skills with new generation AI tools to to improve efficiency, or asking chatbots like ChatGPT to Smith to interrogate profit and loss statements, etc.

10am: Working and non-working households

The Office for National Statistics has published data on the economic status of households in the UK and the people living in them.

Almost 59% of relevant households had all members aged 16 years and over in employment during the period from January to March 2024.

There were an estimated 26.7% of households with a mix of at least one working and one workless adult.

An estimated 14.4% of households where no member of the household was in employment.

Meanwhile, the FTSE 100 is holding its position, down 0.24%.

Other European indices are further in the red, with Spain's IBEX down 0.25%, Germany's Dax down 0.4%. Italy's FTSE MIB down 0.5% and France's CAC down 0.6%.

The pound has risen to its highest against the euro in 21 months as investors become ever more confident that the European Central Bank will cut interest rates next week, with the Bank of England expected to wait until August, September or even November.

Sterling is up 0.2% versus the single currency to £0.849, its highest level since August 2022.

9.40am: National Grid goes ex-rights, UBS does the maths

National Grid PLC (LSE:NG.) shares are down another 1.5% today and have now fallen over 16% in the two and a bit days since the rights issue announcement last week, if adjusting for the bonus element.

NG went 'ex rights' on Friday. So, of the original 3,722 million shares before the rights issue, every 24 shares owned has the right to buy seven new shares at a discounted price of 645p.

The rights have been consolidated up at 3.43 shares per right.and the rights trade separately, so there are now two routes to buying a single equity share in NG, as UBS explains.

NG.L share, which carried rights to the final dividend of 39.12p (which goes ex on 6 June); or a single NG right, which requires an additional 645p by 10 June to take up the rights, but is not entitled to the dividend.

""Apart from the dividend, there should only be a small difference between the two shares, owing to the option value to limit losses on the rights and the time value of money,"" UBS analyst Mark Freshney says, noting there is a 5p difference.

The key is the dividend cut and dividend preference theory, says the analyst.

""A number of high-yielding stocks have cut in the past four years and recovered (SSE, Orsted, Fortum, Centrica, REN), or else are grid-focused businesses with lower payout ratios (EON, SSE) as the shareholder base has refocused on SOTP/growth rather than yield.""

9.22am: Financial market fracture

Financial markets sentiment is ""fracturing"", reckons market analyst Susannah Streeter at Hargreaves Lansdown, pointing to ""AI exuberance"" powering mighty tech higher in one direction, and lingering worries about high interest rates keep investors cautious elsewhere.

""The FTSE 100 has opened on the back foot, as stubborn inflation remains in focus and the general election campaign continues to throw up economic and corporate uncertainty.""

She adds: ""Financial markets are increasingly running on two-speeds as alongside the AI frenzy, more broadly investors are becoming more wary about the impact of high borrowing costs on economies. The inflation snapshot in Australia has been unnerving, showing an acceleration to 3.6% year on year, rather than a decline.""

Ahead of the key US personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation reading on Friday, the Fed's preferred inflation barometer, could further fracture the mood or calm current jitters, Streeter adds.

On the Royal Mail deal, she noted that there is still some caution about whether the deal will go ahead, given that the government has the power under the National Security and Investment act to potentially block the deal.

""IDS comes with a lot of Royal Mail baggage, particularly the obligation to deliver letters six days a week as the UK's universal postal service, at a time when volumes are in sharp decline. But group's international arm GLS has long been considered the jewel in the company's crown, enjoying a level of success which Royal Mail has found elusive and EP Group will have been eyeing up the long-term opportunities here, particularly if inflation subsides further which should help margin growth.""

9am: European confidence

Some European economic data has been published this morning, with consumer confidence index in Germany climbing to -20.9 in June, from -24.0 in May, a touch above the consensus forecast of -22.5.

An equivalent measure in France was unchanged at 90 in May, slightly below the consensus estimate of 91.

8.57am: Green investor sees improved market sentiment, shares in the red tho

Shares in Impax Asset Management (AIM:IPX) are down 7% after the sustainability-focused fund manager reported interim results, which mostly seemed in line with expectations.

Operating profits came in at £25.8 million, a 5% decrease from last year but the dividend was held flat at 4.7p.

Assets under management at the end of March stood at £39.6 billion, a 6% increase over the half, with positive market movements and performance offsetting net outflows of £2.7 billion.

CEO Ian Simm says: ""Following nearly two years of relative headwinds, asset owner sentiment around the transition to a more sustainable economy and associated areas of Impax expertise has improved in recent months.

""We believe that companies providing innovative solutions that address environmental and social challenges remain compelling. Over the long run, we believe these companies can benefit from rising demand for their products and services and deliver strong earnings growth.""

8.33am: Bloomsbury buys and Fullers sells

Some deal news, first from Harry Potter and Sarah J Maas publisher Bloomsbury Publishing PLC, which has struck its largest deal to date.

It is acquiring US group Rowman & Littlefield's academic publishing business for £65 million, of which £60 million will be paid upfront in cash.

From reading to another favourite pastime, and pub chain Fuller Smith & Turner PLC (AIM:FSTA) has offloaded 37 tenanted pubs to Admiral Taverns for £18.3 million.

The sale represents a £1.6 million premium to the portfolio's gross asset value, Fuller's said.

8.19am: FTSE indexes falling lower

The Footsie is heading further into the red and has been joined by the FTSE 250, which had started higher.

London's mid-cap index is down 39 points at 20,666.

Mid-cap fallers include Mobico, as the National Express owner is among those likely to be demoted from the index in next week's quarterly reshuffle.

IWG, the former Regus, is down almost 6% after CEO Mark Dixon sold 35 million shares. The compaby said he is using the proceeds ""to unwind pledge and lending arrangements"" entered into by his investment vehicle Estorn Limited with Deutsche Bank Luxembourg.

Royal Mail owner IDS is one of the top risers as it received a firm offer from 'Czech Sphinx' Daniel Kretinsky, who belied his nickname by coming out with some assurances about how he will look after the company.

On the FTSE 100, the biggest fallers are Ocado, British Airways owner IAG, and electronics distributor RS Group.

8.08am: FTSE 100 opens lower again

As predicted, the FTSE 100 has moved lower in early trading, falling almost 10 points to 8,244.29 in the first few minutes.

Soon-to-be-demoted Ocado and St James's Place are among the fallers, Anglo American too.

7.55am: BHP wants to extend Anglo talks

Anglo American PLC (LSE:AAL) suitor BHP Group Ltd (LSE:BHP, ASX:BHP) has asked for another extension to its 'put up or shut up' takeover deadline as it offered new concessions, including a potential 'reverse break fee', and wants to continue talks.

Last week Anglo and BHP agreed on an extension to the deadline for BHP to make an offer to 29 May.

Since then, BHP says it has been working ""extensively"" to address key matters and has proposed a range of ""socioeconomic measures"" that it said are intended to address Anglo American's concerns about how the deal is structured... read more.

7.45am: The 'Czech Spinx' speaks!

The formal offer for the Royal Mail parent is worth around £3.57 billion (or £5.2 billion enterprise value if also including debt) and is unchanged from the mooted bid on 15 May.

It represents a 72.7% premium to the closing price on 16 April, when 'Czech Spinx' Křetínský first expressed interest in the group.

And today, going against his Spinx nickname, which was given to him in this country due to his enigmatic public persona and low-profile, Křetínský has added his name beside some quotes in the RNS statement.

These quotes are of the ""I'm an OK guy and will look after your company"" vein.

He says he knows Royal Mail forms ""part of the national infrastructure"" and is ""part of the fabric of UK society and has been for hundreds of years"".

He says owning the business ""will come with enormous responsibility - not just to the employees but to the citizens who rely on its services every day"".

He insists that the commitments EP is offering to the company and the government ""reflect how seriously we take this responsibility, to the benefit of IDS' employees, union representatives and all other stakeholders"".

""The EP Group is a patient, supportive investor with a long-term view and decades of experience in owning critical national infrastructure,"" he adds, but says its market is evolving quickly and it ""needs investments into modernisation to keep up with the competition"".

7.30am: Royal Mail owner recommends offer

The board of Royal Mail owner International Distributions Services PLC (LSE:IDS) has reached an agreement on the terms of a recommended cash offer from Czech billionaire Daniel Křetínský's EP Group after it made a formal offer of 370p per share.

As of yesterday, Křetínský's VESA investment vehicle owned a 27.6% stake in IDS.

IDS chair Keith Williams said: ""Both the IDS Board and EP are acutely aware of their responsibilities to IDS and particularly to the unique heritage of Royal Mail and its obligations as the designated Universal Service Provider of postal services in the UK.""

He said the board has ""negotiated a far-reaching package of legally binding undertakings and commitments"", including providing the current universal service obligation with first class letters still delivered six days a week, plus ""the financial stability and maintenance of the IDS Group including Royal Mail, the maintenance of employee benefits and pensions, and ensuring Royal Mail remains headquartered and tax resident in the UK"".

Williams said the board believes that the offer ""is fair and reasonable given that there are uncertainties ahead and allows investors to realise value at a significant premium"".

7.20am: What to watch today

Henry Allen of Deutsche Bank sums up the trading overview: ""markets struggled to gain much traction yesterday, with sovereign bonds selling off globally thanks to several hawkish headlines and weak demand at a Treasury auction"".

The initial catalyst for the selloff was the US consumer confidence indicator coming in positive for the first time since January.

""On the positive side, that helped to ease fears that the US economy might be starting to slow more meaningfully,"" says Allen, but ""it also led investors to dial back their expectations for future rate cuts"".

Reid says the hawkish trend was cemented by comments from Minneapolis Fed president Neel Kashkari, who said ""I don't think anybody has totally taken rate increases off the table"", and sounded relaxed about the Fed not needing to move too quickly to ease policy.

This was reflected in market pricing too, with the chance of a Fed rate cut by September falling from 58% on Monday to 50% by the close yesterday, and overnight it's declined further to just 46%, says Allen.

Looking at todays' macro data: inflation will remain in the spotlight with German CPI, ahead of the euro area print on Friday.

""These will be in particular focus, as this is the last inflation print ahead of the ECB's decision next week, at which they're widely expected to cut rates,"" says Allen.

""Overnight in Asia, risk appetite has remained weak as yields continue to move higher across the world. Moreover, that theme has continued overnight following a stronger-than-expected Australian CPI print, which rose to +3.6% in April (vs. +3.4% expected).""

Also today, a general election is taking place in South Africa, and in the US there's the Richmond Fed's manufacturing index for May, while central bank speakers include the Fed's Williams and Bostic, whilst the Fed will also release their Beige Book.

7.15am: FTSE 100 losing streak to continue

The FTSE 100's losing streak is on track to continue for a sixth session on Wednesday after a mixed close on Wall Street overnight and with Asian markets wallowing in red.

Spread-betters have called the London index down 35 points ahead of the open, having finished more than 63 points lower at 8,254.18 yesterday.

Last night, the Dow Jones fell 0.55% but the Nasdaq rose 0.59% to a new all-time high above 17,000, with the S&P 500 almost perfectly flat, with NVIDIA hitting a new all-time high but other tech mega-caps flattish.

All major Asian indices are in red this morning, with the Hang Seng down 1.9% and Nikkei 0.8% lower.

Also yesterday evening back in the UK, it was confirmed that Ocado Group PLC and St James's Place PLC will both drop out of the FTSE 100.

After Royal Mail owner IDS agreed to a formal offer from Daniel Kretinsky's EP Group earlier, the deal is far from signed, sealed and delivered, with significant political roadblocks to overcome, my colleague Billy Farringdon write.

Both major parties have raised concerns over the takeover, though the Tories have made some supportive sounds.

But with Labour the overwhelming favourite to win the upcoming election, a political showdown with a Keir Starmer-fronted, union-aligned government is in store.

Elsewhere, water company shares have improved on reports that the industry regulator is keen for debt-laden utilities to face smaller fines for sewage dumping to allow time for them to ""recover"".

Ofwat reportedly intends to draw up a regime to enable water companies that need a major financial restructuring such as Thames Water to keep going but under tighter regulatory scrutiny.

2.39pm: FTSE tumbles lower

The FTSE 100 is slithering lower as the session wears on, a similar pattern to that seen in recent days, not helped as US sentiment seems downbeat today.

Most of the gains in the month have been wiped out, with the index having now sunk to its lowest since the first week of the month, down 0.8% today.

Of the top 30 largest companies in Footsie, 26 are in the red, with miners Rio Tinto down 2% and Glencore 1.4% among the larger moves.

National Grid is down another 3.2%.

It's not the worst performance in Europe though, with the French and Italian benchmarks down more than 1.4% and Germany's DAX down 1.1%.

US stocks have opened in the red just now, with the S&P 500 down 0.76% and the Nasdaq falling 0.70%, while the Dow Jones loses around 1% in initial trades.

2.20pm: A London IPO

Exciting news, we've had a new IPO in London today, on the Aquis Stock Exchange rather than the LSE.

Time to ACT PLC, an energy transition supply chain specialist, started trading this morning, brought to market by Novum Securities.

The Middlesbrough-based engineer was founded at GreenSpur, which provides electricity generator technology, in 2011 and then was renamed after the 2019 acquisition of Diffusion Alloys, a provider of metal coating services that is looking to specialise in low carbon-impact coatings for clean and renewable industries.

Both businesses are generating revenue, with the group reporting that it was profitable in 2023 and had £1.9 million cash in the bank on March 31.

In its IPO announcement earlier this month, Time to ACT said it hoped to raise up to £1 million of new cash ""to de-risk growth and in support of its strategy of coupling organic growth and acquisition"".

Executive chairman Chris Heminway says the listing ""marks a significant milestone"" for the company.

""Time To ACT is committed to fostering innovation in this sector and developing engineering-led solutions for a cleaner, greener world. Being listed on the AQSE Growth Market will play an important role in helping us to deliver on this commitment.""

1.45pm: German inflation points to worrying 'stickiness'

German inflation rose slightly more than forecast to 2.8% in May, initial data from the federal statistics office shows.

Inflation hit a four-month high, up from 2.4% last month, driven by some one-off factors

The federal statistics office said German services prices rose 3.9% year on year, up from 3.4%, which offset a slowdown in goods inflation.

This flash data ""illustrates the stickiness of inflation in the entire eurozone"", said economists at ING, noting that the increase was mainly triggered by higher services inflation ""as a result of a reversed base effect from last year's introduction of cheap public transportation"", with most other components mainly stable.

Claus Vistesen at Pantheon Macro says: ""This is a well-telegraphed increase and it almost surely was driven by one-off factors in services, which don't change the overall downtrend in core inflation.

""That said, we still think this sets the tone for a relatively stick EZ report on Friday, and a further blow to hopes of two rate cuts over the summer.""

The euro has strengthened, erasing earlier losses against the US dollar and sterling.

1.36pm: Stake 'n chips

Activist hedge fund firm Elliott Investment Management has written to Texas Instruments Inc (NASDAQ:TXN) after building a stake worth more than $2.5bn.

In the letter to the company's board, Elliott called for Texas to ""adopt a dynamic capacity-management strategy"" and introduce a free cash flow per share target of $9-plus in 2026.

As well as picking out flaws it perceives in the company's strategy, Elliott says it believes in the ""strategic merit of American semiconductor manufacturing leadership"" and that ""TI is positioned as the only analogue company with proven industry leadership and proven technology to achieve this goal at scale"".

""Our diagnosis is simple,"" the activist said, ""investors are concerned that TI appears to have deviated from its longstanding commitment to drive growth of free cash flow per share.""

1.07pm: US to open lower

US stocks are expected to join the sell-off, and engage in a wide retreat when formal trading begins shortly.

S&P 500 futures are down 0.58%, Nasdaq 100 futures are 0.62% lower and those for the Dow Jones have fallen 0.59%.

European markets are bathed in red so far, led by a 1.2% fall in Paris for the CAC 40 and 1.1% decline for the FTSE MIB in Milan.

The FTSE 100 is down 0.4% and Germany's DAX has lost 0.8%.

Nvidia is just above the flatline in premarket trading, while Microsoft is down 0.8% and Amazon down 0.7%, while Apple is up 0.3%.

Market analyst David Morrison at Trade Nation said: ""There's been a big jump in US Treasury yields since Friday, and this appears to be weighing on sentiment.

""It's also fair to say that there's nothing out there which is undeniably positive. The first quarter earnings season is pretty much done now, so there's a risk that the market has lost one significant leg of support.""

""In the absence of fresh corporate results, investors will have to take their lead from upcoming economic data and comments from Federal Reserve members. The latter will be in short supply now as Fed members go into purdah in the week before the next monetary policy meeting which finishes on 12th June.""

Fed rate expectations are around their lowest this year, edging closer to just one 25-basis-point cut for the whole of 2024.

12.49pm: Anti-greenwashing rule starts this week

The FCA's anti-greenwashing rule for investment funds is coming into effect this Friday, designed to protect consumers by ensuring that only products and services can only be described as green or sustainable if claims can be backed up.

UK-based fund managers can use four new investment labels from 31 July 2024.

The four new labels are 'Sustainability Impact' (for funds investing in activities to achieve a real-world impact), 'Sustainability Focus' (funds that invest mainly in assets considered to be sustainable for the environment/society now), 'Sustainability Improvers' (investments in activities that are on a path to improving their sustainability for the environment/society over time), or 'Sustainability Mixed Goals'.

Last month, the FCA confirmed the date that the new rule begins to have an effect on 31 May, with naming and marketing rules for UK-based fund managers coming into effect from the start of this December.

Research as part of the regulator's Financial Lives survey found 81% of adults surveyed would like their investments to do some good as well as provide a financial return.

Lucy Blake, partner and ESG legal expert at law firm Jenner & Block, warned that the FCA is ""prepared to act against firms posing consumer harm or serious misconduct, with potential penalties including fines and suspensions,"" with greenwashing also potentially leading to actions from other UK regulators such as the Competition & Markets Authority and the Advertising Standards Authority, civil claims from consumers and reputational damage.

12.38pm: Trade union numbers rising

As we hear about a new doctor's strike, the trade union movement saw membership grew by 90,000 last year, according to the latest ONS data.

This is being hailed by the TUC, where general secretary Paul Nowak says: ""We need to get more people into trade unions - especially younger workers.

""Being a member of a union gives you an independent voice at work and remains the best way to win better pay and conditions. Every day unions reach agreements with employers that protect and enhance members' jobs and livelihoods and keep workplaces safer.""

He says employers and the economy ""benefit from the productivity gains motivated and well-organised workforces bring"".

The ONS stats also reveal that the union wage premium in the private sector increased in 2023 due to faster growth of average hourly wages for union members.

Earlier today, the FT reported that the ONS itself has been hit by a staff exodus in recent years, with around a fifth of the workforce leaving the official statistics agency, more than twice the number who joined.

The departures were up significantly on pre-pandemic levels.

12.17pm: Market sentiment 'hit by rates concerns'

The FTSE is falling due to stronger-than-expected US data and hawkish Fed comments that have hurt risk sentiment across the markets, says Fiona Cincotta, market analyst at City Index.

She also notes that the IMF has upwardly revised China's growth forecast to 5% after a solid first quarter and recent supportive policy measures from Beijing.

This has boosted oil companies but not miners, she says.

""Meanwhile, the UK economic calendar is quiet. Attention will be on Fed speakers later today for further clarification on the likelihood of the Fed cutting rates,"" Cincotta says.

12pm: Investment trust buybacks

Share buybacks from investment trusts are set to reach a record high this year as the UK's listed funds continue to capitalise on the wide gaps between their market and underlying value.

Investment trusts and funds bought back a total of £2.2 billion worth of shares in the first four months of 2024, a 106% jump compared to the same period last year, data from Winterfloods has revealed.

Last year a record £3.6 billion worth of shares was bought back by the sector.

11.55am: Big oil deal and junior doctors

ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP, ETR:YCP) is in advanced talks to acquire Marathon Oil Corp in a $15 billion all-paper deal, according to the Financial Times.

The takeover could be announced soon, though there is still a chance it could fall apart or face a rival bid, the newspaper added.

Elsewhere, junior doctors are going on a five-day strike in the run-up to the general election.

The British Medical Association, the main doctors' union, said there had been a failure to reach an agreement with the government to secure a better pay offer.

Junior doctors will walk out from June 27 to July 2.

They are looking for a 35% pay rise as pay between 2008 and 2022 has fallen by 26% once rising costs are taken into account, with a 35% increase now needed to reverse that drop.

11.16am: European watchdog clamps down on insider information

The European financial markets watchdog has issued a warning to companies having chats with analysts before they issue results publicly.

Companies should not disclose inside information on these pre-close calls, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) said, warning that they carry ""inherent risks of inadvertent unlawful disclosure.""

These pre-close calls are common practice in Europe prior to the blackout period before results, and often the timing mysteriously coincides with spikes or drops in the shares.

Or as ESMA said, they ""can influence market expectations and instrument prices"", with financial media having reported on volatile trading days around the time companies engaged in pre-close calls.

10.33am: Anglo denies BHP more time

The Anglo American PLC (LSE:AAL) board thinks BHP has not addressed its concerns about the ""disproportionate execution risk"" associated with the proposed takeover structure and the value for shareholders and so has unanimously decided to reject a further extension to the takeover deadline.

This means BHP has to 'put up or shut up' by 5pm today.

Anglo reckons BHP's proposal ""includes the same highly complex and unattractive structure as the proposals previously rejected"" over a month ago, including carrying out two demergers of Anglo's publicly listed subsidiaries side by side, while also completing the takeover.

The ""inter-conditional nature of the three transactions is unprecedented"", it said.

Anglo says its own restructuring plan is ""simpler"", though it is very similar to the BHP double-demerger proposal.

10.22am: Why are markets down?

The FTSE 100 is trading at a three-week low, with the dsix-day losing streak on track to be the longest losing streak since August last year.

Analyst chatter points to the index ""teetering on the edge of a correction phase,"" reports Reuters. If the Footsie retreat to the 8,000 mark it would confirm this trend.

""It's just investor concerns. It's been pessimistic over the last few days. It's also a very data-light week,"" Christopher Peters, trading floor manager at Accendo Markets tells the newswire.

He says the ""chunky, solid information coming next week"" is enough to prompt investors into taking ""a bit of a pause"".

10.15am: 'ChatGPT, analyse these accounts for me'

Accounting giant PwC is rolling out ChatGPT to its 100,000 US and UK staff, the Wall Street Journal is reporting.

In doing so, the big four auditor is set to become OpenAI's largest ChatGPT Enterprise customer and the first reseller of the business-facing AI model.

ChatGPT Enterprise is a version of the chatbot aimed at large companies.

Industry media say that many accounting professionals are already combining their existing spreadsheet skills with new generation AI tools to to improve efficiency, or asking chatbots like ChatGPT to Smith to interrogate profit and loss statements, etc.

10am: Working and non-working households

The Office for National Statistics has published data on the economic status of households in the UK and the people living in them.

Almost 59% of relevant households had all members aged 16 years and over in employment during the period from January to March 2024.

There were an estimated 26.7% of households with a mix of at least one working and one workless adult.

An estimated 14.4% of households where no member of the household was in employment.

Meanwhile, the FTSE 100 is holding its position, down 0.24%.

Other European indices are further in the red, with Spain's IBEX down 0.25%, Germany's Dax down 0.4%. Italy's FTSE MIB down 0.5% and France's CAC down 0.6%.

The pound has risen to its highest against the euro in 21 months as investors become ever more confident that the European Central Bank will cut interest rates next week, with the Bank of England expected to wait until August, September or even November.

Sterling is up 0.2% versus the single currency to £0.849, its highest level since August 2022.

9.40am: National Grid goes ex-rights, UBS does the maths

National Grid PLC (LSE:NG.) shares are down another 1.5% today and have now fallen over 16% in the two and a bit days since the rights issue announcement last week, if adjusting for the bonus element.

NG went 'ex rights' on Friday. So, of the original 3,722 million shares before the rights issue, every 24 shares owned has the right to buy seven new shares at a discounted price of 645p.

The rights have been consolidated up at 3.43 shares per right.and the rights trade separately, so there are now two routes to buying a single equity share in NG, as UBS explains.

NG.L share, which carried rights to the final dividend of 39.12p (which goes ex on 6 June); or a single NG right, which requires an additional 645p by 10 June to take up the rights, but is not entitled to the dividend.

""Apart from the dividend, there should only be a small difference between the two shares, owing to the option value to limit losses on the rights and the time value of money,"" UBS analyst Mark Freshney says, noting there is a 5p difference.

The key is the dividend cut and dividend preference theory, says the analyst.

""A number of high-yielding stocks have cut in the past four years and recovered (SSE, Orsted, Fortum, Centrica, REN), or else are grid-focused businesses with lower payout ratios (EON, SSE) as the shareholder base has refocused on SOTP/growth rather than yield.""

9.22am: Financial market fracture

Financial markets sentiment is ""fracturing"", reckons market analyst Susannah Streeter at Hargreaves Lansdown, pointing to ""AI exuberance"" powering mighty tech higher in one direction, and lingering worries about high interest rates keep investors cautious elsewhere.

""The FTSE 100 has opened on the back foot, as stubborn inflation remains in focus and the general election campaign continues to throw up economic and corporate uncertainty.""

She adds: ""Financial markets are increasingly running on two-speeds as alongside the AI frenzy, more broadly investors are becoming more wary about the impact of high borrowing costs on economies. The inflation snapshot in Australia has been unnerving, showing an acceleration to 3.6% year on year, rather than a decline.""

Ahead of the key US personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation reading on Friday, the Fed's preferred inflation barometer, could further fracture the mood or calm current jitters, Streeter adds.

On the Royal Mail deal, she noted that there is still some caution about whether the deal will go ahead, given that the government has the power under the National Security and Investment act to potentially block the deal.

""IDS comes with a lot of Royal Mail baggage, particularly the obligation to deliver letters six days a week as the UK's universal postal service, at a time when volumes are in sharp decline. But group's international arm GLS has long been considered the jewel in the company's crown, enjoying a level of success which Royal Mail has found elusive and EP Group will have been eyeing up the long-term opportunities here, particularly if inflation subsides further which should help margin growth.""

9am: European confidence

Some European economic data has been published this morning, with consumer confidence index in Germany climbing to -20.9 in June, from -24.0 in May, a touch above the consensus forecast of -22.5.

An equivalent measure in France was unchanged at 90 in May, slightly below the consensus estimate of 91.

8.57am: Green investor sees improved market sentiment, shares in the red tho

Shares in Impax Asset Management (AIM:IPX) are down 7% after the sustainability-focused fund manager reported interim results, which mostly seemed in line with expectations.

Operating profits came in at £25.8 million, a 5% decrease from last year but the dividend was held flat at 4.7p.

Assets under management at the end of March stood at £39.6 billion, a 6% increase over the half, with positive market movements and performance offsetting net outflows of £2.7 billion.

CEO Ian Simm says: ""Following nearly two years of relative headwinds, asset owner sentiment around the transition to a more sustainable economy and associated areas of Impax expertise has improved in recent months.

""We believe that companies providing innovative solutions that address environmental and social challenges remain compelling. Over the long run, we believe these companies can benefit from rising demand for their products and services and deliver strong earnings growth.""

8.33am: Bloomsbury buys and Fullers sells

Some deal news, first from Harry Potter and Sarah J Maas publisher Bloomsbury Publishing PLC, which has struck its largest deal to date.

It is acquiring US group Rowman & Littlefield's academic publishing business for £65 million, of which £60 million will be paid upfront in cash.

From reading to another favourite pastime, and pub chain Fuller Smith & Turner PLC (AIM:FSTA) has offloaded 37 tenanted pubs to Admiral Taverns for £18.3 million.

The sale represents a £1.6 million premium to the portfolio's gross asset value, Fuller's said.

8.19am: FTSE indexes falling lower

The Footsie is heading further into the red and has been joined by the FTSE 250, which had started higher.

London's mid-cap index is down 39 points at 20,666.

Mid-cap fallers include Mobico, as the National Express owner is among those likely to be demoted from the index in next week's quarterly reshuffle.

IWG, the former Regus, is down almost 6% after CEO Mark Dixon sold 35 million shares. The compaby said he is using the proceeds ""to unwind pledge and lending arrangements"" entered into by his investment vehicle Estorn Limited with Deutsche Bank Luxembourg.

Royal Mail owner IDS is one of the top risers as it received a firm offer from 'Czech Sphinx' Daniel Kretinsky, who belied his nickname by coming out with some assurances about how he will look after the company.

On the FTSE 100, the biggest fallers are Ocado, British Airways owner IAG, and electronics distributor RS Group.

8.08am: FTSE 100 opens lower again

As predicted, the FTSE 100 has moved lower in early trading, falling almost 10 points to 8,244.29 in the first few minutes.

Soon-to-be-demoted Ocado and St James's Place are among the fallers, Anglo American too.

7.55am: BHP wants to extend Anglo talks

Anglo American PLC (LSE:AAL) suitor BHP Group Ltd (LSE:BHP, ASX:BHP) has asked for another extension to its 'put up or shut up' takeover deadline as it offered new concessions, including a potential 'reverse break fee', and wants to continue talks.

Last week Anglo and BHP agreed on an extension to the deadline for BHP to make an offer to 29 May.

Since then, BHP says it has been working ""extensively"" to address key matters and has proposed a range of ""socioeconomic measures"" that it said are intended to address Anglo American's concerns about how the deal is structured... read more.

7.45am: The 'Czech Spinx' speaks!

The formal offer for the Royal Mail parent is worth around £3.57 billion (or £5.2 billion enterprise value if also including debt) and is unchanged from the mooted bid on 15 May.

It represents a 72.7% premium to the closing price on 16 April, when 'Czech Spinx' Křetínský first expressed interest in the group.

And today, going against his Spinx nickname, which was given to him in this country due to his enigmatic public persona and low-profile, Křetínský has added his name beside some quotes in the RNS statement.

These quotes are of the ""I'm an OK guy and will look after your company"" vein.

He says he knows Royal Mail forms ""part of the national infrastructure"" and is ""part of the fabric of UK society and has been for hundreds of years"".

He says owning the business ""will come with enormous responsibility - not just to the employees but to the citizens who rely on its services every day"".

He insists that the commitments EP is offering to the company and the government ""reflect how seriously we take this responsibility, to the benefit of IDS' employees, union representatives and all other stakeholders"".

""The EP Group is a patient, supportive investor with a long-term view and decades of experience in owning critical national infrastructure,"" he adds, but says its market is evolving quickly and it ""needs investments into modernisation to keep up with the competition"".

7.30am: Royal Mail owner recommends offer

The board of Royal Mail owner International Distributions Services PLC (LSE:IDS) has reached an agreement on the terms of a recommended cash offer from Czech billionaire Daniel Křetínský's EP Group after it made a formal offer of 370p per share.

As of yesterday, Křetínský's VESA investment vehicle owned a 27.6% stake in IDS.

IDS chair Keith Williams said: ""Both the IDS Board and EP are acutely aware of their responsibilities to IDS and particularly to the unique heritage of Royal Mail and its obligations as the designated Universal Service Provider of postal services in the UK.""

He said the board has ""negotiated a far-reaching package of legally binding undertakings and commitments"", including providing the current universal service obligation with first class letters still delivered six days a week, plus ""the financial stability and maintenance of the IDS Group including Royal Mail, the maintenance of employee benefits and pensions, and ensuring Royal Mail remains headquartered and tax resident in the UK"".

Williams said the board believes that the offer ""is fair and reasonable given that there are uncertainties ahead and allows investors to realise value at a significant premium"".

7.20am: What to watch today

Henry Allen of Deutsche Bank sums up the trading overview: ""markets struggled to gain much traction yesterday, with sovereign bonds selling off globally thanks to several hawkish headlines and weak demand at a Treasury auction"".

The initial catalyst for the selloff was the US consumer confidence indicator coming in positive for the first time since January.

""On the positive side, that helped to ease fears that the US economy might be starting to slow more meaningfully,"" says Allen, but ""it also led investors to dial back their expectations for future rate cuts"".

Reid says the hawkish trend was cemented by comments from Minneapolis Fed president Neel Kashkari, who said ""I don't think anybody has totally taken rate increases off the table"", and sounded relaxed about the Fed not needing to move too quickly to ease policy.

This was reflected in market pricing too, with the chance of a Fed rate cut by September falling from 58% on Monday to 50% by the close yesterday, and overnight it's declined further to just 46%, says Allen.

Looking at todays' macro data: inflation will remain in the spotlight with German CPI, ahead of the euro area print on Friday.

""These will be in particular focus, as this is the last inflation print ahead of the ECB's decision next week, at which they're widely expected to cut rates,"" says Allen.

""Overnight in Asia, risk appetite has remained weak as yields continue to move higher across the world. Moreover, that theme has continued overnight following a stronger-than-expected Australian CPI print, which rose to +3.6% in April (vs. +3.4% expected).""

Also today, a general election is taking place in South Africa, and in the US there's the Richmond Fed's manufacturing index for May, while central bank speakers include the Fed's Williams and Bostic, whilst the Fed will also release their Beige Book.

7.15am: FTSE 100 losing streak to continue

The FTSE 100's losing streak is on track to continue for a sixth session on Wednesday after a mixed close on Wall Street overnight and with Asian markets wallowing in red.

Spread-betters have called the London index down 35 points ahead of the open, having finished more than 63 points lower at 8,254.18 yesterday.

Last night, the Dow Jones fell 0.55% but the Nasdaq rose 0.59% to a new all-time high above 17,000, with the S&P 500 almost perfectly flat, with NVIDIA hitting a new all-time high but other tech mega-caps flattish.

All major Asian indices are in red this morning, with the Hang Seng down 1.9% and Nikkei 0.8% lower.

2.39pm: FTSE tumbles lower

The FTSE 100 is slithering lower as the session wears on, a similar pattern to that seen in recent days, not helped as US sentiment seems downbeat today.

Most of the gains in the month have been wiped out, with the index having now sunk to its lowest since the first week of the month, down 0.8% today.

It's not the worst performance in Europe though, with the French and Italian benchmarks down more than 1.4% and Germany's DAX down 1.1%.

US stocks have opened in the red just now, with the S&P 500 down 0.76% and the Nasdaq falling 0.70%, while the Dow Jones loses around 1% in initial trades.

2.20pm: A London IPO

Exciting news, we've had a new IPO in London today, on the Aquis Stock Exchange rather than the LSE.

Time to ACT PLC, an energy transition supply chain specialist, started trading this morning, brought to market by Novum Securities.

The Middlesbrough-based engineer was founded at GreenSpur, which provides electricity generator technology, in 2011 and then was renamed after the 2019 acquisition of Diffusion Alloys, a provider of metal coating services that is looking to specialise in low carbon-impact coatings for clean and renewable industries.

Both businesses are generating revenue, with the group reporting that it was profitable in 2023 and had £1.9 million cash in the bank on March 31.

In its IPO announcement earlier this month, Time to ACT said it hoped to raise up to £1 million of new cash ""to de-risk growth and in support of its strategy of coupling organic growth and acquisition"".

Executive chairman Chris Heminway says the listing ""marks a significant milestone"" for the company.

""Time To ACT is committed to fostering innovation in this sector and developing engineering-led solutions for a cleaner, greener world. Being listed on the AQSE Growth Market will play an important role in helping us to deliver on this commitment.""

1.45pm: German inflation points to worrying 'stickiness'

German inflation rose slightly more than forecast to 2.8% in May, initial data from the federal statistics office shows.

Inflation hit a four-month high, up from 2.4% last month, driven by some one-off factors

The federal statistics office said German services prices rose 3.9% year on year, up from 3.4%, which offset a slowdown in goods inflation.

This flash data ""illustrates the stickiness of inflation in the entire eurozone"", said economists at ING, noting that the increase was mainly triggered by higher services inflation ""as a result of a reversed base effect from last year's introduction of cheap public transportation"", with most other components mainly stable.

Claus Vistesen at Pantheon Macro says: ""This is a well-telegraphed increase and it almost surely was driven by one-off factors in services, which don't change the overall downtrend in core inflation.

""That said, we still think this sets the tone for a relatively stick EZ report on Friday, and a further blow to hopes of two rate cuts over the summer.""

The euro has strengthened, erasing earlier losses against the US dollar and sterling.

1.36pm: Stake 'n chips

Activist hedge fund firm Elliott Investment Management has written to Texas Instruments Inc (NASDAQ:TXN) after building a stake worth more than $2.5bn.

In the letter to the company's board, Elliott called for Texas to ""adopt a dynamic capacity-management strategy"" and introduce a free cash flow per share target of $9-plus in 2026.

As well as picking out flaws it perceives in the company's strategy, Elliott says it believes in the ""strategic merit of American semiconductor manufacturing leadership"" and that ""TI is positioned as the only analogue company with proven industry leadership and proven technology to achieve this goal at scale"".

""Our diagnosis is simple,"" the activist said, ""investors are concerned that TI appears to have deviated from its longstanding commitment to drive growth of free cash flow per share.""

1.07pm: US to open lower

US stocks are expected to join the sell-off, and engage in a wide retreat when formal trading begins shortly.

S&P 500 futures are down 0.58%, Nasdaq 100 futures are 0.62% lower and those for the Dow Jones have fallen 0.59%.

European markets are bathed in red so far, led by a 1.2% fall in Paris for the CAC 40 and 1.1% decline for the FTSE MIB in Milan.

The FTSE 100 is down 0.4% and Germany's DAX has lost 0.8%.

Nvidia is just above the flatline in premarket trading, while Microsoft is down 0.8% and Amazon down 0.7%, while Apple is up 0.3%.

Market analyst David Morrison at Trade Nation said: ""There's been a big jump in US Treasury yields since Friday, and this appears to be weighing on sentiment.

""It's also fair to say that there's nothing out there which is undeniably positive. The first quarter earnings season is pretty much done now, so there's a risk that the market has lost one significant leg of support.""

""In the absence of fresh corporate results, investors will have to take their lead from upcoming economic data and comments from Federal Reserve members. The latter will be in short supply now as Fed members go into purdah in the week before the next monetary policy meeting which finishes on 12th June.""

Fed rate expectations are around their lowest this year, edging closer to just one 25-basis-point cut for the whole of 2024.

12.49pm: Anti-greenwashing rule starts this week

The FCA's anti-greenwashing rule for investment funds is coming into effect this Friday, designed to protect consumers by ensuring that only products and services can only be described as green or sustainable if claims can be backed up.

UK-based fund managers can use four new investment labels from 31 July 2024.

The four new labels are 'Sustainability Impact' (for funds investing in activities to achieve a real-world impact), 'Sustainability Focus' (funds that invest mainly in assets considered to be sustainable for the environment/society now), 'Sustainability Improvers' (investments in activities that are on a path to improving their sustainability for the environment/society over time), or 'Sustainability Mixed Goals'.

Last month, the FCA confirmed the date that the new rule begins to have an effect on 31 May, with naming and marketing rules for UK-based fund managers coming into effect from the start of this December.

Research as part of the regulator's Financial Lives survey found 81% of adults surveyed would like their investments to do some good as well as provide a financial return.

Lucy Blake, partner and ESG legal expert at law firm Jenner & Block, warned that the FCA is ""prepared to act against firms posing consumer harm or serious misconduct, with potential penalties including fines and suspensions,"" with greenwashing also potentially leading to actions from other UK regulators such as the Competition & Markets Authority and the Advertising Standards Authority, civil claims from consumers and reputational damage.

12.38pm: Trade union numbers rising

As we hear about a new doctor's strike, the trade union movement saw membership grew by 90,000 last year, according to the latest ONS data.

This is being hailed by the TUC, where general secretary Paul Nowak says: ""We need to get more people into trade unions - especially younger workers.

""Being a member of a union gives you an independent voice at work and remains the best way to win better pay and conditions. Every day unions reach agreements with employers that protect and enhance members' jobs and livelihoods and keep workplaces safer.""

He says employers and the economy ""benefit from the productivity gains motivated and well-organised workforces bring"".

The ONS stats also reveal that the union wage premium in the private sector increased in 2023 due to faster growth of average hourly wages for union members.

Earlier today, the FT reported that the ONS itself has been hit by a staff exodus in recent years, with around a fifth of the workforce leaving the official statistics agency, more than twice the number who joined.

The departures were up significantly on pre-pandemic levels.

12.17pm: Market sentiment 'hit by rates concerns'

The FTSE is falling due to stronger-than-expected US data and hawkish Fed comments that have hurt risk sentiment across the markets, says Fiona Cincotta, market analyst at City Index.

She also notes that the IMF has upwardly revised China's growth forecast to 5% after a solid first quarter and recent supportive policy measures from Beijing.

This has boosted oil companies but not miners, she says.

""Meanwhile, the UK economic calendar is quiet. Attention will be on Fed speakers later today for further clarification on the likelihood of the Fed cutting rates,"" Cincotta says.

12pm: Investment trust buybacks

Share buybacks from investment trusts are set to reach a record high this year as the UK's listed funds continue to capitalise on the wide gaps between their market and underlying value.

Investment trusts and funds bought back a total of £2.2 billion worth of shares in the first four months of 2024, a 106% jump compared to the same period last year, data from Winterfloods has revealed.

Last year a record £3.6 billion worth of shares was bought back by the sector.

11.55am: Big oil deal and junior doctors

ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP, ETR:YCP) is in advanced talks to acquire Marathon Oil Corp in a $15 billion all-paper deal, according to the Financial Times.

The takeover could be announced soon, though there is still a chance it could fall apart or face a rival bid, the newspaper added.

Elsewhere, junior doctors are going on a five-day strike in the run-up to the general election.

The British Medical Association, the main doctors' union, said there had been a failure to reach an agreement with the government to secure a better pay offer.

Junior doctors will walk out from June 27 to July 2.

They are looking for a 35% pay rise as pay between 2008 and 2022 has fallen by 26% once rising costs are taken into account, with a 35% increase now needed to reverse that drop.

11.16am: European watchdog clamps down on insider information

The European financial markets watchdog has issued a warning to companies having chats with analysts before they issue results publicly.

Companies should not disclose inside information on these pre-close calls, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) said, warning that they carry ""inherent risks of inadvertent unlawful disclosure.""

These pre-close calls are common practice in Europe prior to the blackout period before results, and often the timing mysteriously coincides with spikes or drops in the shares.

Or as ESMA said, they ""can influence market expectations and instrument prices"", with financial media having reported on volatile trading days around the time companies engaged in pre-close calls.

10.33am: Anglo denies BHP more time

The Anglo American PLC (LSE:AAL) board thinks BHP has not addressed its concerns about the ""disproportionate execution risk"" associated with the proposed takeover structure and the value for shareholders and so has unanimously decided to reject a further extension to the takeover deadline.

This means BHP has to 'put up or shut up' by 5pm today.

Anglo reckons BHP's proposal ""includes the same highly complex and unattractive structure as the proposals previously rejected"" over a month ago, including carrying out two demergers of Anglo's publicly listed subsidiaries side by side, while also completing the takeover.

The ""inter-conditional nature of the three transactions is unprecedented"", it said.

Anglo says its own restructuring plan is ""simpler"", though it is very similar to the BHP double-demerger proposal.

10.22am: Why are markets down?

The FTSE 100 is trading at a three-week low, with the dsix-day losing streak on track to be the longest losing streak since August last year.

Analyst chatter points to the index ""teetering on the edge of a correction phase,"" reports Reuters. If the Footsie retreat to the 8,000 mark it would confirm this trend.

""It's just investor concerns. It's been pessimistic over the last few days. It's also a very data-light week,"" Christopher Peters, trading floor manager at Accendo Markets tells the newswire.

He says the ""chunky, solid information coming next week"" is enough to prompt investors into taking ""a bit of a pause"".

10.15am: 'ChatGPT, analyse these accounts for me'

Accounting giant PwC is rolling out ChatGPT to its 100,000 US and UK staff, the Wall Street Journal is reporting.

In doing so, the big four auditor is set to become OpenAI's largest ChatGPT Enterprise customer and the first reseller of the business-facing AI model.

ChatGPT Enterprise is a version of the chatbot aimed at large companies.

Industry media say that many accounting professionals are already combining their existing spreadsheet skills with new generation AI tools to to improve efficiency, or asking chatbots like ChatGPT to Smith to interrogate profit and loss statements, etc.

10am: Working and non-working households

The Office for National Statistics has published data on the economic status of households in the UK and the people living in them.

Almost 59% of relevant households had all members aged 16 years and over in employment during the period from January to March 2024.

There were an estimated 26.7% of households with a mix of at least one working and one workless adult.

An estimated 14.4% of households where no member of the household was in employment.

Meanwhile, the FTSE 100 is holding its position, down 0.24%.

Other European indices are further in the red, with Spain's IBEX down 0.25%, Germany's Dax down 0.4%. Italy's FTSE MIB down 0.5% and France's CAC down 0.6%.

The pound has risen to its highest against the euro in 21 months as investors become ever more confident that the European Central Bank will cut interest rates next week, with the Bank of England expected to wait until August, September or even November.

Sterling is up 0.2% versus the single currency to £0.849, its highest level since August 2022.

9.40am: National Grid goes ex-rights, UBS does the maths

National Grid PLC (LSE:NG.) shares are down another 1.5% today and have now fallen over 16% in the two and a bit days since the rights issue announcement last week, if adjusting for the bonus element.

NG went 'ex rights' on Friday. So, of the original 3,722 million shares before the rights issue, every 24 shares owned has the right to buy seven new shares at a discounted price of 645p.

The rights have been consolidated up at 3.43 shares per right.and the rights trade separately, so there are now two routes to buying a single equity share in NG, as UBS explains.

NG.L share, which carried rights to the final dividend of 39.12p (which goes ex on 6 June); or a single NG right, which requires an additional 645p by 10 June to take up the rights, but is not entitled to the dividend.

""Apart from the dividend, there should only be a small difference between the two shares, owing to the option value to limit losses on the rights and the time value of money,"" UBS analyst Mark Freshney says, noting there is a 5p difference.

The key is the dividend cut and dividend preference theory, says the analyst.

""A number of high-yielding stocks have cut in the past four years and recovered (SSE, Orsted, Fortum, Centrica, REN), or else are grid-focused businesses with lower payout ratios (EON, SSE) as the shareholder base has refocused on SOTP/growth rather than yield.""

9.22am: Financial market fracture

Financial markets sentiment is ""fracturing"", reckons market analyst Susannah Streeter at Hargreaves Lansdown, pointing to ""AI exuberance"" powering mighty tech higher in one direction, and lingering worries about high interest rates keep investors cautious elsewhere.

""The FTSE 100 has opened on the back foot, as stubborn inflation remains in focus and the general election campaign continues to throw up economic and corporate uncertainty.""

She adds: ""Financial markets are increasingly running on two-speeds as alongside the AI frenzy, more broadly investors are becoming more wary about the impact of high borrowing costs on economies. The inflation snapshot in Australia has been unnerving, showing an acceleration to 3.6% year on year, rather than a decline.""

Ahead of the key US personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation reading on Friday, the Fed's preferred inflation barometer, could further fracture the mood or calm current jitters, Streeter adds.

On the Royal Mail deal, she noted that there is still some caution about whether the deal will go ahead, given that the government has the power under the National Security and Investment act to potentially block the deal.

""IDS comes with a lot of Royal Mail baggage, particularly the obligation to deliver letters six days a week as the UK's universal postal service, at a time when volumes are in sharp decline. But group's international arm GLS has long been considered the jewel in the company's crown, enjoying a level of success which Royal Mail has found elusive and EP Group will have been eyeing up the long-term opportunities here, particularly if inflation subsides further which should help margin growth.""

9am: European confidence

Some European economic data has been published this morning, with consumer confidence index in Germany climbing to -20.9 in June, from -24.0 in May, a touch above the consensus forecast of -22.5.

An equivalent measure in France was unchanged at 90 in May, slightly below the consensus estimate of 91.

8.57am: Green investor sees improved market sentiment, shares in the red tho

Shares in Impax Asset Management (AIM:IPX) are down 7% after the sustainability-focused fund manager reported interim results, which mostly seemed in line with expectations.

Operating profits came in at £25.8 million, a 5% decrease from last year but the dividend was held flat at 4.7p.

Assets under management at the end of March stood at £39.6 billion, a 6% increase over the half, with positive market movements and performance offsetting net outflows of £2.7 billion.

CEO Ian Simm says: ""Following nearly two years of relative headwinds, asset owner sentiment around the transition to a more sustainable economy and associated areas of Impax expertise has improved in recent months.

""We believe that companies providing innovative solutions that address environmental and social challenges remain compelling. Over the long run, we believe these companies can benefit from rising demand for their products and services and deliver strong earnings growth.""

8.33am: Bloomsbury buys and Fullers sells

Some deal news, first from Harry Potter and Sarah J Maas publisher Bloomsbury Publishing PLC, which has struck its largest deal to date.

It is acquiring US group Rowman & Littlefield's academic publishing business for £65 million, of which £60 million will be paid upfront in cash.

From reading to another favourite pastime, and pub chain Fuller Smith & Turner PLC (AIM:FSTA) has offloaded 37 tenanted pubs to Admiral Taverns for £18.3 million.

The sale represents a £1.6 million premium to the portfolio's gross asset value, Fuller's said.

8.19am: FTSE indexes falling lower

The Footsie is heading further into the red and has been joined by the FTSE 250, which had started higher.

London's mid-cap index is down 39 points at 20,666.

Mid-cap fallers include Mobico, as the National Express owner is among those likely to be demoted from the index in next week's quarterly reshuffle.

IWG, the former Regus, is down almost 6% after CEO Mark Dixon sold 35 million shares. The compaby said he is using the proceeds ""to unwind pledge and lending arrangements"" entered into by his investment vehicle Estorn Limited with Deutsche Bank Luxembourg.

Royal Mail owner IDS is one of the top risers as it received a firm offer from 'Czech Sphinx' Daniel Kretinsky, who belied his nickname by coming out with some assurances about how he will look after the company.

On the FTSE 100, the biggest fallers are Ocado, British Airways owner IAG, and electronics distributor RS Group.

8.08am: FTSE 100 opens lower again

As predicted, the FTSE 100 has moved lower in early trading, falling almost 10 points to 8,244.29 in the first few minutes.

Soon-to-be-demoted Ocado and St James's Place are among the fallers, Anglo American too.

7.55am: BHP wants to extend Anglo talks

Anglo American PLC (LSE:AAL) suitor BHP Group Ltd (LSE:BHP, ASX:BHP) has asked for another extension to its 'put up or shut up' takeover deadline as it offered new concessions, including a potential 'reverse break fee', and wants to continue talks.

Last week Anglo and BHP agreed on an extension to the deadline for BHP to make an offer to 29 May.

Since then, BHP says it has been working ""extensively"" to address key matters and has proposed a range of ""socioeconomic measures"" that it said are intended to address Anglo American's concerns about how the deal is structured... read more.

7.45am: The 'Czech Spinx' speaks!

The formal offer for the Royal Mail parent is worth around £3.57 billion (or £5.2 billion enterprise value if also including debt) and is unchanged from the mooted bid on 15 May.

It represents a 72.7% premium to the closing price on 16 April, when 'Czech Spinx' Křetínský first expressed interest in the group.

And today, going against his Spinx nickname, which was given to him in this country due to his enigmatic public persona and low-profile, Křetínský has added his name beside some quotes in the RNS statement.

These quotes are of the ""I'm an OK guy and will look after your company"" vein.

He says he knows Royal Mail forms ""part of the national infrastructure"" and is ""part of the fabric of UK society and has been for hundreds of years"".

He says owning the business ""will come with enormous responsibility - not just to the employees but to the citizens who rely on its services every day"".

He insists that the commitments EP is offering to the company and the government ""reflect how seriously we take this responsibility, to the benefit of IDS' employees, union representatives and all other stakeholders"".

""The EP Group is a patient, supportive investor with a long-term view and decades of experience in owning critical national infrastructure,"" he adds, but says its market is evolving quickly and it ""needs investments into modernisation to keep up with the competition"".

7.30am: Royal Mail owner recommends offer

The board of Royal Mail owner International Distributions Services PLC (LSE:IDS) has reached an agreement on the terms of a recommended cash offer from Czech billionaire Daniel Křetínský's EP Group after it made a formal offer of 370p per share.

As of yesterday, Křetínský's VESA investment vehicle owned a 27.6% stake in IDS.

IDS chair Keith Williams said: ""Both the IDS Board and EP are acutely aware of their responsibilities to IDS and particularly to the unique heritage of Royal Mail and its obligations as the designated Universal Service Provider of postal services in the UK.""

He said the board has ""negotiated a far-reaching package of legally binding undertakings and commitments"", including providing the current universal service obligation with first class letters still delivered six days a week, plus ""the financial stability and maintenance of the IDS Group including Royal Mail, the maintenance of employee benefits and pensions, and ensuring Royal Mail remains headquartered and tax resident in the UK"".

Williams said the board believes that the offer ""is fair and reasonable given that there are uncertainties ahead and allows investors to realise value at a significant premium"".

7.20am: What to watch today

Henry Allen of Deutsche Bank sums up the trading overview: ""markets struggled to gain much traction yesterday, with sovereign bonds selling off globally thanks to several hawkish headlines and weak demand at a Treasury auction"".

The initial catalyst for the selloff was the US consumer confidence indicator coming in positive for the first time since January.

""On the positive side, that helped to ease fears that the US economy might be starting to slow more meaningfully,"" says Allen, but ""it also led investors to dial back their expectations for future rate cuts"".

Reid says the hawkish trend was cemented by comments from Minneapolis Fed president Neel Kashkari, who said ""I don't think anybody has totally taken rate increases off the table"", and sounded relaxed about the Fed not needing to move too quickly to ease policy.

This was reflected in market pricing too, with the chance of a Fed rate cut by September falling from 58% on Monday to 50% by the close yesterday, and overnight it's declined further to just 46%, says Allen.

Looking at todays' macro data: inflation will remain in the spotlight with German CPI, ahead of the euro area print on Friday.

""These will be in particular focus, as this is the last inflation print ahead of the ECB's decision next week, at which they're widely expected to cut rates,"" says Allen.

""Overnight in Asia, risk appetite has remained weak as yields continue to move higher across the world. Moreover, that theme has continued overnight following a stronger-than-expected Australian CPI print, which rose to +3.6% in April (vs. +3.4% expected).""

Also today, a general election is taking place in South Africa, and in the US there's the Richmond Fed's manufacturing index for May, while central bank speakers include the Fed's Williams and Bostic, whilst the Fed will also release their Beige Book.

7.15am: FTSE 100 losing streak to continue

The FTSE 100's losing streak is on track to continue for a sixth session on Wednesday after a mixed close on Wall Street overnight and with Asian markets wallowing in red.

Spread-betters have called the London index down 35 points ahead of the open, having finished more than 63 points lower at 8,254.18 yesterday.

Last night, the Dow Jones fell 0.55% but the Nasdaq rose 0.59% to a new all-time high above 17,000, with the S&P 500 almost perfectly flat, with NVIDIA hitting a new all-time high but other tech mega-caps flattish.

All major Asian indices are in red this morning, with the Hang Seng down 1.9% and Nikkei 0.8% lower.

Also yesterday evening back in the UK, it was confirmed that Ocado Group PLC and St James's Place PLC will both drop out of the FTSE 100.

2.20pm: London IPO

Exciting news, we've had a new IPO in London today, on the Aquis Stock Exchange rather than the LSE.

Time to ACT PLC, an energy transition supply chain specialist, started trading this morning, brought to market by Novum Securities.

The Middlesbrough-based engineer was founded at GreenSpur, which provides electricity generator technology, in 2011 and then was renamed after the 2019 acquisition of Diffusion Alloys, a provider of metal coating services that is looking to specialise in low carbon-impact coatings for clean and renewable industries.

""It's also fair to say that there's nothing out there which is undeniably positive. The first quarter earnings season is pretty much done now, so there's a risk that the market has lost one significant leg of support.""

""In the absence of fresh corporate results, investors will have to take their lead from upcoming economic data and comments from Federal Reserve members. The latter will be in short supply now as Fed members go into purdah in the week before the next monetary policy meeting which finishes on 12th June.""

Fed rate expectations are around their lowest this year, edging closer to just one 25-basis-point cut for the whole of 2024.

12.49pm: Anti-greenwashing rule starts this week

The FCA's anti-greenwashing rule for investment funds is coming into effect this Friday, designed to protect consumers by ensuring that only products and services can only be described as green or sustainable if claims can be backed up.

UK-based fund managers can use four new investment labels from 31 July 2024.

The four new labels are 'Sustainability Impact' (for funds investing in activities to achieve a real-world impact), 'Sustainability Focus' (funds that invest mainly in assets considered to be sustainable for the environment/society now), 'Sustainability Improvers' (investments in activities that are on a path to improving their sustainability for the environment/society over time), or 'Sustainability Mixed Goals'.

Last month, the FCA confirmed the date that the new rule begins to have an effect on 31 May, with naming and marketing rules for UK-based fund managers coming into effect from the start of this December.

Research as part of the regulator's Financial Lives survey found 81% of adults surveyed would like their investments to do some good as well as provide a financial return.

Lucy Blake, partner and ESG legal expert at law firm Jenner & Block, warned that the FCA is ""prepared to act against firms posing consumer harm or serious misconduct, with potential penalties including fines and suspensions,"" with greenwashing also potentially leading to actions from other UK regulators such as the Competition & Markets Authority and the Advertising Standards Authority, civil claims from consumers and reputational damage.

12.38pm: Trade union numbers rising

As we hear about a new doctor's strike, the trade union movement saw membership grew by 90,000 last year, according to the latest ONS data.

This is being hailed by the TUC, where general secretary Paul Nowak says: ""We need to get more people into trade unions - especially younger workers.

""Being a member of a union gives you an independent voice at work and remains the best way to win better pay and conditions. Every day unions reach agreements with employers that protect and enhance members' jobs and livelihoods and keep workplaces safer.""

He says employers and the economy ""benefit from the productivity gains motivated and well-organised workforces bring"".

The ONS stats also reveal that the union wage premium in the private sector increased in 2023 due to faster growth of average hourly wages for union members.

Earlier today, the FT reported that the ONS itself has been hit by a staff exodus in recent years, with around a fifth of the workforce leaving the official statistics agency, more than twice the number who joined.

The departures were up significantly on pre-pandemic levels.

12.17pm: Market sentiment 'hit by rates concerns'

The FTSE is falling due to stronger-than-expected US data and hawkish Fed comments that have hurt risk sentiment across the markets, says Fiona Cincotta, market analyst at City Index.

She also notes that the IMF has upwardly revised China's growth forecast to 5% after a solid first quarter and recent supportive policy measures from Beijing.

This has boosted oil companies but not miners, she says.

""Meanwhile, the UK economic calendar is quiet. Attention will be on Fed speakers later today for further clarification on the likelihood of the Fed cutting rates,"" Cincotta says.

12pm: Investment trust buybacks

Share buybacks from investment trusts are set to reach a record high this year as the UK's listed funds continue to capitalise on the wide gaps between their market and underlying value.

Investment trusts and funds bought back a total of £2.2 billion worth of shares in the first four months of 2024, a 106% jump compared to the same period last year, data from Winterfloods has revealed.

Last year a record £3.6 billion worth of shares was bought back by the sector.

11.55am: Big oil deal and junior doctors

ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP, ETR:YCP) is in advanced talks to acquire Marathon Oil Corp in a $15 billion all-paper deal, according to the Financial Times.

The takeover could be announced soon, though there is still a chance it could fall apart or face a rival bid, the newspaper added.

Elsewhere, junior doctors are going on a five-day strike in the run-up to the general election.

The British Medical Association, the main doctors' union, said there had been a failure to reach an agreement with the government to secure a better pay offer.

Junior doctors will walk out from June 27 to July 2.

They are looking for a 35% pay rise as pay between 2008 and 2022 has fallen by 26% once rising costs are taken into account, with a 35% increase now needed to reverse that drop.

11.16am: European watchdog clamps down on insider information

The European financial markets watchdog has issued a warning to companies having chats with analysts before they issue results publicly.

Companies should not disclose inside information on these pre-close calls, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) said, warning that they carry ""inherent risks of inadvertent unlawful disclosure.""

These pre-close calls are common practice in Europe prior to the blackout period before results, and often the timing mysteriously coincides with spikes or drops in the shares.

Or as ESMA said, they ""can influence market expectations and instrument prices"", with financial media having reported on volatile trading days around the time companies engaged in pre-close calls.

10.33am: Anglo denies BHP more time

The Anglo American PLC (LSE:AAL) board thinks BHP has not addressed its concerns about the ""disproportionate execution risk"" associated with the proposed takeover structure and the value for shareholders and so has unanimously decided to reject a further extension to the takeover deadline.

This means BHP has to 'put up or shut up' by 5pm today.

Anglo reckons BHP's proposal ""includes the same highly complex and unattractive structure as the proposals previously rejected"" over a month ago, including carrying out two demergers of Anglo's publicly listed subsidiaries side by side, while also completing the takeover.

The ""inter-conditional nature of the three transactions is unprecedented"", it said.

Anglo says its own restructuring plan is ""simpler"", though it is very similar to the BHP double-demerger proposal.

10.22am: Why are markets down?

The FTSE 100 is trading at a three-week low, with the dsix-day losing streak on track to be the longest losing streak since August last year.

Analyst chatter points to the index ""teetering on the edge of a correction phase,"" reports Reuters. If the Footsie retreat to the 8,000 mark it would confirm this trend.

""It's just investor concerns. It's been pessimistic over the last few days. It's also a very data-light week,"" Christopher Peters, trading floor manager at Accendo Markets tells the newswire.

He says the ""chunky, solid information coming next week"" is enough to prompt investors into taking ""a bit of a pause"".

10.15am: 'ChatGPT, analyse these accounts for me'

Accounting giant PwC is rolling out ChatGPT to its 100,000 US and UK staff, the Wall Street Journal is reporting.

In doing so, the big four auditor is set to become OpenAI's largest ChatGPT Enterprise customer and the first reseller of the business-facing AI model.

ChatGPT Enterprise is a version of the chatbot aimed at large companies.

Industry media say that many accounting professionals are already combining their existing spreadsheet skills with new generation AI tools to to improve efficiency, or asking chatbots like ChatGPT to Smith to interrogate profit and loss statements, etc.

10am: Working and non-working households

The Office for National Statistics has published data on the economic status of households in the UK and the people living in them.

Almost 59% of relevant households had all members aged 16 years and over in employment during the period from January to March 2024.

There were an estimated 26.7% of households with a mix of at least one working and one workless adult.

An estimated 14.4% of households where no member of the household was in employment.

Meanwhile, the FTSE 100 is holding its position, down 0.24%.

Other European indices are further in the red, with Spain's IBEX down 0.25%, Germany's Dax down 0.4%. Italy's FTSE MIB down 0.5% and France's CAC down 0.6%.

The pound has risen to its highest against the euro in 21 months as investors become ever more confident that the European Central Bank will cut interest rates next week, with the Bank of England expected to wait until August, September or even November.

Sterling is up 0.2% versus the single currency to £0.849, its highest level since August 2022.

9.40am: National Grid goes ex-rights, UBS does the maths

National Grid PLC (LSE:NG.) shares are down another 1.5% today and have now fallen over 16% in the two and a bit days since the rights issue announcement last week, if adjusting for the bonus element.

NG went 'ex rights' on Friday. So, of the original 3,722 million shares before the rights issue, every 24 shares owned has the right to buy seven new shares at a discounted price of 645p.

The rights have been consolidated up at 3.43 shares per right.and the rights trade separately, so there are now two routes to buying a single equity share in NG, as UBS explains.

NG.L share, which carried rights to the final dividend of 39.12p (which goes ex on 6 June); or a single NG right, which requires an additional 645p by 10 June to take up the rights, but is not entitled to the dividend.

""Apart from the dividend, there should only be a small difference between the two shares, owing to the option value to limit losses on the rights and the time value of money,"" UBS analyst Mark Freshney says, noting there is a 5p difference.

The key is the dividend cut and dividend preference theory, says the analyst.

""A number of high-yielding stocks have cut in the past four years and recovered (SSE, Orsted, Fortum, Centrica, REN), or else are grid-focused businesses with lower payout ratios (EON, SSE) as the shareholder base has refocused on SOTP/growth rather than yield.""

9.22am: Financial market fracture

Financial markets sentiment is ""fracturing"", reckons market analyst Susannah Streeter at Hargreaves Lansdown, pointing to ""AI exuberance"" powering mighty tech higher in one direction, and lingering worries about high interest rates keep investors cautious elsewhere.

""The FTSE 100 has opened on the back foot, as stubborn inflation remains in focus and the general election campaign continues to throw up economic and corporate uncertainty.""

She adds: ""Financial markets are increasingly running on two-speeds as alongside the AI frenzy, more broadly investors are becoming more wary about the impact of high borrowing costs on economies. The inflation snapshot in Australia has been unnerving, showing an acceleration to 3.6% year on year, rather than a decline.""

Ahead of the key US personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation reading on Friday, the Fed's preferred inflation barometer, could further fracture the mood or calm current jitters, Streeter adds.

On the Royal Mail deal, she noted that there is still some caution about whether the deal will go ahead, given that the government has the power under the National Security and Investment act to potentially block the deal.

""IDS comes with a lot of Royal Mail baggage, particularly the obligation to deliver letters six days a week as the UK's universal postal service, at a time when volumes are in sharp decline. But group's international arm GLS has long been considered the jewel in the company's crown, enjoying a level of success which Royal Mail has found elusive and EP Group will have been eyeing up the long-term opportunities here, particularly if inflation subsides further which should help margin growth.""

9am: European confidence

Some European economic data has been published this morning, with consumer confidence index in Germany climbing to -20.9 in June, from -24.0 in May, a touch above the consensus forecast of -22.5.

An equivalent measure in France was unchanged at 90 in May, slightly below the consensus estimate of 91.

8.57am: Green investor sees improved market sentiment, shares in the red tho

Shares in Impax Asset Management (AIM:IPX) are down 7% after the sustainability-focused fund manager reported interim results, which mostly seemed in line with expectations.

Operating profits came in at £25.8 million, a 5% decrease from last year but the dividend was held flat at 4.7p.

Assets under management at the end of March stood at £39.6 billion, a 6% increase over the half, with positive market movements and performance offsetting net outflows of £2.7 billion.

CEO Ian Simm says: ""Following nearly two years of relative headwinds, asset owner sentiment around the transition to a more sustainable economy and associated areas of Impax expertise has improved in recent months.

""We believe that companies providing innovative solutions that address environmental and social challenges remain compelling. Over the long run, we believe these companies can benefit from rising demand for their products and services and deliver strong earnings growth.""

8.33am: Bloomsbury buys and Fullers sells

Some deal news, first from Harry Potter and Sarah J Maas publisher Bloomsbury Publishing PLC, which has struck its largest deal to date.

It is acquiring US group Rowman & Littlefield's academic publishing business for £65 million, of which £60 million will be paid upfront in cash.

From reading to another favourite pastime, and pub chain Fuller Smith & Turner PLC (AIM:FSTA) has offloaded 37 tenanted pubs to Admiral Taverns for £18.3 million.

The sale represents a £1.6 million premium to the portfolio's gross asset value, Fuller's said.

8.19am: FTSE indexes falling lower

The Footsie is heading further into the red and has been joined by the FTSE 250, which had started higher.

London's mid-cap index is down 39 points at 20,666.

Mid-cap fallers include Mobico, as the National Express owner is among those likely to be demoted from the index in next week's quarterly reshuffle.

IWG, the former Regus, is down almost 6% after CEO Mark Dixon sold 35 million shares. The compaby said he is using the proceeds ""to unwind pledge and lending arrangements"" entered into by his investment vehicle Estorn Limited with Deutsche Bank Luxembourg.

Royal Mail owner IDS is one of the top risers as it received a firm offer from 'Czech Sphinx' Daniel Kretinsky, who belied his nickname by coming out with some assurances about how he will look after the company.

On the FTSE 100, the biggest fallers are Ocado, British Airways owner IAG, and electronics distributor RS Group.

8.08am: FTSE 100 opens lower again

As predicted, the FTSE 100 has moved lower in early trading, falling almost 10 points to 8,244.29 in the first few minutes.

Soon-to-be-demoted Ocado and St James's Place are among the fallers, Anglo American too.

7.55am: BHP wants to extend Anglo talks

Anglo American PLC (LSE:AAL) suitor BHP Group Ltd (LSE:BHP, ASX:BHP) has asked for another extension to its 'put up or shut up' takeover deadline as it offered new concessions, including a potential 'reverse break fee', and wants to continue talks.

Last week Anglo and BHP agreed on an extension to the deadline for BHP to make an offer to 29 May.

Since then, BHP says it has been working ""extensively"" to address key matters and has proposed a range of ""socioeconomic measures"" that it said are intended to address Anglo American's concerns about how the deal is structured... read more.

7.45am: The 'Czech Spinx' speaks!

The formal offer for the Royal Mail parent is worth around £3.57 billion (or £5.2 billion enterprise value if also including debt) and is unchanged from the mooted bid on 15 May.

It represents a 72.7% premium to the closing price on 16 April, when 'Czech Spinx' Křetínský first expressed interest in the group.

And today, going against his Spinx nickname, which was given to him in this country due to his enigmatic public persona and low-profile, Křetínský has added his name beside some quotes in the RNS statement.

These quotes are of the ""I'm an OK guy and will look after your company"" vein.

He says he knows Royal Mail forms ""part of the national infrastructure"" and is ""part of the fabric of UK society and has been for hundreds of years"".

He says owning the business ""will come with enormous responsibility - not just to the employees but to the citizens who rely on its services every day"".

He insists that the commitments EP is offering to the company and the government ""reflect how seriously we take this responsibility, to the benefit of IDS' employees, union representatives and all other stakeholders"".

""The EP Group is a patient, supportive investor with a long-term view and decades of experience in owning critical national infrastructure,"" he adds, but says its market is evolving quickly and it ""needs investments into modernisation to keep up with the competition"".

7.30am: Royal Mail owner recommends offer

The board of Royal Mail owner International Distributions Services PLC (LSE:IDS) has reached an agreement on the terms of a recommended cash offer from Czech billionaire Daniel Křetínský's EP Group after it made a formal offer of 370p per share.

As of yesterday, Křetínský's VESA investment vehicle owned a 27.6% stake in IDS.

IDS chair Keith Williams said: ""Both the IDS Board and EP are acutely aware of their responsibilities to IDS and particularly to the unique heritage of Royal Mail and its obligations as the designated Universal Service Provider of postal services in the UK.""

He said the board has ""negotiated a far-reaching package of legally binding undertakings and commitments"", including providing the current universal service obligation with first class letters still delivered six days a week, plus ""the financial stability and maintenance of the IDS Group including Royal Mail, the maintenance of employee benefits and pensions, and ensuring Royal Mail remains headquartered and tax resident in the UK"".

Williams said the board believes that the offer ""is fair and reasonable given that there are uncertainties ahead and allows investors to realise value at a significant premium"".

7.20am: What to watch today

Henry Allen of Deutsche Bank sums up the trading overview: ""markets struggled to gain much traction yesterday, with sovereign bonds selling off globally thanks to several hawkish headlines and weak demand at a Treasury auction"".

The initial catalyst for the selloff was the US consumer confidence indicator coming in positive for the first time since January.

""On the positive side, that helped to ease fears that the US economy might be starting to slow more meaningfully,"" says Allen, but ""it also led investors to dial back their expectations for future rate cuts"".

Reid says the hawkish trend was cemented by comments from Minneapolis Fed president Neel Kashkari, who said ""I don't think anybody has totally taken rate increases off the table"", and sounded relaxed about the Fed not needing to move too quickly to ease policy.

This was reflected in market pricing too, with the chance of a Fed rate cut by September falling from 58% on Monday to 50% by the close yesterday, and overnight it's declined further to just 46%, says Allen.

Looking at todays' macro data: inflation will remain in the spotlight with German CPI, ahead of the euro area print on Friday.

""These will be in particular focus, as this is the last inflation print ahead of the ECB's decision next week, at which they're widely expected to cut rates,"" says Allen.

""Overnight in Asia, risk appetite has remained weak as yields continue to move higher across the world. Moreover, that theme has continued overnight following a stronger-than-expected Australian CPI print, which rose to +3.6% in April (vs. +3.4% expected).""

Also today, a general election is taking place in South Africa, and in the US there's the Richmond Fed's manufacturing index for May, while central bank speakers include the Fed's Williams and Bostic, whilst the Fed will also release their Beige Book.

7.15am: FTSE 100 losing streak to continue

The FTSE 100's losing streak is on track to continue for a sixth session on Wednesday after a mixed close on Wall Street overnight and with Asian markets wallowing in red.

NG.L share, which carried rights to the final dividend of 39.12p (which goes ex on 6 June); or a single NG right, which requires an additional 645p by 10 June to take up the rights, but is not entitled to the dividend.

""Apart from the dividend, there should only be a small difference between the two shares, owing to the option value to limit losses on the rights and the time value of money,"" UBS analyst Mark Freshney says, noting there is a 5p difference.

The key is the dividend cut and dividend preference theory, says the analyst.

""A number of high-yielding stocks have cut in the past four years and recovered (SSE, Orsted, Fortum, Centrica, REN), or else are grid-focused businesses with lower payout ratios (EON, SSE) as the shareholder base has refocused on SOTP/growth rather than yield.""

9.22am: Financial market fracture

Financial markets sentiment is ""fracturing"", reckons market analyst Susannah Streeter at Hargreaves Lansdown, pointing to ""AI exuberance"" powering mighty tech higher in one direction, and lingering worries about high interest rates keep investors cautious elsewhere.

""The FTSE 100 has opened on the back foot, as stubborn inflation remains in focus and the general election campaign continues to throw up economic and corporate uncertainty.""

She adds: ""Financial markets are increasingly running on two-speeds as alongside the AI frenzy, more broadly investors are becoming more wary about the impact of high borrowing costs on economies. The inflation snapshot in Australia has been unnerving, showing an acceleration to 3.6% year on year, rather than a decline.""

Ahead of the key US personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation reading on Friday, the Fed's preferred inflation barometer, could further fracture the mood or calm current jitters, Streeter adds.

On the Royal Mail deal, she noted that there is still some caution about whether the deal will go ahead, given that the government has the power under the National Security and Investment act to potentially block the deal.

""IDS comes with a lot of Royal Mail baggage, particularly the obligation to deliver letters six days a week as the UK's universal postal service, at a time when volumes are in sharp decline. But group's international arm GLS has long been considered the jewel in the company's crown, enjoying a level of success which Royal Mail has found elusive and EP Group will have been eyeing up the long-term opportunities here, particularly if inflation subsides further which should help margin growth.""

9am: European confidence

Some European economic data has been published this morning, with consumer confidence index in Germany climbing to -20.9 in June, from -24.0 in May, a touch above the consensus forecast of -22.5.

8.57am: Green investor sees improved market sentiment, shares in the red tho

Shares in Impax Asset Management (AIM:IPX) are down 7% after the sustainability-focused fund manager reported interim results, which mostly seemed in line with expectations.

Operating profits came in at £25.8 million, a 5% decrease from last year but the dividend was held flat at 4.7p.

Assets under management at the end of March stood at £39.6 billion, a 6% increase over the half, with positive market movements and performance offsetting net outflows of £2.7 billion.

CEO Ian Simm says: ""Following nearly two years of relative headwinds, asset owner sentiment around the transition to a more sustainable economy and associated areas of Impax expertise has improved in recent months.

""We believe that companies providing innovative solutions that address environmental and social challenges remain compelling. Over the long run, we believe these companies can benefit from rising demand for their products and services and deliver strong earnings growth.""

8.33am: Bloomsbury buys and Fullers sells

Some deal news, first from Harry Potter and Sarah J Maas publisher Bloomsbury Publishing PLC, which has struck its largest deal to date.

It is acquiring US group Rowman & Littlefield's academic publishing business for £65 million, of which £60 million will be paid upfront in cash.

From reading to another favourite pastime, and pub chain Fuller Smith & Turner PLC (AIM:FSTA) has offloaded 37 tenanted pubs to Admiral Taverns for £18.3 million.

The sale represents a £1.6 million premium to the portfolio's gross asset value, Fuller's said.

8.19am: FTSE indexes falling lower

The Footsie is heading further into the red and has been joined by the FTSE 250, which had started higher.

London's mid-cap index is down 39 points at 20,666.

Mid-cap fallers include Mobico, as the National Express owner is among those likely to be demoted from the index in next week's quarterly reshuffle.

IWG, the former Regus, is down almost 6% after CEO Mark Dixon sold 35 million shares. The compaby said he is using the proceeds ""to unwind pledge and lending arrangements"" entered into by his investment vehicle Estorn Limited with Deutsche Bank Luxembourg.

Royal Mail owner IDS is one of the top risers as it received a firm offer from 'Czech Sphinx' Daniel Kretinsky, who belied his nickname by coming out with some assurances about how he will look after the company.

On the FTSE 100, the biggest fallers are Ocado, British Airways owner IAG, and electronics distributor RS Group.

8.08am: FTSE 100 opens lower again

As predicted, the FTSE 100 has moved lower in early trading, falling almost 10 points to 8,244.29 in the first few minutes.

Soon-to-be-demoted Ocado and St James's Place are among the fallers, Anglo American too.

7.55am: BHP wants to extend Anglo talks

Anglo American PLC (LSE:AAL) suitor BHP Group Ltd (LSE:BHP, ASX:BHP) has asked for another extension to its 'put up or shut up' takeover deadline as it offered new concessions, including a potential 'reverse break fee', and wants to continue talks.

Last week Anglo and BHP agreed on an extension to the deadline for BHP to make an offer to 29 May.

Since then, BHP says it has been working ""extensively"" to address key matters and has proposed a range of ""socioeconomic measures"" that it said are intended to address Anglo American's concerns about how the deal is structured... read more.

7.45am: The 'Czech Spinx' speaks!

The formal offer for the Royal Mail parent is worth around £3.57 billion (or £5.2 billion enterprise value if also including debt) and is unchanged from the mooted bid on 15 May.

It represents a 72.7% premium to the closing price on 16 April, when 'Czech Spinx' Křetínský first expressed interest in the group.

And today, going against his Spinx nickname, which was given to him in this country due to his enigmatic public persona and low-profile, Křetínský has added his name beside some quotes in the RNS statement.

These quotes are of the ""I'm an OK guy and will look after your company"" vein.

He says he knows Royal Mail forms ""part of the national infrastructure"" and is ""part of the fabric of UK society and has been for hundreds of years"".

He says owning the business ""will come with enormous responsibility - not just to the employees but to the citizens who rely on its services every day"".

He insists that the commitments EP is offering to the company and the government ""reflect how seriously we take this responsibility, to the benefit of IDS' employees, union representatives and all other stakeholders"".

""The EP Group is a patient, supportive investor with a long-term view and decades of experience in owning critical national infrastructure,"" he adds, but says its market is evolving quickly and it ""needs investments into modernisation to keep up with the competition"".

7.30am: Royal Mail owner recommends offer

The board of Royal Mail owner International Distributions Services PLC (LSE:IDS) has reached an agreement on the terms of a recommended cash offer from Czech billionaire Daniel Křetínský's EP Group after it made a formal offer of 370p per share.

As of yesterday, Křetínský's VESA investment vehicle owned a 27.6% stake in IDS.

IDS chair Keith Williams said: ""Both the IDS Board and EP are acutely aware of their responsibilities to IDS and particularly to the unique heritage of Royal Mail and its obligations as the designated Universal Service Provider of postal services in the UK.""

He said the board has ""negotiated a far-reaching package of legally binding undertakings and commitments"", including providing the current universal service obligation with first class letters still delivered six days a week, plus ""the financial stability and maintenance of the IDS Group including Royal Mail, the maintenance of employee benefits and pensions, and ensuring Royal Mail remains headquartered and tax resident in the UK"".

Williams said the board believes that the offer ""is fair and reasonable given that there are uncertainties ahead and allows investors to realise value at a significant premium"".

7.20am: What to watch today

Henry Allen of Deutsche Bank sums up the trading overview: ""markets struggled to gain much traction yesterday, with sovereign bonds selling off globally thanks to several hawkish headlines and weak demand at a Treasury auction"".

The initial catalyst for the selloff was the US consumer confidence indicator coming in positive for the first time since January.

""On the positive side, that helped to ease fears that the US economy might be starting to slow more meaningfully,"" says Allen, but ""it also led investors to dial back their expectations for future rate cuts"".

Reid says the hawkish trend was cemented by comments from Minneapolis Fed president Neel Kashkari, who said ""I don't think anybody has totally taken rate increases off the table"", and sounded relaxed about the Fed not needing to move too quickly to ease policy.

This was reflected in market pricing too, with the chance of a Fed rate cut by September falling from 58% on Monday to 50% by the close yesterday, and overnight it's declined further to just 46%, says Allen.

Looking at todays' macro data: inflation will remain in the spotlight with German CPI, ahead of the euro area print on Friday.

""These will be in particular focus, as this is the last inflation print ahead of the ECB's decision next week, at which they're widely expected to cut rates,"" says Allen.

""Overnight in Asia, risk appetite has remained weak as yields continue to move higher across the world. Moreover, that theme has continued overnight following a stronger-than-expected Australian CPI print, which rose to +3.6% in April (vs. +3.4% expected).""

Also today, a general election is taking place in South Africa, and in the US there's the Richmond Fed's manufacturing index for May, while central bank speakers include the Fed's Williams and Bostic, whilst the Fed will also release their Beige Book.

7.15am: FTSE 100 losing streak to continue

The FTSE 100's losing streak is on track to continue for a sixth session on Wednesday after a mixed close on Wall Street overnight and with Asian markets wallowing in red.

Spread-betters have called the London index down 35 points ahead of the open, having finished more than 63 points lower at 8,254.18 yesterday.

Last night, the Dow Jones fell 0.55% but the Nasdaq rose 0.59% to a new all-time high above 17,000, with the S&P 500 almost perfectly flat, with NVIDIA hitting a new all-time high but other tech mega-caps flattish.

All major Asian indices are in red this morning, with the Hang Seng down 1.9% and Nikkei 0.8% lower.

The Anglo American PLC (LSE:AAL) board thinks BHP has not assaged its concerns about the ""disproportionate execution risk"" associated with the proposed takeover structure and the value for shareholders and so has unanimously decided to reject a further extension to the takeover deadline.

This means BHP has to 'put up or shut up' by 5pm today.

Anglo reckons BHP's proposal ""includes the same highly complex and unattractive structure as the proposals previously rejected"" over a month ago, including carrying out two demergers of Anglo's publicly listed subsidiaries side by side, while also completing the takeover.

The ""inter-conditional nature of the three transactions is unprecedented"", it said, with regulatory approvals in various juridisactions ""likely to result in material conditions being imposed that would disproportionately impact the value of Anglo American Platinum and Kumba and, therefore, the value delivered to Anglo American's shareholders"".

Anglo says its own restructuring plan is ""simpler"", though it is very similar to the BHP double-demerger proposal.

10.22am: Why are markets down?

The FTSE 100 is trading at a three-week low, with the dsix-day losing streak on track to be the longest losing streak since August last year.

Analyst chatter points to the index ""teetering on the edge of a correction phase,"" reports Reuters. If the Footsie retreat to the 8,000 mark it would confirm this trend.

""It's just investor concerns. It's been pessimistic over the last few days. It's also a very data-light week,"" Christopher Peters, trading floor manager at Accendo Markets tells the newswire.

He says the ""chunky, solid information coming next week"" is enough to prompt investors into taking ""a bit of a pause"".

10.15am: 'ChatGPT analyse these accounts for me'

Accounting giant PwC is rolling out ChatGPT to its 100,000 US and UK staff, the Wall Street Journal is reporting.

In doing so, the big four auditor is set to become OpenAI's largest ChatGPT Enterprise customer and the first reseller of the business-facing AI model.

ChatGPT Enterprise is a version of the chatbot aimed at large companies.

Industry media say that many accounting professionals are already combining their existing spreadsheet skills with new generation AI tools to to improve efficiency, or asking chatbots like ChatGPT to Smith to interrogate profit and loss statements, etc.

10am: Working and non-working households

The Office for National Statistics has published data on the economic status of households in the UK and the people living in them.

Almost 59% of relevant households had all members aged 16 years and over in employment during the period from January to March 2024.

There were an estimated 26.7% of households with a mix of at least one working and one workless adult.

An estimated 14.4% of households where no member of the household was in employment.

Meanwhile the FTSE 100 is holding its position, down 0.24%.

Other European indices are further in the red, with Spain's IBEX down 0.25%, Germany's Dax down 0.4%. Italy's FTSE MIB down 0.5% and France's CAC down 0.6%.

National Grid PLC (LSE:NG.) shares are down another 1.5% today and have now fallen over 16% in the two and a bit days since the rights issue announcement last week, if adjusting for the bonus element.

NG went 'ex rights' on Friday. So, of the original 3,722 million shares before the rights issue, every 24 shares owned has the right to buy seven new shares at a discounted price of 645p.

If the polls are correct and recent council elections are anything to go by, the election could deliver a landslide victory to the Labour Party, currently the main opposition against Sunak's Conservative Party.

How Does The UK Election System Work?

Unlike the college votes system in the U.S., the UK operates a more simple version of the first-past-the-post system.

The UK is politically divided into 650 constituencies, each represented by a member of parliament (MP) in Westminster, London.

On polling day, each person casts a single vote for one candidate on the ballot card. The candidate with the most votes wins that constituency. The political party that wins the most constituencies becomes the new ruling party, and its leader is sworn in by the King as prime minister.

Why Has An Election Been Called Now?

It's a constitutional obligation to hold a general election in the U.K. every five years. Sunak could have waited until December to call the election for January 2025, but - in a surprise announcement on May 22 - he set the date for July 4.

Why didn't he wait? He likely considered the benefits of hanging around were too few. The Conservatives have held power since David Cameron led the party to victory in the 2010 general election. Things were looking pretty stable for a while - there was cohesion in the party, the economy was on the up and the Conservative - and Cameron's - mandate was renewed at the 2015 election.

However, a string of devisive events, including the Brexit referendum in 2016, the Conservative party's difficulties in adopting Brexit-related policies and new trade terms, and the mishandling of the COVID-19 crisis, have resulted in the resignation of four prime ministers over the past six years.

And Sunak's own position has been built on a less-than-stable foundation since he took the helm following Liz Truss' record short tenure as PM. The Conservative Party leadership has lost the trust of many of its MPs, with several now declaring they will not contest their seats on July 4.

He's now throwing the dice, gambling that the Labour Party and its leader Keir Starmer are unprepared for a snap election.

What Happens In The Coming Weeks?

As the Electoral Commission springs into action to get polling cards sent to all registered voters and prepare voting locations and official vote counters, the political parties are putting the final details to their election manifestos.

In recent days Sunak's team has unveiled its list of priority policies, including bringing back national service, reducing public health waiting lists and reduced taxation and spending - all aimed at its key 60+ demographic.

Starmer has hit the campaign trail with pledges to reform the health service, grow the economy and tighten up on border security. On taxation, Labour plans to crack down on tax-avoiders, but plans no rises in corporation or personal taxes.

Among the main differentiating factors is environmental policy. The Conservative Party has, over the past several months, backtracked on some of its environmental commitments.

Labour, however, remains committed to its green pledges, including clean power by 2030, the establishment of a new publicly-owned energy company and to increase windfall taxes on oil and gas producers.

Shares in National Grid Plc (NYSE:NGG), the UK energy distribution giant, have fallen 15% in two days after announcing a £7 billion ($8.94 billion) rights issue to help fund its green investment up to March 2029.

Meanwhile, fears that Labour could wholly or partially re-nationalize swathes of the utilities sector following its announcement of plans to create a new publicly-owned energy company sent shivers through water and energy stocks.

""Overall, we see most risk at the water companies, where we expect most rhetoric and a key political battle ground ahead of next election,"" said Citi analysts in a note last week.

Water companies United Utilities (OTC:UUGRY) and Severn Trent (OTC:STRNY) were down 7.9% and 7% respectively last week.

Since the May 22 announcement, the FTSE 100 index is down nearly 1%.

Among the U.S. stocks exposed to UK risk is Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA), whose shares have fallen 13% over the past week.

Boots is one of the biggest high street retailers in the UK and, although no specific policies have been announced that might affect the stock, investors appear cautious.

Since the announcement, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Gilt has risen 127 basis points, pushing prices lower, over concerns of increased government borrowing under a potential new Labour government.

UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has called a general election to be held on July 4. If the polls are correct and recent council elections are anything to go by, the election could deliver a landslide victory to the Labour Party, currently the main opposition against Sunak's Conservative Party.

How Does The UK Election System Work?

Unlike the college votes system in the U.S., the UK operates a more simple version of the first-past-the-post system.

The UK is politically divided into 650 constituencies, each represented by a member of parliament (MP) in Westminster, London.

On polling day, each person casts a single vote for one candidate on the ballot card. The candidate with the most votes wins that constituency. The political party that wins the most constituencies becomes the new ruling party, and its leader is sworn in by the King as prime minister.

Why Has An Election Been Called Now?

It's a constitutional obligation to hold a general election in the U.K. every five years. Sunak could have waited until December to call the election for January 2025, but - in a surprise announcement on May 22 - he set the date for July 4.

Why didn't he wait? He likely considered the benefits of hanging around were too few. The Conservatives have held power since David Cameron led the party to victory in the 2010 general election. Things were looking pretty stable for a while - there was cohesion in the party, the economy was on the up and the Conservative - and Cameron's - mandate was renewed at the 2015 election.

However, a string of devisive events, including the Brexit referendum in 2016, the Conservative party's difficulties in adopting Brexit-related policies and new trade terms, and the mishandling of the COVID-19 crisis, have resulted in the resignation of four prime ministers over the past six years.

And Sunak's own position has been built on a less-than-stable foundation since he took the helm following Liz Truss' record short tenure as PM. The Conservative Party leadership has lost the trust of many of its MPs, with several now declaring they will not contest their seats on July 4.

He's now throwing the dice, gambling that the Labour Party and its leader Keir Starmer are unprepared for a snap election.

What Happens In The Coming Weeks?

As the Electoral Commission springs into action to get polling cards sent to all registered voters and prepare voting locations and official vote counters, the political parties are putting the final details to their election manifestos.

In recent days Sunak's team has unveiled its list of priority policies, including bringing back national service, reducing public health waiting lists and reduced taxation and spending - all aimed at its key 60+ demographic.

Starmer has hit the campaign trail with pledges to reform the health service, grow the economy and tighten up on border security. On taxation, Labour plans to crack down on tax-avoiders, but plans no rises in corporation or personal taxes.

Among the main differentiating factors is environmental policy. The Conservative Party has, over the past several months, backtracked on some of its environmental commitments.

Labour, however, remains committed to its green pledges, including clean power by 2030, the establishment of a new publicly-owned energy company and to increase windfall taxes on oil and gas producers.

3.46pm: Footsie keeps dropping

Heading towards the close in London and the FTSE 100 is falling ever lower, down 0.9%.

Many of the top 15 are down more than 1%, with some like AstraZeneca, RELX, Diageo and Compass down at least 2%.

The mid-caps of the FTSE 250 index are now down as much, down 0.34% to 20,701.

3.42pm: Couple of crypto things

First is our daily crypto report, which has a bit more of the reasoning why bitcoin (BTC) and ethereum are moving this week.

BTC briefly tipped across the $70,000 price point yesterday following a week of mediocre performance for the world's largest cryptocurrency, today has seen a rather sharp reversal with the BTC/USD pair dropping 1.7% to trade at $68,193 at the time of writing.

Analysts have pointed to a large-scale bitcoin transfer, estimated at $7 billion, from wallets owned by Mt Gox, the cryptocurrency exchange that collapsed a decade ago.

Elsewhere, Riot Platforms, one of the most highly valued bitcoin miners globally, has gone public and hostile with a $2.30 per share offer for smaller rival Bitfarms (TSX-V:BITF).

According to Riot's press statement, the Bitfarms (TSX-V:BITF) board rejected the April offer ""without engaging in substantive dialogue with Riot"" and has some charged language, highlighting allegations etc... read more on the Riot-Bitfarms battle here.

3.20pm: Bookmakers lead fallers

Flutter Entertainment PLC (LSE:FLTR), Draftkings Inc (NASDAQ:DKNG) and Entain PLC (LSE:ENT) fell after a bill passed in Illinois to impose a new tax on sports betting revenue.

Senators approved the progressive tax, which starts at 20% for adjusted gross receipts of up to $30 million and caps out at 40% for AGR above $200 million, as part of the state's 2025 budget.

Flutter, which is in the process of dropping its London primary listing, and therefore also its FTSE 100 status, is leading the fallers today, down 6.3%, while Ladbrokes, which is a 50% owner of BetMGM, is down 2.5%.

US-listed DraftKings plunged 10.4%, with trade websites calculating it would have to pay a 20% tax on its $7 million retail AGR and 40% on its digital AGR, which was $350 million.

3.12pm: US confidence improves

US consumer confidence data has been printed for May, coming in higher than expected.

The confidence index rose to 102.0 from a revised 97.5 the month before, better than the 96.0 consensus estimate.

Confidence about the present situation rose to 143.1 from 140.6, while expectations improved to 74.6 from 68.8.

Wall Street indices fell in advance of the release but are rising again after.

2.55pm: US stocks open mixed

Wall Street stocks have mostly opened higher, though the Dow Jones is down 0.25% as health stocks weigh.

The Nasdaq Composite is up 0.2%, led by a near-5% Nvidia rise for Nvidia, while the S&P 500 is flat, having traded higher initially.

Apple, Alphabet and ASML are in the green, but they are the only ones in the Nasdaq's top 15.

1.31pm: Election influence for markets?

Last week's general election news is not likely to impact monetary policy but investor confidence could be influenced by changes in opinion polls, says UBS.

Markets have been pretty indifferent to the PM's rain-sodden announcement, but this is not expected continue up to polling day.

""There are certainly a few things that could get investors excited,"" says UBS economist Dean Turner. ""The first of these will be the opinion polls.

""History tells us that opinions can, and often do, change quite quickly during an election campaign,"" he says, noting Theresa May's 2017 campaign when a 15% lead for the Conservatives all but evaporated by election day.

""If Labour's lead in opinion polls, hovering around 20%, starts to erode, investors may start to question their current confidence in the result.""

The other interesting development to watch is when the party manifestos are published, though we have a fair idea already, on economic matters.

There will not be much to separate the two main parties, the UBS economist says, with both likely to commit to sticking to the existing fiscal rules, which leaves neither of them with much room for manoeuvre and little impact on a macro perspective, he says, though there is always the potential for surprise.

""So, we should expect a lot of headlines and a few surprises over the next few weeks, but when it comes to investing in the UK markets, we still think investors should stick to fundamentals,"" Turner says, with the UK market rated as 'most preferred' for UBS.

""We... stick with this view as FTSE 100 companies, which generate a significant portion of their revenues internationally, should be largely sheltered from domestic political events.

""For bonds, rate cuts from the Bank of England should lead to falling yields, which is positive for bond prices.""

1.22pm: Pension promise

More electioneering, this time a new higher 'triple lock' for pensions.

Prime Minister Rishi Sunak promised today that pensioners will never pay tax on their state pension under his government if it wins the next election.

Building on the ""triple lock"" introduced by David Cameron, Sunak said if he is returned to power he will also make sure the personal allowance for pensioners would increase by at least 2.5% or in line with the higher of earnings or inflation.

Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves, who earlier revealed that more than a hundred leaders of large and small businesses have declared their support of the party's economic plans, called the scheme a ""desperate gimmick"".

1.05pm: Europe in the red, US hard to read

Like the FTSE 100, the major European indices are all in the red too, having mostly started higher. Germany's Dax is just below the flatline, while France's CAC is the worst position, down 0.6%.

Looking across the Atlantic, US markets are heading for a mixed start as they reopen after the Memorial Day holiday.

Tech stocks seem to be expected to drive the rise, with Nasdaq 100 futures pointing to a 0.2% gain, with S&P 500 futures up 0.1%, while Dow Jones futures are down 0.1%.

In the energy markets, WTI crude prices have steadied after rebounding sharply yesterday from more than three-month lows ahead of the online OPEC+ meeting next weekend.

In US data, consumer confidence numbers are due today, the Federal Reserve's Beige Book tomorrow, followed by the second reading of GDP and the trade balance on Thursday with the Chicago PMI alongside the PCE inflation reading that is seen as a key reading for the Fed as policymakers' preferred inflation measure.

""All roads this week point towards the April US core PCE print on Friday,"" says Deutsche Bank's Jim Reid. ""You don't need me to tell you how well scrutinised this data will be and how important it is to the Fed.""

Versus the previous month, PCE inflation is expected to edge down from 0.32% to 0.26%.

Trading volumes have been light for stock index futures markets, says market analyst David Morrison at Trade Nation.

""Stock indices are a touch firmer this morning, but it's difficult to gauge investor sentiment. We'll probably need to wait until volumes pick up later this afternoon.""

12.44pm: EU hydrogen funding

The European Commission has approved €1.4 billion of hydrogen funding for 13 projects and 11 companies, including Airbus, BMW and Michelin.

The Hy2Move programmes aim to develop technologies and processes ""that go beyond current technology and will allow major improvements notably in the areas of mobility and transport applications, fuel cells, on-board hydrogen storage and generation of hydrogen for the use in mobility and transport"".

It is designed to help the EU reach its target of reducing transport emissions by 90%.

The hydrogen funding is also accompanied by a separate €1 billion healthcare project to help the discovery of drugs to treat rare diseases and cancers, which the EU estimates will unlock an extra €5.9 billion in private funding.

12.25pm: Retail sector remains cautious

We have the second retail sector update of the day, this time from CBI.

Like the BRC survey said earlier, selling price inflation in the retail sector eased considerably in May, the CBI report says, adding that retail sales grew at their fastest pace since December 2022 in the year to May.

The CBI distributive trades survey found that retailers expect sales to fall slightly next month, but to remain broadly in line with seasonal norms.

Conditions elsewhere in the sector also appear to be more mixed, with headcount continuing to fall and investment plans weakening further.

""May's increase in retail sales adds to the swathe of data pointing to an improvement in activity over the near-term,"" said Alpesh Paleja, CBI lead economist.

""Falling inflation, and continuing real wage growth will contribute to a healthier consumer outlook, in turn supporting the retail sector further.

""That being said, retailers are restrained about their business situation over the coming quarter. Headlines sales are expected to fall moderately next month, and it's concerning that retailers' investment intentions have deteriorated noticeably.""

12.03pm: Meme update

Shares in GameStop Corp (NYSE:GME) are up 23% in premarket after the retailer raised new funds.

The king of meme stocks said it had raised over $900 million from selling shares during the rally earlier this month.

11.49am: City broker's overseas offices closing

The value of City broker Numis has been halved since being bought by Deutsche Bank, according to a Telegraph report.

Having bought the UK company for £410 million in April 2023, since renaming it Deutsche Numis, the German bank wrote down the value of the subsidiary by €233 million (£200 million).

Deutsche is closing the UK and European offices of Numis and merging them into its own buildings, with UK staff also moved into its new London office.

11.38am: FTSE slips lower

The FTSE 100 has dropped below the 8300 mark that it first broke through almost a month ago, well the 5th of May.

Many of the index's largest companies are dragging, including AstraZeneca down 0.9%, HSBC, Diageo and Compass all down more than 1%.

Only three of the top 15 are in green.

11.23am: Economy the focus of the election

PM Rishi Sunak is on a campaign visit in Stoke-on-Trent today.

Sunak says: ""The only certainty you're going to get with a Labour Party is that they are going to run out of money and put up your taxes.""

Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves, speaking at a Rolls-Royce Holdings PLC (LSE:RR.) factory, says taxes are at a 70-year high and says there are not additional tax rises needed under Labour's plans beyond those already set out.

As party leader Kier Starmer has set out, the top of Labour's 'first six steps for change' is to deliver economic stability with tough spending rules, to grow the economy and keep taxes, inflation and mortgages as low as possible.

Reeves says watchwords if the election is won will be ""stability, investment, reform"".

The full speech text is here.

11.11am: No Budget til September if Labour wins

If Labour wins the general election in July there earliest a budget would be held is late September, says Rachel Reeves, Labour's Shadow Chancellor, who is giving a speech right now.

She says this would be to allow the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) 10 weeks to weigh up her plans.

Reeves said earlier that the PM has called an early election is that the government's running of the economy is not working, noting that taxes have reached a 70-year high, national debt has more than doubled, and mortgages have gone up as a result of Liz Truss's mini-budget.

If the UK economy had grown at the rate of the OECD average over the past 14 years, it would be £150bn larger, she says.

11.03am: Some market analyst thoughts

Let's catch up with some market analysts and see what their thoughts are on this morning's news.

Dan Coatsworth at AJ Bell notes some ""strength in the aviation, mining, energy and insurance sectors"" that helped give the index its initial lift, and says Asian markets are looking ""resilient"".

""Later this week a second estimate of US GDP for the first quarter, the core PCE reading of inflation which the Federal Reserve likes to pore over when making decisions on rates, and Chinese manufacturing figures are likely to dominate the market's agenda,"" he adds.

Guy Lawson-Johns at Hargreaves Lansdown has more, noting some of the initial policy proposals emerging as the UK general election campaign gets underway.

""Last week's election announcement is causing some short-term volatility in the markets, but longer-term investors can usually take this as background noise,"" he says.

This includes Rishi Sunak betting on a £2.4 billion tax break to win the support of pensioners and last week's National Service pitch another defensive strategy to shore up core Tory voters, while shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves, ahead of a speech today, has sought to burnish her business credentials with a letter signed by 150 business people supporting Labour' approach to the economy, including bosses and ex-bosses from WPP, Iceland, JP Morgan, Tesco Bank and Heathrow.

He also flags that the put-up-or-shut-up deadlines of the bids for Royal Mail owner IDS and Anglo American come on Wednesday.

Looking at commodities, Brent crude is up 0.25% at $83.31, continued its rebound from near four-month lows.

""This comes amid expectations that OPEC+ will extend voluntary output cuts at its next meeting on 2 June. On the demand side, markets are also awaiting key US inflation data this week to gauge the direction of Federal Reserve monetary policy,"" Lawson-Johns says.

10.52am: ECB cut 'done deal'

Overnight, senior officials from the European Central Bank sent clear signal that interest rates will be cut from their record highs next week.

Chief economist Philip Lane said in a speech: ""At our June meeting, if our updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission were to further increase our confidence that inflation is converging to our target in a sustained manner, it would be appropriate to reduce the current level of monetary policy restriction.""

French central bank chief Francois Villeroy de Galhau, who with Lane is also one of the 26 members of the ECB's governing council, said: ""Barring a surprise, the first rate cut in June is a done deal.""

As for further cuts in July and beyond he added, ""let us keep our freedom on the timing and pace"".

10.42am: NatWest update

And now NatWest says its digital banking services are back up.

They ""should now be working as expected"" now, the lender's customer service team said, telling complaining customers on social media to ""try logging in as normal"".

However, NatWest's service updates page still says its mobile app is suffering from a ""service disruption"", with some customers still not able to view their credit card information. ""We're working hard to fix this, sorry if it's causing you any issues,"" it says on the page.

10.22am: NatWest app crash

An outage of the NatWest Group PLC (LSE:NWG) online banking app seems to be making news this morning.

It has been down since around 5:40 am, according to Downdetector, hitting thousands of users who have reported various error messages when attempting to log in.

NatWest reassured customers that they can still use their cards to make payments and withdraw cash from ATMs, branches, and the Post Office, and it is ""working hard getting everything back up and running"".

10.14am: ICG results look good but broker has a ""but""

Intermediate Capital Group (LSE:ICP) is near the top of the FTSE 100 leaderboard as its shares have risen 5.5% to new-all time highs on the back of its results, where the investment firm reported a bigger profit than expected and said it is benefiting from the current market.

Analyst Rae Maile at broker Panmure Gordon said the new medium-term target for fund-raising averages at least $13.8 billion per year and consensus assumes $12.4 billion and $14.1 billion for the current and next year.

""So far, so very good"", said Maile. ""The risk is that expectations have increased with the share price, as they have always tended to do.""

Consensus forecasts assume the operating margin for the fund management company (FMC) over 56% but guidance is ""in excess of 52%"", notes Maile, adding that the dividend was ""increased by just 2%"".

A year ago, a reasonable p/e on the FMC delivered the balance sheet ""for free"".

""Now the share price discounts 14x for the FMC and the balance sheet at book value. That is still fine, the FMC deserves a premium and book value undervalues the balance sheet, but further growth and re-rating is now a requirement rather than a free ride,"" the analyst concludes.

9.51am: Death of a CEO

Sad news from US operating oil developer TomCo Energy, which has announced the sudden death of John Potter, its CEO, at the age of 54.

He passed away suddenly on Friday, according to the company, which he had led for six years.

TomCo said non-execs Malcolm Groat, Louis Castro and Zac Phillips, will take interim responsibility for operations.

Chairman Groat said: ""All of us in and around TomCo, all who knew John, are deeply shocked and saddened by his sudden death. His hard work, dedication and good humour will be sorely missed. Our job, collectively, is to fulfil John's plans for TomCo.""

9.44am: Water companies leaking

Reports that the regulator will refuse water companies' requests for big customer bill hikes is hitting shares in United Utilities Group PLC (LSE:UU.), Severn Trent PLC (LSE:SVT) and Pennon Group PLC (LSE:PNN, OTC:PEGRY), which owns South West Water and Bristol Water.

Some water companies have applied to raise consumer bills over 90% and others between 60% and 30% as they look to invest in improvements to the network while also keeping up dividends for their shareholders.

Watchdog Ofwat is poised to turn down these pricing proposals, the Guardian is reporting, with some water companies getting half of what they requested.

The draft determination from Ofwat is due on 11 July, which will decide pricing and investment levels for the next five years.

8.56am: AstraZeneca drug update drags

The FTSE 100 is now sliding lower, with the post-long weekend good mood seeming to be fleeting.

There seem to be slightly more stocks in green (55) than red (45), with one flat, but most of the larger names are lower, with only four of the top 15 in green.

A notable faller is one of the largest, AstraZeneca down 1.6%.

An announcement from the drug giant this morning revealed that survival rates from datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato-DXd), which it is developing with Daiichi Sankyo, were ""numerically favoured... but did not reach statistical significance"".

8.48am: Pay revolution?

Shareholder revolts against director pay and bonuses have quietened down, data from the Investment Association suggests.

The number of companies hit by major investor pushback on pay fell 80% during the AGM season, it found, with only five meetings so far this year seeing more than 20% of investors voting against remuneration plans.

These were Hunting, Pearson, STV Group, Clarkson and Synthomer (LSE:SYNT).

Investors disapproved of the pay deals at 25 companies over the same period in 2023, the IA noted.

8.27am: Footsie flip-flop

Now the Footsie is down into the red, a familiar place in recent days, down just three points though.

The FTSE 250 is higher, however, up 25 points at 20,795. Defence technology outfit QinetiQ Group PLC (LSE:QQ.) and transport company FirstGroup are top of the mid-cap list.

Great Portland Estates (LSE:GPOR) PLC is down 16% after putting out further details following its rights issue announced last week.

There's been some macroeconomic data this morning, from the British Retail Consortium, with further evidence of easing inflation.

The retail trade body found that shop price annual inflation softened to 0.6% in May, down from 0.8% in April and the lowest since November 2021.

Non-food moved further into deflation at 0.8%, from 0.6% deflation last month and the lowest since October 2021.

Food inflation slowed to 3.2% from 3.4%, with fresh food inflation reached its lowest since November 2021.

8.10am: FTSE 100 opens higher

The FTSE 100 has surprised by starting higher as London's blue-chip index looks to break its losing streak.

In initial trading, the benchmark gained 13 points to climb above 8330, up 0.15%.

Rolls-Royce Group PLC is top of the leaderboard, up 2.7%, followed by National Grid PLC and easyJet PLC.

Intermediate Capital Group (LSE:ICP) PLC is up 1.9% after publishing its final results and hiking its dividend for the 14th consecutive year.

8am: Genuit sales down but margins up

Another short update, but not quite as brief and slightly less positive, from pipe and aircon maker Genuit Group PLC (LSE:GEN), formerly known as Polypipe.

It says revenues were down 8.6% in the first four months of the year as the market so far this year has been a bit soft, though this has been in line with management expectations.

On the plus side, ahead of its annual shareholder meeting later today in Leeds, the company said its underlying operating profit margin continued to improve, so it is keeping full-year earnings expectations unchanged.

CEO Joe Vorih reckons Genuit is ""in a strong position to benefit from the normalisation of volumes as markets recover"".

7.53am: Softcat (LSE:SCT) purring

There are a few FTSE 350 results out this morning, including Softcat (LSE:SCT) PLC, which has helpfully provided an extremely short third-quarter update.

The IT infrastructure technology and services group said that market conditions and trading in the three months to 30 April were pretty much the same as they were in the first half, leading to further growth in gross invoiced income, gross profit and operating profit.

""The board continues to anticipate that full year gross profit and operating profit results will be in line with expectations,"" Softcat (LSE:SCT) confirmed in its three-line statement.

7.49am: Boohoo faces AGM pay revolt

Boohoo Group PLC (AIM:BOO) faces a shareholder revolt over its plans to reward bosses with sizeable bonuses despite the losses they made in the past year.

The clothing retailer reported a £160 million loss as sales fell 17% but its annual report showed that, even though the management team failed to meet financial targets, the remuneration committee decided to grant payouts anyway as the loss was ""not an accurate reflection of the excellent work carried out"".

Several major shareholders are planning to vote against the proposed £1 million bonuses for co-founders Carol Kane and Mahmud Kamani as well as CEO John Lyttle at next month's annual general meeting, according to the Sunday Times.

7.29am: Revolution's rejection

M&A action it is indeed, with Revolution Bars Group PLC (AIM:RBG) confirming that it has rejected a proposal from Nightcap PLC (AIM:NGHT) as it is ""incapable of being delivered"".

While Revolution's management wants to raise £12.5 million to carry out a restructuring plan, legal advisers have suggested the Nightcap plans would throw a spanner in the works as funding would not be in place in time for the planned relaunch.

Nightcap's due diligence would also add more time, which Revolutuon says would add ""material delivery risk"" and possible require additional funding, further complicating the feasibility of the proposal.

Earlier this month, Revolution said its hunt for a potential rescuer had yielded 32 potential buyers, but management believes its proposed £12.5 million fundraising and restructuring plans are the only viable way forward.

""The board notes that, should the restructuring plan proceed and be sanctioned by the court, it would preserve value for the company's current shareholders by comparison to the offers received from the M&A process which provided no equity value, whilst acknowledging the dilutive effect of the Fundraising for those Shareholders who have not participated in its pro rata to their current shareholdings,"" Revolution said.

7.15am: FTSE losing streak to continue

The FTSE 100 is expected to continue its losing run for a fifth day on Tuesday, with the long weekend rest not expected to provide a boost.

Spread-betters are calling the index 12 points lower, having finished last week at 8317.59, losing 1.2% over the five days.

US consumer confidence data has been printed for May, coming in higher than expected.

The confidence index rose to 102.0 from a revised 97.5 the month before, better than the 96.0 consensus estimate.

Confidence about the present situation rose to 143.1 from 140.6, while expectations improved to 74.6 from 68.8.

Wall Street indices fell in advance of the release but are rising again after.

2.55pm: US stocks open mixed

Wall Street stocks have mostly opened higher, though the Dow Jones is down 0.25% as health stocks weigh.

The Nasdaq Composite is up 0.2%, led by a near-5% Nvidia rise for Nvidia, while the S&P 500 is flat, having traded higher initially.

Apple, Alphabet and ASML are in the green, but they are the only ones in the Nasdaq's top 15.

1.31pm: Election influence for markets?

Last week's general election news is not likely to impact monetary policy but investor confidence could be influenced by changes in opinion polls, says UBS.

Markets have been pretty indifferent to the PM's rain-sodden announcement, but this is not expected continue up to polling day.

""There are certainly a few things that could get investors excited,"" says UBS economist Dean Turner. ""The first of these will be the opinion polls.

""History tells us that opinions can, and often do, change quite quickly during an election campaign,"" he says, noting Theresa May's 2017 campaign when a 15% lead for the Conservatives all but evaporated by election day.

""If Labour's lead in opinion polls, hovering around 20%, starts to erode, investors may start to question their current confidence in the result.""

The other interesting development to watch is when the party manifestos are published, though we have a fair idea already, on economic matters.

There will not be much to separate the two main parties, the UBS economist says, with both likely to commit to sticking to the existing fiscal rules, which leaves neither of them with much room for manoeuvre and little impact on a macro perspective, he says, though there is always the potential for surprise.

""So, we should expect a lot of headlines and a few surprises over the next few weeks, but when it comes to investing in the UK markets, we still think investors should stick to fundamentals,"" Turner says, with the UK market rated as 'most preferred' for UBS.

""We... stick with this view as FTSE 100 companies, which generate a significant portion of their revenues internationally, should be largely sheltered from domestic political events.

""For bonds, rate cuts from the Bank of England should lead to falling yields, which is positive for bond prices.""

1.22pm: Pension promise

More electioneering, this time a new higher 'triple lock' for pensions.

Prime Minister Rishi Sunak promised today that pensioners will never pay tax on their state pension under his government if it wins the next election.

Building on the ""triple lock"" introduced by David Cameron, Sunak said if he is returned to power he will also make sure the personal allowance for pensioners would increase by at least 2.5% or in line with the higher of earnings or inflation.

Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves, who earlier revealed that more than a hundred leaders of large and small businesses have declared their support of the party's economic plans, called the scheme a ""desperate gimmick"".

1.05pm: Europe in the red, US hard to read

Like the FTSE 100, the major European indices are all in the red too, having mostly started higher. Germany's Dax is just below the flatline, while France's CAC is the worst position, down 0.6%.

Looking across the Atlantic, US markets are heading for a mixed start as they reopen after the Memorial Day holiday.

Tech stocks seem to be expected to drive the rise, with Nasdaq 100 futures pointing to a 0.2% gain, with S&P 500 futures up 0.1%, while Dow Jones futures are down 0.1%.

In the energy markets, WTI crude prices have steadied after rebounding sharply yesterday from more than three-month lows ahead of the online OPEC+ meeting next weekend.

In US data, consumer confidence numbers are due today, the Federal Reserve's Beige Book tomorrow, followed by the second reading of GDP and the trade balance on Thursday with the Chicago PMI alongside the PCE inflation reading that is seen as a key reading for the Fed as policymakers' preferred inflation measure.

""All roads this week point towards the April US core PCE print on Friday,"" says Deutsche Bank's Jim Reid. ""You don't need me to tell you how well scrutinised this data will be and how important it is to the Fed.""

Versus the previous month, PCE inflation is expected to edge down from 0.32% to 0.26%.

Trading volumes have been light for stock index futures markets, says market analyst David Morrison at Trade Nation.

""Stock indices are a touch firmer this morning, but it's difficult to gauge investor sentiment. We'll probably need to wait until volumes pick up later this afternoon.""

12.44pm: EU hydrogen funding

The European Commission has approved €1.4 billion of hydrogen funding for 13 projects and 11 companies, including Airbus, BMW and Michelin.

The Hy2Move programmes aim to develop technologies and processes ""that go beyond current technology and will allow major improvements notably in the areas of mobility and transport applications, fuel cells, on-board hydrogen storage and generation of hydrogen for the use in mobility and transport"".

It is designed to help the EU reach its target of reducing transport emissions by 90%.

The hydrogen funding is also accompanied by a separate €1 billion healthcare project to help the discovery of drugs to treat rare diseases and cancers, which the EU estimates will unlock an extra €5.9 billion in private funding.

12.25pm: Retail sector remains cautious

We have the second retail sector update of the day, this time from CBI.

Like the BRC survey said earlier, selling price inflation in the retail sector eased considerably in May, the CBI report says, adding that retail sales grew at their fastest pace since December 2022 in the year to May.

The CBI distributive trades survey found that retailers expect sales to fall slightly next month, but to remain broadly in line with seasonal norms.

Conditions elsewhere in the sector also appear to be more mixed, with headcount continuing to fall and investment plans weakening further.

""May's increase in retail sales adds to the swathe of data pointing to an improvement in activity over the near-term,"" said Alpesh Paleja, CBI lead economist.

""Falling inflation, and continuing real wage growth will contribute to a healthier consumer outlook, in turn supporting the retail sector further.

""That being said, retailers are restrained about their business situation over the coming quarter. Headlines sales are expected to fall moderately next month, and it's concerning that retailers' investment intentions have deteriorated noticeably.""

12.03pm: Meme update

Shares in GameStop Corp (NYSE:GME) are up 23% in premarket after the retailer raised new funds.

The king of meme stocks said it had raised over $900 million from selling shares during the rally earlier this month.

11.49am: City broker's overseas offices closing

The value of City broker Numis has been halved since being bought by Deutsche Bank, according to a Telegraph report.

Having bought the UK company for £410 million in April 2023, since renaming it Deutsche Numis, the German bank wrote down the value of the subsidiary by €233 million (£200 million).

Deutsche is closing the UK and European offices of Numis and merging them into its own buildings, with UK staff also moved into its new London office.

11.38am: FTSE slips lower

The FTSE 100 has dropped below the 8300 mark that it first broke through almost a month ago, well the 5th of May.

Many of the index's largest companies are dragging, including AstraZeneca down 0.9%, HSBC, Diageo and Compass all down more than 1%.

Only three of the top 15 are in green.

11.23am: Economy the focus of the election

PM Rishi Sunak is on a campaign visit in Stoke-on-Trent today.

Sunak says: ""The only certainty you're going to get with a Labour Party is that they are going to run out of money and put up your taxes.""

Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves, speaking at a Rolls-Royce Holdings PLC (LSE:RR.) factory, says taxes are at a 70-year high and says there are not additional tax rises needed under Labour's plans beyond those already set out.

As party leader Kier Starmer has set out, the top of Labour's 'first six steps for change' is to deliver economic stability with tough spending rules, to grow the economy and keep taxes, inflation and mortgages as low as possible.

Reeves says watchwords if the election is won will be ""stability, investment, reform"".

The full speech text is here.

11.11am: No Budget til September if Labour wins

If Labour wins the general election in July there earliest a budget would be held is late September, says Rachel Reeves, Labour's Shadow Chancellor, who is giving a speech right now.

She says this would be to allow the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) 10 weeks to weigh up her plans.

Reeves said earlier that the PM has called an early election is that the government's running of the economy is not working, noting that taxes have reached a 70-year high, national debt has more than doubled, and mortgages have gone up as a result of Liz Truss's mini-budget.

If the UK economy had grown at the rate of the OECD average over the past 14 years, it would be £150bn larger, she says.

11.03am: Some market analyst thoughts

Let's catch up with some market analysts and see what their thoughts are on this morning's news.

Dan Coatsworth at AJ Bell notes some ""strength in the aviation, mining, energy and insurance sectors"" that helped give the index its initial lift, and says Asian markets are looking ""resilient"".

""Later this week a second estimate of US GDP for the first quarter, the core PCE reading of inflation which the Federal Reserve likes to pore over when making decisions on rates, and Chinese manufacturing figures are likely to dominate the market's agenda,"" he adds.

Guy Lawson-Johns at Hargreaves Lansdown has more, noting some of the initial policy proposals emerging as the UK general election campaign gets underway.

""Last week's election announcement is causing some short-term volatility in the markets, but longer-term investors can usually take this as background noise,"" he says.

This includes Rishi Sunak betting on a £2.4 billion tax break to win the support of pensioners and last week's National Service pitch another defensive strategy to shore up core Tory voters, while shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves, ahead of a speech today, has sought to burnish her business credentials with a letter signed by 150 business people supporting Labour' approach to the economy, including bosses and ex-bosses from WPP, Iceland, JP Morgan, Tesco Bank and Heathrow.

He also flags that the put-up-or-shut-up deadlines of the bids for Royal Mail owner IDS and Anglo American come on Wednesday.

Looking at commodities, Brent crude is up 0.25% at $83.31, continued its rebound from near four-month lows.

""This comes amid expectations that OPEC+ will extend voluntary output cuts at its next meeting on 2 June. On the demand side, markets are also awaiting key US inflation data this week to gauge the direction of Federal Reserve monetary policy,"" Lawson-Johns says.

10.52am: ECB cut 'done deal'

Overnight, senior officials from the European Central Bank sent clear signal that interest rates will be cut from their record highs next week.

Chief economist Philip Lane said in a speech: ""At our June meeting, if our updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission were to further increase our confidence that inflation is converging to our target in a sustained manner, it would be appropriate to reduce the current level of monetary policy restriction.""

French central bank chief Francois Villeroy de Galhau, who with Lane is also one of the 26 members of the ECB's governing council, said: ""Barring a surprise, the first rate cut in June is a done deal.""

As for further cuts in July and beyond he added, ""let us keep our freedom on the timing and pace"".

10.42am: NatWest update

And now NatWest says its digital banking services are back up.

They ""should now be working as expected"" now, the lender's customer service team said, telling complaining customers on social media to ""try logging in as normal"".

However, NatWest's service updates page still says its mobile app is suffering from a ""service disruption"", with some customers still not able to view their credit card information. ""We're working hard to fix this, sorry if it's causing you any issues,"" it says on the page.

10.22am: NatWest app crash

An outage of the NatWest Group PLC (LSE:NWG) online banking app seems to be making news this morning.

It has been down since around 5:40 am, according to Downdetector, hitting thousands of users who have reported various error messages when attempting to log in.

NatWest reassured customers that they can still use their cards to make payments and withdraw cash from ATMs, branches, and the Post Office, and it is ""working hard getting everything back up and running"".

10.14am: ICG results look good but broker has a ""but""

Intermediate Capital Group (LSE:ICP) is near the top of the FTSE 100 leaderboard as its shares have risen 5.5% to new-all time highs on the back of its results, where the investment firm reported a bigger profit than expected and said it is benefiting from the current market.

Analyst Rae Maile at broker Panmure Gordon said the new medium-term target for fund-raising averages at least $13.8 billion per year and consensus assumes $12.4 billion and $14.1 billion for the current and next year.

""So far, so very good"", said Maile. ""The risk is that expectations have increased with the share price, as they have always tended to do.""

Consensus forecasts assume the operating margin for the fund management company (FMC) over 56% but guidance is ""in excess of 52%"", notes Maile, adding that the dividend was ""increased by just 2%"".

A year ago, a reasonable p/e on the FMC delivered the balance sheet ""for free"".

""Now the share price discounts 14x for the FMC and the balance sheet at book value. That is still fine, the FMC deserves a premium and book value undervalues the balance sheet, but further growth and re-rating is now a requirement rather than a free ride,"" the analyst concludes.

9.51am: Death of a CEO

Sad news from US operating oil developer TomCo Energy, which has announced the sudden death of John Potter, its CEO, at the age of 54.

He passed away suddenly on Friday, according to the company, which he had led for six years.

TomCo said non-execs Malcolm Groat, Louis Castro and Zac Phillips, will take interim responsibility for operations.

Chairman Groat said: ""All of us in and around TomCo, all who knew John, are deeply shocked and saddened by his sudden death. His hard work, dedication and good humour will be sorely missed. Our job, collectively, is to fulfil John's plans for TomCo.""

9.44am: Water companies leaking

Reports that the regulator will refuse water companies' requests for big customer bill hikes is hitting shares in United Utilities Group PLC (LSE:UU.), Severn Trent PLC (LSE:SVT) and Pennon Group PLC (LSE:PNN, OTC:PEGRY), which owns South West Water and Bristol Water.

Some water companies have applied to raise consumer bills over 90% and others between 60% and 30% as they look to invest in improvements to the network while also keeping up dividends for their shareholders.

Watchdog Ofwat is poised to turn down these pricing proposals, the Guardian is reporting, with some water companies getting half of what they requested.

The draft determination from Ofwat is due on 11 July, which will decide pricing and investment levels for the next five years.

8.56am: AstraZeneca drug update drags

The FTSE 100 is now sliding lower, with the post-long weekend good mood seeming to be fleeting.

There seem to be slightly more stocks in green (55) than red (45), with one flat, but most of the larger names are lower, with only four of the top 15 in green.

A notable faller is one of the largest, AstraZeneca down 1.6%.

An announcement from the drug giant this morning revealed that survival rates from datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato-DXd), which it is developing with Daiichi Sankyo, were ""numerically favoured... but did not reach statistical significance"".

8.48am: Pay revolution?

Shareholder revolts against director pay and bonuses have quietened down, data from the Investment Association suggests.

The number of companies hit by major investor pushback on pay fell 80% during the AGM season, it found, with only five meetings so far this year seeing more than 20% of investors voting against remuneration plans.

These were Hunting, Pearson, STV Group, Clarkson and Synthomer (LSE:SYNT).

Investors disapproved of the pay deals at 25 companies over the same period in 2023, the IA noted.

8.27am: Footsie flip-flop

Now the Footsie is down into the red, a familiar place in recent days, down just three points though.

The FTSE 250 is higher, however, up 25 points at 20,795. Defence technology outfit QinetiQ Group PLC (LSE:QQ.) and transport company FirstGroup are top of the mid-cap list.

Great Portland Estates (LSE:GPOR) PLC is down 16% after putting out further details following its rights issue announced last week.

There's been some macroeconomic data this morning, from the British Retail Consortium, with further evidence of easing inflation.

The retail trade body found that shop price annual inflation softened to 0.6% in May, down from 0.8% in April and the lowest since November 2021.

Non-food moved further into deflation at 0.8%, from 0.6% deflation last month and the lowest since October 2021.

Food inflation slowed to 3.2% from 3.4%, with fresh food inflation reached its lowest since November 2021.

8.10am: FTSE 100 opens higher

The FTSE 100 has surprised by starting higher as London's blue-chip index looks to break its losing streak.

In initial trading, the benchmark gained 13 points to climb above 8330, up 0.15%.

Rolls-Royce Group PLC is top of the leaderboard, up 2.7%, followed by National Grid PLC and easyJet PLC.

Intermediate Capital Group (LSE:ICP) PLC is up 1.9% after publishing its final results and hiking its dividend for the 14th consecutive year.

8am: Genuit sales down but margins up

Another short update, but not quite as brief and slightly less positive, from pipe and aircon maker Genuit Group PLC (LSE:GEN), formerly known as Polypipe.

It says revenues were down 8.6% in the first four months of the year as the market so far this year has been a bit soft, though this has been in line with management expectations.

On the plus side, ahead of its annual shareholder meeting later today in Leeds, the company said its underlying operating profit margin continued to improve, so it is keeping full-year earnings expectations unchanged.

CEO Joe Vorih reckons Genuit is ""in a strong position to benefit from the normalisation of volumes as markets recover"".

7.53am: Softcat (LSE:SCT) purring

There are a few FTSE 350 results out this morning, including Softcat (LSE:SCT) PLC, which has helpfully provided an extremely short third-quarter update.

The IT infrastructure technology and services group said that market conditions and trading in the three months to 30 April were pretty much the same as they were in the first half, leading to further growth in gross invoiced income, gross profit and operating profit.

""The board continues to anticipate that full year gross profit and operating profit results will be in line with expectations,"" Softcat (LSE:SCT) confirmed in its three-line statement.

7.49am: Boohoo faces AGM pay revolt

Boohoo Group PLC (AIM:BOO) faces a shareholder revolt over its plans to reward bosses with sizeable bonuses despite the losses they made in the past year.

The clothing retailer reported a £160 million loss as sales fell 17% but its annual report showed that, even though the management team failed to meet financial targets, the remuneration committee decided to grant payouts anyway as the loss was ""not an accurate reflection of the excellent work carried out"".

Several major shareholders are planning to vote against the proposed £1 million bonuses for co-founders Carol Kane and Mahmud Kamani as well as CEO John Lyttle at next month's annual general meeting, according to the Sunday Times.

7.29am: Revolution's rejection

M&A action it is indeed, with Revolution Bars Group PLC (AIM:RBG) confirming that it has rejected a proposal from Nightcap PLC (AIM:NGHT) as it is ""incapable of being delivered"".

While Revolution's management wants to raise £12.5 million to carry out a restructuring plan, legal advisers have suggested the Nightcap plans would throw a spanner in the works as funding would not be in place in time for the planned relaunch.

Nightcap's due diligence would also add more time, which Revolutuon says would add ""material delivery risk"" and possible require additional funding, further complicating the feasibility of the proposal.

Earlier this month, Revolution said its hunt for a potential rescuer had yielded 32 potential buyers, but management believes its proposed £12.5 million fundraising and restructuring plans are the only viable way forward.

""The board notes that, should the restructuring plan proceed and be sanctioned by the court, it would preserve value for the company's current shareholders by comparison to the offers received from the M&A process which provided no equity value, whilst acknowledging the dilutive effect of the Fundraising for those Shareholders who have not participated in its pro rata to their current shareholdings,"" Revolution said.

7.15am: FTSE losing streak to continue

The FTSE 100 is expected to continue its losing run for a fifth day on Tuesday, with the long weekend rest not expected to provide a boost.

Spread-betters are calling the index 12 points lower, having finished last week at 8317.59, losing 1.2% over the five days.

It was a public holiday in both the US and the UK yesterday, but Asian markets were generally positive.

This morning equities in Asia are looking subdued, with mixed moves either side of the flatline.

The European Commission has approved €1.4 billion of hydrogen funding for 13 projects and 11 companies, including Airbus, BMW and Michelin.

PM Rishi Sunak is on a campaign visit in Stoke-on-Trent today.

Sunak says: ""The only certainty you're going to get with a Labour Party is that they are going to run out of money and put up your taxes.""

Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves, speaking at a Rolls-Royce Holdings PLC (LSE:RR.) factory, says taxes are at a 70-year high and says there are not additional tax rises needed under Labour's plans beyond those already set out.

As party leader Kier Starmer has set out, the top of Labour's 'first six steps for change' is to deliver economic stability with tough spending rules, to grow the economy and keep taxes, inflation and mortgages as low as possible.

Reeves says watchwords if the election is won will be ""stability, investment, reform"".

The full speech text is here.

11.11am: No Budget til September if Labour wins

If Labour wins the general election in July there earliest a budget would be held is late September, says Rachel Reeves, Labour's Shadow Chancellor, who is giving a speech right now.

She says this would be to allow the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) 10 weeks to weigh up her plans.

Reeves said earlier that the PM has called an early election is that the government's running of the economy is not working, noting that taxes have reached a 70-year high, national debt has more than doubled, and mortgages have gone up as a result of Liz Truss's mini-budget.

If the UK economy had grown at the rate of the OECD average over the past 14 years, it would be £150bn larger, she says.

11.03am: Some market analyst thoughts

Let's catch up with some market analysts and see what their thoughts are on this morning's news.

Dan Coatsworth at AJ Bell notes some ""strength in the aviation, mining, energy and insurance sectors"" that helped give the index its initial lift, and says Asian markets are looking ""resilient"".

""Later this week a second estimate of US GDP for the first quarter, the core PCE reading of inflation which the Federal Reserve likes to pore over when making decisions on rates, and Chinese manufacturing figures are likely to dominate the market's agenda,"" he adds.

Guy Lawson-Johns at Hargreaves Lansdown has more, noting some of the initial policy proposals emerging as the UK general election campaign gets underway.

""Last week's election announcement is causing some short-term volatility in the markets, but longer-term investors can usually take this as background noise,"" he says.

This includes Rishi Sunak betting on a £2.4 billion tax break to win the support of pensioners and last week's National Service pitch another defensive strategy to shore up core Tory voters, while shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves, ahead of a speech today, has sought to burnish her business credentials with a letter signed by 150 business people supporting Labour' approach to the economy, including bosses and ex-bosses from WPP, Iceland, JP Morgan, Tesco Bank and Heathrow.

He also flags that the put-up-or-shut-up deadlines of the bids for Royal Mail owner IDS and Anglo American come on Wednesday.

Looking at commodities, Brent crude is up 0.25% at $83.31, continued its rebound from near four-month lows.

""This comes amid expectations that OPEC+ will extend voluntary output cuts at its next meeting on 2 June. On the demand side, markets are also awaiting key US inflation data this week to gauge the direction of Federal Reserve monetary policy,"" Lawson-Johns says.

10.52am: ECB cut 'done deal'

Overnight, senior officials from the European Central Bank sent clear signal that interest rates will be cut from their record highs next week.

Chief economist Philip Lane said in a speech: ""At our June meeting, if our updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission were to further increase our confidence that inflation is converging to our target in a sustained manner, it would be appropriate to reduce the current level of monetary policy restriction.""

French central bank chief Francois Villeroy de Galhau, who with Lane is also one of the 26 members of the ECB's governing council, said: ""Barring a surprise, the first rate cut in June is a done deal.""

As for further cuts in July and beyond he added, ""let us keep our freedom on the timing and pace"".

10.42am: NatWest update

And now NatWest says its digital banking services are back up.

They ""should now be working as expected"" now, the lender's customer service team said, telling complaining customers on social media to ""try logging in as normal"".

However, NatWest's service updates page still says its mobile app is suffering from a ""service disruption"", with some customers still not able to view their credit card information. ""We're working hard to fix this, sorry if it's causing you any issues,"" it says on the page.

10.22am: NatWest app crash

An outage of the NatWest Group PLC (LSE:NWG) online banking app seems to be making news this morning.

It has been down since around 5:40 am, according to Downdetector, hitting thousands of users who have reported various error messages when attempting to log in.

NatWest reassured customers that they can still use their cards to make payments and withdraw cash from ATMs, branches, and the Post Office, and it is ""working hard getting everything back up and running"".

10.14am: ICG results look good but broker has a ""but""

Intermediate Capital Group (LSE:ICP) is near the top of the FTSE 100 leaderboard as its shares have risen 5.5% to new-all time highs on the back of its results, where the investment firm reported a bigger profit than expected and said it is benefiting from the current market.

Analyst Rae Maile at broker Panmure Gordon said the new medium-term target for fund-raising averages at least $13.8 billion per year and consensus assumes $12.4 billion and $14.1 billion for the current and next year.

""So far, so very good"", said Maile. ""The risk is that expectations have increased with the share price, as they have always tended to do.""

Consensus forecasts assume the operating margin for the fund management company (FMC) over 56% but guidance is ""in excess of 52%"", notes Maile, adding that the dividend was ""increased by just 2%"".

A year ago, a reasonable p/e on the FMC delivered the balance sheet ""for free"".

""Now the share price discounts 14x for the FMC and the balance sheet at book value. That is still fine, the FMC deserves a premium and book value undervalues the balance sheet, but further growth and re-rating is now a requirement rather than a free ride,"" the analyst concludes.

9.51am: Death of a CEO

Sad news from US operating oil developer TomCo Energy, which has announced the sudden death of John Potter, its CEO, at the age of 54.

He passed away suddenly on Friday, according to the company, which he had led for six years.

TomCo said non-execs Malcolm Groat, Louis Castro and Zac Phillips, will take interim responsibility for operations.

Chairman Groat said: ""All of us in and around TomCo, all who knew John, are deeply shocked and saddened by his sudden death. His hard work, dedication and good humour will be sorely missed. Our job, collectively, is to fulfil John's plans for TomCo.""

9.44am: Water companies leaking

Reports that the regulator will refuse water companies' requests for big customer bill hikes is hitting shares in United Utilities Group PLC (LSE:UU.), Severn Trent PLC (LSE:SVT) and Pennon Group PLC (LSE:PNN, OTC:PEGRY), which owns South West Water and Bristol Water.

Some water companies have applied to raise consumer bills over 90% and others between 60% and 30% as they look to invest in improvements to the network while also keeping up dividends for their shareholders.

Watchdog Ofwat is poised to turn down these pricing proposals, the Guardian is reporting, with some water companies getting half of what they requested.

The draft determination from Ofwat is due on 11 July, which will decide pricing and investment levels for the next five years.

8.56am: AstraZeneca drug update drags

The FTSE 100 is now sliding lower, with the post-long weekend good mood seeming to be fleeting.

There seem to be slightly more stocks in green (55) than red (45), with one flat, but most of the larger names are lower, with only four of the top 15 in green.

A notable faller is one of the largest, AstraZeneca down 1.6%.

An announcement from the drug giant this morning revealed that survival rates from datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato-DXd), which it is developing with Daiichi Sankyo, were ""numerically favoured... but did not reach statistical significance"".

8.48am: Pay revolution?

Shareholder revolts against director pay and bonuses have quietened down, data from the Investment Association suggests.

The number of companies hit by major investor pushback on pay fell 80% during the AGM season, it found, with only five meetings so far this year seeing more than 20% of investors voting against remuneration plans.

These were Hunting, Pearson, STV Group, Clarkson and Synthomer (LSE:SYNT).

Investors disapproved of the pay deals at 25 companies over the same period in 2023, the IA noted.

8.27am: Footsie flip-flop

Now the Footsie is down into the red, a familiar place in recent days, down just three points though.

The FTSE 250 is higher, however, up 25 points at 20,795. Defence technology outfit QinetiQ Group PLC (LSE:QQ.) and transport company FirstGroup are top of the mid-cap list.

Great Portland Estates (LSE:GPOR) PLC is down 16% after putting out further details following its rights issue announced last week.

There's been some macroeconomic data this morning, from the British Retail Consortium, with further evidence of easing inflation.

The retail trade body found that shop price annual inflation softened to 0.6% in May, down from 0.8% in April and the lowest since November 2021.

Non-food moved further into deflation at 0.8%, from 0.6% deflation last month and the lowest since October 2021.

Food inflation slowed to 3.2% from 3.4%, with fresh food inflation reached its lowest since November 2021.

8.10am: FTSE 100 opens higher

The FTSE 100 has surprised by starting higher as London's blue-chip index looks to break its losing streak.

In initial trading, the benchmark gained 13 points to climb above 8330, up 0.15%.

Rolls-Royce Group PLC is top of the leaderboard, up 2.7%, followed by National Grid PLC and easyJet PLC.

Intermediate Capital Group (LSE:ICP) PLC is up 1.9% after publishing its final results and hiking its dividend for the 14th consecutive year.

8am: Genuit sales down but margins up

Another short update, but not quite as brief and slightly less positive, from pipe and aircon maker Genuit Group PLC (LSE:GEN), formerly known as Polypipe.

It says revenues were down 8.6% in the first four months of the year as the market so far this year has been a bit soft, though this has been in line with management expectations.

On the plus side, ahead of its annual shareholder meeting later today in Leeds, the company said its underlying operating profit margin continued to improve, so it is keeping full-year earnings expectations unchanged.

CEO Joe Vorih reckons Genuit is ""in a strong position to benefit from the normalisation of volumes as markets recover"".

7.53am: Softcat (LSE:SCT) purring

There are a few FTSE 350 results out this morning, including Softcat (LSE:SCT) PLC, which has helpfully provided an extremely short third-quarter update.

The IT infrastructure technology and services group said that market conditions and trading in the three months to 30 April were pretty much the same as they were in the first half, leading to further growth in gross invoiced income, gross profit and operating profit.

""The board continues to anticipate that full year gross profit and operating profit results will be in line with expectations,"" Softcat (LSE:SCT) confirmed in its three-line statement.

7.49am: Boohoo faces AGM pay revolt

Boohoo Group PLC (AIM:BOO) faces a shareholder revolt over its plans to reward bosses with sizeable bonuses despite the losses they made in the past year.

The clothing retailer reported a £160 million loss as sales fell 17% but its annual report showed that, even though the management team failed to meet financial targets, the remuneration committee decided to grant payouts anyway as the loss was ""not an accurate reflection of the excellent work carried out"".

Several major shareholders are planning to vote against the proposed £1 million bonuses for co-founders Carol Kane and Mahmud Kamani as well as CEO John Lyttle at next month's annual general meeting, according to the Sunday Times.

7.29am: Revolution's rejection

M&A action it is indeed, with Revolution Bars Group PLC (AIM:RBG) confirming that it has rejected a proposal from Nightcap PLC (AIM:NGHT) as it is ""incapable of being delivered"".

While Revolution's management wants to raise £12.5 million to carry out a restructuring plan, legal advisers have suggested the Nightcap plans would throw a spanner in the works as funding would not be in place in time for the planned relaunch.

Nightcap's due diligence would also add more time, which Revolutuon says would add ""material delivery risk"" and possible require additional funding, further complicating the feasibility of the proposal.

Earlier this month, Revolution said its hunt for a potential rescuer had yielded 32 potential buyers, but management believes its proposed £12.5 million fundraising and restructuring plans are the only viable way forward.

""The board notes that, should the restructuring plan proceed and be sanctioned by the court, it would preserve value for the company's current shareholders by comparison to the offers received from the M&A process which provided no equity value, whilst acknowledging the dilutive effect of the Fundraising for those Shareholders who have not participated in its pro rata to their current shareholdings,"" Revolution said.

7.15am: FTSE losing streak to continue

The FTSE 100 is expected to continue its losing run for a fifth day on Tuesday, with the long weekend rest not expected to provide a boost.

Spread-betters are calling the index 12 points lower, having finished last week at 8317.59, losing 1.2% over the five days.

It was a public holiday in both the US and the UK yesterday, but Asian markets were generally positive.

This morning equities in Asia are looking subdued, with mixed moves either side of the flatline.

Beatrice Offshore Windfarm broke rules when it charged excessive prices to reduce its output to ease pressure on the grid, ""pushing up costs for consumers,"" Ofgem said in a statement.

The action follows a Bloomberg investigation earlier this year which showed that dozens of British wind farms were overstating their power production, which in turn added millions to consumers' electricity bills.

Beatrice Offshore Windfarm overstated generation forecasts by between 6% and 10% from September 2021 through July 2022, the report found.

The wind farm is a joint venture with SSE Plc owning a 40% stake.

On particularly windy days, turbines in the UK often have to be turned off as they risk overloading the country's aging electricity network.

National Grid Plc's system operator will pay companies to do this based on the wind farms' own predictions of how much they would have generated.

Overstating forecasts can boost what the companies receive, with consumers ultimately picking up the tab.

""BOWL now accepts Ofgem's position that its approach was not compliant,"" Ofgem wrote in their statement. The money will be paid into the regulator's redress fund, which helps support energy consumers in vulnerable situations, according to the statement.

BOWL said it accepted that it breached one of its electricity generation license conditions, according to a statement from its spokesperson, adding that ""the breach was in BOWL's view wholly unintentional.""",energyvoice.com,news,Energy Voice,Erikka Askeland,0.09019607843137245,454600713,1,https://www.energyvoice.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/01/Beatrice-Offshore-Wind-Farm_-Moray-Firth_-Scotland_Large-Image_m29742-1-363rgw2dd.jpg,

11.49am: City broker's overseas offices closing

The value of City broker Numis has been halved since being bought by Deutsche Bank, according to a Telegraph report.

Having bought the UK company for £410 million in April 2023, since renaming it Deutsche Numis, the German bank wrote down the value of the subsidiary by €233 million (£200 million).

Deutsche is closing the UK and European offices of Numis and merging them into its own buildings, with UK staff also moved into its new London office.

11.38am: FTSE slips lower

The FTSE 100 has dropped below the 8300 mark that it first broke through almost a month ago, well the 5th of May.

Many of the index's largest companies are dragging, including AstraZeneca down 0.9%, HSBC, Diageo and Compass all down more than 1%.

Only three of the top 15 are in green.

""The board notes that, should the restructuring plan proceed and be sanctioned by the court, it would preserve value for the company's current shareholders by comparison to the offers received from the M&A process which provided no equity value, whilst acknowledging the dilutive effect of the Fundraising for those Shareholders who have not participated in its pro rata to their current shareholdings,"" Revolution said.

7.15am: FTSE losing streak to continue

The FTSE 100 is expected to continue its losing run for a fifth day on Tuesday, with the long weekend rest not expected to provide a boost.

Spread-betters are calling the index 12 points lower, having finished last week at 8317.59, losing 1.2% over the five days.

It was a public holiday in both the US and the UK yesterday, but Asian markets were generally positive.

This morning equities in Asia are looking subdued, with mixed moves either side of the flatline.

The FTSE 100 has dropped below the 8300 mark that it first broke through almost a month ago, well the 5th of May.

Many of the index's largest companies are dragging, including AstraZeneca down 0.9%, HSBC, Diageo and Compass all down more than 1%.

Only three of the top 15 are in green.

11.23am: Economy the focus of the election

PM Rishi Sunak is on a campaign visit in Stoke-on-Trent today.

Sunak says: ""The only certainty you're going to get with a Labour Party is that they are going to run out of money and put up your taxes.""

Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves, speaking at a Rolls-Royce Holdings PLC (LSE:RR.) factory, says taxes are at a 70-year high and says there are not additional tax rises needed under Labour's plans beyond those already set out.

As party leader Kier Starmer has set out, the top of Labour's 'first six steps for change' is to deliver economic stability with tough spending rules, to grow the economy and keep taxes, inflation and mortgages as low as possible.

Reeves says watchwords if the election is won will be ""stability, investment, reform"".

The full speech text is here.

11.11am: No Budget til September if Labour wins

If Labour wins the general election in July there earliest a budget would be held is late September, says Rachel Reeves, Labour's Shadow Chancellor, who is giving a speech right now.

She says this would be to allow the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) 10 weeks to weigh up her plans.

Reeves said earlier that the PM has called an early election is that the government's running of the economy is not working, noting that taxes have reached a 70-year high, national debt has more than doubled, and mortgages have gone up as a result of Liz Truss's mini-budget.

If the UK economy had grown at the rate of the OECD average over the past 14 years, it would be £150bn larger, she says.

11.03am: Some market analyst thoughts

Let's catch up with some market analysts and see what their thoughts are on this morning's news.

Dan Coatsworth at AJ Bell notes some ""strength in the aviation, mining, energy and insurance sectors"" that helped give the index its initial lift, and says Asian markets are looking ""resilient"".

""Later this week a second estimate of US GDP for the first quarter, the core PCE reading of inflation which the Federal Reserve likes to pore over when making decisions on rates, and Chinese manufacturing figures are likely to dominate the market's agenda,"" he adds.

Guy Lawson-Johns at Hargreaves Lansdown has more, noting some of the initial policy proposals emerging as the UK general election campaign gets underway.

""Last week's election announcement is causing some short-term volatility in the markets, but longer-term investors can usually take this as background noise,"" he says.

This includes Rishi Sunak betting on a £2.4 billion tax break to win the support of pensioners and last week's National Service pitch another defensive strategy to shore up core Tory voters, while shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves, ahead of a speech today, has sought to burnish her business credentials with a letter signed by 150 business people supporting Labour' approach to the economy, including bosses and ex-bosses from WPP, Iceland, JP Morgan, Tesco Bank and Heathrow.

He also flags that the put-up-or-shut-up deadlines of the bids for Royal Mail owner IDS and Anglo American come on Wednesday.

Looking at commodities, Brent crude is up 0.25% at $83.31, continued its rebound from near four-month lows.

""This comes amid expectations that OPEC+ will extend voluntary output cuts at its next meeting on 2 June. On the demand side, markets are also awaiting key US inflation data this week to gauge the direction of Federal Reserve monetary policy,"" Lawson-Johns says.

10.52am: ECB cut 'done deal'

Overnight, senior officials from the European Central Bank sent clear signal that interest rates will be cut from their record highs next week.

Chief economist Philip Lane said in a speech: ""At our June meeting, if our updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission were to further increase our confidence that inflation is converging to our target in a sustained manner, it would be appropriate to reduce the current level of monetary policy restriction.""

French central bank chief Francois Villeroy de Galhau, who with Lane is also one of the 26 members of the ECB's governing council, said: ""Barring a surprise, the first rate cut in June is a done deal.""

As for further cuts in July and beyond he added, ""let us keep our freedom on the timing and pace"".

10.42am: NatWest update

And now NatWest says its digital banking services are back up.

They ""should now be working as expected"" now, the lender's customer service team said, telling complaining customers on social media to ""try logging in as normal"".

However, NatWest's service updates page still says its mobile app is suffering from a ""service disruption"", with some customers still not able to view their credit card information. ""We're working hard to fix this, sorry if it's causing you any issues,"" it says on the page.

10.22am: NatWest app crash

An outage of the NatWest Group PLC (LSE:NWG) online banking app seems to be making news this morning.

It has been down since around 5:40 am, according to Downdetector, hitting thousands of users who have reported various error messages when attempting to log in.

NatWest reassured customers that they can still use their cards to make payments and withdraw cash from ATMs, branches, and the Post Office, and it is ""working hard getting everything back up and running"".

10.14am: ICG results look good but broker has a ""but""

Intermediate Capital Group (LSE:ICP) is near the top of the FTSE 100 leaderboard as its shares have risen 5.5% to new-all time highs on the back of its results, where the investment firm reported a bigger profit than expected and said it is benefiting from the current market.

Analyst Rae Maile at broker Panmure Gordon said the new medium-term target for fund-raising averages at least $13.8 billion per year and consensus assumes $12.4 billion and $14.1 billion for the current and next year.

""So far, so very good"", said Maile. ""The risk is that expectations have increased with the share price, as they have always tended to do.""

Consensus forecasts assume the operating margin for the fund management company (FMC) over 56% but guidance is ""in excess of 52%"", notes Maile, adding that the dividend was ""increased by just 2%"".

A year ago, a reasonable p/e on the FMC delivered the balance sheet ""for free"".

""Now the share price discounts 14x for the FMC and the balance sheet at book value. That is still fine, the FMC deserves a premium and book value undervalues the balance sheet, but further growth and re-rating is now a requirement rather than a free ride,"" the analyst concludes.

9.51am: Death of a CEO

Sad news from US operating oil developer TomCo Energy, which has announced the sudden death of John Potter, its CEO, at the age of 54.

He passed away suddenly on Friday, according to the company, which he had led for six years.

TomCo said non-execs Malcolm Groat, Louis Castro and Zac Phillips, will take interim responsibility for operations.

Chairman Groat said: ""All of us in and around TomCo, all who knew John, are deeply shocked and saddened by his sudden death. His hard work, dedication and good humour will be sorely missed. Our job, collectively, is to fulfil John's plans for TomCo.""

9.44am: Water companies leaking

Reports that the regulator will refuse water companies' requests for big customer bill hikes is hitting shares in United Utilities Group PLC (LSE:UU.), Severn Trent PLC (LSE:SVT) and Pennon Group PLC (LSE:PNN, OTC:PEGRY), which owns South West Water and Bristol Water.

Some water companies have applied to raise consumer bills over 90% and others between 60% and 30% as they look to invest in improvements to the network while also keeping up dividends for their shareholders.

Watchdog Ofwat is poised to turn down these pricing proposals, the Guardian is reporting, with some water companies getting half of what they requested.

The draft determination from Ofwat is due on 11 July, which will decide pricing and investment levels for the next five years.

8.56am: AstraZeneca drug update drags

The FTSE 100 is now sliding lower, with the post-long weekend good mood seeming to be fleeting.

There seem to be slightly more stocks in green (55) than red (45), with one flat, but most of the larger names are lower, with only four of the top 15 in green.

A notable faller is one of the largest, AstraZeneca down 1.6%.

An announcement from the drug giant this morning revealed that survival rates from datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato-DXd), which it is developing with Daiichi Sankyo, were ""numerically favoured... but did not reach statistical significance"".

8.48am: Pay revolution?

Shareholder revolts against director pay and bonuses have quietened down, data from the Investment Association suggests.

The number of companies hit by major investor pushback on pay fell 80% during the AGM season, it found, with only five meetings so far this year seeing more than 20% of investors voting against remuneration plans.

These were Hunting, Pearson, STV Group, Clarkson and Synthomer (LSE:SYNT).

Investors disapproved of the pay deals at 25 companies over the same period in 2023, the IA noted.

8.27am: Footsie flip-flop

Now the Footsie is down into the red, a familiar place in recent days, down just three points though.

The FTSE 250 is higher, however, up 25 points at 20,795. Defence technology outfit QinetiQ Group PLC (LSE:QQ.) and transport company FirstGroup are top of the mid-cap list.

Great Portland Estates (LSE:GPOR) PLC is down 16% after putting out further details following its rights issue announced last week.

There's been some macroeconomic data this morning, from the British Retail Consortium, with further evidence of easing inflation.

The retail trade body found that shop price annual inflation softened to 0.6% in May, down from 0.8% in April and the lowest since November 2021.

Non-food moved further into deflation at 0.8%, from 0.6% deflation last month and the lowest since October 2021.

Food inflation slowed to 3.2% from 3.4%, with fresh food inflation reached its lowest since November 2021.

8.10am: FTSE 100 opens higher

The FTSE 100 has surprised by starting higher as London's blue-chip index looks to break its losing streak.

In initial trading, the benchmark gained 13 points to climb above 8330, up 0.15%.

Rolls-Royce Group PLC is top of the leaderboard, up 2.7%, followed by National Grid PLC and easyJet PLC.

Intermediate Capital Group (LSE:ICP) PLC is up 1.9% after publishing its final results and hiking its dividend for the 14th consecutive year.

8am: Genuit sales down but margins up

Another short update, but not quite as brief and slightly less positive, from pipe and aircon maker Genuit Group PLC (LSE:GEN), formerly known as Polypipe.

It says revenues were down 8.6% in the first four months of the year as the market so far this year has been a bit soft, though this has been in line with management expectations.

On the plus side, ahead of its annual shareholder meeting later today in Leeds, the company said its underlying operating profit margin continued to improve, so it is keeping full-year earnings expectations unchanged.

CEO Joe Vorih reckons Genuit is ""in a strong position to benefit from the normalisation of volumes as markets recover"".

7.53am: Softcat (LSE:SCT) purring

There are a few FTSE 350 results out this morning, including Softcat (LSE:SCT) PLC, which has helpfully provided an extremely short third-quarter update.

The IT infrastructure technology and services group said that market conditions and trading in the three months to 30 April were pretty much the same as they were in the first half, leading to further growth in gross invoiced income, gross profit and operating profit.

""The board continues to anticipate that full year gross profit and operating profit results will be in line with expectations,"" Softcat (LSE:SCT) confirmed in its three-line statement.

7.49am: Boohoo faces AGM pay revolt

Boohoo Group PLC (AIM:BOO) faces a shareholder revolt over its plans to reward bosses with sizeable bonuses despite the losses they made in the past year.

The clothing retailer reported a £160 million loss as sales fell 17% but its annual report showed that, even though the management team failed to meet financial targets, the remuneration committee decided to grant payouts anyway as the loss was ""not an accurate reflection of the excellent work carried out"".

Several major shareholders are planning to vote against the proposed £1 million bonuses for co-founders Carol Kane and Mahmud Kamani as well as CEO John Lyttle at next month's annual general meeting, according to the Sunday Times.

7.29am: Revolution's rejection

M&A action it is indeed, with Revolution Bars Group PLC (AIM:RBG) confirming that it has rejected a proposal from Nightcap PLC (AIM:NGHT) as it is ""incapable of being delivered"".

While Revolution's management wants to raise £12.5 million to carry out a restructuring plan, legal advisers have suggested the Nightcap plans would throw a spanner in the works as funding would not be in place in time for the planned relaunch.

Nightcap's due diligence would also add more time, which Revolutuon says would add ""material delivery risk"" and possible require additional funding, further complicating the feasibility of the proposal.

Earlier this month, Revolution said its hunt for a potential rescuer had yielded 32 potential buyers, but management believes its proposed £12.5 million fundraising and restructuring plans are the only viable way forward.

""The board notes that, should the restructuring plan proceed and be sanctioned by the court, it would preserve value for the company's current shareholders by comparison to the offers received from the M&A process which provided no equity value, whilst acknowledging the dilutive effect of the Fundraising for those Shareholders who have not participated in its pro rata to their current shareholdings,"" Revolution said.

11.11am: No Budget til September if Labour wins

If Labour wins the general election in July there earliest a budget would be held is late September, says Rachel Reeves, Labour's Shadow Chancellor, who is giving a speech right now.

She says this would be to allow the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) 10 weeks to weigh up her plans.

Reeves said earlier that the PM has called an early election is that the government's running of the economy is not working, noting that taxes have reached a 70-year high, national debt has more than doubled, and mortgages have gone up as a result of Liz Truss's mini-budget.

If the UK economy had grown at the rate of the OECD average over the past 14 years, it would be £150bn larger, she says.

11.03am: Some market analyst thoughts

Let's catch up with some market analysts and see what their thoughts are on this morning's news.

Dan Coatsworth at AJ Bell notes some ""strength in the aviation, mining, energy and insurance sectors"" that helped give the index its initial lift, and says Asian markets are looking ""resilient"".

""Last week's election announcement is causing some short-term volatility in the markets, but longer-term investors can usually take this as background noise,"" he says.

This includes Rishi Sunak betting on a £2.4 billion tax break to win the support of pensioners and last week's National Service pitch another defensive strategy to shore up core Tory voters, while shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves, ahead of a speech today, has sought to burnish her business credentials with a letter signed by 150 business people supporting Labour' approach to the economy, including bosses and ex-bosses from WPP, Iceland, JP Morgan, Tesco Bank and Heathrow.

He also flags that the put-up-or-shut-up deadlines of the bids for Royal Mail owner IDS and Anglo American come on Wednesday.

Now the Footsie is down into the red, a familiar place in recent days, down just three points though.

The FTSE 250 is higher, however, up 25 points at 20,795. Defence technology outfit QinetiQ Group PLC (LSE:QQ.) and transport company FirstGroup are top of the mid-cap list.

Great Portland Estates (LSE:GPOR) PLC is down 16% after putting out further details following its rights issue announced last week.

There's been some macroeconomic data this morning, from the British Retail Consortium, with further evidence of easing inflation.

The retail trade body found that shop price annual inflation softened to 0.6% in May, down from 0.8% in April and the lowest since November 2021.

Food inflation slowed to 3.2% from 3.4%, with fresh food inflation reached its lowest since November 2021.

8.10am: FTSE 100 opens higher

The FTSE 100 has surprised by starting higher as London's blue-chip index looks to break its losing streak.

In initial trading, the benchmark gained 13 points to climb above 8330, up 0.15%.

Rolls-Royce Group PLC is top of the leaderboard, up 2.7%, followed by National Grid PLC and easyJet PLC.

Intermediate Capital Group (LSE:ICP) PLC is up 1.9% after publishing its final results and hiking its dividend for the 14th consecutive year.

8am: Genuit sales down but margins up

Another short update, but not quite as brief and slightly less positive, from pipe and aircon maker Genuit Group PLC (LSE:GEN), formerly known as Polypipe.

It says revenues were down 8.6% in the first four months of the year as the market so far this year has been a bit soft, though this has been in line with management expectations.

On the plus side, ahead of its annual shareholder meeting later today in Leeds, the company said its underlying operating profit margin continued to improve, so it is keeping full-year earnings expectations unchanged.

CEO Joe Vorih reckons Genuit is ""in a strong position to benefit from the normalisation of volumes as markets recover"".

7.53am: Softcat (LSE:SCT) purring

There are a few FTSE 350 results out this morning, including Softcat (LSE:SCT) PLC, which has helpfully provided an extremely short third-quarter update.

The IT infrastructure technology and services group said that market conditions and trading in the three months to 30 April were pretty much the same as they were in the first half, leading to further growth in gross invoiced income, gross profit and operating profit.

""The board continues to anticipate that full year gross profit and operating profit results will be in line with expectations,"" Softcat (LSE:SCT) confirmed in its three-line statement.

7.49am: Boohoo faces AGM pay revolt

Boohoo Group PLC (AIM:BOO) faces a shareholder revolt over its plans to reward bosses with sizeable bonuses despite the losses they made in the past year.

The clothing retailer reported a £160 million loss as sales fell 17% but its annual report showed that, even though the management team failed to meet financial targets, the remuneration committee decided to grant payouts anyway as the loss was ""not an accurate reflection of the excellent work carried out"".

Several major shareholders are planning to vote against the proposed £1 million bonuses for co-founders Carol Kane and Mahmud Kamani as well as CEO John Lyttle at next month's annual general meeting, according to the Sunday Times.

7.29am: Revolution's rejection

M&A action it is indeed, with Revolution Bars Group PLC (AIM:RBG) confirming that it has rejected a proposal from Nightcap PLC (AIM:NGHT) as it is ""incapable of being delivered"".

While Revolution's management wants to raise £12.5 million to carry out a restructuring plan, legal advisers have suggested the Nightcap plans would throw a spanner in the works as funding would not be in place in time for the planned relaunch.

Nightcap's due diligence would also add more time, which Revolutuon says would add ""material delivery risk"" and possible require additional funding, further complicating the feasibility of the proposal.

Earlier this month, Revolution said its hunt for a potential rescuer had yielded 32 potential buyers, but management believes its proposed £12.5 million fundraising and restructuring plans are the only viable way forward.

""The board notes that, should the restructuring plan proceed and be sanctioned by the court, it would preserve value for the company's current shareholders by comparison to the offers received from the M&A process which provided no equity value, whilst acknowledging the dilutive effect of the Fundraising for those Shareholders who have not participated in its pro rata to their current shareholdings,"" Revolution said.

7.15am: FTSE losing streak to continue

The FTSE 100 is expected to continue its losing run for a fifth day on Tuesday, with the long weekend rest not expected to provide a boost.

Spread-betters are calling the index 12 points lower, having finished last week at 8317.59, losing 1.2% over the five days.

It was a public holiday in both the US and the UK yesterday, but Asian markets were generally positive.

This morning equities in Asia are looking subdued, with mixed moves either side of the flatline.

Sad news from US operating oil developer TomCo Energy, which has announced the sudden death of John Potter, its CEO, at the age of 54.

He passed away suddenly on Friday, according to the company, which he had led for six years.

TomCo said non-execs Malcolm Groat, Louis Castro and Zac Phillips, will take interim responsibility for operations.

Chairman Groat said: ""All of us in and around TomCo, all who knew John, are deeply shocked and saddened by his sudden death. His hard work, dedication and good humour will be sorely missed. Our job, collectively, is to fulfil John's plans for TomCo.""

9.44am: Water companies leaking

Reports that the regulator will refuse water companies' requests for big customer bill hikes is hitting shares in United Utilities Group PLC (LSE:UU.), Severn Trent PLC (LSE:SVT) and Pennon Group PLC (LSE:PNN, OTC:PEGRY), which owns South West Water and Bristol Water.

Some water companies have applied to raise consumer bills over 90% and others between 60% and 30% as they look to invest in improvements to the network while also keeping up dividends for their shareholders.

Watchdog Ofwat is poised to turn down these pricing proposals, the Guardian is reporting, with some water companies getting half of what they requested.

The draft determination from Ofwat is due on 11 July, which will decide pricing and investment levels for the next five years.

8.56am: AstraZeneca drug update drags

The FTSE 100 is now sliding lower, with the post-long weekend good mood seeming to be fleeting.

There seem to be slightly more stocks in green (55) than red (45), with one flat, but most of the larger names are lower, with only four of the top 15 in green.

A notable faller is one of the largest, AstraZeneca down 1.6%.

An announcement from the drug giant this morning revealed that survival rates from datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato-DXd), which it is developing with Daiichi Sankyo, were ""numerically favoured... but did not reach statistical significance"".

8.48am: Pay revolution?

Shareholder revolts against director pay and bonuses have quietened down, data from the Investment Association suggests.

The number of companies hit by major investor pushback on pay fell 80% during the AGM season, it found, with only five meetings so far this year seeing more than 20% of investors voting against remuneration plans.

These were Hunting, Pearson, STV Group, Clarkson and Synthomer (LSE:SYNT).

Investors disapproved of the pay deals at 25 companies over the same period in 2023, the IA noted.

8.27am: Footsie flip-flop

Now the Footsie is down into the red, a familiar place in recent days, down just three points though.

The FTSE 250 is higher, however, up 25 points at 20,795. Defence technology outfit QinetiQ Group PLC (LSE:QQ.) and transport company FirstGroup are top of the mid-cap list.

Great Portland Estates (LSE:GPOR) PLC is down 16% after putting out further details following its rights issue announced last week.

There's been some macroeconomic data this morning, from the British Retail Consortium, with further evidence of easing inflation.

The retail trade body found that shop price annual inflation softened to 0.6% in May, down from 0.8% in April and the lowest since November 2021.

Non-food moved further into deflation at 0.8%, from 0.6% deflation last month and the lowest since October 2021.

If you want to know who really controls National Grid plc (LON:NG.), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 79% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.

And institutional investors saw their holdings value drop by 21% last week. The recent loss, which adds to a one-year loss of 6.3% for stockholders, may not sit well with this group of investors. Often called ""market movers"", institutions wield significant power in influencing the price dynamics of any stock. Hence, if weakness in National Grid's share price continues, institutional investors may feel compelled to sell the stock, which might not be ideal for individual investors.

Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about National Grid.

See our latest analysis for National Grid

Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.

As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in National Grid. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at National Grid's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.

Investors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in National Grid. The company's largest shareholder is BlackRock, Inc., with ownership of 8.4%. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 5.0% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 2.8% by the third-largest shareholder.

A deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.

While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.

While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.

I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.

Our information suggests that National Grid plc insiders own under 1% of the company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own UK£18m worth of shares (at current prices). Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling.

The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 20% stake in National Grid. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.

It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand National Grid better, we need to consider many other factors. Case in point: We've spotted 3 warning signs for National Grid you should be aware of, and 2 of them are concerning.

And it's in stark contrast to the funding approach taken by Britain's struggling water companies.

Both industries need huge spending to fix and maintain existing infrastructure, while building more to meet future demand. Both are regulated in similar ways and must balance demands from investors for competitive returns with keeping customer bills in check. They usually raise debt and equity to fund projects.

Yet companies such as Thames Water Ltd. have come unstuck by amassing debt without the equity needed to keep the balance sheet stable. Now, Thames is struggling to get the investment it needs to keep operating.

National Grid on Thursday announced plans to raise £6.8 billion ($8.6 billion) of capital to underpin a £60 billion spending program. The utility will continue to issue senior debt and use hybrid debt to ""maintain balance-sheet strength,"" it said. Gearing, a key metric of a firm's stability, will drop to the low 60% range.

That compares with gearing of 79.5% for Thames, one of the highest levels in the sector. It has £16 billion of debt and has lost the backing of shareholders. The company is currently running down its cash pile as it strives to avoid being put into special administration, a form of temporary nationalization.

National Grid is ""a clear contrast to the water sector, which arguably faces more urgent funding needs but where investors are more reluctant to inject equity"" and there's less scope for disposals, said Paul Vickars, a senior credit analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. That leaves credit quality ""looking increasingly stretched.""

Water regulator Ofwat has tightened the screws on shareholder payouts, while returns for electricity networks have also been trimmed in recent years to ensure consumers get value for money.

Grid investors have remained on board. Yet Thames shareholders, critical of years of poor management and regulatory conditions they deem too harsh, have shown they're prepared to walk away.",bnnbloomberg.ca,news,BNN,,-0.2,454228971,1,http://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/polopoly_fs/1.2077009!/fileimage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/the-national-grid-plc-rayleigh-electricity-substation-near-rayleigh-uk-on-wednesday-aug-23-2023-the-energy-price-cap-level-set-by-regulator-ofgem-is-expected-to-ease-slightly-from-october-but-to-rise-again-in-january-according-to-estimates-from-cornwall-insights-photographer-chris-ratcliffe-bloomberg.jpg,

In connection with the Rights Issue, the Underwriters and any of their respective affiliates may, in accordance with applicable legal and regulatory provisions, take up a portion of the Nil Paid Rights, the Fully Paid Rights and the New Shares in the Rights Issue as a principal position and in that capacity may retain, purchase, sell, offer to sell or otherwise deal for their own account in securities of the Company and related or other securities and instruments (including Nil Paid Rights, Fully Paid Rights and New Shares) and may offer or sell such securities otherwise than in connection with the Rights Issue (including through coordinated action to dispose of any New Shares which they are required to subscribe for as underwriters), provided that the Underwriters and their respective affiliates may not engage in short selling for the purpose of hedging their commitments under the Underwriting Agreement (subject to certain exceptions contained in the Underwriting Agreement). Accordingly, references in the Prospectus to Nil Paid Rights, Fully Paid Rights and New Shares being offered or placed should be read as including any offering or placement of Nil Paid Rights, Fully Paid Rights and New Shares to either of the Underwriters or any of their respective affiliates acting in such capacity. In addition, certain of the Underwriters or their affiliates may enter into financing arrangements (including margin loans) with investors in connection with which such Underwriters (or their affiliates) may from time to time acquire, hold or dispose of Nil Paid Rights, Fully Paid Rights and New Shares.

Each Canadian investor who exercises its Nil Paid Rights or Fully Paid Rights and/or purchases New Shares will be deemed to have represented to the Company, the Underwriters and to each dealer from whom a purchase confirmation is received, as applicable, that the investor (i) is purchasing as principal, or is deemed to be purchasing as principal in accordance with applicable Canadian securities laws, for investment only and not with a view to resale or redistribution; (ii) is an ""accredited investor"" as such term is defined in section 1.1 of National Instrument 45-106 Prospectus Exemptions (""NI 45-106"") or, in Ontario, as such term is defined in section 73.3(1) of the Securities Act (Ontario); and (iii) is a ""permitted client"" as such term is defined in section 1.1 of National Instrument 31-103 Registration Requirements, Exemptions and Ongoing Registrant Obligations. If you are an ""accredited investor"" and a ""permitted client"", in order to exercise your Nil Paid Rights or Fully Paid Rights and/or acquire any New Shares upon exercise thereof, you must sign and deliver an investor letter.

Solely for the purposes of the product governance requirements of Chapter 3 of the FCA Handbook Product Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook (the ""UK Product Governance Rules""), and disclaiming all and any liability, whether arising in tort, contract or otherwise, which any ""manufacturer"" (for the purposes of the UK Product Governance Rules) may otherwise have with respect thereto, the Nil Paid Rights, the Fully Paid Rights and the New Shares have been subject to a product approval process which has determined that each are: (i) compatible with an end target market of retail investors and investors who meet the criteria of professional clients and eligible counterparties, each as defined in Chapter 3 of the FCA Handbook Conduct of Business Sourcebook; and (ii) eligible for distribution through all permitted distribution channels (the ""UK Target Market Assessment""). Notwithstanding the UK Target Market Assessment, ""distributors"" (for the purposes of the UK Product Governance Requirements) should note that: the price of the Nil Paid Rights, the Fully Paid Rights and/or the New Shares may decline and investors could lose all or part of their investment; the Nil Paid Rights, the Fully Paid Rights and/or the New Shares offer no guaranteed income and no capital protection; and an investment in the Nil Paid Rights, the Fully Paid Rights and/or the New Shares is compatible only with investors who do not need a guaranteed income or capital protection, who (either alone or in conjunction with an appropriate financial or other adviser) are capable of evaluating the merits and risks of such an investment and who have sufficient resources to be able to bear any losses that may result therefrom. The UK Target Market Assessment is without prejudice to any contractual, legal or regulatory selling restrictions in relation to the Rights Issue. Furthermore, it is noted that, notwithstanding the UK Target Market Assessment, the Underwriters will only procure investors who meet the criteria of professional clients and eligible counterparties.

For the avoidance of doubt, the UK Target Market Assessment does not constitute: (i) an assessment of suitability or appropriateness for the purposes of Chapters 9A or 10A, respectively, of the FCA Handbook Conduct of Business Sourcebook; or (ii) a recommendation to any investor or group of investors to invest in, or purchase, or take any other action whatsoever with respect to, the Nil Paid Rights, the Fully Paid Rights and/or the New Shares.

Each distributor is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Nil Paid Rights, the Fully Paid Rights and/or the New Shares and determining appropriate distribution channels.

This announcement contains certain statements that are neither reported financial results nor other historical information. These statements are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These statements include information with respect to National Grid's (the Company) financial condition, its results of operations and businesses, strategy, plans and objectives. Words such as 'aims', 'anticipates', 'expects', 'should', 'intends', 'plans', 'believes', 'outlook', 'seeks', 'estimates', 'targets', 'may', 'will', 'continue', 'project' and similar expressions, as well as statements in the future tense, identify forward-looking statements. This document also references climate-related targets and climate-related risks which differ from conventional financial risks in that they are complex, novel and tend to involve projection over long term scenarios which are subject to significant uncertainty and change. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of National Grid's future performance and are subject to assumptions, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by such forward-looking statements or targets. Many of these assumptions, risks and uncertainties relate to factors that are beyond National Grid's ability to control, predict or estimate precisely, such as changes in laws or regulations and decisions by governmental bodies or regulators, including those relating to current and upcoming price controls in the UK and rate cases in the US, as well as the future of system operation in the UK; the timing of construction and delivery by third parties of new generation projects requiring connection; breaches of, or changes in, environmental, climate change and health and safety laws or regulations, including breaches or other incidents arising from the potentially harmful nature of its activities; network failure or interruption, the inability to carry out critical non-network operations and damage to infrastructure, due to adverse weather conditions including the impact of major storms as well as the results of climate change, due to counterparties being unable to deliver physical commodities; reliability of and access to IT systems, including or due to the failure of or unauthorised access to or deliberate breaches of National Grid's systems and supporting technology; failure to adequately forecast and respond to disruptions in energy supply; performance against regulatory targets and standards and against National Grid's peers with the aim of delivering stakeholder expectations regarding costs and efficiency savings, as well as against targets and standards designed to support its role in the energy transition; and customers and counterparties (including financial institutions) failing to perform their obligations to the Company. Other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in this announcement include fluctuations in exchange rates, interest rates and commodity price indices; restrictions and conditions (including filing requirements) in National Grid's borrowing and debt arrangements, funding costs and access to financing; regulatory requirements for the Company to maintain financial resources in certain parts of its business and restrictions on some subsidiaries' transactions such as paying dividends, lending or levying charges; the delayed timing of recoveries and payments in National Grid's regulated businesses, and whether aspects of its activities are contestable; the funding requirements and performance of National Grid's pension schemes and other post-retirement benefit schemes; the failure to attract, develop and retain employees with the necessary competencies, including leadership and business capabilities, and any significant disputes arising with National Grid's employees or breaches of laws or regulations by its employees; the failure to respond to market developments, including competition for onshore transmission; the threats and opportunities presented by emerging technology; the failure by the Company to respond to, or meet its own commitments as a leader in relation to, climate change development activities relating to energy transition, including the integration of distributed energy resources; and the need to grow the Company's business to deliver its strategy, as well as incorrect or unforeseen assumptions or conclusions (including unanticipated costs and liabilities) relating to business development activity, including the sale of a stake in its UK Gas Transmission and Metering business, its strategic infrastructure projects and joint ventures and the separation and transfer of the ESO to the public sector.

National Grid plc NGG shares are trading lower after the company reported an equity raise of £7 billion and a year-over-year decrease in full-year revenue results.

In its 2023/24 full-year, adjusted EPS increased 32% year over year to £0.84, and gross revenue declined 8% year over year to £19.850 billion.

Underlying operating profit rose 4% Y/Y to £4.8 billion (+6% Y/Y at constant currency), aided by growth in revenues in UK Electricity Transmission through the RIIO-T2 price control, non-recurrence of Western Link liquidated damages, and higher rates in New York and New England.

Dividend: The company disclosed a final dividend of 39.12 pence, bringing the full-year dividend to 58.52 pence, up 5.55% and in line with policy.

Outlook: For 2024/25, the company expects underlying EPS to be broadly in line with 2023/24 EPS once this has been adjusted by the number of bonus shares issued as part of the rights issue.

Investment: The company plans to invest £60 billion (around $75 billion) in the U.S. and U.K. over the next five years.

In New York, National Grid is investing around $21 billion between now and 2029, per the company's statement.

The investment is expected to deliver annual group asset growth of around 10%, and 6%-8% underlying EPS CAGR from a 2024/25 baseline to 2028/29, assuming an exchange rate of £1:$1.25.

This is projected to be led by a comprehensive financing plan that includes a £7 billion equity raise.

John Pettigrew, Chief Executive, said, ""Alongside our new five-year financial framework, we are also today further evolving our strategy to focus on networks and will therefore be streamlining our business as we announce our intention to sell Grain LNG, our UK LNG asset, and National Grid Renewables, our US onshore renewables business.""

A total of 1.09 billion new shares will be issued at a price of 645 pence per share on the basis of seven new shares for every 24 existing shares, National Grid said in a statement.

It is the largest rights issue in the U.K. since 2009, and the biggest in Europe since 2021. National Grid previously unveiled a rights issue in 2010, Reuters reported, citing a company spokesperson.

The move was announced a day after U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak called a July 4 national election, although executives at National Grid told reporters they do see any ""material impact"" from a possible change in government, according to Reuters.

Proceeds from the rights issue will mostly be used to fund a ""higher-growth investment phase,"" the company said, adding that it gives the it the ""appropriate financial flexibility"" in a planned 5-year push to overhaul its energy network.

""[W]e are confident that we can deliver this step-up in new infrastructure that will provide greater levels of energy security and enable diversification of energy sources to help decarbonise the economies we serve,"" National Grid said.

Analysts at RBC Capital Markets argued that investors would likely be ""surprised"" by both the size and the timing of the fundraising drive. However, they predicted that any initial negative reaction to the news ""should remove an overhang"" on the stock going forward.

Royal Mail owner International Distributions Services PLC (LSE:IDS) has confirmed that publication of its financial results has been delayed due to auditors asking for more time, which has historically been a worrying sign for investors.

With no new expected date for publication offered, the shares dropped 2% to 321p on the announcement.

Results had been planned to be published this morning.

Auditor KPMG has ""requested additional time to complete the usual standard procedures after their internal reviews were late in the audit timetable, thereby delaying their final audit process"".

Office wags suggested that perhaps some important documents had been sent by Royal Mail and this had been the reason for the delay.

The IDS board said it still expects profits adjusted operating profit ""broadly in line"" with previously published guidance, with the word 'broadly' also generally understood to be code for 'a bit lower'.

1pm: Big bet on the Tories

Although the FTSE is not offering huge excitement today, political betting markets have been active.

Bookmaker Star Sports says a punter has waded in with a five-figure bet on a Conservative majority in the July election.

A £30,000 bet was placed on a Tory Majority at odds of 25/1, following Rishi Sunak's announcement of a snap election on 4 July.

The bet defies the current polls, which currently predict a large Labour majority.

Star said the odds of a Conservative majority at the general election shortened from 33/1 to 25/1 following Sunak's announcement.

William Kedjanyi, the bookie's political betting analyst, said: ""Sunak's decision to call a snap election in July has clearly filled one punter with buckets of confidence in his party, who has placed a massive bet with us at 25/1. This would return £750,000 should the Conservatives achieve a majority.""

He said after the punchy bet Star has sliced the odds further into 20/1.

""Despite drifting from 1/12, Labour remain the odds-on favourites at 1/8 for a majority vote in July, with a fair amount of support coming in for there to be no majority at all at 11/2 from 15/2,"" Kedjani said.

12.21pm: No delivery of Royal Mail results?

The owner of Royal Mail, International Distributions Services PLC (LSE:IDS), has not published final results that were scheduled for this morning (and still confirmed on its investor relations page this afternoon).

A week after the company's board said it was ""minded"" to agree to a £3.5 billion bid from Czech billionaire Daniel 'the Czech Sphinx' Kretinsky, IDS was due to publish its full-year numbers results at 7am this morning.

Kretinsky's EP Group proposed a bid on May 15.

12.02pm: Read across from HL to AJB

Even if another offer for Hargreaves Lansdown does not come, news of private equity interest ""is likely to lead to positive share price read across to AJ Bell and other investment platforms, and sustained support for share prices"", says UBS analyst Haley Tam.

""The private equity action could be seen as confirmation that further FCA consumer duty actions in this space are less likely.""

What's more, Tam says private equity interest in this sector ""could raise expectations of potential consolidation and/or other M&A activity in the space"".

Banks and insurers could also see UK investment platforms as ""attractive"", the analyst adds, offering revenue diversity and boosting returns on invested capital.

""With UK assets widely perceived as inexpensive, the sector could also be attractive to an overseas platform with potential synergy benefits,"" she concludes.

11.56am: HL bid price 'opportunistic'

Some broker comments on the HL offer.

""Too cheap, still,"" says Panmure's Michael Caine fan Rae Maile (see below).

""The approach by private equity for Hargreaves echoes the broader trend across the UK market of low valuations being exploited by investors with the freedom to take a longer view.""

He calls the approach ""opportunistic and pitched at a level which would be a steal for the putative bidders"".

A key question for investors, says UBS analyst Haley Tam, ""is whether a further, higher offer will be forthcoming"".

She does not explicitly state whether she thinks another bid is likely but outlines key factors such as Nordic Capital's experience in this sector, having previously took digital bank Nordnet private in 2016, the necessity of significant shareholder support and HL being midway through its own investment plan.

The 985p offer price is equivalent to 15.3 times 2026 forecast consensus underlying earnings and 15.2 times the 2027 consensus.

""In a hypothetical situation where HL cut platform and stock trading pricing to competitive levels, we estimate the immediate EPS impact could be as much as 25-50%. The potential for longer term upside from a return to market share gain could justify this short term downside to earnings,"" Tam says.

11.29am: Oilers lift Footsie, utilities drag

Helping the Footsie's recovery in the latter part of the morning has been oil prices rebounding from yesterday's three-month lows.

Brent crude futures are up 0.77% to $82.53 per barrel.

Shell PLC (LSE:SHEL, NYSE:SHEL) and BP PLC (LSE:BP.) are both up 0.6%, with all but one of the blue-chip index's top 10 in the green.

Top risers in the index are St James's Place, Persimmon, Rolls-Royce, BAE Systems and Scottish Mortgage.

National Grid is the biggest faller, down almost 10% after announcing plans for a £7 billion rights issue at a big discount.

Market analyst Victoria Scholar at ii points out that this wipes out all of its year-to-date gains, landing the stock in the red now so far this year.

Other utilities are also under pressure, with United Utilities and Severn Trent both down 4.5%.

Other former state-owned companies are down too, potentially connected to the election announcement.

BT Group PLC (LSE:BT.A) is down 2.8% and Centrica PLC is down 1.8% among the blue chips, while among the mid-caps Drax Group (LSE:DRX) PLC is down 8.6%, Pennon Group PLC 5.3% lower.

11.13am: AJ Bell blows the doors off

In a note entitled ""In the words of Charlie Croker"" - the character played by Michael Caine in The Italian Job - Panmure Gordon analyst Rae Maile gave his thoughts on AJ Bell's half-year numbers.

""Interim results are so far ahead of estimates that we made a moment of thinking that we were looking at the wrong company,"" the analyst chirps.

PBT of £61.4 million compared with Panmure's estimate of £48.9 million that were towards the top end of expectations, while revenue was also ahead of estimates and costs were lower.

""In the words of Charlie Croker ... We expected a decent set of results, the outcome more than blew the doors off.""

11.10am: PMI data doesn't change much

There was not much of a reaction to the UK PMI data earlier, says market analyst Kathleen Brooks at XTB, though the FTSE 100 and 250 are both in positive territory now.

She notes that GBP/USD fell to $1.27 on the news, but is now recovering. ""Stocks are moving in unison after Nvidia results boosted overall market sentiment. Global sovereign bonds are mostly rallying, the UK is seeing bond yields fall back slightly after Wednesday's big surge higher after the stronger than expected CPI print for April.""

As the PMIs are often volatile from month-to-month, economist Peter Arnold of the EY ITEM Club said the strength of last month's balance ""did look like an outlier compared with other indicators"", so he ""does not see May's softer outturn as being problematic"".

""Indeed, it is consistent with GDP continuing to grow at a solid pace in Q2, and the recovery becoming more firmly entrenched.""

One interesting point, Arnold says, is on inflation, with input cost inflation the weakest in seven months and output prices at their slowest growth in over three years.

""Following on the back of yesterday's large upside surprise for services inflation, these results offer some cause to hope that the official data will cool in the months ahead,"" he says.

""But the chances of a June rate cut look very low after yesterday's data, and softer survey data is unlikely to do much to change that.""

10.43am: Rio Tinto should drop UK listing

An activist investor has called for Rio Tinto PLC to give up its primary London quote and therefore also its FTSE 100 listing, like rival BHP did three years ago.

London-based Palliser Capital, which has built up less than a 1% stake, has argued Rio's dual Anglo-Aussie corporate structure made it difficult to pull off big acquisitions, the Financial Times reported.

It reckons Rio is trading at a $27 billion discount, or so it told a Sohn Hong Kong investment conference on Thursday.

Palliser's chief investment officer James Smith, who is reported to have been in contact with management about its dual listing, said he believed there was upside of ""nearly 40 per cent"" in Rio's shares.

9.59am: PMI services weaker

The UK's services sector has seen some cooling this month, according to the preliminary 'flash' PMI survey from S&P Global, though manufacturing is rebounding.

The composite purchasing managers' index fell to 52.8 midway through May from 54.1 in April, taking the balance back to the level seen in March.

This was caused by a fall in the services PMI to 52.9 from 55.0 as growth in new orders cools.

On the flip side, the manufacturing PMI rebounded back into positive territory at 51.3 from 49.1 in April.

Another interesting development in May's flash survey was the weakness in the costs and prices balances, with input cost inflation the weakest in seven months, while output prices rose at their slowest pace since February 2021, with the service sector being the source of weakness in both sectors.

9.51am: Tate & Lyle climbs on Primient sale

Tate & Lyle PLC (LSE:TATE) climbed on Thursday morning after unveiling stronger profit for last year and the sale of its remaining stake in Primient.

Pre-tax profit climbed 18% to £287 million in the year to March, the food and beverage firm said on Thursday, despite a 2% fall in revenue to £1.65 billion on softer demand.

Tate & Lyle also announced the sale of its remaining 49.7% stake in ingredients producer Primient for US$350 million (£275 million).

""The sale of our remaining stake in Primient represents an important milestone for our business,"" chief executive Nick Hampton said.

""With this sale, the transformation of Tate & Lyle into a fully-focused speciality food and beverage solutions business is complete.""

Shares climbed 4.7% to 708.50p.

9.19am: National Grid slumps on £7bn rights issue

National Grid PLC (LSE:NG.) fell almost 9% after unveiling plans for a rights issue alongside its full-year results, raising £7 billion.

The 645p price will raise funds for a £60 billion energy infrastructure investment plan.

""The board unanimously believes this comprehensive financing plan will allow the group to fund a significant increase in capital investment, maintain its strong investment grade credit rating, deliver for customers, and continue to achieve attractive shareholders returns,"" National Grid said.

News of the plan sent shares down 8.7% to 1,030p in early trading.

""Understandably, this and the dilution effect of the rights issue have led their share price to plunge, eToro analyst Adam Vettese said.

National Grid was ""ordinarily a steady-eddie defensive stock,"" he added.

National Grid also reported that pre-tax profit slipped 15% to just over £3 billion, while per-share earnings fell 19% to 60p.

8.40am: Platforms in demand

Hargreaves rival AJ Bell PLC (LSE:AJB) is topping the FTSE 350 risers, up 10% after its half-year results impressed and it got a read-across boost from the sector bid interest.

Revenue rose 27% and pre-tax profit 47% as the platform steadily increased its share of the investing platform market, having passed the half-a-million customers mark in April.

A 21% interim dividend increase was also announced, with the mid cap also announcing a review of its capital-allocation policy toward a ""progressive"" policy.

The wider FTSE 250 is up 16 points while the FTSE 100 continues to sink, down 18 points or 0.22% now.

8.33am: Top risers

Let's brighten up the day for investors by looking at the blue-chip leaderboard.

One of the top risers is

Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust PLC (LSE:SMT), which is getting a double benefit today, as its results showed a return to positive growth and one of its big shareholdings, Nvidia, is due to heading higher today.

The return to growth followed two consecutive years of negative returns, with net asset value of its portfolio holdings increasing 11.5%, which was principally thanks to the trust's two largest investments - chip sector giants Nvidia and ASML - benefitting from the AI boom.

The index's other big investment trusts are also in the green, F&C Investment Trust PLC (LSE:FCIT) and 3i Group PLC, up just under 1%.

Top of the list though, is St James's Place PLC, with many other financial sector names prominent in the leaderboard on the back of the Hargreaves Lansdown bid interest, even though it seems a bit of a lowball offer.

St James's is up 4.9%, Schroders PLC 1.2% and Barclays PLC, Prudential PLC (LSE:PRU), HSBC Holdings PLC all around 0.8%

Marks & Spencer Group PLC is continuing to rise as its numbers from yesterday are further chewed over.

8.15am: FTSE 100 falls again

The FTSE 100 climbed a few points higher in initial trades but has quickly resumed its familiar pattern from recent days by squelching into the red.

After a quarter of an hour, the blue-chip index was down 10 points at 8360.

Four blue-chips stocks going ex-dividend is knocking 1.84 points off the total, those being Imperial Brands, Whitbread, Diploma and DCC.

Rolls-Royce is one of the fallers, down 1% after its first-quarter update.

Aviva is down 0.1% after its own. Both companies kept their outlook unchanged for the year.

8am: Not-West?

Rishi Sunak's calling of a general election for the first Thursday in July is likely to derail the government's retail sale of NatWest Group PLC (LSE:NWG).

The multibillion-pound sale to private investors had been a key plan of Chancellor Jeremy Hunt, which he confirmed in the Budget in March.

Treasury officials have told various media that those plans have now been paused, with one source telling Sky News that the plans have been put ""in the deep freeze"".

7.57am: Aviva hails 'excellent' start

Likewise, Aviva PLC (LSE:AV.) has also reported a strong start and kept its full-year outlook unchanged.

General insurance premiums increased 16% to £2.7bn and workplace pensions business generated net flows of £2bn as 136 new schemes were won.

In the bulk purchase annuity market, retirement sales were up 13%. A solvency shareholder cover ratio of 206% was above some analyst forecasts.

The life insurer's boss Amanda Blanc felt the first-quarter numbers were ""excellent"" and said the group was in ""great health"".

""We have clear competitive advantages - in our brand, our scale, and our diverse business - which are driving consistently strong performance, and giving us real optimism about 2024,"" she said.

7.39am: Rolls-Royce has 'strong start'

Rolls-Royce Holdings PLC (LSE:RR.) chief executive Tufan Erginbilgic said the engine maker made a ""strong start"" in the first four months of 2024 and maintained guidance for the full year.

In the FTSE 100-listed group's civil aerospace arm, the keenly watched long-term service agreement large engine flying hours (EFH) figure was said to have returned to 100% of the levels from pre-pandemic 2019.

This was lower than some more optimistic analysts expected.

A key driver was the continued recovery of international air traffic in Asia and the growing fleet of aeroplanes that have RR engines installed.

For the full year, Erginbilgic said expectations for large EFH at 100%-110% of 2019 levels, 1,300-1,400 shop visits and 500-550 OE deliveries are all unchanged.

He said Rolls remains ""on track"" to deliver the annualised cost reduction of £200 million by the end of next year, with redundancy consultations ""advanced"".

7.24am: Hargreaves Lansdown rejects offer

The board of Hargreaves Lansdown PLC (LSE:HL.) has rejected a bid from a consortium of private equity and the Abu Dhabi investment fund.

A price of 985p per share was the latest of two approaches from the consortium made up of CVC Advisers, Nordic Capital, SCSP and Platinum Ivy (a subsidiary of Abu Dhabi Investment Authority), which issued a statement after markets closed yesterday.

Hargreaves shares finished yesterday at 979p, after a late spike as speculation about a bid filtered through, having started the day at 931p.

""The board confirms that it unanimously rejected the Proposal on the basis it substantially undervalues Hargreaves Lansdown and its future prospects,"" a statement this morning says, adding that it will update the market at the full year results on 9 August.

7.16am: FTSE 100 to inch higher

After a two-day pullback, the FTSE 100 is predicted to hold its ground on Thursday, after confirmation that a general election is coming in six weeks.

In fact, spread-betters have called the blue-chip index four points higher, following a day when it lost 46 points to close just above 8370.

Overnight, the major US stock indices finished in the red but NVIDIA jumped 6% after the closing bell as its earnings continued to roar higher and beat Wall Street estimates.

The Dow Jones finished 0.5% lower, the S&P 500 down 0.3%, the Nasdaq Composite 0.2% and the small cap Russell 2000 dropped 0.8%.

""Markets had an eventful day yesterday, with various headlines that drove swings in both directions. As we go to press this morning, sentiment has turned more positive,"" says macro strategist Henry Allen at Deutsche Bank, pointing to futures on the S&P 500 up 0.65% following an upbeat outlook from Nvidia.

He said markets lost ground earlier in the day after the minutes of the latest Fed meeting were ""on the hawkish side"", while bonds sold off after UK inflation surprised on the upside to serve ""as a reminder that the path back to target may not be a smooth one, and led investors to dial back the chance of rate cuts across Europe"".

Market analyst Ipek Ozkardeskaya at Swissquote Bank said the UK election news combined with the inflation print washed out the expectation of a June rate cut from the Bank of England and lifted the pound, which hit the FTSE.

""Consequently, Cable is pushing higher above the 1.27 level right now, but the upside potential will likely remain capped as - if nothing - the uncertainty surrounding the UK general election will most probably tame appetite for sterling in the next six weeks,"" she said.",proactiveinvestors.co.uk,news,Proactiveinvestors UK,Oliver Haill,-0.0117647058823529,454165870,1,https://cdn.proactiveinvestors.com/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJwYS1jZG4iLCJrZXkiOiJ1cGxvYWRcL05ld3NcL0ltYWdlXC8yMDI0XzA1XC8yMDI0LTA1LTIzLTEyLTExLTMxLWZjOTU5YWM1ZmE0NjJiMzlkYWUwMGE1NTAyNTllM2EzLmpwZyIsImVkaXRzIjp7InJlc2l6ZSI6eyJ3aWR0aCI6MTIwMCwiaGVpZ2h0Ijo2MzAsImZpdCI6ImNvdmVyIn19fQ==,

Barclays Bank PLC (""Barclays"") and J.P. Morgan Securities plc (which conducts its UK investment banking activities under the marketing name J.P. Morgan Cazenove) (""J.P. Morgan"") (together, the ""Banks"" or the ""Underwriters"") are each authorised by the Prudential Regulation Authority (""PRA"") and regulated in the United Kingdom by the FCA and the PRA. The Banks are acting exclusively for the Company and acting for no one else in connection with the Rights Issue. They will not regard any other person as a client in relation to the Rights Issue and will not be responsible to anyone other than the Company for providing the protections afforded to their respective clients, nor for providing advice in connection with the Rights Issue or any other matter, transaction or arrangement referred to in this announcement.

Robey Warshaw LLP (the ""Financial Adviser""), which is authorised and regulated by the FCA in the UK, is acting exclusively as financial adviser to the Company and no one else in connection with the matters described in this announcement and will not be responsible to anyone other than the Company for providing the protections afforded to clients of the Financial Adviser nor for providing advice in connection with the matters referred to herein.

Neither of the Underwriters nor the Financial Adviser, nor any of their respective subsidiaries, branches or affiliates, nor any of their respective directors, officers or employees accepts any responsibility or liability whatsoever for the contents of this announcement, (or whether any information has been omitted from the announcement), or makes any representation or warranty, express or implied, as to its accuracy, completeness or verification or for any other statement made or purported to be made by it, or on its behalf, in connection with the Company, the Nil Paid Rights, the Fully Paid Rights, the Provisional Allotment Letter, the New Shares or the Rights Issue, whether written, oral or in a visual or electronic form, and howsoever transmitted or made available, or for any loss arising from any use of this announcement or its contents or otherwise arising in connection therewith. Subject to applicable law, each of the Underwriters and the Financial Adviser accordingly disclaims all and any liability whether arising in tort, contract or otherwise (save as referred to above) which it might otherwise have in respect of this announcement or any such statement. Neither of the Underwriters nor the Financial Adviser, nor any of their respective subsidiaries, branches or affiliates, nor any of their respective directors, officers or employees owes or accepts any duty, liability or responsibility whatsoever (whether direct or indirect, whether in contract, in tort, under statute or otherwise) to any person who is not a client of the Underwriters or the Financial Adviser (as applicable) in connection with the Rights Issue, this announcement, any statement contained herein, or otherwise.

In connection with the Rights Issue, the Underwriters and any of their respective affiliates may, in accordance with applicable legal and regulatory provisions, take up a portion of the Nil Paid Rights, the Fully Paid Rights and the New Shares in the Rights Issue as a principal position and in that capacity may retain, purchase, sell, offer to sell or otherwise deal for their own account in securities of the Company and related or other securities and instruments (including Nil Paid Rights, Fully Paid Rights and New Shares) and may offer or sell such securities otherwise than in connection with the Rights Issue (including through coordinated action to dispose of any New Shares which they are required to subscribe for as underwriters), provided that the Underwriters and their respective affiliates may not engage in short selling for the purpose of hedging their commitments under the Underwriting Agreement (subject to certain exceptions contained in the Underwriting Agreement). Accordingly, references in the Prospectus to Nil Paid Rights, Fully Paid Rights and New Shares being offered or placed should be read as including any offering or placement of Nil Paid Rights, Fully Paid Rights and New Shares to either of the Underwriters or any of their respective affiliates acting in such capacity. In addition, certain of the Underwriters or their affiliates may enter into financing arrangements (including margin loans) with investors in connection with which such Underwriters (or their affiliates) may from time to time acquire, hold or dispose of Nil Paid Rights, Fully Paid Rights and New Shares. Except as required by applicable law or regulation, the Underwriters do not propose to make any public disclosure in relation to such transactions.

The offer and sale of the Nil Paid Rights, Fully Paid Rights and/or New Shares in Canada is being made on a private placement basis only and is exempt from the requirement that National Grid prepares and files a prospectus under applicable Canadian securities laws. Any resale of Nil Paid Rights, Fully Paid Rights and/or New Shares acquired by a Canadian investor in this offering must be made in accordance with applicable Canadian securities laws, which may impose restrictions, under certain circumstances, to resales of the Nil Paid Rights, Fully Paid Rights and/or New Shares outside of Canada.

Each Canadian investor who exercises its Nil Paid Rights or Fully Paid Rights and/or purchases New Shares will be deemed to have represented to the Company, the Underwriters and to each dealer from whom a purchase confirmation is received, as applicable, that the investor (i) is purchasing as principal, or is deemed to be purchasing as principal in accordance with applicable Canadian securities laws, for investment only and not with a view to resale or redistribution; (ii) is an ""accredited investor"" as such term is defined in section 1.1 of National Instrument 45-106 Prospectus Exemptions (""NI 45-106"") or, in Ontario, as such term is defined in section 73.3(1) of the Securities Act (Ontario); and (iii) is a ""permitted client"" as such term is defined in section 1.1 of National Instrument 31-103 Registration Requirements, Exemptions and Ongoing Registrant Obligations. If you are an ""accredited investor"" and a ""permitted client"", in order to exercise your Nil Paid Rights or Fully Paid Rights and/or acquire any New Shares upon exercise thereof, you must sign and deliver an investor letter.

Solely for the purposes of the product governance requirements of Chapter 3 of the FCA Handbook Product Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook (the ""UK Product Governance Rules""), and disclaiming all and any liability, whether arising in tort, contract or otherwise, which any ""manufacturer"" (for the purposes of the UK Product Governance Rules) may otherwise have with respect thereto, the Nil Paid Rights, the Fully Paid Rights and the New Shares have been subject to a product approval process which has determined that each are: (i) compatible with an end target market of retail investors and investors who meet the criteria of professional clients and eligible counterparties, each as defined in Chapter 3 of the FCA Handbook Conduct of Business Sourcebook; and (ii) eligible for distribution through all permitted distribution channels (the ""UK Target Market Assessment""). Notwithstanding the UK Target Market Assessment, ""distributors"" (for the purposes of the UK Product Governance Requirements) should note that: the price of the Nil Paid Rights, the Fully Paid Rights and/or the New Shares may decline and investors could lose all or part of their investment; the Nil Paid Rights, the Fully Paid Rights and/or the New Shares offer no guaranteed income and no capital protection; and an investment in the Nil Paid Rights, the Fully Paid Rights and/or the New Shares is compatible only with investors who do not need a guaranteed income or capital protection, who (either alone or in conjunction with an appropriate financial or other adviser) are capable of evaluating the merits and risks of such an investment and who have sufficient resources to be able to bear any losses that may result therefrom. The UK Target Market Assessment is without prejudice to any contractual, legal or regulatory selling restrictions in relation to the Rights Issue. Furthermore, it is noted that, notwithstanding the UK Target Market Assessment, the Underwriters will only procure investors who meet the criteria of professional clients and eligible counterparties.

For the avoidance of doubt, the UK Target Market Assessment does not constitute: (i) an assessment of suitability or appropriateness for the purposes of Chapters 9A or 10A, respectively, of the FCA Handbook Conduct of Business Sourcebook; or (ii) a recommendation to any investor or group of investors to invest in, or purchase, or take any other action whatsoever with respect to, the Nil Paid Rights, the Fully Paid Rights and/or the New Shares.

Each distributor is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Nil Paid Rights, the Fully Paid Rights and/or the New Shares and determining appropriate distribution channels.

Although the FTSE is not offering huge excitement today, political betting markets have been active.

Bookmaker Star Sports says a punter has waded in with a five-figure bet on a Conservative majority in the July election.

A £30,000 bet was placed on a Tory Majority at odds of 25/1, following Rishi Sunak's announcement of a snap election on 4 July.

The bet defies the current polls, which currently predict a large Labour majority.

Star said the odds of a Conservative majority at the general election shortened from 33/1 to 25/1 following Sunak's announcement.

William Kedjanyi, the bookie's political betting analyst, said: ""Sunak's decision to call a snap election in July has clearly filled one punter with buckets of confidence in his party, who has placed a massive bet with us at 25/1. This would return £750,000 should the Conservatives achieve a majority.""

He said after the punchy bet Star has sliced the odds further into 20/1.

""Despite drifting from 1/12, Labour remain the odds-on favourites at 1/8 for a majority vote in July, with a fair amount of support coming in for there to be no majority at all at 11/2 from 15/2,"" Kedjani said.

12.21pm: No delivery of Royal Mail results?

The owner of Royal Mail, International Distributions Services PLC (LSE:IDS), has not published final results that were scheduled for this morning (and still confirmed on its investor relations page this afternoon).

A week after the company's board said it was ""minded"" to agree to a £3.5 billion bid from Czech billionaire Daniel 'the Czech Sphinx' Kretinsky, IDS was due to publish its full-year numbers results at 7am this morning.

Kretinsky's EP Group proposed a bid on May 15.

12.02pm: Read across from HL to AJB

Even if another offer for Hargreaves Lansdown does not come, news of private equity interest ""is likely to lead to positive share price read across to AJ Bell and other investment platforms, and sustained support for share prices"", says UBS analyst Haley Tam.

""The private equity action could be seen as confirmation that further FCA consumer duty actions in this space are less likely.""

What's more, Tam says private equity interest in this sector ""could raise expectations of potential consolidation and/or other M&A activity in the space"".

Banks and insurers could also see UK investment platforms as ""attractive"", the analyst adds, offering revenue diversity and boosting returns on invested capital.

""With UK assets widely perceived as inexpensive, the sector could also be attractive to an overseas platform with potential synergy benefits,"" she concludes.

11.56am: HL bid price 'opportunistic'

Some broker comments on the HL offer.

""Too cheap, still,"" says Panmure's Michael Caine fan Rae Maile (see below).

""The approach by private equity for Hargreaves echoes the broader trend across the UK market of low valuations being exploited by investors with the freedom to take a longer view.""

He calls the approach ""opportunistic and pitched at a level which would be a steal for the putative bidders"".

A key question for investors, says UBS analyst Haley Tam, ""is whether a further, higher offer will be forthcoming"".

She does not explicitly state whether she thinks another bid is likely but outlines key factors such as Nordic Capital's experience in this sector, having previously took digital bank Nordnet private in 2016, the necessity of significant shareholder support and HL being midway through its own investment plan.

The 985p offer price is equivalent to 15.3 times 2026 forecast consensus underlying earnings and 15.2 times the 2027 consensus.

""In a hypothetical situation where HL cut platform and stock trading pricing to competitive levels, we estimate the immediate EPS impact could be as much as 25-50%. The potential for longer term upside from a return to market share gain could justify this short term downside to earnings,"" Tam says.

11.29am: Oilers lift Footsie, utilities drag

Helping the Footsie's recovery in the latter part of the morning has been oil prices rebounding from yesterday's three-month lows.

Brent crude futures are up 0.77% to $82.53 per barrel.

Shell PLC (LSE:SHEL, NYSE:SHEL) and BP PLC (LSE:BP.) are both up 0.6%, with all but one of the blue-chip index's top 10 in the green.

Top risers in the index are St James's Place, Persimmon, Rolls-Royce, BAE Systems and Scottish Mortgage.

National Grid is the biggest faller, down almost 10% after announcing plans for a £7 billion rights issue at a big discount.

Market analyst Victoria Scholar at ii points out that this wipes out all of its year-to-date gains, landing the stock in the red now so far this year.

Other utilities are also under pressure, with United Utilities and Severn Trent both down 4.5%.

Other former state-owned companies are down too, potentially connected to the election announcement.

BT Group PLC (LSE:BT.A) is down 2.8% and Centrica PLC is down 1.8% among the blue chips, while among the mid-caps Drax Group (LSE:DRX) PLC is down 8.6%, Pennon Group PLC 5.3% lower.

11.13am: AJ Bell blows the doors off

In a note entitled ""In the words of Charlie Croker"" - the character played by Michael Caine in The Italian Job - Panmure Gordon analyst Rae Maile gave his thoughts on AJ Bell's half-year numbers.

""Interim results are so far ahead of estimates that we made a moment of thinking that we were looking at the wrong company,"" the analyst chirps.

PBT of £61.4 million compared with Panmure's estimate of £48.9 million that were towards the top end of expectations, while revenue was also ahead of estimates and costs were lower.

""In the words of Charlie Croker ... We expected a decent set of results, the outcome more than blew the doors off.""

11.10am: PMI data doesn't change much

There was not much of a reaction to the UK PMI data earlier, says market analyst Kathleen Brooks at XTB, though the FTSE 100 and 250 are both in positive territory now.

She notes that GBP/USD fell to $1.27 on the news, but is now recovering. ""Stocks are moving in unison after Nvidia results boosted overall market sentiment. Global sovereign bonds are mostly rallying, the UK is seeing bond yields fall back slightly after Wednesday's big surge higher after the stronger than expected CPI print for April.""

As the PMIs are often volatile from month-to-month, economist Peter Arnold of the EY ITEM Club said the strength of last month's balance ""did look like an outlier compared with other indicators"", so he ""does not see May's softer outturn as being problematic"".

""Indeed, it is consistent with GDP continuing to grow at a solid pace in Q2, and the recovery becoming more firmly entrenched.""

One interesting point, Arnold says, is on inflation, with input cost inflation the weakest in seven months and output prices at their slowest growth in over three years.

""Following on the back of yesterday's large upside surprise for services inflation, these results offer some cause to hope that the official data will cool in the months ahead,"" he says.

""But the chances of a June rate cut look very low after yesterday's data, and softer survey data is unlikely to do much to change that.""

10.43am: Rio Tinto should drop UK listing

An activist investor has called for Rio Tinto PLC to give up its primary London quote and therefore also its FTSE 100 listing, like rival BHP did three years ago.

London-based Palliser Capital, which has built up less than a 1% stake, has argued Rio's dual Anglo-Aussie corporate structure made it difficult to pull off big acquisitions, the Financial Times reported.

It reckons Rio is trading at a $27 billion discount, or so it told a Sohn Hong Kong investment conference on Thursday.

Palliser's chief investment officer James Smith, who is reported to have been in contact with management about its dual listing, said he believed there was upside of ""nearly 40 per cent"" in Rio's shares.

9.59am: PMI services weaker

The UK's services sector has seen some cooling this month, according to the preliminary 'flash' PMI survey from S&P Global, though manufacturing is rebounding.

The composite purchasing managers' index fell to 52.8 midway through May from 54.1 in April, taking the balance back to the level seen in March.

This was caused by a fall in the services PMI to 52.9 from 55.0 as growth in new orders cools.

On the flip side, the manufacturing PMI rebounded back into positive territory at 51.3 from 49.1 in April.

Another interesting development in May's flash survey was the weakness in the costs and prices balances, with input cost inflation the weakest in seven months, while output prices rose at their slowest pace since February 2021, with the service sector being the source of weakness in both sectors.

9.51am: Tate & Lyle climbs on Primient sale

Tate & Lyle PLC (LSE:TATE) climbed on Thursday morning after unveiling stronger profit for last year and the sale of its remaining stake in Primient.

Pre-tax profit climbed 18% to £287 million in the year to March, the food and beverage firm said on Thursday, despite a 2% fall in revenue to £1.65 billion on softer demand.

Tate & Lyle also announced the sale of its remaining 49.7% stake in ingredients producer Primient for US$350 million (£275 million).

""The sale of our remaining stake in Primient represents an important milestone for our business,"" chief executive Nick Hampton said.

""With this sale, the transformation of Tate & Lyle into a fully-focused speciality food and beverage solutions business is complete.""

Shares climbed 4.7% to 708.50p.

9.19am: National Grid slumps on £7bn rights issue

National Grid PLC (LSE:NG.) fell almost 9% after unveiling plans for a rights issue alongside its full-year results, raising £7 billion.

The 645p price will raise funds for a £60 billion energy infrastructure investment plan.

""The board unanimously believes this comprehensive financing plan will allow the group to fund a significant increase in capital investment, maintain its strong investment grade credit rating, deliver for customers, and continue to achieve attractive shareholders returns,"" National Grid said.

News of the plan sent shares down 8.7% to 1,030p in early trading.

""Understandably, this and the dilution effect of the rights issue have led their share price to plunge, eToro analyst Adam Vettese said.

National Grid was ""ordinarily a steady-eddie defensive stock,"" he added.

National Grid also reported that pre-tax profit slipped 15% to just over £3 billion, while per-share earnings fell 19% to 60p.

8.40am: Platforms in demand

Hargreaves rival AJ Bell PLC (LSE:AJB) is topping the FTSE 350 risers, up 10% after its half-year results impressed and it got a read-across boost from the sector bid interest.

Revenue rose 27% and pre-tax profit 47% as the platform steadily increased its share of the investing platform market, having passed the half-a-million customers mark in April.

A 21% interim dividend increase was also announced, with the mid cap also announcing a review of its capital-allocation policy toward a ""progressive"" policy.

The wider FTSE 250 is up 16 points while the FTSE 100 continues to sink, down 18 points or 0.22% now.

8.33am: Top risers

Let's brighten up the day for investors by looking at the blue-chip leaderboard.

One of the top risers is

Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust PLC (LSE:SMT), which is getting a double benefit today, as its results showed a return to positive growth and one of its big shareholdings, Nvidia, is due to heading higher today.

The return to growth followed two consecutive years of negative returns, with net asset value of its portfolio holdings increasing 11.5%, which was principally thanks to the trust's two largest investments - chip sector giants Nvidia and ASML - benefitting from the AI boom.

The index's other big investment trusts are also in the green, F&C Investment Trust PLC (LSE:FCIT) and 3i Group PLC, up just under 1%.

Top of the list though, is St James's Place PLC, with many other financial sector names prominent in the leaderboard on the back of the Hargreaves Lansdown bid interest, even though it seems a bit of a lowball offer.

St James's is up 4.9%, Schroders PLC 1.2% and Barclays PLC, Prudential PLC (LSE:PRU), HSBC Holdings PLC all around 0.8%

Marks & Spencer Group PLC is continuing to rise as its numbers from yesterday are further chewed over.

8.15am: FTSE 100 falls again

The FTSE 100 climbed a few points higher in initial trades but has quickly resumed its familiar pattern from recent days by squelching into the red.

After a quarter of an hour, the blue-chip index was down 10 points at 8360.

Four blue-chips stocks going ex-dividend is knocking 1.84 points off the total, those being Imperial Brands, Whitbread, Diploma and DCC.

Rolls-Royce is one of the fallers, down 1% after its first-quarter update.

Aviva is down 0.1% after its own. Both companies kept their outlook unchanged for the year.

8am: Not-West?

Rishi Sunak's calling of a general election for the first Thursday in July is likely to derail the government's retail sale of NatWest Group PLC (LSE:NWG).

The multibillion-pound sale to private investors had been a key plan of Chancellor Jeremy Hunt, which he confirmed in the Budget in March.

Treasury officials have told various media that those plans have now been paused, with one source telling Sky News that the plans have been put ""in the deep freeze"".

7.57am: Aviva hails 'excellent' start

Likewise, Aviva PLC (LSE:AV.) has also reported a strong start and kept its full-year outlook unchanged.

General insurance premiums increased 16% to £2.7bn and workplace pensions business generated net flows of £2bn as 136 new schemes were won.

In the bulk purchase annuity market, retirement sales were up 13%. A solvency shareholder cover ratio of 206% was above some analyst forecasts.

The life insurer's boss Amanda Blanc felt the first-quarter numbers were ""excellent"" and said the group was in ""great health"".

""We have clear competitive advantages - in our brand, our scale, and our diverse business - which are driving consistently strong performance, and giving us real optimism about 2024,"" she said.

7.39am: Rolls-Royce has 'strong start'

Rolls-Royce Holdings PLC (LSE:RR.) chief executive Tufan Erginbilgic said the engine maker made a ""strong start"" in the first four months of 2024 and maintained guidance for the full year.

In the FTSE 100-listed group's civil aerospace arm, the keenly watched long-term service agreement large engine flying hours (EFH) figure was said to have returned to 100% of the levels from pre-pandemic 2019.

This was lower than some more optimistic analysts expected.

A key driver was the continued recovery of international air traffic in Asia and the growing fleet of aeroplanes that have RR engines installed.

For the full year, Erginbilgic said expectations for large EFH at 100%-110% of 2019 levels, 1,300-1,400 shop visits and 500-550 OE deliveries are all unchanged.

He said Rolls remains ""on track"" to deliver the annualised cost reduction of £200 million by the end of next year, with redundancy consultations ""advanced"".

7.24am: Hargreaves Lansdown rejects offer

The board of Hargreaves Lansdown PLC (LSE:HL.) has rejected a bid from a consortium of private equity and the Abu Dhabi investment fund.

A price of 985p per share was the latest of two approaches from the consortium made up of CVC Advisers, Nordic Capital, SCSP and Platinum Ivy (a subsidiary of Abu Dhabi Investment Authority), which issued a statement after markets closed yesterday.

Hargreaves shares finished yesterday at 979p, after a late spike as speculation about a bid filtered through, having started the day at 931p.

""The board confirms that it unanimously rejected the Proposal on the basis it substantially undervalues Hargreaves Lansdown and its future prospects,"" a statement this morning says, adding that it will update the market at the full year results on 9 August.

7.16am: FTSE 100 to inch higher

After a two-day pullback, the FTSE 100 is predicted to hold its ground on Thursday, after confirmation that a general election is coming in six weeks.

In fact, spread-betters have called the blue-chip index four points higher, following a day when it lost 46 points to close just above 8370.

Overnight, the major US stock indices finished in the red but NVIDIA jumped 6% after the closing bell as its earnings continued to roar higher and beat Wall Street estimates.

The Dow Jones finished 0.5% lower, the S&P 500 down 0.3%, the Nasdaq Composite 0.2% and the small cap Russell 2000 dropped 0.8%.

""Markets had an eventful day yesterday, with various headlines that drove swings in both directions. As we go to press this morning, sentiment has turned more positive,"" says macro strategist Henry Allen at Deutsche Bank, pointing to futures on the S&P 500 up 0.65% following an upbeat outlook from Nvidia.

He said markets lost ground earlier in the day after the minutes of the latest Fed meeting were ""on the hawkish side"", while bonds sold off after UK inflation surprised on the upside to serve ""as a reminder that the path back to target may not be a smooth one, and led investors to dial back the chance of rate cuts across Europe"".

Market analyst Ipek Ozkardeskaya at Swissquote Bank said the UK election news combined with the inflation print washed out the expectation of a June rate cut from the Bank of England and lifted the pound, which hit the FTSE.

""Consequently, Cable is pushing higher above the 1.27 level right now, but the upside potential will likely remain capped as - if nothing - the uncertainty surrounding the UK general election will most probably tame appetite for sterling in the next six weeks,"" she said.",proactiveinvestors.co.uk,news,Proactiveinvestors UK,Oliver Haill,0.1137254901960785,454163006,1,https://cdn.proactiveinvestors.com/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJwYS1jZG4iLCJrZXkiOiJ1cGxvYWRcL05ld3NcL0ltYWdlXC8yMDI0XzA1XC8yMDI0LTA1LTIzLTEyLTExLTMxLWZjOTU5YWM1ZmE0NjJiMzlkYWUwMGE1NTAyNTllM2EzLmpwZyIsImVkaXRzIjp7InJlc2l6ZSI6eyJ3aWR0aCI6MTIwMCwiaGVpZ2h0Ijo2MzAsImZpdCI6ImNvdmVyIn19fQ==,

Up to nearly $35 million of this investment is intended to improve US energy systems in Massachusetts and New York. The company said its investment in the region has increased more than 60 percent in the last 5 years.

The investments are to bring economic growth to the region with National Grid supporting 127,000 jobs by the end of the decade.

According to the US Department of Energy (DOE), lack of transmission infrastructure can directly contribute to higher electric bills, and more frequent and longer power outages. The federal analysis found the region needs a 255 percent increase in transmission development to support the clean energy growth expected under New York and Massachusetts policies.

'The increased investment we're announcing today follows positive engagement with our regulators in these states, reflecting a willingness to upgrade electricity networks to provide long term affordable energy to all, and reduce emissions across our gas networks,' said CEO of National Grid John Pettigrew.

The company also boosted its quarterly dividend by about 150% to $0.10 a share and announced a 10-for-1 stock split, effective June 7th.

Yesterday, the minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee's April 30-May 1 meeting revealed that Federal Reserve officials became increasingly worried about inflation. Policymakers noted that ""recent data had not increased their confidence in progress toward 2 percent and, accordingly, had suggested that the disinflation process would likely take longer than previously thought."" Also, the minutes showed that ""various participants"" discussed a willingness to raise rates if inflation did not continue its downward trajectory toward the 2% goal. ""Although monetary policy was seen as restrictive, many participants commented on their uncertainty about the degree of restrictiveness,"" according to the FOMC minutes released on Wednesday.

""Hawkish surprise (kind of) from the Fed minutes. The investing world will have to wait at least another month to hear anything about rate cuts - but the kicker in this report was the willingness of some participants to restrict policy further,"" said Alex McGrath at NorthEnd Private Wealth.

In yesterday's trading session, Wall Street's major indices closed lower.

An activist investor has called for Rio Tinto PLC to give up its primary London quote and therefore also its FTSE 100 listing, like rival BHP did three years ago.

London-based Palliser Capital, which has built up less than a 1% stake, has argued Rio's dual Anglo-Aussie corporate structure made it difficult to pull off big acquisitions, the Financial Times reported.

It reckons Rio is trading at a $27 billion discount, or so it told a Sohn Hong Kong investment conference on Thursday.

Palliser's chief investment officer James Smith, who is reported to have been in contact with management about its dual listing, said he believed there was upside of ""nearly 40 per cent"" in Rio's shares.

9.59am: PMI services weaker

The UK's services sector has seen some cooling this month, according to the preliminary 'flash' PMI survey from S&P Global, though manufacturing is rebounding.

The composite purchasing managers' index fell to 52.8 midway through May from 54.1 in April, taking the balance back to the level seen in March.

This was caused by a fall in the services PMI to 52.9 from 55.0 as growth in new orders cools.

On the flip side, the manufacturing PMI rebounded back into positive territory at 51.3 from 49.1 in April.

Another interesting development in May's flash survey was the weakness in the costs and prices balances, with input cost inflation the weakest in seven months, while output prices rose at their slowest pace since February 2021, with the service sector being the source of weakness in both sectors.

9.51am: Tate & Lyle climbs on Primient sale

Tate & Lyle PLC (LSE:TATE) climbed on Thursday morning after unveiling stronger profit for last year and the sale of its remaining stake in Primient.

Pre-tax profit climbed 18% to £287 million in the year to March, the food and beverage firm said on Thursday, despite a 2% fall in revenue to £1.65 billion on softer demand.

Tate & Lyle also announced the sale of its remaining 49.7% stake in ingredients producer Primient for US$350 million (£275 million).

""The sale of our remaining stake in Primient represents an important milestone for our business,"" chief executive Nick Hampton said.

""With this sale, the transformation of Tate & Lyle into a fully-focused speciality food and beverage solutions business is complete.""

Shares climbed 4.7% to 708.50p.

9.19am: National Grid slumps on £7bn rights issue

National Grid PLC (LSE:NG.) fell almost 9% after unveiling plans for a rights issue alongside its full-year results, raising £7 billion.

The 645p price will raise funds for a £60 billion energy infrastructure investment plan.

""The board unanimously believes this comprehensive financing plan will allow the group to fund a significant increase in capital investment, maintain its strong investment grade credit rating, deliver for customers, and continue to achieve attractive shareholders returns,"" National Grid said.

News of the plan sent shares down 8.7% to 1,030p in early trading.

""Understandably, this and the dilution effect of the rights issue have led their share price to plunge, eToro analyst Adam Vettese said.

National Grid was ""ordinarily a steady-eddie defensive stock,"" he added.

National Grid also reported that pre-tax profit slipped 15% to just over £3 billion, while per-share earnings fell 19% to 60p.

8.40am: Platforms in demand

Hargreaves rival AJ Bell PLC (LSE:AJB) is topping the FTSE 350 risers, up 10% after its half-year results impressed and it got a read-across boost from the sector bid interest.

Revenue rose 27% and pre-tax profit 47% as the platform steadily increased its share of the investing platform market, having passed the half-a-million customers mark in April.

A 21% interim dividend increase was also announced, with the mid cap also announcing a review of its capital-allocation policy toward a ""progressive"" policy.

The wider FTSE 250 is up 16 points while the FTSE 100 continues to sink, down 18 points or 0.22% now.

8.33am: Top risers

Let's brighten up the day for investors by looking at the blue-chip leaderboard.

One of the top risers is

Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust PLC (LSE:SMT), which is getting a double benefit today, as its results showed a return to positive growth and one of its big shareholdings, Nvidia, is due to heading higher today.

The return to growth followed two consecutive years of negative returns, with net asset value of its portfolio holdings increasing 11.5%, which was principally thanks to the trust's two largest investments - chip sector giants Nvidia and ASML - benefitting from the AI boom.

The index's other big investment trusts are also in the green, F&C Investment Trust PLC (LSE:FCIT) and 3i Group PLC, up just under 1%.

Top of the list though, is St James's Place PLC, with many other financial sector names prominent in the leaderboard on the back of the Hargreaves Lansdown bid interest, even though it seems a bit of a lowball offer.

St James's is up 4.9%, Schroders PLC 1.2% and Barclays PLC, Prudential PLC (LSE:PRU), HSBC Holdings PLC all around 0.8%

Marks & Spencer Group PLC is continuing to rise as its numbers from yesterday are further chewed over.

8.15am: FTSE 100 falls again

The FTSE 100 climbed a few points higher in initial trades but has quickly resumed its familiar pattern from recent days by squelching into the red.

After a quarter of an hour, the blue-chip index was down 10 points at 8360.

Four blue-chips stocks going ex-dividend is knocking 1.84 points off the total, those being Imperial Brands, Whitbread, Diploma and DCC.

Rolls-Royce is one of the fallers, down 1% after its first-quarter update.

Aviva is down 0.1% after its own. Both companies kept their outlook unchanged for the year.

8am: Not-West?

Rishi Sunak's calling of a general election for the first Thursday in July is likely to derail the government's retail sale of NatWest Group PLC (LSE:NWG).

The multibillion-pound sale to private investors had been a key plan of Chancellor Jeremy Hunt, which he confirmed in the Budget in March.

Treasury officials have told various media that those plans have now been paused, with one source telling Sky News that the plans have been put ""in the deep freeze"".

7.57am: Aviva hails 'excellent' start

Likewise, Aviva PLC (LSE:AV.) has also reported a strong start and kept its full-year outlook unchanged.

General insurance premiums increased 16% to £2.7bn and workplace pensions business generated net flows of £2bn as 136 new schemes were won.

In the bulk purchase annuity market, retirement sales were up 13%. A solvency shareholder cover ratio of 206% was above some analyst forecasts.

The life insurer's boss Amanda Blanc felt the first-quarter numbers were ""excellent"" and said the group was in ""great health"".

""We have clear competitive advantages - in our brand, our scale, and our diverse business - which are driving consistently strong performance, and giving us real optimism about 2024,"" she said.

7.39am: Rolls-Royce has 'strong start'

Rolls-Royce Holdings PLC (LSE:RR.) chief executive Tufan Erginbilgic said the engine maker made a ""strong start"" in the first four months of 2024 and maintained guidance for the full year.

In the FTSE 100-listed group's civil aerospace arm, the keenly watched long-term service agreement large engine flying hours (EFH) figure was said to have returned to 100% of the levels from pre-pandemic 2019.

This was lower than some more optimistic analysts expected.

A key driver was the continued recovery of international air traffic in Asia and the growing fleet of aeroplanes that have RR engines installed.

For the full year, Erginbilgic said expectations for large EFH at 100%-110% of 2019 levels, 1,300-1,400 shop visits and 500-550 OE deliveries are all unchanged.

He said Rolls remains ""on track"" to deliver the annualised cost reduction of £200 million by the end of next year, with redundancy consultations ""advanced"".

7.24am: Hargreaves Lansdown rejects offer

The board of Hargreaves Lansdown PLC (LSE:HL.) has rejected a bid from a consortium of private equity and the Abu Dhabi investment fund.

A price of 985p per share was the latest of two approaches from the consortium made up of CVC Advisers, Nordic Capital, SCSP and Platinum Ivy (a subsidiary of Abu Dhabi Investment Authority), which issued a statement after markets closed yesterday.

Hargreaves shares finished yesterday at 979p, after a late spike as speculation about a bid filtered through, having started the day at 931p.

""The board confirms that it unanimously rejected the Proposal on the basis it substantially undervalues Hargreaves Lansdown and its future prospects,"" a statement this morning says, adding that it will update the market at the full year results on 9 August.

7.16am: FTSE 100 to inch higher

After a two-day pullback, the FTSE 100 is predicted to hold its ground on Thursday, after confirmation that a general election is coming in six weeks.

In fact, spread-betters have called the blue-chip index four points higher, following a day when it lost 46 points to close just above 8370.

Overnight, the major US stock indices finished in the red but NVIDIA jumped 6% after the closing bell as its earnings continued to roar higher and beat Wall Street estimates.

The Dow Jones finished 0.5% lower, the S&P 500 down 0.3%, the Nasdaq Composite 0.2% and the small cap Russell 2000 dropped 0.8%.

""Markets had an eventful day yesterday, with various headlines that drove swings in both directions. As we go to press this morning, sentiment has turned more positive,"" says macro strategist Henry Allen at Deutsche Bank, pointing to futures on the S&P 500 up 0.65% following an upbeat outlook from Nvidia.

He said markets lost ground earlier in the day after the minutes of the latest Fed meeting were ""on the hawkish side"", while bonds sold off after UK inflation surprised on the upside to serve ""as a reminder that the path back to target may not be a smooth one, and led investors to dial back the chance of rate cuts across Europe"".

Market analyst Ipek Ozkardeskaya at Swissquote Bank said the UK election news combined with the inflation print washed out the expectation of a June rate cut from the Bank of England and lifted the pound, which hit the FTSE.

""Consequently, Cable is pushing higher above the 1.27 level right now, but the upside potential will likely remain capped as - if nothing - the uncertainty surrounding the UK general election will most probably tame appetite for sterling in the next six weeks,"" she said.",proactiveinvestors.co.uk,news,Proactiveinvestors UK,Oliver Haill,0.06666666666666665,454154731,1,https://cdn.proactiveinvestors.com/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJwYS1jZG4iLCJrZXkiOiJ1cGxvYWRcL05ld3NcL0ltYWdlXC8yMDI0XzA1XC8yMDI0LTA1LTIzLTEwLTU3LTAyLTI3ZDk2NmNjMDM3M2QxZjQwZDE1ZTdiNjU1MTdmZTU5LmpwZyIsImVkaXRzIjp7InJlc2l6ZSI6eyJ3aWR0aCI6MTIwMCwiaGVpZ2h0Ijo2MzAsImZpdCI6ImNvdmVyIn19fQ==,

The London-based multinational electricity and gas utility said the investment from financial 2025 to 2029 will be nearly double that of the previous five-year period and will deliver a ""significant step-change"" in critical energy infrastructure in the UK and US.

Nearly 80% of the capital investment will go into Electricity Networks, with the group mix moving towards 80% electricity and 20% gas by 2029, the company stated.

Chief Executive John Pettigrew called the plan a ""defining moment"" for the company, ""cementing our position as a leader in the energy transition in the UK and US northeast"".

National Grid operates electricity and gas distribution networks the US states of New York and Massachusetts.

National Grid said the fully underwritten right issue would be priced at 645 pence per share and will be offer to existing shareholders on the basis of 7 new shares for every 24 already held shares.

Shares in National Grid opened were down 8.8% at 1,028.00p each in London on Thursday morning.

To further help fund the investment, National Grid intends to sell Grain LNG, its UK liquefied natural gas business, and National Grid Renewables, its US onshore renewable energy business.

National Grid also plans ""senior debt and future hybrid issuance to maintain balance sheet strength and investment flexibility"".

""The board unanimously believes this comprehensive financing plan will allow the group to fund a significant increase in capital investment, maintain its strong investment grade credit rating, deliver for customers, and continue to achieve attractive shareholders returns,"" it said in a statement.

Alongside this, National Grid unveiled a new five-year financial framework through to financial 2029.

The company plans to deliver group asset compound annual growth of around 10%, 6% to 8% underlying compound annual earnings per share growth from a financial 2025 baseline, and continue a progressive dividend policy.

National Grid said it would maintain the total level of dividend following the rights issue and aim to continue to grow the payout in line with the UK consumer prices index including owner occupiers' housing costs from 2024's rebased level.

Pettigrew said: ""Our investment will unlock significant economic growth and, by the end of the decade, National Grid is expected to support over 60,000 more jobs, while also decarbonising our energy systems, bolstering security of supply, and reducing consumer bills in the long term. Our strong track record of infrastructure delivery, positive engagement with our regulators and wider stakeholders, alongside clarity on the scale and profile of our capital investment positions National Grid to take advantage of the significant growth opportunities we see ahead.""

Pettigrew said the readiness to take this step ""is underscored by another year of strong financial and operational performance.""

National Grid on Thursday reported pretax profit fell 15% to GBP3.05 billion in the financial year that ended March 31 from GBP3.59 billion the year before. Operating profit fell 8.1% to GBP4.48 billion from GBP4.88 billion.

This was principally driven by non-cash exceptional charges in the financial year versus gains on disposals in the prior year, partly offset by favourable timing and commodity swings and higher underlying performance versus the prior year.

EPS fell 19% to 60.0p from 74.2p, while the dividend was increased by 5.6% to 58.52p from 55.44p.

Gross revenue was GBP19.85 billion, down 8.4% from GBP21.66 billion, and other operating income dropped to just GBP12 million from GBP989 million, but operating costs were reduced by 13% to GBP15.39 billion from GBP17.77 billion.

Capital investment totalled GBP8.2 billion for continuing operations, up 8% at actual exchange rates.

The proceeds of approximately 6.8 billion pounds from the issue would be utilized to fund a higher-growth investment phase for the Group, with around 60 billion pounds of capital investment expected during the 5-year period from fiscal year 2025 to fiscal year 2029.

In the near term, to support efficient management of funding costs, approximately 750 million pounds of the net proceeds would be used to refinance a portion of the Group's outstanding hybrid bonds that have first call dates in the next 15 months.

Deliver £60bn investment in energy infrastructure

To fund a significant step up in capital investment to around £60 billion in energy network infrastructure, the Board of National Grid plc (""National Grid"" or the ""Company"") today announces a capital raise of approximately £7 billion by way of a fully underwritten Rights Issue of 1,085,448,980 New Shares at 645 pence per New Share on the basis of 7 New Shares for every 24 Existing Shares (the ""Rights Issue"").

National Grid's results for the year ended 31 March 2024 have been released today in an accompanying announcement.

SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND TO AND REASONS FOR THE RIGHTS ISSUE

National Grid plays a critical role in delivering the energy transition across our jurisdictions, by building and maintaining the transmission and distribution infrastructure to enable the connection of cleaner, more affordable renewable energy. Not only will this enable the decarbonisation of the economies we serve, it will also ensure we can meet the demand growth we anticipate from a more technology-enabled economy, as well as greater electrification of homes, heating and vehicles.

The opportunities presented by the growth of electricity demand, and the consensus among our regulators and jurisdictions of the urgent need for decarbonisation are unprecedented. It's against this backdrop that we expect to significantly increase our capital investment over the next five years.

Our geographic position and our work with governments and regulators provides us with an unprecedented growth opportunity that we expect will create substantial value for our shareholders. This investment in new infrastructure will enhance resiliency and enable the jurisdictions in which we operate to make meaningful progress in their journeys towards a decarbonised energy system. The step-up in investment as set out in our new 5-year financial framework underscores National Grid's position as one of the FTSE's biggest investors in the delivery of the energy transition. Over the last three years we have reshaped our portfolio and now have a mix of businesses that is increasingly weighted towards electricity transmission and distribution, making us well-placed to capture the significant network growth opportunities that lie ahead. With our operational and regulatory capabilities, combined with a strong track record of delivery, we are confident that we can deliver this step-up in new infrastructure that will provide greater levels of energy security and enable diversification of energy sources to help decarbonise the economies we serve.

The Board unanimously believes that raising net proceeds of approximately £6.8 billion through the Rights Issue will give the Group appropriate financial flexibility to deliver the Group's strategy over the 5-year financial framework, and funding clarity until at least the end of the RIIO-T3 period.

The Rights Issue net proceeds of approximately £6.8 billion will principally be utilised to fund a higher-growth investment phase for the Group, with around £60 billion of capital investment expected during the 5-year period from FY25 to FY29. In the near term, to support efficient management of funding costs, approximately £750 million of the net proceeds will be used to refinance a portion of the Group's outstanding hybrid bonds that have first call dates in the next 15 months.

This collaboration will allow National Grid to create new power systems to support Tata Steel's planned 3.2 million tonnes electric arc furnace, slated for construction by the end of 2027.

Rajesh Nair, CEO of Tata Steel UK, announced online, ""This will help us replace our aging and carbon-intensive blast furnaces with a state-of-the-art electric arc furnace capable of producing our customers' most demanding steel products.""

In 2023, the UK government pledged up to £500 million ($635 million) to aid Tata Steel's transformation of the country's largest steel mills, aiming to maintain productivity and competitiveness. This initiative is part of a broader effort to retain companies within Britain.

Following extensive negotiations with UK trade unions, Tata Steel confirmed in April a £1.25 billion investment in an electric furnace at Port Talbot. These discussions addressed concerns about potential job losses, with Tata Steel estimating that approximately 2,500 jobs will be impacted over the next 18 months.

The shift to electric furnace technology is a significant move towards more sustainable steel production, offering a greener alternative to traditional coal-fired furnaces. However, the transition also raises concerns about employment, as the new technology may not require as many workers.

Industry Minister Alan Mak praised the agreement, calling it ""another positive step towards securing the future of steelmaking in South Wales and the UK."" He highlighted the importance of this transition for the local and national steel industry, underscoring the significance of sustainable practices in maintaining the industry's viability.",solarquarter.com,news,SolarQuarter,Sangita Shetty,0.1450980392156862,454140292,1,https://solarquarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/18-3.png,eng-9583060

Technological advancements play a crucial role in shaping the power grid market. Smart grid technologies, such as advanced metering infrastructure, distribution automation, and grid modernization solutions, are gaining prominence.

These technologies enable utilities to monitor, control, and optimize grid operations in real-time, enhancing reliability, efficiency, and resilience while integrating renewable energy sources and accommodating electric vehicles.

Renewable energy integration is another significant factor driving market growth. The transition towards cleaner energy sources, such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power, necessitates the development of grid infrastructure capable of accommodating fluctuating generation patterns and bi-directional power flows.

This includes the deployment of energy storage systems, grid-scale batteries, and demand response mechanisms to balance supply and demand and ensure grid stability.

Electricity transmission losses within the power grid resulting in frequent power outages are estimated to restrain the market growth in the future. This is because the electricity distribution over long distances increases the temperature within power lines which results in energy losses in the form of heat.

Also, the amount of energy lost during electricity transmission, varies from country to country. Electricity transmission losses in the power grid can lead to power outages, leading to huge blackouts, and damage to electronic devices.

These factors are estimated to restrict the power grid market opportunities in the upcoming years.

5 Safe Stocks to Buy as Consumer Sentiment Hits 6-Month Low

Rising inflation is igniting fresh fears of an economic slowdown, as the upbeat sentiment among millions of Americans continues to fade fast. Consumers who were confident about the economy's health till a few months back are now doubtful about the future.

The University of Michigan's preliminary reading on the overall consumer sentiment index came up with a reading of 67.4 for May, its lowest level in six months. Also, this was sharply lower than April's reading of 77.2 and the consensus estimate of 76.

This reflects a 12.7% month-over-month and 14.2% year-over-year decline in consumer sentiment.

The one-year outlook for inflation climbed to 3.5% in May, increasing 0.3% month over month. Also, the five-year outlook for inflation rose 0.1% to 3.1% in May.

The current condition index dropped over 10 points to 68.8 in May. The expectations index slipped to 66.5%, declining 9.5%.

Economic growth slowed in the first quarter, increasing a modest 1.6%, sharply lower than the consensus estimate of 2.2%, and after increasing 3.5% in the final quarter of 2023.

Inflation, which had been declining sharply till December 2023, thanks to the Federal Reserve's strict monetary tightening campaign, has once again started its ascent.

Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 3.5% in March, which has raised concerns among investors as they fear that the Federal Reserve could further delay its planned rate cuts. The Fed also said that it doesn't see any signs of inflation declining sharply and its 2% target is still a far cry.

Rising inflation presently remains the biggest concern leading to delay rate cuts, which could keep markets volatile for a longer period.

This strategy looks for firms with persistent earnings growth that trade at a discount relative to their earnings growth and dividend yield.

NATIONAL GRID PLC (ADR) (NGG) is a large-cap growth stock in the Electric Utilities industry. The rating according to our strategy based on John Neff changed from 58% to 77% based on the firm's underlying fundamentals and the stock's valuation. A score of 80% or above typically indicates that the strategy has some interest in the stock and a score above 90% typically indicates strong interest.

Company Description: National Grid plc is an energy company. The Company's businesses supply gas and electricity to various customers and communities. Its segments include UK Electricity Transmission, UK Electricity Distribution, UK Electricity System Operator, New England, New York and National Grid Ventures. UK Electricity Transmission segment includes the high-voltage electricity transmission networks in England and Wales. UK Electricity Distribution segment includes the electricity distribution networks of Western Power Distribution in East Midlands, West Midlands, and Southwest of England and South Wales. UK Electricity System Operator segment is the Great Britain system operator. The New England segment is engaged in gas distribution networks, electricity distribution networks, and high-voltage electricity transmission networks in New England. New York segment is engaged in gas distribution networks, electricity distribution networks, and high-voltage electricity transmission networks in New York.

The following table summarizes whether the stock meets each of this strategy's tests. Not all criteria in the below table receive equal weighting or are independent, but the table provides a brief overview of the strong and weak points of the security in the context of the strategy's criteria.

About John Neff: While known as the manager with whom many top managers entrusted their own money, Neff was far from the smooth-talking, high-profile Wall Streeter you might expect. He was mild-mannered and low-key, and the same might be said of the Windsor Fund that he managed for more than three decades. In fact, Neff himself described the fund as ""relatively prosaic, dull, [and] conservative."" There was nothing dull about his results, however. From 1964 to 1995, Neff guided Windsor to a 13.7 percent average annual return, easily outpacing the S&P 500's 10.6 percent return during that time. That 3.1 percentage point difference is huge over time -- a $10,000 investment in Windsor (with dividends reinvested) at the start of Neff's tenure would have ended up as more than $564,000 by the time he retired, more than twice what the same investment in the S&P would have yielded (about $233,000). Considering the length of his tenure, that track record may be the best ever for a manager of such a large fund.

The factory, at the Port of Nigg in northern Scotland, will produce the high voltage direct current cables capable of carrying power over long distances that wind farms desperately need. The factory will bring £350 million ($439 million) of investment as well as 150 highly skilled jobs to the area, the company said in a statement on Tuesday.

Europe doesn't have enough cable manufacturers to meet its green ambitions and the firms that do make them are facing years of backlog with many booked out until 2030.

Sumitomo already has an advance agreement with SSE Plc, the UK's largest generator of renewable power, that's chosen the Japanese firm as the preferred bidder for a major power link between the Shetland Islands and the mainland.

The Shetland 2 power link is set to bring 2 gigawatts of renewable power 330 kilometers (205 miles) from the islands to the mainland. It is part of the National Grid Plc's £58 billion plan for grid upgrades beyond 2030. About 21 gigawatts of offshore wind that's in development off the coast of Scotland needs to be connected by the types of cables the new plant will manufacture.",bnnbloomberg.ca,news,BNN,,0.0980392156862746,453375489,1,http://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/polopoly_fs/1.2072617!/fileimage/httpImage/image.png_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/image.png,eng-9565877

Consumers who were confident about the economy's health till a few months back are now doubtful about the future.

The University of Michigan's preliminary reading on the overall consumer sentiment index came up with a reading of 67.4 for May, its lowest level in six months. Also, this was sharply lower than April's reading of 77.2 and the consensus estimate of 76.

This reflects a 12.7% month-over-month and 14.2% year-over-year decline in consumer sentiment.

The one-year outlook for inflation climbed to 3.5% in May, increasing 0.3% month over month. Also, the five-year outlook for inflation rose 0.1% to 3.1% in May.

The current condition index dropped over 10 points to 68.8 in May. The expectations index slipped to 66.5%, declining 9.5%.

Economic growth slowed in the first quarter, increasing a modest 1.6%, sharply lower than the consensus estimate of 2.2%, and after increasing 3.5% in the final quarter of 2023.

Inflation, which had been declining sharply till December 2023, thanks to the Federal Reserve's strict monetary tightening campaign, has once again started its ascent.

Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 3.5% in March, which has raised concerns among investors as they fear that the Federal Reserve could further delay its planned rate cuts. The Fed also said that it doesn't see any signs of inflation declining sharply and its 2% target is still a far cry.

Rising inflation presently remains the biggest concern leading to delay rate cuts, which could keep markets volatile for a longer period.

BPL's Bookmobile joined Community Offshore Wind's community outreach van at the community center at the Farragut Houses on May 4 to begin distributing bundles of books to Brooklyn families. The donated books focus on STEM topics like renewable energy and engineering. They also include biographies of inspiring scientists to encourage a passion for STEM education and careers in the next generation of the clean energy workforce.

Families can continue to pick up book bundles at the Bookmobile in Red Hook at the corner of Lorraine and Columbia Streets on May 7 and May 21 from 11AM - 4PM.

""Community Offshore Wind is committed to helping New York families access the education and development opportunities needed for the clean energy jobs of the future,"" said Doug Perkins, President and Project Director of Community Offshore Wind. ""By partnering with the BPL, we can help spark an interest in STEM subjects among children in Brooklyn and put them on a path toward clean energy education. We'll also help them start or build their home libraries and inspire a life-long love of learning.""

""Having books at home provides a clear path to academic success and we are thrilled to partner with Community Offshore Wind to provide books for children to build libraries of their own. As these young Brooklynites explore STEM topics that interest them, we hope they begin to think about their own career paths and scientific discoveries,"" said Linda E. Johnson, President and CEO, Brooklyn Public Library.

Studies have repeatedly demonstrated that home libraries and access to books from a young age both contribute significantly to better educational outcomes for children, but often, families in disadvantaged communities lack the opportunity to build those resources for their children. This program will help overcome that longstanding barrier by ensuring equitable access to books that will further students' education and support better learning in school.

""Proficiency in the areas of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics can take you so far in life,"" said NYCHA Chief Executive Officer Lisa Bova-Hiatt. ""These skills can open up amazing career opportunities, and they can serve you immensely in your day-to-day life. We extend our sincere appreciation to Community Offshore Wind and the Brooklyn Public Library for putting valuable STEM resources in the hands of young NYCHA residents and their families at Red Hook and Farragut Houses.""

""To build a sustainable future that works for everybody, we need to educate our kids so they can take the reins of that future,"" said State Senator Andrew Gounardes. ""Having books at home is a proven way to ensure children have the resources they need to learn and thrive, and these STEM books will open them up to a world of possibilities when it comes to science, renewable energy and engineering. I'm grateful to Community Offshore Wind and Brooklyn Public Library for putting the children of the Red Hook and Farragut Houses at the center of their vision for a green future.""

""The Brooklyn Public Library system has been instrumental in fostering an eagerness to learn in our borough's youth. This is why I was excited to learn about Community Offshore Wind's plan to partner with the Brooklyn Public Library bus mobile to donate 3,200 books to families from Red Hook and Farragut Houses,"" said New York State Assemblywoman Marcela Mitaynes. ""As we continue to build a green, sustainable future for our children, books are a fun and accessible way to introduce STEM to our younger residents. I look forward to new initiatives and events that will continue to uplift our communities.""

Since its launch in 2022, Community Offshore Wind has been an active and engaged neighbor to New York communities. For Engineers Week 2023 and 2024, the project funded field trips for more than 140 New York students to local museums, and brought team members to the Harbor Middle School and New York Urban Assembly Harbor High School to encourage an early interest in STEM education and careers. They have also offered swim lessons to children from disadvantaged communities in partnership with the YMCA, donated 900 coats to families in need during the winter months and provided 30,000 fresh seafood meals to food banks throughout the state.

Brooklyn Public Library is the sixth largest library system in the country and a leading provider of free early literacy programs in New York City. From multilingual story times to Brainy Babies and Ready Set Kindergarten, BPL offers free programs that increase literacy, language, and social skills in young children, while providing parents and caregivers techniques for supporting learning at home. In 2023, BPL offered nearly 5000 free public programs for children, ages 0 to 12, focused on literacy, reading and the joy of a good book.

And in our experience, buying the right stocks can give your wealth a significant boost. For example, the National Grid plc (LON:NG.) share price is up 26% in the last 5 years, clearly besting the market return of around 7.6% (ignoring dividends).

Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business.

See our latest analysis for National Grid

To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.

National Grid's earnings per share are down 7.1% per year, despite strong share price performance over five years.

The strong decline in earnings per share suggests the market isn't using EPS to judge the company. Given that EPS is down, but the share price is up, it seems clear the market is focussed on other aspects of the business, at the moment.

In fact, the dividend has increased over time, which is a positive. Maybe dividend investors have helped support the share price. We'd posit that the revenue growth over the last five years, of 9.5% per year, would encourage people to invest.

The graphic below depicts how earnings and revenue have changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).

National Grid is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth. So it makes a lot of sense to check out what analysts think National Grid will earn in the future (free analyst consensus estimates)

When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of National Grid, it has a TSR of 64% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!

While the broader market gained around 7.4% in the last year, National Grid shareholders lost 1.5% (even including dividends). However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 10% per year over half a decade. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand National Grid better, we need to consider many other factors. Case in point: We've spotted 2 warning signs for National Grid you should be aware of, and 1 of them is potentially serious.
