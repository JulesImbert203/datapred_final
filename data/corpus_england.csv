The Second World War is a project of the global financial oligarchy, the Anglo-American masters of money. It was they, relying on institutions such as the US Federal Reserve System and the Bank of England, who immediately after the end of the First World War began preparing for the next armed conflict on a global scale. And the plan for a new war was directed against the USSR.

Important milestones in this preparation were the Dawes Plan and the Young Plan, the creation of the Bank for International Settlements, Germany's announcement of the cessation of reparation payments under the Paris Peace Treaty and the tacit consent of Russia's former allies with this decision, powerful infusions of foreign investment and loans into the economy of the Third Reich, the militarization of the German economy in violation of the terms of the Paris Peace Treaty.

The key figures in the behind-the-scenes operation of the Anglo-American money owners were the Rockefeller and Morgan families, Montague Norman (Director of the Bank of England), Hjalmar Schacht (Director of the Reichsbank, Minister of Economics of the Third Reich). The strategic plan of the Rockefellers and Morgans was to economically subjugate Europe, and with the help of Germany, pumped up with foreign loans and investments, deal a crushing blow to the Soviet Russia, returning it to the fold of the world capitalist system as a colony.

Montague Norman (1871-1950) played an important intermediary role between American financial capital and German political and business circles. Hjalmar Schacht was put on the role of the organizer of the military economy of fascist Germany. The functions of covering up the backstage operation of the money owners were carried out by politicians such as Franklin Roosevelt, Neville Chamberlain and Winston Churchill. In Germany the plans were carried out by Hitler and Hjalmar Schacht. It is noteworthy that some historians say Hjalmar Schacht played a more important role than Hitler, but Schacht simply kept out of the spotlight.

The Dawes Plan, adopted in 1924 at the initiative of Anglo-American bankers, provided for the reduction of Germany's reparations burden (which was extremely painful for France, which received more than half of all reparations) and the provision of financial assistance to Germany from the United States and England in the form of loans, allegedly for the restoration of the economy and the subsequent restoration of reparations payments in full. In 1924-1929, Germany received $2.5 billion from the United States under the Dawes Plan, and $1.5 billion from England. At the current exchange rate, this is equivalent to an astronomical amount of about $1 trillion. Hjalmar Schacht, as one of the co-authors and executors of the Dawes Plan, summing up the results of the implementation of this plan in 1929, noted with satisfaction that 'Germany received as many foreign loans in 5 years as America received in the 40 years preceding the First World War' (1). As a result, Germany, defeated in the war, already in 1929 came in second place in the world in terms of industrial production, surpassing England.

In the 1930s, the process of pumping the German economy with investments and loans continued. For this purpose, in accordance with the Young Plan, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) was established in Switzerland (Basel) in 1930. The official purpose of the BIS was to pay reparations to Germany in favor of the victorious countries. In fact, through the BIS, the movement of money went in the opposite direction - from the United States and England to Germany. By the early 1930s, most of the strategically important companies in Germany belonged to American capital or were partially controlled by it. Some of the capital belonged to British investors. For example, the German oil refining industry and the production of synthetic gasoline from coal belonged to the American corporation Standard Oil (Rockefellers). The core of the German chemical industry was I.G. Farbenindustrie, which came under the control of the Morgan banking house. 40% of the German telephone network and 30% of the shares of the Focke-Wulf aircraft manufacturer belonged to the American company ITT. The core of the German radio and electrical industry was the A.E.G., Siemens, and Osram concerns; they came under the control of the American company General Electric. Both I.T.T. and General Electric were part of the Morgan financial empire. Finally, 100% of the shares of the Volkswagen concern were under the control of the American automobile corporation Ford.

By the time Hitler came to power, all strategically important branches of German industry - oil refining and the production of synthetic fuel, chemical, automotive, aviation, electrical engineering and radio instrumentation, a significant part of mechanical engineering (a total of 278 firms and concerns) were under the full control of American financial capital. In addition, the leading German banks - Deutsche Bank, Dresdner Bank, Donat Bank and a number of others - fell under the control of American capital (2).

***

On January 30, 1933, Hitler became Reich Chancellor. Before that, his candidacy was carefully studied by American bankers. In the autumn of 1930, the chairman of the Reichsbank, J. Schacht, travelled across the ocean in order to discuss with his American counterparts the details of the plan to bring Hitler to power. After Hitler's candidacy and the plan for his political promotion were finally approved at a secret meeting of bankers in the United States, Schacht returned to Germany. Throughout 1932 he worked with German bankers and industrialists to get their full support for Hitler. And such support was received. In mid-November 1932, 17 major bankers and industrialists sent a letter to President Hindenburg demanding the appointment of Hitler as Reich Chancellor. The last working meeting of German financiers before the elections was held on January 4, 1933, at the villa of the well-known German banker Kurt von Schröder near Cologne.

After the National Socialists came to power, Germany's financial, credit, trade and economic relations with the Anglo-Saxon world reached a qualitatively new level. Hitler immediately makes a loud announcement that he refuses to pay reparations. This, naturally, called into question the ability of England and France to repay their debts to the United States on loans from the First World War, but across the ocean they accepted Hitler's statement without any objections. In May 1933, H. Schacht made another visit to the USA. There he meets with US President F. Roosevelt and major bankers and signs an agreement to receive American loans totaling $1 billion. In June of the same year, H. Schacht travels to London and negotiates with M. Norman. Everything happens like in a fairy tale: the British agree to provide the Third Reich with a loan in the amount of $2 billion and at the same time do not object to the suspension of payments for servicing and repayment of British loans previously received by Germany. Some historians believe that an important reason for such accommodating American and British bankers was that the USSR completed the first five-year plan in 1932, which, unexpectedly for the West, led to a sharp strengthening of the economic positions of the Soviet power. Several thousand enterprises were built and put into operation, mainly in heavy industry. The USSR's dependence on imports of machinery and equipment decreased sharply over several years. The prospects of economic strangulation of the Soviet Union had practically disappeared. The bet was placed on war, and the unbridled militarization of Germany began.

The ease of obtaining American loans is also explained by the fact that almost simultaneously with Hitler coming to power in Germany, President Franklin Roosevelt came to power in the United States. He was supported by the same American bankers who supported Hitler in the fall of 1931. The newly elected president could not help but approve of the generous loan gesture in favor of the new regime in Berlin. By the way, many noted the great similarity between Roosevelt's ""new economic course"" in the USA and the economic policy of the Third Reich in Germany. There is nothing surprising about this. The same people, mainly from American financial circles, acted as consultants and developers of economic policy in both countries.

However, the ""new economic course"" of Roosevelt soon began to falter. In 1937, America was again in the abyss of the crisis, and in 1939, industrial capacity utilization in the USA was 33% (at the height of the crisis, 1929-1933 was 19%). Evaluating the situation in the USA in 1939, one of Roosevelt's closest advisors, P. Taguell, wrote: ""In 1939, the government could not achieve any success. Ahead lay the open sea until the day when Hitler invaded Poland. The mist could dispel only the mighty wind of war. Any other measures that were in the hands of Roosevelt would have yielded no results ""(3).

Under these conditions, only world war could become the only salvation for American capitalism. In 1939, the owners of money, using all the levers they had, began to put pressure on Hitler, demanding that he immediately start a big war in the East.

The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) became an important instrument for the policy of the owners of money during the Second World War. It was created as an outpost of American capital in Europe and served as a link between Anglo-Saxon and German capital, a kind of offshore cosmopolitan capital, providing it with protection from various political winds, wars, sanctions, etc. Although the BIS was founded as a commercial public bank, its immunity from government interference and even taxation in both peace and war was guaranteed by an international treaty signed in 1930 in The Hague.

The main initiators of the creation of the BIS were the bankers of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York from Morgan's inner circle, the director of the Bank of England Montagu Norman, the German financiers Hjalmar Schacht, Walther Funk (later replaced H. Schacht as president of the Reichsbank), and Emil Puhl.

The central banks of England, France, Italy, Germany, Belgium, and a number of private banks became the founders of the BIS, which signed the Charter of the Bank. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which actively participated in the creation of the BIS, was not included in the list of founders for political reasons. The United States Charter of the BIS was signed by the First National Bank of New York private banks, ""D. P. Morgan and Company ""and"" First National Bank of Chicago ""- they all belonged to the Morgan Empire. Japan was also represented in the BIS by private banks. In 1931-1932 19 central banks of European countries have joined the Bank for International Settlements. The first president of the BIS was the Rockefeller banker Gates McGarrah. In 1933, he left this post. He was replaced by an American, Leon Frazer, a protégé of the Morgans. During the Second World War, the president of the bank was again the American Thomas Harrington McKitrick.

The Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which actively participated in the creation of the BIS, was not included in the founders for political reasons. On behalf of the United States, the Charter of the BIS was signed by the private banks First National Bank of New York, D. P.

In 1931-1932, 19 central banks of European countries joined the Bank for International Settlements. The first president of the BIS was a banker from the Rockefeller clan, Gates McGarrah. In 1933, he left this post. He was replaced by the American Leon Fraser, a protégé of the Morgans. During the Second World War, the president of the bank was again an American, Thomas Harrington McKittrick.

Much has been written about how the BIS worked in the interests of the Third Reich (4). During the war years, the BIS carried out the calculations of Germany for the supply of goods from different countries, including those for which Germany was a military adversary. After Pearl Harbor, during all the war years, the BIS was still mentioned in all official reference books as a correspondent bank of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. During the war years, the BIS was under the control of the Nazis, but the American Thomas Harrington McKitrick was president of this bank. While soldiers were killed on the fronts, the BIS leadership meetings were held in Basel with the participation of bankers from Germany, Japan, Italy, Belgium, England and the United States. Here, in the Swiss ""banking offshore"", mutual understanding reigned, here there was an intense joint work of representatives of the countries opposing the war.

In an atmosphere of war, the BIS became the place where the gold stolen by Germany in various European countries flowed. In March, 1938, after the Nazis entered Vienna, most of the Austrian gold they had stolen moved to the BIS safes. The same fate befell the gold reserves of the Czech National Bank - 48 million dollars. This was before the start of World War II. After its unleashing, gold flowed into the Bank for International Settlements, which the Third Reich mined in concentration camps and as a result of various raids to rob civilians in the occupied countries (jewelry, gold crowns, cigarette cases, dishes, etc.). This is the so-called Nazi gold. It was usually processed from primary raw materials into standard ingots and sent to the BIS, other Swiss banks or outside Europe. After Pearl Harbor, that is, after the US entered the war, the Bank of International Settlements, according to the data of the American researcher C. Khayem, deposited gold from the Nazis for the sum of $ 378 million.

The history of the seizure of Czech gold by the Third Reich with the help of the BIS is worth saying in a little more detail. The details of this operation became clear after the Bank of England declassified part of its archives in 2012 (5). In March 1939, Hitler's troops captured Prague. The Nazis, threatening with weapons, demanded the surrender of the country's national treasure - gold reserves, estimated at 48 million dollars. Frightened members of the bank's board reported that the gold had already been transferred to the Bank for International Settlements. As it turned out later, the gold from Basel then migrated to the vault of the Bank of England. On command from Berlin, the gold was transferred to the account of the Reichsbank in the BIS, and physically it remained in the Bank of England. Further, the Bank of England began to carry out various operations with gold on commands that went from Berlin (from the Reichsbank) to the BIS, and then were relayed to London. A criminal conspiracy arose between three parties: the Reichsbank of Nazi Germany, the Bank for International Settlements and the Bank of England. By the way, in England in 1939, a real scandal began, since the Bank of England carried out transactions with Czech gold on orders that came from Berlin and Basel, and not from the Czech government. In particular, in June 1939, three months before the declaration of war between Great Britain and Germany, the Bank of England helped the Germans sell 440 thousand pounds sterling worth of gold and transfer part of the German gold reserves to New York (the Germans were sure that in the event of their invasion of Poland, the United States would not declare war). The Bank of England carried out illegal transactions with Czech gold with the tacit consent of the British government, which was aware of the matter. Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, Chancellor of the Exchequer John Simon, and other high-ranking officials were spinning like snakes in a frying pan, resorting to outright lies (they say, the gold was returned to its rightful owner or was not transferred to the Reichsbank at all). Only the recently discovered secret archives of the Bank of England confirm that the top officials of the state lied, covering for themselves, the Bank of England and the Bank for International Settlements. It was convenient to coordinate the joint criminal activities of the Bank of England and the BIS due to the fact that the chairman of the latter throughout the war was Montagu Norman, the director of the Bank of England, who did not hide his fascist sympathies at all.

In 1944, at an international conference in Bretton Woods (USA), where plans for the future world financial order were discussed, the question of the unseemly role of the BIS in the world war and its work for Nazi Germany suddenly surfaced. Omitting many details, I note that at the conference, with great difficulty, it was possible to adopt a resolution to close the BIS (a number of delegates and observers from the United States tried to prevent the adoption of such a resolution). However, the owners of the money ignored the decision of the international conference. And all compromising information related to the activities of the BIS during wartime was classified (6). This also helps today to falsify the history of World War II.

Finally, a few words about the banker and financier Hjalmar Schacht (1877-1970). He was the key figure controlling the economic machine of the Third Reich, the extraordinary and authorized representative of the Anglo-American capital in Germany. In 1945, Schacht was brought to justice by the International Military Tribunal in Nuremberg, but on October 1, 1946 was acquitted. Schacht went unscathed, as did Hitler, who, for inexplicable reasons, was not on the list of top war criminals in 1945. Moreover, Schacht, as if nothing had happened, returned to the German banking sector, founded and headed the Schacht GmbH banking house in Dusseldorf. It would seem that the detail is not worthy of attention, but this fact once again helps to understand that the Second World War was being prepared and partly summed up by the Anglo-American money owners and their authorized representatives in Germany. These same owners of money today want not only to rewrite the history of the Second World War, but also to replay its results.

Finally, a few words about the banker and financier Hjalmar Schacht (1877-1970). He was a key figure in control of the economic machine of the Third Reich, the extraordinary and plenipotentiary representative of Anglo-American capital in Germany. In 1945, Schacht was tried by the International Military Tribunal in Nuremberg, but was acquitted on October 1, 1946. Schacht got away with it just like Hitler, who for inexplicable reasons was not on the list of major war criminals in 1945. Moreover, Schacht returned to the German banking industry as if nothing had happened, founded and headed the banking house Schacht GmbH in Düsseldorf. It would seem that this detail does not deserve attention, but this fact once again helps to understand that the Second World War was prepared and partly summed up by the Anglo-American owners of money and their authorized representatives in Germany. These same owners of money today want not only to rewrite the history of World War II, but also to replay its results.

On January 30, 1933, Hitler became Reich Chancellor. Before that, his candidacy was carefully studied by American bankers. In the autumn of 1930, the chairman of the Reichsbank, J.

In March, 1938, after the Nazis entered Vienna, most of the Austrian gold they had stolen moved to the BIS safes. The same fate befell the gold reserves of the Czech National Bank - 48 million dollars. This was before the start of World War II. After its unleashing, gold flowed into the Bank for International Settlements, which the Third Reich mined in concentration camps and as a result of various raids to rob civilians in the occupied countries (jewelry, gold crowns, cigarette cases, dishes, etc.). This is the so-called Nazi gold. It was usually processed from primary raw materials into standard ingots and sent to the BIS, other Swiss banks or outside Europe. After Pearl Harbor, that is, after the US entered the war, the Bank of International Settlements, according to the data of the American researcher C. Khayem, deposited gold from the Nazis for the sum of $ 378 million.

The history of the seizure of Czech gold by the Third Reich with the help of the BIS is worth saying in a little more detail. The details of this operation became clear after the Bank of England declassified part of its archives in 2012 (5). In March 1939, Hitler's troops captured Prague. The Nazis, threatening with weapons, demanded the surrender of the country's national treasure - gold reserves, estimated at 48 million dollars. Frightened members of the bank's board reported that the gold had already been transferred to the Bank for International Settlements. As it turned out later, the gold from Basel then migrated to the vault of the Bank of England. On command from Berlin, the gold was transferred to the account of the Reichsbank in the BIS, and physically it remained in the Bank of England. Further, the Bank of England began to carry out various operations with gold on commands that went from Berlin (from the Reichsbank) to the BIS, and then were relayed to London. A criminal conspiracy arose between three parties: the Reichsbank of Nazi Germany, the Bank for International Settlements and the Bank of England. By the way, in England in 1939, a real scandal began, since the Bank of England carried out transactions with Czech gold on orders that came from Berlin and Basel, and not from the Czech government. In particular, in June 1939, three months before the declaration of war between Great Britain and Germany, the Bank of England helped the Germans sell 440 thousand pounds sterling worth of gold and transfer part of the German gold reserves to New York (the Germans were sure that in the event of their invasion of Poland, the United States would not declare war). The Bank of England carried out illegal transactions with Czech gold with the tacit consent of the British government, which was aware of the matter. Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, Chancellor of the Exchequer John Simon, and other high-ranking officials were spinning like snakes in a frying pan, resorting to outright lies (they say, the gold was returned to its rightful owner or was not transferred to the Reichsbank at all). Only the recently discovered secret archives of the Bank of England confirm that the top officials of the state lied, covering for themselves, the Bank of England and the Bank for International Settlements. It was convenient to coordinate the joint criminal activities of the Bank of England and the BIS due to the fact that the chairman of the latter throughout the war was Montagu Norman, the director of the Bank of England, who did not hide his fascist sympathies at all.

In 1944, at an international conference in Bretton Woods (USA), where plans for the future world financial order were discussed, the question of the unseemly role of the BIS in the world war and its work for Nazi Germany suddenly surfaced. Omitting many details, I note that at the conference, with great difficulty, it was possible to adopt a resolution to close the BIS (a number of delegates and observers from the United States tried to prevent the adoption of such a resolution). However, the owners of the money ignored the decision of the international conference. And all compromising information related to the activities of the BIS during wartime was classified (6). This also helps today to falsify the history of World War II.

Finally, a few words about the banker and financier Hjalmar Schacht (1877-1970). He was the key figure controlling the economic machine of the Third Reich, the extraordinary and authorized representative of the Anglo-American capital in Germany. In 1945, Schacht was brought to justice by the International Military Tribunal in Nuremberg, but on October 1, 1946 was acquitted. Schacht went unscathed, as did Hitler, who, for inexplicable reasons, was not on the list of top war criminals in 1945. Moreover, Schacht, as if nothing had happened, returned to the German banking sector, founded and headed the Schacht GmbH banking house in Dusseldorf. It would seem that the detail is not worthy of attention, but this fact once again helps to understand that the Second World War was being prepared and partly summed up by the Anglo-American money owners and their authorized representatives in Germany. These same owners of money today want not only to rewrite the history of the Second World War, but also to replay its results.

Finally, a few words about the banker and financier Hjalmar Schacht (1877-1970). He was a key figure in control of the economic machine of the Third Reich, the extraordinary and plenipotentiary representative of Anglo-American capital in Germany. In 1945, Schacht was tried by the International Military Tribunal in Nuremberg, but was acquitted on October 1, 1946. Schacht got away with it just like Hitler, who for inexplicable reasons was not on the list of major war criminals in 1945. Moreover, Schacht returned to the German banking industry as if nothing had happened, founded and headed the banking house Schacht GmbH in Düsseldorf. It would seem that this detail does not deserve attention, but this fact once again helps to understand that the Second World War was prepared and partly summed up by the Anglo-American owners of money and their authorized representatives in Germany. These same owners of money today want not only to rewrite the history of World War II, but also to replay its results.

Of course that protest observe the u of t contest and those in the united states are to register solidarity with those who are in gaza, and the palestinians, as the war with israel continues, israel and hamas. And this morning as we turn to that story next, the graphic images and details are emerging from the southern gaza city of rafah, and an israeli air strike on a camp for displaced people has reportedly claimed more than 30 lives and sparked international outrage. >> Videos from the scene show ambulances racing to the site, intense fires burning and the scramble to pull survivors from the rubble. It's happened less than three days after the U.N. world court ordered israeli forces to abandon their rafah offensive. Now, sarah coates is track being the very latest out of tel aviv for us, and sarah, as I mentioned, there's plenty of anger over this air strike. I just want to bring in unindication of that from canada. Ndp leader jagmeet singh has joined the outcry. He has posted on social media this message. The world is failing the people of gaza. Canada is failing the people of gaza. We must do everything we can to stop this. So indicative of some of the feeling of what has happened, sarah, take us through what did in fact take place and more of the reactions. >> Good morning, heather. According to the hamas-run gaza health ministry and also doctors on the ground, this strike an israeli-designated safe zone in the northwestern part of rafah. Extremely disturbing images are coming through people pulling charred bodies of what appears to be a large container with people on the ground saying that this is where many displaced people were sheltering. Now, a paramedic has just come out to tell asp that this is one of the deadliest attacks since the beginning of the war. We've also heard from israel's military prosecutor who is describing this incident as very grave. The idf has come out to release the statement saying idf aircraft has struck a compound in which significant terrorists were operating, that the strikes were carried out against legitimate targets and international law through the use of precise munitions and on the basis of precise intelligence. Now, the military says it eliminated a hamas chief of staff officer a west bank, also another official from that area, with the idf acknowledging that several civilians have been injured, saying the incident is now under review. Now, the U.N. palestinian age aidsy unrwa has posted on x, we haven't established communications with our colleagues on the ground saying we are extremely concerned for their well-being. No place is safe, no one is safe. Also heard from the eu's of foreign policy chief joseph burrill calling on both sides to respect the ruling handed down by the international court of justice. >> This is really the limit. Housing international community can make -- implement a war. Force into -- international court ofs. >> So that word from josep borrell. Now, the air strike on this camp followed hours after hamas launched a big rocket attack on tel aviv whereby you are, first time there in months, and yet despite all of this renewed military action there's hopes that talks on a new cease-fire and hostage release may start again this week. What do we know about that right now? >> Certainly word of hope, heather, but really in saying that not much optimism. We do need recall that hamas wants comprehensive cease-fire. Israel says that that simply will not happen. We've also heard from the qataris. The qataris are of course a key mediator in the hostage negotiations coming out to say that this strike on rafah could hinder the potential negotiations which could kick off as you said this week. You also mentioned this large rocket attack on central israel yesterday. It was less than 24 hours ago, air raid sirens ringing out here in tel aviv for the first time in four months really causing a lot of panic, a lot of confusion right across the city. People ran to shelter. A lot of these missiles were intercepted by the iron dome missile defence system although one directly hit a home just north of where I am standing.

very important to mention that hamas has come out to claim this barrage of rockets and all of them did come from rafah, heather. >> Sarah, thank you so much. Sarah coates live from tel aviv this morning. >> In canada today, there are thousands of people from fort nelson and nearby fort nelson first nation who have the go-ahead to return home today. About 47 people had to flee their homes over two weeks ago after wildfires threaten their communities. Well, those orders are being lifted as of 8:00 A.M. local today and maryann is here with the count down for their return, good morning. >> Good morning, heather, yeah, a lot of residents have been counting down to the day that they could return back home. It's finally here later this morning but they are being told to be patient. Several essential workers were allowed in the community in the days leading up to this morning to make sure they could get things up and running afternoons as they can but residents returning home today are being told they have to be prepared, that means topping up things like fuel, making sure you return home with several details of food and other essentials you may need abuse it's going to take some time for your community to get back to normal. They haven't been home since may the 10th, when the evacuation orlando was put in place for the fort nelson and fort nelson first nation and many of those residents, 4700 of them or so went south to the community of fort saint john. When they return to their homes they will see damage there. In fort nelson, 10 properties were destroyed, include four homes that were completely damaged. In the area of the fort nelson first nation, no properties were damaged there because of the parker lake fire but some areas of cultural significance were destroyed in the area around snake river. So keep that in mind. Either way, residents are feeling optimistic including one woman who said the community will band together. >> A lot of people are going to have to do a lot of cleaning in their houses. I expect to find a lot of garbage, like, strewn about town from the bears. I've heard that the bears have been coming into town and going through everybody's garbage at night. I moved away for a couple of years and then I went back because the community is so strong together and I love going into the store and, like, talking to people, saying hello, passing by. I think everybody -- I feel like everybody's going to be in good spirits and happy to be ohome absee each other. >> Now, things like water, electricity, sewage, that's all back up and running. But if you have specialized health care needs, the advice from officials in fort nelson is maybe delay your return because right now any in patient emergency care is still being transferred out to areas outside of fort nelson. There's also going to be a reception centre there and also this hotline I should mention for anyone who may need help returning home, (250)775-0933 if you need that extra help. >> The people who do get go to go home and I think I said 4, I missed 4700, that's obviously a broader return than 47. But the evacuation order has ended but the evacuation alert continues, right? >> Yes, the evacuation alert essentially means that, yes, they are back home but they have to be ready to leave again at a moment's notice because the fires continue to burn. Not only the parker lake fire as you can see there but also the patrick creek wildfire nortel of fort nelson. That's bigger than the parker lake fire. It's been burning since 2023 and then there are other fires in the area. That's why they are getting home, they can start cleaning up but they can't get too comfortable. Here's the message from the mayor of fort nelson. >> We will be putting on an evacuation alert because there are still some fires out there, the conditions around the region are still extremely dry, and we'll need to be thinking about the potential for another fire over this long season that we've got coming. We're expecting thunder and lightning storms which of course can create their own fires, never mind the holdover fires that are out there. >> So in addition to overseeing the return of residents in fort nelson and the fort nelson first nation, also keeping an eye on those conditions which the bc wildfire service, heather, is saying there's volatile wildfire conditions. >> Listening there to that clip from mayor rob fraser, he's going to join us as he has often over the course of the story. We'll talk to him around 8:15 eastern, 5:15 local for the very latest on that return to fort nelson today. >> There's a new study out from montreal children's hospital that shows an average of one child a day in quebec goes to the emergency room, one child every day for drowning or near drowning during the summer. It's an alarming number, so alarming that the study's author is planning to release the study later in the fall say they needed to speak out now. >> Either we search or I find that number high. But as a parent, I found that number concerning. It's certainly high enough for me to be more vigilant with my own family. >> The researchers found that for every fatal drowning, ten

kids are hospitalized. The number one cause of drowning accidents, lack every supervision. Younger kids aged 1 to 4 were the most likely to drown in backyard pools. For older kids, the danger is more from open water, lakes and rivers. Quebec government requires all new backyard pools to be fenced in, but pools need before 2010, if they were built before that year, they were to be fenced in by october of 2025. >> As many as 120 million people in the united states remain under an extreme weather threat this morning, after a weekend of deadly storms. Officials say 18 people are dead across texas, oklahoma, arkansas and kentucky. Four children are among the dead. At least 11 tornadoes were spotted yesterday alone, one in texas over the weekend had winds hitting nearly 220 kilometers per hour. >> Grab my dog, we headed for there and it just -- it was just unbelievable the sound of all of the destruction going on around us. >> More than 640,000 homes and businesses across 13 states were reported without power as of late last night. Extreme heat forecast to today, which is a holiday in the u.s., could send the temperatures as high as 45° in houston and austin, texas. Steve storms are now forecast for U.S. east coast south from new england. >> A horrifying development in a disaster in papa new guinea. Authorities now say more than 2,000 people could be buried alive by a landslide that hit a remote mountain village in the south pacific nation last frit. Government officials have a dire warning about the rescue effort as well, saying few of those buried will likely be saved because damaged roads mean rescuers can't get happy equipment to the disaster zone. Some parts of the village runed as much as 8 meters every debris. Officials say so far only 6 bodies have been recovered. >> Another severe turbulence incident is under investigation this morning. 12 people were hurt, eight of them needing treatment in hospital after a qatar airlines flight dropped for more than 5 seconds on a flight to dublin. Yvette britain has the latest details. >> It was very scary. It was the worst experience, honestly. >> Shaken but safe. Qatar airways passengers on a flight from doha to dublin recall violent turbulence over turkey. >> We were on the plane, and we saw the flight attendants go up in the air and come stay right there back down. >> Panic, look of panic everywhere. >> Passengers say the plane seemed to drop suddenly during food and drink service, 12 injured,le taken to hospital, this only days after more than 100 single pour passenger passengers were injured after turbulence hit a flight to england over myanmar. One passenger with a heart condition died. >> It can happen very suddenly without any warning alberta all. >> The national transportation safety board says turbulence accounts for more than a third every accidents on airplanes and can cause severe injury. >> If you are not strapped in, there's a good chance you are going to get brain or upper spinal injuries. So while -- even though the seatbelt sign is off, while you are seated, keep that belt fastened. >> Singapore airlines changed safety rules after tuesday's turbulence to stop serving hot meals and drinks when the seatbelt sign is on. Researchers warn that air turbulence events are increasing and becoming more difficult to predict. >> I do think that we need to continually re-evaluate that in the face of the reality that these things are more frequent and more severe than before. >> In a statement to cbc, qatar airways said the boeing flight is now under internal investigation. Safety and security of their top priority. >> So, yeah, it was just atrocious. Never again. >> This man walked away with just torn clothes and questions how he plans to transfer next time. Yvette britain, cbc news, vancouver. >> There's a new call today for facebook to do more to crack down on scammers. A new brunswick woman is going public after her account was hacked and hijacked, and her friends targeted. As rosa marchitelli reports, if are are a fan of social media you should be vigilant because this scam is still making the rounds on line. >> We've stayed in touch through facebook and messenger, right, over the years. >> These former neighbours were reunited after being suckled into a facebook scam that's designed to play on the goodwill every friends. Here's what happened. A fraudster packed lisa laurie's account, pretending to be her they posted an ad claiming she

was selling her dad's things after he moved into long-term care. Several friends sent e transfer deposit losing thousands of dollars, including carol stevens. >> I thought it was my friend lisa. And she's the most honest, trustworthy person I know. >> Lisa and her friends repeatedly reported the crime in progress to facebook. But the company did nothing to stop it. >> They had a lot of people saying this is a scam and they didn't do anything about it. >> Last year, canadians lost a reported $174 million in social media scams, according to the canadian antifraud centre. And there's more. Go public found page after page of the same scam running rampant on facebook, same words, same photos. So we asked meta, the company behind facebook, why it's failing to remove a scam it already knows about. It didn't respond. >> As a result, what turns -- what starts as a small issue is exacerbated into a massive identity theft or identity fraud. >> Meta made about $185 billion in revenue last year. The cyber crime expert says it's time it invests more into protecting users. >> The organizations need to respond to people's actual needs. >> Posing as a customer, go public contacted several of the scammers. >> He wants 300 up front, okay? >> When we called one of them out and asked if facebook had ever shut them town, they didn't seem board. Meta says over 15,000 reviewers across the globe review potential violations on facebook and instagram and receive in-depth training. The two women say they've lost trust in social media but they are grateful to have someone they can trust back in their lives. >> We will not go so long before our next visit together. >> Rosa marchitelli, cbc news, calgary. >> Here's what else you should know as you start your monday morning.

This vision of the princess of wales is generating as much talk as the latest official portrait of king charles, and today on commotion, ella mine is going to dignity into the controversies, that's on the cbc radio and cbc listen appear. >> Is marine collagen is a billion dolbies often considered a greener alternative to beef-based supplements, but what it is it mean for all of the fish?

Now bravery is our victory. - -[crowd cheers] >> Heather: starting this week, our last week of may with chris. And I don't know about you, but I woke to a big-time rumbling last tight, chris. >> Yes, indeed, there were storms coming up, even severe warm storms in southwestern ontario and down in the U.S. it was a very tumultuous and in some cases deadly weekend, thunderstorms with this cold front moving eastwards across the U.S. and our low pressure systems over the great lakes and let's zoom in here. We still have some lingering thunderstorms between kingston and pet bahama with a, another line here northeast of montreal, and we're going to get into multiple rounds every showers and thunderstorms today. So a pretty good breeding ground for this to occur. Humid air, round one, moving -- round one happening now, round 2 this afternoon and evening, and likely even a third round 2. So the heaviest amounts of rain and the best chance of thunderstorms today and tonight, because tomorrow will be a little more scattered in nature and cooling down too. So anywhere in orange means you've got a risk of severe weather. And the primary concern here, heavy downpours, damaging winds, especially this afternoon and evening, eastern ontario and southern quebec with those batch of storms and possibly some hail as well. And temperatures start to cool down. So a far cry from the upper 20's and humidity in the low 30's, temperatures will be in the upper teens, but at least some drier weather wednesday into thursday, quebec as well, montreal you will feel some of that cool down as well. But a couple of days of unsettled weather to be sure. A fair-weather for most of the maritimes today, just a misty foggy start. Lab, very mild, eastern newfoundland on the cool side but high pressure there. But that will give way to the storms moving from ontario and quebec today into the maritimes tomorrow. So it will be your turn to get into some thunderstorms. And if you are in the wreckhouse area or plan to travel tuesday night into wednesday, that might be a no-no. We have strong winds headed enroute. >> The weather update is brought to you by off cast mosquito forecast.

It's odd how in an instant things can transform. Slipping out of balance into freefall. (The stock market is now down 23%). This is happening people. Where there are so few certainties... (laughing) Look around you. You deserve to know. as we navigate a future unknown. I'm glad I found stability amidst it all. Gold. Standing the test of time. Oh Canada!! their time has come Argentina have done it! One more Messi moment! Beyond glorious! Messi magic once again This is it...the stage is set That's what they came for!! And it is spectacular!! >> Another live look at 10 downing street in london, england, where today we learned U.K. residents will be heading to the polls this summer. British prime minister rishi sunak delivering the statement outside 10 downing just moments ago, we announced a general election will be held july, the 4th. Joining me now is tom brooks, a policy adviser and durham university professor of law and government professor, thanks very much for joining us. There had been speculation that it will later in the year election. Is this a surprise this? >> I think surprised if there is was that there was figures today about government borrowing levels, which meant that there governments hopes of of announcing some of the tax cuts looked like that was not going to happen. Small boat arrivals have been at a record level. This of the government has made a big planter stopping the boats across the english channel and and removing people pending asylum to rwanda and so on. It's happened going to to plan. And I think that might just must have been made. I know that these things are going to be any better over the next couple months. And so they called it now, things wouldn't be any worse. They might be a couple months ended with them too, to catch out of their own labour party, scottish nationalists and others. Maybe hoping their work prepared for this moment, but I suspect it's the worst secret in everyone because it had to happen this year and happen fairly soon anyway. So a surprise of sorts. >> The conservatives are trailing in the polls as soon as himself a within the party is having some issues can that what do they have to do to even have a hope of winning? >> I think it's, it's a very tall order for them to and I think one of the calculations they must get done is think about how much more terrible the result might be if they waited another couple months. Interest rates have gotten a bit better, but they're much higher than they were a few years ago as living standards and the U.K. are worse now than they were 14 years ago. People in my county county, durham right now don't have access to nhs dentist survey forced to go private. They want to access a dentist. You've got the constituency areas the police are not investigating were burglaries and where the place up and judge has been told not to sentence people because of overcrowding in the presence of a lot of things aren't going very well. And I think again, the judge has probably it's a good now to the polls. It's that off. Things aren't as bad as they might with the where there might be small, more small boats, people thing, higher and so on and so forth. I suspect it's a it's a damage limitation rather march to some so you think trait remembered something interesting about this prime minister is that no one's everybody for him, he's never let his party in a general election. He also lost the conservative party leadership contest to the stress. It was the shortest

serving prime minister need the following boris johnson's. There's a nation. So we've got somebody is says not even when his own parties members from kind of leaving it to only a few more months anyway, to call a general election. So yeah, I think he looked at that, the winds blowing and thought now was was better than any later than it did so we'll find out shortly. >> What kind of we're like the scottish party be your party's not consider the 2 main street. >> Yeah, I think that they could be a factor of sorts. I think that the, the main rees, the main factor, the scottish national party. I have this at the the in scotland did incredibly well winning virtually all its most in that that's in westminster did incredibly well. The problem for the s&p is that they want a lot of these by a narrow margin to next. And the honourable and wears later had a very the there and let them know that there's been a kind of political crisis of a very popular leader in scotland resigned her husband rested. It's been a number of things going on in s and the politics thanks to the north of the border. I think that. The s&p fortunes will make a difference. But I think that the difference will be looking for it's how many seats labour can win. Often the conservatives have not done particularly well in scotland for some time that I would not expect them to do now, but they could help make a real difference to weather. Keir starmer labour been outright majority or that we have a hung parliament. >> Ok professor, thank you very much for your analysis. Appreciation. Thom brooks as a policy adviser you know, the university professor of law and government. Norway, spain and ireland have announced their intention to formally recognize a palestinian state. A declaration that would go into effect on tuesday. >> I've spoken with a number of of the heaters and counterparts. I'm confident that for other countries will join us and taking this important step in the coming weeks. >> Leaders from the 3 countries say they hope the move brings new momentum toward a two-state solution. Adding it's not a decision against israel or one in favour of hamas, but instead it is in support of peace. Israel, they're angry reaction here, calling the decision distorted. And israel has now recalled its ambassadors to ireland, norway and spain. Some of their envoys hamas. Meantime, welcome the move and is calling on other nations to follow suit. Joining me now is michael lynk, former un special rapporteur for the situation of human rights in the palestinian territory from 2016 2 2022 michael, thank you very much for joining us. Thank you, roger, for having me. Does this is this a surprise move, your reaction to this? Are we expecting something like this? >> Well, I think there have been signals for some time that some european countries are going to do this. I think there had been a push for the eu as a to recognize the palestine as a we already have a handful of european countries have done this, this move today by norway, spain and ireland. I think will that will start much bigger snowball going down the mountain. We're expecting bill jim slovakia's. So the source will to probably to make a similar declaration the next couple days. And there may will be others. So who will soon follow them? So I think there's a recognition that same, we recognize palestine as a state does not bring a vote palestine as a state. But it does show, I think that world's increasing impatience with israel and its blockage of avenue or any path for the palestinians to achieve statehood. Now with this. >> Break help convince israel that maybe they need to find a peace accord or is this going to drive them further into the corner? >> Will be we know that the israeli current israeli government says it will never be a palestinian state under its watch. That's that's a fairly broad consensus among a number of the centre and the right there's really not politics, even if they say they accept a palestinian state, they don't accept a palestinian state on the 1967 boundaries, which is what international law would wind up demanding. So my sense is israel right now is overstepping its feet and quite angry. Its recalled its ambassadors from norway and spain and ireland. But I don't think there's much reversal that's in the courage that israel would have any effect on in changing minds with regards to this. And I think it's going to leave it increasingly even more isolated

than it is already. And probably drinking along united states with it. Now opponents of said this rewards terrorism. Your thoughts on that. Well, I I think irish knows the norwegian prime minister or foreign affairs minister said today this is a reward with respect to hamas and terrorism. It is a a slap in the face to israel. It's a recognition of something of that that's been long that international law and international diplomacy has long accepted that there has to be a palestinian state in the hope is, I guess is that by recognizing a palestinian state, a long time demand of the palestinian authority. It will give more legitimacy to the palestinian authority and take away some of the legitimacy that hamas has gained in taking on israel over the last 7 months. Now internally, though, is that is there any hope of a palestinian state? >> If if it's the palestinian authority running it. And hamas has pushed out. >> O we'll have to see where the with the dust settles out at the end of the war on gaza. Hamas is book is going to come out of the war, likely both weaker and stronger, weaker in the sense that it's had a lot of its military capacity destroyed and that its ability to govern gaza has probably been taken away from it. But there also is, I think, a strong sentiment of palestinian popular opinion leaning simply they are seen to be standing up to israel and be like poking it in the nose in a way that the palestinians authorities seem to be much weaker in being able to confront israel and to make any meaningful change on the ground. You mentioned the U.S. earlier, where does this leave them? Increasingly isolated with israel. The united states has has taken a long time position that it will. It supports a palestinian state. It will only support a palestinian state at the end of negotiations with israel. I think what you know that the announcement today by these 3 european countries are saying there is no from a path forward for palestinian state, which we all say we support given the determination can by the current israeli government to oppose want. So it makes, I think american argument saying, well, we should support a peace process and well, we should support a palestinian state only at the end of that. Negotiations seem increasingly hollow and and on persuasive. >> And for other countries that will not acknowledge it or recognize like canada, where does that leave them? >> Well, canada up until very recently had taken the same position of the united states is that they wouldn't recognize a palestinian state unless and until it emerged from negotiations with israel. I think we're going to see some daylight between the canadian position and the american position simply because I think there's a there's a recognition of the true facts on the ground that others. Now 740,000 israeli settlers in occupied east jerusalem and the west bank that israelis government has made it very clear they're not supporting a palestinian state. So canada's now same, we reserve the option now to recognize palestine as a state sooner than what negotiations may produce. So this will put, I think, even more pressure on canada to begin to make some hard decisions on its stance towards israel and palestine. >> Okay michael, thank you very much for your insight and analysis. Roger, thanks again for having me. Michael lake is a former un special rapporteur for the situation of human rights in the palestinian territory from 2016 to 2022.

In her suit, crystal mckinney claims she was drugged in sexually assaulted by combs at his new york city recording studio in 2003. Its latest lawsuit comes just days after surveillance video service showing comes physically attacking his then girlfriend cassie ventura and 2016 and filed a lawsuit against the rapper november. But the case was settled shortly after. Joining me now is new, my rahmani, a former federal prosecutor and president of west coast trial lawyers. My, thank you very much for joining us. >> O thanks. 70 roger. >> This new charge, new lawsuit. What are we looking at in this one? >> Yet another victim was come forward and alleged physical and sexual abuse by sean diddy combs. And this is bad news, not just because it's going to cost them money, but it makes it even more likely that in the face criminal charges against the sunni too much pressure on prosecutors to many victims. And that video that was released on friday showing that severe physical of it is that domestic violence prosecutors are going to have to act. I think it's a matter of when you get to and I did not this. >> It is, why is that is it is it is this political pressure on them. Now. >> Well, every prosecutor in the country is either elected or appointed by someone who isn't. There's a lot of pressure on folks to bring its tax, the rich and powerful men in hollywood to justice. There's a perception that they're able to escape justice because of their financial. It's the ability to hire the best and the most expensive lawyers. But when you have victim after that, this coming forward and really raising much of the same allegation coming too much for prosecutors to ignore going forward. And let's not forget. Federal prosecutors had enough evidence to get a search warrant for 2 of that is home and miami and los angeles, where I am. And if you can rent a federal judge, those home have evidence of a crime. It's not too far removed to come in that same judge that there's enough evidence to get an arrest warrant for good. >> And with the the accusation in this in this most recent one. How does it look? Is it a strong case? >> Well, that's similar to some of the other accusations involving sexual assault and obvious that cash isn't sure

case. But by far the strongest said the longest lasting relationship with did 11 years. And she was the first in that really, it expired a me too movement after she filed her lawsuit their november, even though it was settled the following that, the minute she alleged terrible. Really sexual abuse, including in rape and sexual abuse of minors. So I think hers is by far the strongest case, even though it was settled already. >> Diddy's apology video that he released a few days ago. Will this help or hurt him? >> Well, then it too little too late. It's not for that one cat who first filed dubois came out that these were baseless and outrageous lies. And did he did post that apology on instagram on sunday, but really, it was all so now it the treatment and therapy. But again, we apologize. And 6 months later, when it was clear to the entire world, you are physically abuse in ex-girlfriend. That wasn't particularly moving in my opinion. >> So what's next? What are we looking at? >> Next is the waiting game for, did he? So obviously, there's civil cases that are pending, but really those criminal charges, I fully expect that should a drop. I wouldn't be surprised if he's charged in a rico indictment similar to our kelly. We're talking about a really a pattern of sexual abuse in the video that we saw this weekend. I expect. One of the people it kathy venture. >> Okay, we've lost him at the end there. We were just wrapping up this interview. Nima, if you can hear us. Thank you very much for joining us. We your analysis.

Tends to cause more storms in the atlantic. There are already record temperatures for the atlantic ocean. Hurricanes draw energy from warm ocean water is really lining up to be active season in the atlantic. The 2024 hurricane forecast predicts 17 to 25 named storms up from an average of 14 8 to 13 hurricanes in the forecast is a jump from the average of 7. The forecast also calls for 4 to 7 major hurricanes. The previous average is only 3 hurricanes making landfall are difficult to predict, even drawing an active season. But it's also worth noting 2022 was not an act of season. It was an average hurricane season, but that was the year fiona made landfall here in the maritimes hurricane fiona caused more than 800 million dollars in damage, leaving physical and emotional scars.

Our goal in gaza is especially emphasized here in rafah, said israel's defence minister while visiting troops today destroy hamas return the hostages and maintain freedom of operation. He says. Now today's attacks by hamas, a show of resiliency that now has some questioning whether israel's goal of fully eliminating hamas. >> Can be achieved. >> Trucks are entering gaza through southern israel today. Comes on the heels of a new agreement to bypass the rafah crossing with egypt on friday. The international court of justice ordered israel to open the rafah crossing to allow for the flow of aid. Egypt refuses to reopen its side of the rafah crossing until control of the gaza side is handed back to palestinians. >> More than 95% of that has come in for the past 7 months.

This as a deadline approaches for them to remove their camp. Cp24's andrew brennan joins us live with the latest on this. Andrew looks as though the encampment still very much there before but behind you rather, they have about till 8:00am tomorrow morning. But a lot happening between now and them. >> A lot happening, although the question is lindsay, will that change anything because ultimately as things stand right now, the people that have been in this encampment going on. 25 days hit nearly hitting 3, 3, a, I should say, hitting almost 4 weeks really that by this point, they have no plans on leaving. As things stand, even after 8:00am, they're not expecting to be wheeled out of here by police. At 8:00 on monday morning. They're expecting first of all that there, there will a court injunction that will be filed. That's happening, we know tomorrow morning. According to only the demonstrators. But what the university of toronto says its trespass notice, which is on the fence behind me that you notice of trespass. Now after that, potentially there could some form of removal in the days to come. That's what the expectation is, at least the plans are for the demonstrators here. But as you can see, looking at bird's eye view of the encampment shot

today. One thing that's really has seemingly changes where the proposals are at the proposal from the university was said was turned down by that from protesters earlier on. I should say it just before the weekend started and they've offered counter proposals today. Here's some of what they're saying that they want. And also a little bit more from what they wanted to share with the media ahead of their meeting at 5:00pm today. >> Ut has filed for an injunction ab to call the police to come at U.S. encampment. And that injunction being filed at 8:00am tomorrow morning in court. And that process will take a couple days. So we actually don't anticipate police showing up at 8:00am tomorrow. We are holding a rally with members of cupe and the ontario federation for labour tomorrow morning at 8:00am at to ensure that, you know, if there is a police escalation, we have lots of supports and students who are here, but ultimately, we're not anticipating that because ut has gone to the process of filing this motion. And this injunction with the court. And they've got the process of hiring a very expensive, very notorious law firm to do their bidding for them. And so it will probably take a couple days and we'll have to wait and see what the injunctions s. >> In the interest of transparency in correcting the record. We feel it's important to publicize are negotiating process. Offer. We're given by the administration on thursday. It's more for restatement of university policy that is an actual offer. Most of what was outlined in the document are processes that could have been initiated by students before the encampment. The force being to administration. The same processes that we know time and again and then failure because president gertler has the authority to simply say no to the recommendation of a committee that he stacks himself. >> Now as for the prospect in court with facing this injunction, one thing those 2 protesters who at the at the front of the, the meeting for the, the press conference earlier saying is they feel that they have good chances looking at what happened, for instance, at mcgill university in montreal, where there was 2 injunctions that were filed against the encampment. There. Both the both actually fall off failing in corsi encampment sticking around, even after both of those went through the legal process.

And 25 million doses of ecstasy, both considered intelligence winds at canada's borders. >> In a report calling for improved training and tools it provides in it important kind of insight into hidden part of the work of canada border services agency. An internal review made public this month found insufficient access to intelligence training for officers and analysts calling it one of the major challenges that could pose risks to the agency with new recruits often working 7 months or more without formal intelligence training. Cbsa has been struggling since its creation. You know, this is now at 2 decades ago to transform it into what is often called an intelligence led organization. And intelligence expert wesley wark says that's critical because of a growing focus on spotting national security threats, including from the trove of data online that can be open sourced, but isn't always sewn together. The report recommending better technology on that front. It's a combination of taking raw data using artificial intelligence using human analytical capabilities to come up with an intelligence picture.

While the cbsa says as a result of this report, it's reviewing its training standards, certifying 12 new instructors at its own training college identifying data gaps and new technology to help and mapping out a new way to measure goals and outcomes. The key message that comes out is that that big intelligence capabilities that cbsa needs are not really at at that point that they, are required to be what the agency didn't attached to its plan is a timeline. And tonight, the union representing border workers, which could strike next month, tells me what they really need are another 2 to 3,000 staff for all areas of their work and assurances that new technology will complement workers. >> Not replace them. >> Well, that told yesterday's russian attack on a ukrainian shopping centre has risen to 14 people.

Canada leaving prague without a medal at the world hockey championship. Thanks to a come from behind win by sweden. From 299 queen street west. You're watching toronto's breaking news cp24. Good afternoon. I'm phil perkins. Thanks for joining us. Our top story. Police say one person has been injured in a stabbing at fairview mall near don mills and sheppard. They say they were called around 12 30 this afternoon about a woman who was stabbed by a man who is known to her while security was able to detain the suspect. Paramedics have since taken the woman hospital. They say her injuries are serious. And pro-palestinian demonstrators at the university of toronto cabbage will be meeting with school officials later today. For more negotiations. This as a deadline approaches for them to remove their camp. Cp24's andrew brennan joins us live with the latest standard. >> Well, phil, that deadline is a and tomorrow and one thing is based on how the university says it's going to be handling conceivably that demonstrators that are here in their tents, dozens upon dozens behind me here at king's college circle. What the university has said is that they will be filing an injunction in the morning at in the courts. And with that expectation, the demonstrators here say they have, they have no indication that there thinking are going to be any police officers kicking them off of campus and removing them and their tents tomorrow. They say that they will be steadfastly staying here, not just until they are, I told potentially forced potentially to leave, but that they wants to stay until their demands are met. And they shared some of those renewed demands with that. Fry with reporters today outside of simcoe hall just beside where we're standing right now. And those demands updated since the offer they got from the university, giving them this ultimatum of 8:00am on monday. It's take it or leave it, get out situation. The essential crux doubt it comes down to essentially changing between what the university is offering as in some cases, working groups or committees to look at some of the demands instead of support pointing towards the university's president and saying that he can unilaterally do a lot of the changes that they're asking for and removing the committee has something in the middle of their demands for boycotting. For instance, israeli institutions and those that they say would be a b tied to the war in gaza or looking at any divestments from universal for many israeli companies, that potentially could be part of the war or sanctions. They're

out. So that is essential changes that they've offered in their counterproposal. They'll be presenting that to the university administration later on today. As you mentioned, feel at 5:00pm. That meeting will take place. And then to 15 hours after that is when this deadline hits for them too. Leave without potential consequences. But they say they plan to stay. They also have a legal team that will be presenting their case in court as this injunction goes before a judge just for the university seeking that injunction.

Pro-palestinian demonstrators at the u of t encampment will be meeting with school officials later today. For more negotiations. This as a deadline approaches for them to remove their camp. Cp24's andrew brennan joins us now with all the latest. What are you hearing from protesters there? Andrew? >> Well, melissa, what will we will be hearing is a counter proposal from demonstrators and we'll have that for our viewers later on into the afternoon. The other thing that we've been hearing from protesters at this encampment who have been here now for 3 and a half weeks. 24 days since made a second is the proposal offered by the administration in given out by the president in a press conference at the end of the week was ultimately not much different, not much to add versus what they have offered. The demonstrators that have been out here for 3 and a half weeks before includes having a working guide advisory committee be set a potentially to look at any forms of

divestments. But that is something that the university ultimately says it has no plans to do. It does say it's open to potentially looking at disclosure, but there will be no boycott. When you look at the trifecta of and this goes back to about 2004, 2005. Just as gaza became more of an enclave at that time, there was a movement called bds boycott, divest and sanction. And that's I tactic used by pro-palestinian. Either demonstrators are palestinians themselves for about 20 years now. Now there is no plan according to the university, in their latest statement to look at any boycotts end of partnerships with israeli institutions. Academic or otherwise. We're starting to hear some of the loudspeakers coming out from this encampment that what the demonstrators have renamed king from king's college circle in to us. They circle for a free hollis 9 now, as I mentioned, they will be sharing some of their counter proposals and demands that they will be bringing to the table at 5:00pm with the administration. Also a press conference has been called for 11:30am tomorrow, which is following the deadline that was set by the administration and is on the notice of trespass on the front gates right behind me that just says says they want to see all of the demonstrators out by 8:00am conceivably indicating that the people that are here. Have no plans to leave despite the threat of legal proceedings. Now when it comes to potential injunction that could be filed against these demonstrators as a tactic that has been used before by other universities. And notably in the case of mcgill university, where there were 2 injunctions filed against the demonstrators there at that encampment. Both of those failed in recent weeks. Now, melissa will send it back to you and have more from the demonstrators and their demands. Coming up later on in the show. Yeah, the hours ahead will be consequential for this encampment at u of t andrew brennan will be bringing us more throughout the day. Thanks for that. Andrew. >> Looking overseas, rocket sirens were heard across central israel, including in tel aviv today.

It was a high-scoring affair, with the teams tied at three apiece late in the game, before cincinnati scored in stoppage time to take the win. Tfc return to the field wednesday against philadelphia. >> I don't know how many garfield many -- movies there have been. But guess what everybody that's in the london theatres right now, richard crouse joins us. Richard, garfield thank we know the story. The stars the voice of a guess chris pratt, who I thank I just read that he wants to start a film with his wife kathleen kennedy or schwarzenegger. Kind [ Unintelligible ] which is not an actress but I want to act together. With anyways, enough about them, let's talk about garfield. >> With a family that acts to gather stays together maybe that's what he was thinking. Garfield is a big new computer-generated animated film starting [ Unintelligible ] of the comic strip for fifty-year. Like jim davis. Here's the thing though, it doesn't feel like a garfield movie even though it is gore -- called the garfield movie. The comic book character or the comic strip character that we've gotten to know is sardonic, is lazy, sleeps all day. Just kind of has this sort of breeze and attitude. Where, the one in the film, each lasagna, like the one in the comic strip. But other then that is completely different. They set him off on a big action-adventure. He is not sardonic, is not lazy, he's not sleeping all the time, so all of the things that have made garfield really pretty popular over the years have been taken out, and then replaced by what is essentially just a big generic action movie for kids. That happens to start garfield. Has some good voices and it's. Thank that 10 and 11 -year-olds we'll probably get a kick out of it. 's zips along the animation is all right. I don't think anyone older than that I.E. the parents will find much to enjoy here, but I think for smaller kids, on a sunday matinee, they might be entertained by it well enough. >> When I was again at the gum have told you the story before but when I was a kid on saturday morning, my parents would drop my brother and my sister myself off at the theatre, and we would watch the movie and they would go grocery shopping, and then when it was over, they would meet us back so if that's what parents can do. Is a different time not to leave the child in the theatre alone. And so england, it was different it was the sixties. Average, my husband started watching season two and he set a can't room the season one that's been so long ago. So with out of range you need to go back to the first season? Or is there a recap? >> What you should probably go back and have a look. I would imagine if you watch the last episode of the lost her to come flooding back if you haven't watched it yet but that's one of the things with the streaming shows, a sometimes, they disappear for really long time in between seasons. And that seems to be the case here without her range. It is set in wyoming, and it's kind of this weird mix of how western and science-fiction. So think of it as kind of like yellowstone, and west world, if they had a baby. It might look something like out of range. And it is in the second season, just as suspenseful as the first one. The story is becoming a bit more complicated, there's time travel and things that are happening here. But I think what makes the second season interesting is that they have really deepened the characters. To be get to know everybody in the first season, maybe over the wikipedia page. That's what you should do. So you get to know everybody in the first season, another we are back in season two, they characters, to me anyways, seem richer, and a bit more interesting. Sera bit more invested in what happens. >> Okay. 's before we go the jenks park to. Out of range has been a little while but the jenks part two has been a really long time since the jenks part one. >> It was something that were the captured people's imaginations. Find this on craig, and that's the story of robert durst, who was accused of killing his wife, his best friend, and his neighbour. And while they were making a documentary about him, they caught him on a life mike saying I killed them all of course. And he was convicted. And he has now passed away in prison. But, what they've done here as they have gone back to tell the story of the whole process of making that first documentary, and what happened he said well I killed them all of course. And it is kind of like the filmmakers turning the camera on themselves. But it's an interesting way to see the behind-the-scenes and that -- machinations of what happens when you capture a confession on tape like they did in part one. So I do thank it was could put

wouldn't because legal thank they expected apart to pure but it was called the jenks then, is called the [ Interjections ] part two now. It's on crave. >> Andria: you always have to be aware when there's a life mike. That's one thing I've learned in television. [ Unintelligible ] bell media as of ctv.

Bullet holes were found at bay as khan ca elementary school near dufferin and finch around 9:00 this morning. Police say at around 4:50am a vehicle pulled up in front of the school. >> And multiple people got out and began shooting. The building was damaged, but no injuries are reported. >> One of the questions that I'm sure people are asking is this is a hate crime. Is this a terrorist act? What I want to say, that's too early in the investigation to say whether it is or not. We're not getting, nor the obvious, you know, of what has occurred here and what the target the shooting was. >> But the same time, it would be wrong to to just guess at this point, we're going to win into this investigation with an open mind.

But guess what everybody that's in the london theatres right now, richard crouse joins us. Richard, garfield thank we know the story. The stars the voice of a guess chris pratt, who I thank I just read that he wants to start a film with his wife kathleen kennedy or schwarzenegger. Kind [ Unintelligible ] which is not an actress but I want to act together. With anyways, enough about them, let's talk about garfield. >> With a family that acts to gather stays together maybe that's what he was thinking. Garfield is a big new computer-generated animated film starting [ Unintelligible ] of the comic strip for fifty-year. Like jim davis. Here's the thing though, it doesn't feel like a garfield movie even though it is gore -- called the garfield movie. The comic book character or the comic strip character that we've gotten to know is sardonic, is lazy, sleeps all day. Just kind of has this sort of breeze and attitude. Where, the one in the film, each lasagna, like the one in the comic strip. But other then that is completely different. They set him off on a big action-adventure. He is not sardonic, is not lazy, he's not sleeping all the time, so all of the things that have made garfield really pretty popular over the years have been taken out, and then replaced by what is essentially just a big generic action movie for kids. That happens to start garfield. Has some good voices and it's. Thank that 10 and 11 -year-olds we'll probably get a kick out of it. 's zips along the animation is all right. I don't think anyone older than that I.E. the parents will find much to enjoy here, but I think for smaller kids, on a sunday matinee, they might be entertained by it well enough. >> When I was again at the gum have told you the story before but when I was a kid on saturday morning, my parents would drop my brother and my sister myself off at the theatre, and we would watch the movie and they would go grocery shopping, and then when it was over, they would meet us back so if that's what parents can do. Is a different time not to leave the child in the theatre alone. And so england, it was different it was the sixties. Average, my husband started watching season two and he set a can't room the season one that's been so long ago. So with out of range you need to go back to the first season? Or is there a recap? >> What you should probably go back and have a look. I would imagine if you watch the last episode of the lost her to come flooding back if you haven't watched it yet but that's one of the things with the streaming shows, a sometimes, they disappear for really long time in between seasons. And that seems to be the case here without her range. It is set in wyoming, and it's kind of this weird mix of how western and science-fiction. So think of it as kind of like yellowstone, and west world, if they had a baby. It might look something like out of range. And it is in the second season, just as suspenseful as the first one. The story is becoming a bit more complicated, there's time travel and things that are happening here. But I think what makes the second season interesting is that they have really deepened the characters. To be get to know everybody in the first season, maybe over the wikipedia page. That's what you should do. So you get to know everybody in the first season, another we are back in season two, they characters, to me anyways, seem richer, and a bit more interesting. Sera bit more invested in what happens. >> Okay. 's before we go the jenks park to. Out of range has been a little while but the jenks part two has been a really long time since the jenks part one. >> It was something that were the captured people's imaginations. Find this on craig, and that's the story of robert durst, who was accused of killing his wife, his best friend, and his neighbour. And while they were making a documentary about him, they caught him on a life mike saying I killed them all of course. And he was convicted. And he has now passed away in prison. But, what they've done here as they have gone back to tell the story of the whole process of making that first documentary, and what happened he said well I killed them all of course. And it is kind of like the filmmakers turning the camera on themselves. But it's an interesting way to see the behind-the-scenes and that -- machinations of what happens when you capture a confession on tape like they did in part one. So I do thank it was could put

wouldn't because legal thank they expected apart to pure but it was called the jenks then, is called the [ Interjections ] part two now. It's on crave. >> Andria: you always have to be aware when there's a life mike. That's one thing I've learned in television. [ Unintelligible ] bell media as of ctv.

But guess what everybody that's in the london theatres right now, richard crouse joins us. Richard, garfield thank we know the story. The stars the voice of a guess chris pratt, who I thank I just read that he wants to start a film with his wife kathleen kennedy or schwarzenegger. Kind [ Unintelligible ] which is not an actress but I want to act together. With anyways, enough about them, let's talk about garfield. >> With a family that acts to gather stays together maybe that's what he was thinking. Garfield is a big new computer-generated animated film starting [ Unintelligible ] of the comic strip for fifty-year. Like jim davis. Here's the thing though, it doesn't feel like a garfield movie even though it is gore -- called the garfield movie. The comic book character or the comic strip character that we've gotten to know is sardonic, is lazy, sleeps all day. Just kind of has this sort of breeze and attitude. Where, the one in the film, each lasagna, like the one in the comic strip. But other then that is completely different. They set him off on a big action-adventure. He is not sardonic, is not lazy, he's not sleeping all the time, so all of the things that have made garfield really pretty popular over the years have been taken out, and then replaced by what is essentially just a big generic action movie for kids. That happens to start garfield. Has some good voices and it's. Thank that 10 and 11 -year-olds we'll probably get a kick out of it. 's zips along the animation is all right. I don't think anyone older than that I.E. the parents will find much to enjoy here, but I think for smaller kids, on a sunday matinee, they might be entertained by it well enough. >> When I was again at the gum have told you the story before but when I was a kid on saturday morning, my parents would drop my brother and my sister myself off at the theatre, and we would watch the movie and they would go grocery shopping, and then when it was over, they would meet us back so if that's what parents can do. Is a different time not to leave the child in the theatre alone. And so england, it was different it was the sixties. Average, my husband started watching season two and he set a can't room the season one that's been so long ago. So with out of range you need to go back to the first season? Or is there a recap? >> What you should probably go back and have a look. I would imagine if you watch the last episode of the lost her to come flooding back if you haven't watched it yet but that's one of the things with the streaming shows, a sometimes, they disappear for really long time in between seasons. And that seems to be the case here without her range. It is set in wyoming, and it's kind of this weird mix of how western and science-fiction. So think of it as kind of like yellowstone, and west world, if they had a baby. It might look something like out of range. And it is in the second season, just as suspenseful as the first one. The story is becoming a bit more complicated, there's time travel and things that are happening here. But I think what makes the second season interesting is that they have really deepened the characters. To be get to know everybody in the first season, maybe over the wikipedia page. That's what you should do. So you get to know everybody in the first season, another we are back in season two, they characters, to me anyways, seem richer, and a bit more interesting. Sera bit more invested in what happens. >> Okay. 's before we go the jenks park to. Out of range has been a little while but the jenks part two has been a really long time since the jenks part one. >> It was something that were the captured people's imaginations. Find this on craig, and that's the story of robert durst, who was accused of killing his wife, his best friend, and his neighbour. And while they were making a documentary about him, they caught him on a life mike saying I killed them all of course. And he was convicted. And he has now passed away in prison. But, what they've done here as they have gone back to tell the story of the whole process of making that first documentary, and what happened he said well I killed them all of course. And it is kind of like the filmmakers turning the camera on themselves. But it's an interesting way to see the behind-the-scenes and that -- machinations of what happens when you capture a confession on tape like they did in part one. So I do thank it was could put

wouldn't because legal thank they expected apart to pure but it was called the jenks then, is called the [ Interjections ] part two now. It's on crave. >> Andria: you always have to be aware when there's a life mike. That's one thing I've learned in television. [ Unintelligible ] bell media as of ctv.

It was all detroit needed in the 2 one-way. David schneider was responsible for the jays only run a double in the 7th. The jays will look to split the four-game series tomorrow morning. And the canadians have been upset at the world hockey championship in prague. Switzerland getting the best of canada in the shootout, 3 to 2. This was signed, jumped out to a 2, nothing lead. Canada was able to tie things up, but ultimately cannot get it done. >> That's what's causing start to believe really. Lot of credit to the guys are sticking battling back. Comes down to that unfortunately, income on top. Obviously, I'm not the game. We all came here for about the same time to get

Of course that protest observe the u of t contest and those in the united states are to register solidarity with those who are in gaza, and the palestinians, as the war with israel continues, israel and hamas. And this morning as we turn to that story next, the graphic images and details are emerging from the southern gaza city of rafah, and an israeli air strike on a camp for displaced people has reportedly claimed more than 30 lives and sparked international outrage. >> Videos from the scene show ambulances racing to the site, intense fires burning and the scramble to pull survivors from the rubble. It's happened less than three days after the U.N. world court ordered israeli forces to abandon their rafah offensive. Now, sarah coates is track being the very latest out of tel aviv for us, and sarah, as I mentioned, there's plenty of anger over this air strike. I just want to bring in unindication of that from canada. Ndp leader jagmeet singh has joined the outcry. He has posted on social media this message. The world is failing the people of gaza. Canada is failing the people of gaza. We must do everything we can to stop this. So indicative of some of the feeling of what has happened, sarah, take us through what did in fact take place and more of the reactions. >> Good morning, heather. According to the hamas-run gaza health ministry and also doctors on the ground, this strike an israeli-designated safe zone in the northwestern part of rafah. Extremely disturbing images are coming through people pulling charred bodies of what appears to be a large container with people on the ground saying that this is where many displaced people were sheltering. Now, a paramedic has just come out to tell asp that this is one of the deadliest attacks since the beginning of the war. We've also heard from israel's military prosecutor who is describing this incident as very grave. The idf has come out to release the statement saying idf aircraft has struck a compound in which significant terrorists were operating, that the strikes were carried out against legitimate targets and international law through the use of precise munitions and on the basis of precise intelligence. Now, the military says it eliminated a hamas chief of staff officer a west bank, also another official from that area, with the idf acknowledging that several civilians have been injured, saying the incident is now under review. Now, the U.N. palestinian age aidsy unrwa has posted on x, we haven't established communications with our colleagues on the ground saying we are extremely concerned for their well-being. No place is safe, no one is safe. Also heard from the eu's of foreign policy chief joseph burrill calling on both sides to respect the ruling handed down by the international court of justice. >> This is really the limit. Housing international community can make -- implement a war. Force into -- international court ofs. >> So that word from josep borrell. Now, the air strike on this camp followed hours after hamas launched a big rocket attack on tel aviv whereby you are, first time there in months, and yet despite all of this renewed military action there's hopes that talks on a new cease-fire and hostage release may start again this week. What do we know about that right now? >> Certainly word of hope, heather, but really in saying that not much optimism. We do need recall that hamas wants comprehensive cease-fire. Israel says that that simply will not happen. We've also heard from the qataris. The qataris are of course a key mediator in the hostage negotiations coming out to say that this strike on rafah could hinder the potential negotiations which could kick off as you said this week. You also mentioned this large rocket attack on central israel yesterday. It was less than 24 hours ago, air raid sirens ringing out here in tel aviv for the first time in four months really causing a lot of panic, a lot of confusion right across the city. People ran to shelter. A lot of these missiles were intercepted by the iron dome missile defence system although one directly hit a home just north of where I am standing.

very important to mention that hamas has come out to claim this barrage of rockets and all of them did come from rafah, heather. >> Sarah, thank you so much. Sarah coates live from tel aviv this morning. >> In canada today, there are thousands of people from fort nelson and nearby fort nelson first nation who have the go-ahead to return home today. About 47 people had to flee their homes over two weeks ago after wildfires threaten their communities. Well, those orders are being lifted as of 8:00 A.M. local today and maryann is here with the count down for their return, good morning. >> Good morning, heather, yeah, a lot of residents have been counting down to the day that they could return back home. It's finally here later this morning but they are being told to be patient. Several essential workers were allowed in the community in the days leading up to this morning to make sure they could get things up and running afternoons as they can but residents returning home today are being told they have to be prepared, that means topping up things like fuel, making sure you return home with several details of food and other essentials you may need abuse it's going to take some time for your community to get back to normal. They haven't been home since may the 10th, when the evacuation orlando was put in place for the fort nelson and fort nelson first nation and many of those residents, 4700 of them or so went south to the community of fort saint john. When they return to their homes they will see damage there. In fort nelson, 10 properties were destroyed, include four homes that were completely damaged. In the area of the fort nelson first nation, no properties were damaged there because of the parker lake fire but some areas of cultural significance were destroyed in the area around snake river. So keep that in mind. Either way, residents are feeling optimistic including one woman who said the community will band together. >> A lot of people are going to have to do a lot of cleaning in their houses. I expect to find a lot of garbage, like, strewn about town from the bears. I've heard that the bears have been coming into town and going through everybody's garbage at night. I moved away for a couple of years and then I went back because the community is so strong together and I love going into the store and, like, talking to people, saying hello, passing by. I think everybody -- I feel like everybody's going to be in good spirits and happy to be ohome absee each other. >> Now, things like water, electricity, sewage, that's all back up and running. But if you have specialized health care needs, the advice from officials in fort nelson is maybe delay your return because right now any in patient emergency care is still being transferred out to areas outside of fort nelson. There's also going to be a reception centre there and also this hotline I should mention for anyone who may need help returning home, (250)775-0933 if you need that extra help. >> The people who do get go to go home and I think I said 4, I missed 4700, that's obviously a broader return than 47. But the evacuation order has ended but the evacuation alert continues, right? >> Yes, the evacuation alert essentially means that, yes, they are back home but they have to be ready to leave again at a moment's notice because the fires continue to burn. Not only the parker lake fire as you can see there but also the patrick creek wildfire nortel of fort nelson. That's bigger than the parker lake fire. It's been burning since 2023 and then there are other fires in the area. That's why they are getting home, they can start cleaning up but they can't get too comfortable. Here's the message from the mayor of fort nelson. >> We will be putting on an evacuation alert because there are still some fires out there, the conditions around the region are still extremely dry, and we'll need to be thinking about the potential for another fire over this long season that we've got coming. We're expecting thunder and lightning storms which of course can create their own fires, never mind the holdover fires that are out there. >> So in addition to overseeing the return of residents in fort nelson and the fort nelson first nation, also keeping an eye on those conditions which the bc wildfire service, heather, is saying there's volatile wildfire conditions. >> Listening there to that clip from mayor rob fraser, he's going to join us as he has often over the course of the story. We'll talk to him around 8:15 eastern, 5:15 local for the very latest on that return to fort nelson today. >> There's a new study out from montreal children's hospital that shows an average of one child a day in quebec goes to the emergency room, one child every day for drowning or near drowning during the summer. It's an alarming number, so alarming that the study's author is planning to release the study later in the fall say they needed to speak out now. >> Either we search or I find that number high. But as a parent, I found that number concerning. It's certainly high enough for me to be more vigilant with my own family. >> The researchers found that for every fatal drowning, ten

kids are hospitalized. The number one cause of drowning accidents, lack every supervision. Younger kids aged 1 to 4 were the most likely to drown in backyard pools. For older kids, the danger is more from open water, lakes and rivers. Quebec government requires all new backyard pools to be fenced in, but pools need before 2010, if they were built before that year, they were to be fenced in by october of 2025. >> As many as 120 million people in the united states remain under an extreme weather threat this morning, after a weekend of deadly storms. Officials say 18 people are dead across texas, oklahoma, arkansas and kentucky. Four children are among the dead. At least 11 tornadoes were spotted yesterday alone, one in texas over the weekend had winds hitting nearly 220 kilometers per hour. >> Grab my dog, we headed for there and it just -- it was just unbelievable the sound of all of the destruction going on around us. >> More than 640,000 homes and businesses across 13 states were reported without power as of late last night. Extreme heat forecast to today, which is a holiday in the u.s., could send the temperatures as high as 45° in houston and austin, texas. Steve storms are now forecast for U.S. east coast south from new england. >> A horrifying development in a disaster in papa new guinea. Authorities now say more than 2,000 people could be buried alive by a landslide that hit a remote mountain village in the south pacific nation last frit. Government officials have a dire warning about the rescue effort as well, saying few of those buried will likely be saved because damaged roads mean rescuers can't get happy equipment to the disaster zone. Some parts of the village runed as much as 8 meters every debris. Officials say so far only 6 bodies have been recovered. >> Another severe turbulence incident is under investigation this morning. 12 people were hurt, eight of them needing treatment in hospital after a qatar airlines flight dropped for more than 5 seconds on a flight to dublin. Yvette britain has the latest details. >> It was very scary. It was the worst experience, honestly. >> Shaken but safe. Qatar airways passengers on a flight from doha to dublin recall violent turbulence over turkey. >> We were on the plane, and we saw the flight attendants go up in the air and come stay right there back down. >> Panic, look of panic everywhere. >> Passengers say the plane seemed to drop suddenly during food and drink service, 12 injured,le taken to hospital, this only days after more than 100 single pour passenger passengers were injured after turbulence hit a flight to england over myanmar. One passenger with a heart condition died. >> It can happen very suddenly without any warning alberta all. >> The national transportation safety board says turbulence accounts for more than a third every accidents on airplanes and can cause severe injury. >> If you are not strapped in, there's a good chance you are going to get brain or upper spinal injuries. So while -- even though the seatbelt sign is off, while you are seated, keep that belt fastened. >> Singapore airlines changed safety rules after tuesday's turbulence to stop serving hot meals and drinks when the seatbelt sign is on. Researchers warn that air turbulence events are increasing and becoming more difficult to predict. >> I do think that we need to continually re-evaluate that in the face of the reality that these things are more frequent and more severe than before. >> In a statement to cbc, qatar airways said the boeing flight is now under internal investigation. Safety and security of their top priority. >> So, yeah, it was just atrocious. Never again. >> This man walked away with just torn clothes and questions how he plans to transfer next time. Yvette britain, cbc news, vancouver. >> There's a new call today for facebook to do more to crack down on scammers. A new brunswick woman is going public after her account was hacked and hijacked, and her friends targeted. As rosa marchitelli reports, if are are a fan of social media you should be vigilant because this scam is still making the rounds on line. >> We've stayed in touch through facebook and messenger, right, over the years. >> These former neighbours were reunited after being suckled into a facebook scam that's designed to play on the goodwill every friends. Here's what happened. A fraudster packed lisa laurie's account, pretending to be her they posted an ad claiming she

was selling her dad's things after he moved into long-term care. Several friends sent e transfer deposit losing thousands of dollars, including carol stevens. >> I thought it was my friend lisa. And she's the most honest, trustworthy person I know. >> Lisa and her friends repeatedly reported the crime in progress to facebook. But the company did nothing to stop it. >> They had a lot of people saying this is a scam and they didn't do anything about it. >> Last year, canadians lost a reported $174 million in social media scams, according to the canadian antifraud centre. And there's more. Go public found page after page of the same scam running rampant on facebook, same words, same photos. So we asked meta, the company behind facebook, why it's failing to remove a scam it already knows about. It didn't respond. >> As a result, what turns -- what starts as a small issue is exacerbated into a massive identity theft or identity fraud. >> Meta made about $185 billion in revenue last year. The cyber crime expert says it's time it invests more into protecting users. >> The organizations need to respond to people's actual needs. >> Posing as a customer, go public contacted several of the scammers. >> He wants 300 up front, okay? >> When we called one of them out and asked if facebook had ever shut them town, they didn't seem board. Meta says over 15,000 reviewers across the globe review potential violations on facebook and instagram and receive in-depth training. The two women say they've lost trust in social media but they are grateful to have someone they can trust back in their lives. >> We will not go so long before our next visit together. >> Rosa marchitelli, cbc news, calgary. >> Here's what else you should know as you start your monday morning.

Now bravery is our victory. - -[crowd cheers] >> Heather: starting this week, our last week of may with chris. And I don't know about you, but I woke to a big-time rumbling last tight, chris. >> Yes, indeed, there were storms coming up, even severe warm storms in southwestern ontario and down in the U.S. it was a very tumultuous and in some cases deadly weekend, thunderstorms with this cold front moving eastwards across the U.S. and our low pressure systems over the great lakes and let's zoom in here. We still have some lingering thunderstorms between kingston and pet bahama with a, another line here northeast of montreal, and we're going to get into multiple rounds every showers and thunderstorms today. So a pretty good breeding ground for this to occur. Humid air, round one, moving -- round one happening now, round 2 this afternoon and evening, and likely even a third round 2. So the heaviest amounts of rain and the best chance of thunderstorms today and tonight, because tomorrow will be a little more scattered in nature and cooling down too. So anywhere in orange means you've got a risk of severe weather. And the primary concern here, heavy downpours, damaging winds, especially this afternoon and evening, eastern ontario and southern quebec with those batch of storms and possibly some hail as well. And temperatures start to cool down. So a far cry from the upper 20's and humidity in the low 30's, temperatures will be in the upper teens, but at least some drier weather wednesday into thursday, quebec as well, montreal you will feel some of that cool down as well. But a couple of days of unsettled weather to be sure. A fair-weather for most of the maritimes today, just a misty foggy start. Lab, very mild, eastern newfoundland on the cool side but high pressure there. But that will give way to the storms moving from ontario and quebec today into the maritimes tomorrow. So it will be your turn to get into some thunderstorms. And if you are in the wreckhouse area or plan to travel tuesday night into wednesday, that might be a no-no. We have strong winds headed enroute. >> The weather update is brought to you by off cast mosquito forecast. Off, prevention is the best protection from mosquitoes. >>The Great Canadian Baking Showis back. >> And the winner is... >> Alan, no, it's too soon for that.

The victims include a 15-year-old and two others age 23 and 25. Cbc's reporter has more from montreal. >> Reporter: what police are essentially saying today is we know that it was about 15-16 people, who were part of this altercation. And the big piece of news that we have is that police are saying that it is not linked to gang violence. But that it is just a personal conflict between these people. But police are not really giving much more details than that. Which know this happened around 7:00 P.M. last night in montreal. But aside from that, they say they really are still investigating. They're trying to identify all the people who are at the scene. Trying to identify witnesses. Trying to get camera footage of the area. But they're still very much in the early stages of this investigation. And trying to figure out where to go from here. They say they have one or two suspects, but they say at this point, no one has been arrested. It's simply too early in the investigation. >> Natasha: cbc reporter in montreal. >>> The head of quebecor is calling on the federal government to intervene on the deal between loblaws. The owner says the deal would push the company out of loblaws stores. Cbc's janyce McGREGOR reports. >> Reporter: if you shopped in an loblaws-owned store, you may have seen the mobile shop kiosks. They're independent. They market themselves as not a affiliated with any telecom company. Saying they don't pick favorites. Saying they work for consumers in their promotional materials. As you say, they're located across canada. They are now accused by the head of quebecor of engaging in some behaviour to try to shutout certain carriers from those shops. Pierre carl palado's letter to industry minister champaign says he's become aware of a new deal that would see these stores in grocery stores only carry products from rogers and bell. They have worked together on a joint venture called glen tell. And in the future, it apparently will have a supply contract so that the mobile shop only includes their products and their services. We remember, of course, freedom mobile, the quebecor kind of brand of cell service, it has only been a part of video tron québec for the last year. It was previously part of shaw communications. Shaw had to divest, sell it off as part of its merger with rogers. The intent was for quebecor to run a forced national cell phone carrier. It made a equipment to keep prices low in western canada and ontario to expand its 5g infrastructure to give consumers more choice. But if they're going to be shutout of certain shops, palado's point is will that come to pass? The telecom shop tells cbc, it only accounts for 5% of the total sales of phones and cell phone plans in canada. It says because it has an only limited market presence, it doesn't think decisions it might make about, you know, its suppliers necessarily affects competition in the sector on a national scale. It says it does continue to offer a range of options to its customers. But, you know, the concern here is that that range has shrunk with this new deal. >> Natasha: so in palado's's letter he's directing the minister champaign. What actions could the federal government take? >> Reporter: what are the minister's powers and limitations? He was stopped on his way into the liberal's national caucus meeting on parliament hill this morning and here's what he had to say. >> That's a question for the competition bureau. A letter should be addressed to the competition bureau and as you know we give them the powers to fully conduct the ministry investigation. >> Reporter: are you saying you have no power? >> It's the competition that has the power. >> Reporter: it's impacted because the minister does not direct the investigations that the competition bureau might choose to undertake. It's possible -- >> Natasha: we're going to interrupt janyce and take you to london, england, where the

british prime minister is making an announcement. >> As I stand as your prime minister, I can't help to reflect my first proper introduction was over fours ago. I sat behind one of the podiums upstairs in the building. I told you we face a generation-defining moment and we as a society would not be judged as government action but the small acts of kindness we show one another. You met that challenge and then some. I have never been prouder to be british. When I introduced the following scheme, I did so not because I saw a country simply in need of desperate help. Albeit, we were. But because I saw a country whose future hung in the balance. I could be bold and trust in the tens of millions of you at home you could rise to the movement or accept the inevitable millions of job losses and pick up the pieces. In truth, it was no choice at all. I have never and will never leave the people of this country to face the darkest of days alone. And you know that because you've seen it. I will do everything in my power to provide you with the strongest possible protection I can. That is my promise to you. Because for so many of us, it's easy to forget the scale of what we've been through. We were hit by a pandemic that upended normal life. Who would have thought the government would tell us how many times a day we could leave our homes? Just as we were recovering from covid, war returned to europe with putin's war on ukraine sent your energy fills skyrocketing. I came to office to restore economic stability, the bedrock of future success. Whether that is rising wages and good jobs, investment in our public services, or the defence of the country. And because of our collective sacrifice and your hard work, we have reached two major milestones in delivering that stability. Showing that when we work together, anything is possible. Our economy is now growing faster than anyone predicted, out pacing germany, france and U.S. and this morning, it was confirmed inflation is back to normal. This means the pressure on prices is relieved and mortgage rates will come down. This is proof that the plan and priorities I set out are working. I recognise that it's not always been easy. Some of you will only just be starting to feel the benefits. For some, it might still be hard when you look at your bank balance. But this hard-earned economic stability was only ever meant to be the beginning. The question now is how and who do you trust to turn that foundation into a secure future for you, your family, and our country? Now, it's a moment for britain to choose its future. To decide whether we want to build on the progress we've made oris can going back to square one with no plan and no certainty. Earlier today, I spoke with his majesty the king to request the dissolution of parliament. The king granted this request and we will have the general election on the 4th of july. This election will take place at a time when the world is more dangerous than it has been since the end of the cold war. Putin's russia is waging a brutal war in ukraine and will not stop there if he succeeds. That war made it too clear the risk to our energy security. In the middle east, the forces of extremism threaten regional and ultimately global stability. These tensions are ex-employeded by extremist who seek to undermine our values and define our society at home. China is looking to dominate the 21st century by stealing a lead in technology. And migration is being weaponized by hostile states to threaten the integrity of our borders. These uncertain times, call for a clear plan. And bold action to chart a course to a secure future. You must choose in this election who has that plan. Who is prepared to take the bold action necessary to secure a better future for our country and our children. Now I cannot and will not play the we have got everything right. No government should. But I am proud of what we've achieved together. The bold actions we have taken, the confidence about what we can do in the future. We've tackled inflation, controlled debt, cut workers' taxes, and increased state pension by 900 pounds. We've reduced taxes on investments and seized the opportunity for brexit to make this the best country in the world to grow a business. But record amounts of funding into our N.H.S. ensure it's training the doctors and nurses it needs to the decades to come. We've reformed education in our

children and are now the best readers in the western world. We prioritized energy security and family finances over environmental dogma in our approach to net-zero. We fully funded increase in defence spending to 2.5% of G.D.P. we made a decision to invest more in local transport so you use rather than endlessly pile more money into H.S. 2. We set out a plan to reform welfare system to make it fair for those who pay for it and those who need it. Immigration, is finally coming down. We're stopping the boats with our rwanda partnership. And we will ensure that the next generation grows up smoke-free. I hope that my work since I became prime minister shows we have a plan and are prepared to take bold action necessary for our countries to flourish. I stopped with that plan and always been honest with you about what is needed even when that has been difficult because I'm guided by doing what is right for our country, not what is easy. I can't say the same thing for the labour party. Because I don't know what they offer. In truth, I don't think you know either. That's because they have no plan. There is no bold action. And as a result, a future can only be uncertain with them. On the 5th of july -- or I will be prime minister. He has shown time and again he will take the easy way out and do anything to get power. If he was happy to abandon all the promises he made once he became leader once you got the job, how do you know he won't do the same thing if he were to become prime minister? If you don't have the conviction to stick to anything you say, if you don't have the courage to tell people what you want to do, and if you don't have a plan, how can you possibly be trusted to lead our country, especially at this most uncertain of times? Over the next few weeks, I will fight for every vote. I will earn your trust, and I will prove to you that only a conservative government, led by me, will not put our hard-earned economic stability at risk. Can restore pride and confidence in our country. And with a clear plan and bold action, will deliver a secure future for you, your family, and our united kingdom. >> Natasha: okay. Folks, we've been taking you live to a rainy london. And that was british prime minister rishi sunak confirming what many of us were keeping he would say. There's going to be a general election in the U.K. an election day is going to be on july 4th. Let's bring in cbc's julia chapman, who was watching alongside at our london bureau. Julia, it's such a british scene powering down on the prime minister. And very punk rock. I don't know if it was a coincidence or someone was trying to drown him out. A huge mood-setter. Tell us what we should anticipate. >> Reporter: it's the news we were anticipating. It's against the backdrop of protesters. Rishi sunak confirms there will be a U.K. general election on july 4th. He's taken the decision to go early when it comes to calling this election. He had a few more months until he would have been forced to do so. Five years into this parliament. So there is certainly now a big campaign gaining momentum in the next six weeks as rishi sunak tries to paint the conservative party as the party of stability and he pointed to some of what he sees as the party's achievements over the last few years. Indeed, the conservative party has been in power for 14 years. He's the fifth prime minister during that time to run the united kingdom. He talked about the furlough scheme that he oversaw when he was a chancellor, the country's finance minister, during the covid period. How it helped people who were out of work to stay afloat. He pointed to his policy of trying to phase out smoking, a policy moving through parliament and will have to be rushed through in order to be approved before this election. Polls put him 20 points behind the labour party. He took aim at labour. Saying he doesn't know what the party stands for and he doesn't think the electorate does either.

The investigators aren't going to jump to any conclusions. At the same time we're not going to ignore the obvious. >> Roger: toronto police are investigating after shots were fired at a jewish elementary school. >> Along the wall. Steel. Suter with a shot. Scores! Deflected in front! >> Roger: california, edmonton, game two of the western final. Who won? We will tell you. You're watching ctv news channel. I'm roger petersen, thank you very much for joining us. Aid trucks have begun to enter gaza via southern israel, it's part of a new agreement. It was closed when israeli forces seized the palestinian size earlier this month. Egypt had refused to reopen its side until control of the gazan side was handed back to the palestinians. Under U.S. and israeli pressure, it agreed to redirect traffic through the main cargo terminal. It's unclear if humanitarian groups will be able to access the aid because of fighting in the air. >>> A frightening incident has toronto police looking at a possible hate crime or even worse. Shots were fired at a jewish elementary school. Sean leathong with details. >> Reporter: a single bullet hole marks the window of the bais chaya mushka school for girls. Police confirming multiple shots were fired at the building early this morning. Suspects arrived at the school in a vehicle, a dark-coloured vehicle. They exited the vehicle and opened fire at the school causing some damage to the front of the school. >> Reporter: according to police the shooting happened just before 5 this morning. The school is located on crestwood drive surrounded by businesses. Police spent the day going through security footage. >> You will see an increased presence not only in this neighbourhood. >> Reporter: police will not call the shooting a hate crime and say they will enter the investigation with an open mind. >> The investigation will tell us what occurred here. That's why we have hate crime involved in this investigation. We're not ignoring the obvious. >> Reporter: premier doug ford writing on ""x"" this is a gross display of anti-semitism. Every student deserves to feel safe at school. If you have any information, contact toronto police. These cowards need to be found and brought to justice. >> Reporter: reaction from the jewish centre has been swift with a statement coming from the centre for israel and jewish affairs saying we demand justice. We demand swift action. The fact a school was targeted regardless of whether kids were present or not represents a worrying escalation in the violence jewish canadians have been experiencing and from friends of simon wiesenthal, which reads in part, it's time for leaders to stop with the sympathetic words and take the actions necessary to confront the escalating hatred plaguing our communities. Jews in this country will not hide in fear in the face of this brazen cowardly act. Police say they are stepping up their visibility within the community. >> The community will see officers at other schools, high visibility at synagogues, to ensure that the public understands that community safety is number one for us. >> Reporter: police have not said how many suspects they're looking for. Sean leathong, ctv news, toronto. >> Roger: a possible showdown brewing for tomorrow at the pro palestinian encampment at the university of toronto. The demonstrators have been ordered to leave. They say they aren't going anywhere. Ctv's rahim ladhani has the story. >> Reporter: more than 170 tents continue to occupy the green space at kings college circle at the university of toronto. Pro palestinian demonstrators vowing to stay put despite being delivered trespass notices. >> To us it is shocking that u of t would rather call the police than stop investing in weapons and bombs. >> Reporter: the heightened situation can escalate further with police enforcement on monday. Toronto's mayor says she won't be involved with that decision. >> It's not up to the mayor to tell the police what to do. There's a law to enforce. It's up to the university of toronto and police and there is a very important point to make. >> Reporter: the university has given those in the encampment a new deadline and an offer. They have until 8 monday morning to vacate. If not, the notice says necessary legal steps will be taken. The university is also inviting students to present their demands to u of t's governing board of council and former working group and consider

options. >> Reporter: the administration has not agreed to allow us to appoint people to this committee. We can make recommendations under the current proposal. Recommendations need to be approved by the president. He has final say. >> The offer makes clear that the university will not end partnerships with israeli schools. Encampment organizers describe it as an inadequate ultimatum prompting demonstrators to take further action. >> A group of students have begun an indefinite hunger strike. We will continuing in the university stops aligning itself with war criminals. We won't eat. >> Reporter: the two sides will have an opportunity to find common ground when they meet again for talks on sunday at a p.m. >> There is an ongoing genocide. We are asking for u of t to commit to meeting our demands now. We have been here for 22 days. We are here now.

Ctv's olivia o'malley has more. >> Reporter: robots are rolling around the caq convention. Social media and A.I. are topics of discussion with its eye on the future of quebec. The party says it's concerned about youth and technology. [ Speaking French ] >> Reporter: premier francois legault says platforms such as instagram and TikTok are nothing less than virtual pushers. He's offering to hold a transpartisan committee to study the effects of screens on the health and development of young people. This comes after parti quebecois leader paul st. Pierre plamondon has been calling on the network to ban certain actions for young people. The caq says studying the issue will hopefully help parents with young children. >> We don't want to substitute their role. We want to help them deal with this situation seems to be worrying a lot of parents. As you saw earlier today, a lot of youth as well. The youth today were the ones most vocal about this issue. That was impressive to me actually. >> Reporter: the heart of the debate was the caq youth links proposal to set the minimum age for accessing social media platforms to 16 years old. When it came to the debate, the proposal was watered down. In the end, legault made his offer to the opposition leaders. The government has banned cell phones in class, education minister says the commission will help him see if they should be banned further. >> I'm looking forward to this commission helping me and helping us to have a better comprehension on this particular issue. >> Reporter: caq MNAs say the commission will be formed by 2025 at the latest which could potentially bring changes. Legault says the party will continue to make for the next generation. Olivia o'malley, ctv news. >> Roger: there were rallies in cities and towns across alberta yesterday to send a message to the provincial government. >> Enough of the lies, the deception, the gaslighting. >> A lot of the decisions the ucp and people inside the party are supporting have nothing to do with science or evidence or expertise. It's all fear and pandering. >> Roger: 500 people gathered outside calgary city hall commanding transparency and accountability. Some of the major issues including the alberta pension plan and attacks on education and healthcare. In a statement, the ucp's shane getson says the party supports albertans' rights to peaceful protest. >> Police are investigating and searching after a small plane went down near squamish bc.

It is coordinating with police and the bc coroner's service. >> The death toll from that massive landslide in papua new guinea is now more than 670.

>>> The U.N. says the updated death toll follows the discovery of 100 homes buried in the debris on top of the 60 they knew had been buried. Local officials put the death toll at 100. It soared. Over 5 bodies have been recovered. The national government may ask for more international assistance. According to officials renewed heavy rains triggered flash floods in afghanistan. At least 15 people are dead there including two parents ands their 8 children in the northeast of the country. The unusually heavy seasonal rains have been wreaking havoc on all parts of the country killing hundreds of people and destroying property and crops.

We're having trouble controlling those numbers whether it's through not enough testing, barriers to access to testing or to care. >> Reporter: researchers say a rise in substance use, lack of awareness and stigma also play a role in transmission. >> The most devastating effect of syphilis in adults is congenital syphilis from the mother to the fetus. Transmission that could result in miscarriage or developmental issues to the baby. Congenital cases jumped 600% from 2018 to 2022. An alarming surge considering provinces like manitoba went decades recording a single case.

>> We didn't see syphilis for decades. And so there's a lot of physicians and healthcare providers who don't know what congenital syphilis looks like. It's important to educate them. >> Known itself the great imitator, syphilis can look like other infections and sometimes show no symptoms at all.

Aid trucks have begun to enter gaza via southern israel under a new agreement to bypass the rafah crossing. It was closed when israeli forces seized the palestinian side earlier this month. Egypt refused to reopen its side until control of the gazan side was handed back to the palestinians. Under U.S. and israeli pressure, it agreed to divert traffic through gaza's main cargo terminal. It's unclear if humanitarian groups will be able to access the aid because of fighting in the area. A frightening incident has toronto police looking at a possible hate crime or even worse. Shots were fired at a jewish elementary school yesterday. Sean leathong with the details. >> Reporter: a single bullet hole marks the window of the bais chaya mushka school for girls.
