A tough year for clean hydrogen prospects is giving way to more optimism on projects and demand, writes Pamela Machado

The clean hydrogen sector still lacks tangible progress and final investment decisions (FIDs) for projects remain few and far between, but it is reaching a moment of reckoning essential for market maturity, delegates at the World Hydrogen Summit in Rotterdam said this month.

When asked whether they were more or less positive than a year ago, industry participants gave diverging answers, but there was widespread agreement that progress on clean hydrogen has been slower than expected in what one called ""the year of doldrums"". Increasing material and financing costs, the unstable geopolitical situation and a lack of clarity on regulatory frameworks are just some of the challenges developers have faced.

This is a ""grim environment if you were expecting the Swiss army knife approach"" to work, industry body the Australia Hydrogen Council chief executive Fiona Simon said, alluding to the misguided expectation that hydrogen could be used across all sectors to help decarbonise. ""We are coming to terms"" with the real use and appropriate applications of hydrogen, Simon said, pointing to green steel production. ""We are converging on the same concepts and same policies.""

The industry has reached the point where it is becoming a lot clearer which projects will actually materialise. A greater sense of realism is underpinning discussions, according to Dutch gas company Gasunie chief executive Willemien Terpstra. But delegates widely urged more policy action, especially on the demand side. Spurring on demand will be key to getting to more FIDs, Spanish utility Iberdrola's hydrogen development director, Jorge Palomar Herrero, said. ""We can have great intentions and great projects but without the demand they are not going to happen."" Even in Europe, which has pushed ahead with efforts to stimulate demand, these have not been enough to spur offtake, Herrero said.

Demand-side incentives alone will likely not be enough and eventually there will have to be consumption obligations too, some said. ""Carrots"" may help to reduce project costs and kick-start production, but ""sticks"" will be key, delegates heard. Consumption mandates could accelerate momentum in emerging markets that have big ambitions for exports to future demand centres, World Bank private-sector arm IFC energy chief investment officer Ignacio de Calonje said.

Governments are now ready to act on these requests, according to Brussels-based industry body the Hydrogen Council's director for policy and partnerships, Daria Nochevnik.

ST. PETERSBURG, May 24. /TASS/. The Arbitration Court of St. Petersburg and the Leningrad Region has upheld Gazprom Export's claim against the Czech Republic's CEZ banning it from continuing foreign arbitration proceedings, a TASS correspondent reported from the courtroom.

In case of violation of the ban, the court ruled to recover 57.7 mln euro from the Czech company in favor of Gazprom Export.

""The Arbitration Court of the city of St. Petersburg and the Leningrad Region determined: to prohibit the company CEZ a. s. from continuing proceedings at the International Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce <...>. In case CEZ a. s. fails to comply with the ruling of the court on this case <...> an award in favor of Gazprom Export LLC [in the amount of] 57,734,000 euros in rubles at the rate of the Bank of Russia will be paid by the company CEZ a. s.,"" the judge said.

Earlier, Gazprom Export demanded that CEZ be prohibited from continuing arbitration proceedings at the International Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce in Geneva, and that it be fined if CEZ failed to comply with the judicial act.

It was reported in February 2023 that the Czech energy company CEZ (70% of shares owned by the state) had initiated an arbitration worth $45 mln against Gazprom Export due to a gas shortfall in 2022.

Earlier Gazprom filed claims in the Russian court against German traders Uniper Global Commodities SE and Meta-Methanhandel GmbH, Austria's OMV Exploration & Production GmbH, Czech company NET4GAS, Naftogaz of Ukraine, the Dutch gas transport Gasunie Transport Service, the operator of the BBL gas pipeline between the UK and the Netherlands, Slovakia's ZSE Energia and the Polish-Russian company Europol GAZ, which owns the Polish section of the Yamal-Europe gas pipeline, demanding a ban on continuing arbitration proceedings in foreign courts. The Russian company won all its claims to ban the continuation of legal proceedings abroad.

The memorandum was signed on the sidelines of the ongoing World Hydrogen Summit in Rotterdam, Netherlands.

President Nangolo Mbumba revealed this during his keynote address on Tuesday.

Mbumba said the memorandum includes Namibia's green hydrogen programme, the Western Cape Development Agency (Wesgro), the Trade and Investment Promotion Agency (NCEDA), and Gasunie, the Netherlands' leading hydrogen backbone developer.

""This partnership aims to study the feasibility of building Africa's first cross-country green hydrogen pipeline, connecting Namibia and South Africa, and facilitating significant trade of a new product between our two countries,"" Mbumba said.

According to Mbumba, Namibia, like many African countries, views the 21st century as a potentially transformative era for the continent.

""In this era, we can utilise new, greener, and cleaner technologies to leapfrog towards industrialisation and subsequent economic transformation.

""This will enable us to create jobs, significantly reduce poverty, and build inclusive, peaceful, and stable societies that will give rise to genuine and lasting progress,"" he said.

He also said that the government, through the Green Hydrogen Council, has worked tirelessly over the past few years to position Namibia as the primary leader in the global green hydrogen market.

""We are now starting to see concrete, visible results.

Namibia hosts nine hydrogen projects across two developing hydrogen valleys,"" he said.

Mbumba told the delegates that green hydrogen offers opportunities beyond clean molecule production; it holds the potential to anchor new industries in emerging markets worldwide.

Namibia, he explained, has always desired to become an indispensable logistics hub for the Southern African region.

""To enhance this ambition, we are now developing an ammonia bunkering hub and a green hydrogen-powered train to decarbonise shipping and long-haul logistics routes. This will ensure that goods and commodities transported via our port infrastructure minimise scope two and scope three emissions.

""This will not only increase the competitiveness of Walvis Bay and Luderitz as harbours of choice for critical exporters and importers, but we believe it will also increase the competitiveness of our regional goods and augment the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), thereby boosting intra-African trade in the process,"" he said.

Namibia currently hosts nine hydrogen projects across two burgeoning hydrogen valleys, with potential for a third linked to its iron ore sector, while South Africa boasts its own extensive national green hydrogen program.

Namibia aims to establish itself as a logistics hub for Southern Africa through initiatives like an ammonia bunkering hub and a green hydrogen-powered train. This announcement was made at the World Hydrogen Forum in the Netherlands, where Namibia also showcased its inaugural exhibition at the World Hydrogen Summit, featuring the Daures Green Hydrogen Village.

Namibia is using this platform to provide updates on all its projects and emerging shared infrastructure in its hydrogen valleys, including plans for a 2,500-kilometer cross-border pipeline from Luderitz to Saldanha.

The partnership between Namibia and South Africa involves the Western Cape Development Agency (Wesgro) and the Northern Cape Economic Development, Trade, and Investment Promotion Agency (NCEDA) from South Africa, alongside Gasunie, a prominent Dutch hydrogen infrastructure developer.

ST. PETERSBURG, May 22. /TASS/. The Arbitration Court of St. Petersburg and the Leningrad Region upheld Gazprom Export's claim against Austria's OMV Gas Marketing & Trading GmbH banning it from continuing foreign arbitration proceedings, a TASS correspondent reported from the courtroom.

The court ruled that the Austrian company will have to pay Gazprom Export if it violates the ban.

""The Arbitration Court of the city of St. Petersburg and the Leningrad Region determined: to prohibit the company OMF Gas Marketing and Trading GmbH from continuing arbitration proceedings at the Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce <...>.

Earlier, Gazprom Export demanded that OMV Gas Marketing & Trading GmbH be prohibited from continuing arbitration proceedings at the Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce and that it be fined if it failed to comply with the judicial act.

Gazprom Export's lawyer insisted in court that because of sanctions, the company can not get proper legal representation and justice abroad. In particular, a number of EU law firms refused to work with Russian companies, and an agreement on streamlining the issuance of visas was also canceled. Nevertheless, the OMV representative claimed that no personal sanctions had been imposed against Gazprom Export, and the Austrian company proposed - within the same arbitration court - to transfer the hearings to other jurisdictions (including Dubai or Istanbul), but did not receive any response.

OMV Gas Marketing & Trading GmbH is a subsidiary of Austria's OMV AG. In June 2018, an agreement was signed to extend the existing contract between Gazprom Export LLC and OMV Gas Marketing & Trading GmbH to supply Russian natural gas to Austria until 2040. Previously, the contract was signed through 2028.

Our participation in this auspicious event is thus another chapter in this exciting story of friendship and collaboration.

Namibia, like many African countries, views the 21st century as a potentially transformative era for the continent, in which we can utilise new, greener and cleaner technologies to leapfrog towards industrialisation and subsequent economic transformation. This will enable us to create jobs, greatly reduce poverty and build inclusive, peaceful and stable societies that will give rise to genuine and lasting progress.

In this regard, the Namibian government, together with national and international stakeholders, is spearheading efforts to unlock the massive potential of green hydrogen. Over the past few years, the government, through the Green Hydrogen Council, has worked tirelessly to position Namibia as the primary leader in the global market for green hydrogen, and we are now starting to see concrete visible results.

In the Namibian context, green hydrogen is the brainchild of my predecessor, the late Dr Hage Geingob, the third president of the Republic of Namibia, who recognised in early 2021 the catalytic role the sector can play in reconstructing the Namibian economy.

Today I stand before you all to pay tribute to his great vision, which reminds me of the old Greek proverb which states ""blessed are those who plant trees whose shade they would never sit under"".

President Geingob was one such visionary who planted a tree whose shade he would never sit under, but which would transform the lives of millions of people and turn their dreams of prosperity into reality.

As a result of his tireless efforts, today Namibia hosts 9 hydrogen projects, across two developing hydrogen valleys, with the potential for a third valley to be anchored by its abundant iron ore potential.

I am informed that Namibia is hosting its inaugural exhibition right here at the World Hydrogen Summit, alongside a dedicated space reserved by our own Daures Green Hydrogen Village. At this pavilion, we shall be providing key status updates of all said projects and emerging common use infrastructure in our hydrogen valleys.

Green hydrogen offers opportunities beyond just clean molecule production, it holds the potential to anchor new industries in emerging markets across the globe. Namibia has always harboured a desire to become an indispensable logistics hub to the southern African region.

To enhance this ambition, we are now developing an ammonia-bunkering hub and a green hydrogen-powered train to decarbonise shipping and long-haul logistics routes, ensuring that goods and commodities transported via our port infrastructure minimises both scope two and scope three emissions.

This will not only increase the competitiveness of Walvis Bay and Lüderitz as harbours of choice for key exporters and importers, but we believe it will increase the competitiveness of our regional goods, augment the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), thereby boosting intra-African trade in the process.

Our newly developed green industrialisation blueprint further illustrates how green hydrogen can be used to add value to minerals sourced from within our borders and indeed the continent.

In Namibia, we plan to produce green direct reduced iron, a key low-carbon ingredient that promises to decarbonise the steel industry, which according to the international energy agency contributes to more than 8% of global emissions.

My final point is that green hydrogen promises to buttress our relations at the regional and international levels. Later today, Namibia's green hydrogen programme will sign a memorandum of understanding with the Western Cape Development Agency (Wesgro), their counterparts from the Northern Cape, the Northern Cape Economic Development, Trade and Investment Promotion Agency (NCEDA) and Gasunie, The Netherland's leading hydrogen backbone developer.

This partnership aims to study the feasibility of building Africa's first cross country green hydrogen pipeline, connecting Namibia and South Africa and facilitating significant trade of a new product between our two countries.

At this juncture, allow me to extend an invitation to all to join Namibia and the rest of Africa, as we look to host the African Global Green Hydrogen Summit between the third and fifth of September this year.

At that event, we shall look to not only showcase what Namibia has delivered in terms of our green hydrogen ecosystem, but also the efforts of our peer nations on the continent.

Furthermore, we shall zero in on key policy interventions needed to give birth to a burgeoning sector and also showcase key financial models and tools needed to close the gap between the price of grey and green molecules.

Lastly, we shall organise targeted tours to Namibia's projects, showcasing constructed infrastructure producing hydrogen, synthetic fuels, fertilisers and reduced iron to illustrate the practical applications of a hydrogen economy. This is an opportunity Namibia cannot afford to miss!

As I conclude, let me state that I am honoured to have been given this opportunity to address you, and most of all, to finish a most inspiring journey that my brother, president Geingob, started. While thanking the organisers of this wonderful World Hydrogen Summit for arranging this event, let me encourage all participants to take full advantage of this opportune occasion to cultivate greater growth, inclusive development and cooperation in the hydrogen sector.

We are glad to be part of this grand and exciting occasion and I wish you all fruitful discussions and a successful World Hydrogen Summit.

Bettina Schneider

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Bilfinger's First Quarter 2024 Webcast. My name is Bettina Schneider, and I'm here together with Thomas Schulz, our Group CEO; and Matti Jakel, our Group CFO. Thank you for joining us so early today, so we can inform you on our Q1 numbers before we start our Annual General Meeting at 10 a.m. We start now with the presentations. Afterwards, you will have the opportunity to ask your questions via phone or via chat in the webcast.

I'd like to inform you that all participants are in a listen-only mode and that the conference call is being recorded. With this, I hand over to Thomas.

Thomas Schulz

Good morning, everybody. Let us start directly with our highlights for the quarter 1, 2024 for our Bilfinger Group. We had an orders received with EUR 1.144 million and a book-to-bill of 1.05. So, the quarter regarding the order intake was as we expected and normalized because last year, we had a book-to-bill of 1.3, an extraordinary high growth in the quarter 1, 2023. Our revenue was up organically 3% and the real highlight, we more or less doubled the margin to 4% on the EBITA. Our cash flow, another very positive news was positive and actually made a swing close to EUR 60 million from minus EUR 26 million to plus EUR 24 million.

We keep, of course, our outlook with EUR 4.5 billion to EUR 4.8 billion on revenue and 4.9% to 5.2% on EBITA. We see the market situation stable to positive across all regions and all sectors. Our earnings per share went up to EUR 0.66 from EUR 0.18 and we have a Capital Market Day on the 12th of June during the Achema to give more information, especially about the acquisition stock, the progress on our strategy and cash flow. If we then go to a very important issue and parameter for us as Bilfinger, it's part of the ESG range. It's about safety. And you see on the right side on the top, the TRIF and as lower the figure is as better it is.

And you can see that our organization actually improved from last year to this year down to 0.76. More significant improvement, we have actually on the LTIF, Lost Time Injury Frequency rate. And that is down to a fantastic 0.06. Of course, our target is to have both figures, both KPIs on 0, but it shows we as Bilfinger at wherever we are to our partners a very safe environment. Out of that into the market. I said at the highlights, it's a stable to positive market.

We are acting mainly in 4 main industry groups; energy, chemical and petrochem, pharma, biopharma, oil and gas. All over positive. Let us start with the energy. There are big investments going on. We see, especially in North America and in the Middle East for the future, huge growth rates and a very stable and ongoing good investment level, not in the same high percentage figures in Europe. If we then go to the chemical and the petrochem industry, which makes roughly 30% of our top line, the chemical industry globally actually grows more than the whole global industry on earth, but we have, of course, regional differences.

Europe is on a fairly low level when we see U.S. market growing roughly twice and the Middle East up to 5x faster than we have in Europe. That puts our customers, especially in the chemical industry, very much under pressure here in Europe, which opens for us a lot of additional work. Then we come to a growth sector. It's pharma, biopharma, roughly 10% of our top line. There you see that we have 8% growth for the next few years in that market.

It's very profitable. It's a high-tech area. It's an area where we as Bilfinger have very strong customer relations, good business to be in. Last but not least, oil and gas. Oil and gas for several years now has a revival same as nuclear as an energy.

And in oil and gas, the spend on exploration, which actually is important to see how the growth in that area will go on for the next 5 to 10 years is around 5%, and that is very positive. We have a lot of positive figures in that area, too. So overall, in the markets where we are acting, stable to positive and in the way how customers order to industrial service providers like us, Bilfinger, it looks quite good. Out of that, we would like to talk about our order intake and the level of demand. Because of the fact that we are acting across a lot of industries and 80% of our business is more or less the same no matter which industry we are in, we implemented a few quarters ago the so-called opportunity pipeline. It is indexed to the first or to the January 2022.

And it shows the level, monetary level, what we can bid on, what is available in the market. When you look on the right side, you see the 3 blue sticks and it shows an increasing trend throughout the first quarter on a significant higher level than we had in quarter 1 last year or at the beginning of that opportunity pipeline KPI. Below, you have the orders received. It looks, of course, with minus 17%, not that positive. But last year, with close to EUR 1.4 billion with a book-to-bill over 1.3% was an extraordinary quarter, which actually is not good in the way as we do our business because it's about providing people to the sites. And if we have too much orders at the same time, we have to talk with a lot of customers to even that out over a longer period of time.

This quarter is EUR 1.144 billion. It is a book-to-bill of 1.05. This is what we call a normalized positive quarter. The other highlight in it is that we actually reduced the percentage of projects within the order intake, which is in line with our derisking and our standardization efforts out of the strategy. Our order backlog is more or less the same as we had it in quarter 1, 2023.Out of the demand into selected orders to explain what we are really doing in the different areas and regions and industries.

First example is with Gasunie in the Netherlands. It's about a 10 years engineering frame agreement, what we got as Bilfinger, especially regarding the energy transition with hydrogen transport as well as CO2 carbon capture and storage and transport. The second one shows our strong position within the Middle East. It's about Saudi Electricity Company in Saudi Arabia, of course. It is about another side where we do the comprehensive maintenance services on steam turbine generators and critical boilers.

This is out of a very long-term partnership where we support Saudi Electricity Company to provide all over in that strong growth country energy. The last example is out of adjacent industries. It's about the semiconductor manufacturers. This time here in Germany. It's about that we deliver design, fabrication and installation for ultrapure water and wastewater treatment.

This is, of course, important for the semiconductor manufacturer and it's important that it's not only efficient, it has to follow a high-tech request regarding ultrapure water content. Out of that, I would like to go to innovation. Innovation for industrial service provider, especially in the field of digitalization and more and more artificial intelligence is utmost important for us to show our customers that we are leading efficiency improvement in all areas. This time, it's about the so-called product carbon footprint calculation. It offers significant savings for the client on an existing plant or new-to-build plants where we are able to calculate more or less unlimited scenarios with different components to give to the client the scenario with the lowest CO2 footprint in the material, what is built in on a site or will be built in on a site. That, of course, gives the client the possibility to optimize the CO2 footprint to optimize the material that they use and having a good step ahead in their target for a lot of customers, 2030 to be carbon neutral with [Scope 3] issues, too. Out of that, I would like to go to Matti, our CFO.

Matti Jakel

Thanks, Thomas. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us this early. Revenue grew by 3% to EUR 1.09 billion. The planned reduction of our U.S. revenues equates to about 2%. Hence, the overall business grew by 5% in total, which is in line with our overall guidance. EBITA margin almost doubled from 2.1% in quarter 1, 2023 to 4%, which is a very good start and quite supportive of our 2024 guidance. The largest improvement we see in E&M International, where the margin improved by 540 basis points. Gross profit for the group, gross profit margin improved from 9.5% to 10.3% or 80 basis points. SG&A costs reduced by EUR 5 million, a consequence of our efficiency program and the SG&A ratio consequently improved from 7.4% to 6.7%, again, an improvement of 70 basis points.

In total, we are seeing savings of around EUR 11 million from the efficiency program, both in SG&A expenses, but also some of, in the cost of sales. The EBITA margin improvement translates into an earnings per share of EUR 0.66 for the first quarter compared to EUR 0.18 in quarter 1, 2023, that is more than tripling in absolute terms. The financial result remained stable while lower tax rate helped the improvement. On another note, as you know, we have the Annual General Meeting today, and we are proposing a dividend for the financial year of 2023 of EUR 1.80 per share, which is a payout ratio of 58%, close to the upper range border of our financial policy and the dividend yield on the year-end share price equates to 5.2%. Another positive news on the first quarter is our free cash flow. Year-over-year, the free cash flow improved by EUR 50 million from minus EUR 26 million to plus EUR 24 million, largely a consequence of the increased earnings.

The special items shown here at the bottom right corner of minus EUR 8 million is mainly due to the payouts from the efficiency programs as we have announced it early on. The net trade assets to revenue ratio went up a notch to 11%. That's a key indicator that we are monitoring very closely.Net liquidity. Since January 1, net liquidity decreased by EUR 26 million from EUR 120 million to EUR 94 million. Two sort of major events happened in the first quarter.

One is the stock acquisition where we paid the purchase price in March of EUR 29 million and we also repaid the bond in March, EUR 250 million, which was offset by the corresponding reduction in securities and other investments. As part of our financial policy, we are aiming to receive investment-grade rating. Quite a long time ago, Bilfinger set its financing target to -- for FFO to net debt to larger than 30% and the net debt-to-EBITDA ratio to 2.5% -- 2.5, sorry. In the first quarter, we took a look at these ratios. We reviewed and revised these ratios to 50% and 2.0, thus moderating our risk profile.

This change still leaves ample headroom for organic and inorganic growth as well as distributions to shareholders. And in combination with our solid performance, Standard & Poor's just issued a research report and they provided Bilfinger with a positive outlook, indicating that there is -- we're getting a lot closer to receiving investment grade. Let's take a quick look into the operations into the segments. E&M Europe, the order intake has normalized after the exceptional quarter 1, 2023. With a book-to-bill of 1.10, we are well underway to continue our profitable growth path. Revenue grew organically at 4% across all the regions and the revenue split remains largely the same by contracts and by industries.

EBITA margin went up by 120 basis points from 3.3% to 4.5%, with effects from derisking and efficiency program driving this improvement. The largest improvement in the profitability is what we have seen in E&M International. But let's take a look at the order intake in the first place. Again, order intake went down from EUR 241 million to EUR 156 million by design. It's much lower due to the successful repositioning in part of our U.S.

business, where we're exiting the installation business and we're focusing on maintenance activities. The revenue decline was much smaller at minus 4%, indicating a reduced revenue volatility, which again helps the de-risking. EBITA went up from minus EUR 6 million to plus EUR 3 million, now marking the third profitable quarter in a row. And lastly, Segment Technologies. Order intake went down from EUR 182 million to EUR 160 million. You may remember that we had a large portion of orders received on the Hinkley Point nuclear power plant project in the first quarter 2023, which just didn't repeat this year, not unexpectedly.

Revenue grew slightly by 1% from EUR 167 million to EUR 170 million, so very steady as planned. And the EBITA margin at 4.2% remained almost unchanged compared to the prior quarter or prior year quarter. That's it for a quick rundown of the numbers. Back to Thomas.

Thomas Schulz

Thanks a lot, Matti. So let's look into the outlook for 2024. Of course, we don't change that. But you see here, revenue, EBITA, free cash flow and on the first left column, how we finalized the year 2023, and that was close to EUR 4.5 billion on the revenue. Our guidance for this year is EUR 4.5 billion to EUR 4.8 billion.

Our EBITA margin last year was 4.3%. Our guidance for this year is 4.9% to 5.2%, and cash flow guidance is on the EUR 100 million to EUR 140 million, coming from EUR 122 million in the year before. So, when we compare now year-to-date and of course, for quarter 1, that's the quarter 1 figure, these are the quarter 1 figures. You see that we have an improvement in the revenue to EUR 1.088 billion. We have more or less a doubling of the EBITA margin from 2.1% to 4.0%, and we have quite a good development, very positive development in the free cash flow generation. In these figures is, of course, the acquisition of Stork, what we closed on the 1st of April, that means at the beginning of the second quarter, not included.

So we give here a short glimpse on that, what we acquired, but you will get significant more information on the Capital Market Day on the 12th of June in Frankfurt during the Achema exhibition. The facts are we actually acquired with that M&A 2,700 highly qualified professionals. And I can tell you, with all the meetings what we had after the closing, very positive mood of our new colleagues, and we are very happy to have them onboard. The annual revenue, what we expect is around EUR 530 million and it's mainly the Netherlands, Belgium and partly, Germany. The service portfolio, what we take over is in the middle part, in the middle box, and you see it's actually quite complementary. And it helps us to set up, especially Belgium and the Netherlands in a similar way as we are already positioned in Germany.

The additional services, what we get in Germany actually is quite a nice complement to that what we actually offer to our clients already. So, it's complementary. It is an additional growth of knowledge, expertise and good behaving, compliant and motivated workforce in the time of shortage of labor of competent labor, and it gives us a definite increased opportunity to be the solution partner of choice in the industry. Out of that, the highlights. And before I go on that, a big thank you to all our colleagues around the world, making that good quarter possible. We had an orders received over EUR 1.1 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.05.

We had a revenue close to EUR 1.1 billion with an organic growth of 3%. We had more or less a doubling of EBITA margin to 4%. Our free cash flow actually came in quite a positive territory with plus EUR 24 million. Outlook is confirmed, market situation is stable to positive. Earnings per share, quite significant, up to EUR 0.66 and Capital Market Day, where you are all invited to and hopefully, participating on the 12th of June. Thanks a lot.

Back to Bettina.

Question-and-Answer Session

A - Bettina Schneider

Ladies and gentlemen, you can now ask your questions via chat in the webcast or alternatively via phone by pressing star and 1 on your keypad. If you would like to withdraw your question, please press star and 2 on your phone. Once again, star and 1 on your keypad to register your question. The first question comes from Gregor Kuglitsch, UBS.

Gregor Kuglitsch

So, I guess I really have a couple of questions. So firstly, on your margin performance, I mean, obviously very strong in quarter 1, 200 basis points up. Usually, obviously, was a little bit of, I guess, how let's say, aggressive you want to be in booking margins early in the year to suggest to me things are going quite well. So I want to understand, I guess, what happens. So, what sort of explains this big jump?

And I guess I don't want to push you, but obviously, why you not sort of tempted to up the guidance a bit given that you're kind of trending up 200 basis points there in the first quarter? Secondly, regarding Stork, you gave us a little bit of a glimpse that things are looking good and I appreciate we'll get more in June. But can you give us a sense sort of your first impressions having owned the business now for 6 weeks or so, what you think the potential is on that EUR 500 million of revenues? Where was the profit in the end last year? And kind of what do you think is the potential perhaps we'll get more of that in June. But if you could just give us a bit of a preview.

Matti Jakel

Thanks, Gregor. This is Matti. I'll start with the margin performance and Thomas will respond to the Stork questions. I can tell you that we have not been aggressive at all in realizing margins in the first quarter. This is what the business generated as a normal course of business.

I think it's more to look into last year, the first quarter where we had a number of write-downs on what we call bad project or bad contracts, which didn't happen this year, which is a testament of the derisking that we have implemented last year and it's continuing. So, it's a margin that we would expect for the future going forward. Plus also, we're seeing really the improvements from the efficiency program, as I said, both in the SG&A but also part of the contribution margin in the operations. I think your second question in relation to this is why not taking the guidance up on the positive first quarter. I just believe it's way too early to do this in the first place. Second, we have the Stork acquisition that we need to look into.

And once we have a full view of the Stork acquisition plus the second quarter, then it's really time to take a look into the guidance, but not before. So we're quite happy with the first quarter, I have to say, really happy with the first quarter. I have colleagues here who have worked in Bilfinger for more than 2 decades. And one of them said, well, this is the best first quarter here as seen in 20 years. I did not go to the extreme to really review all the numbers of the last 20 first quarters, but it really shows that this is a successful first quarter.

Thomas Schulz

And it's definitely in the right way to achieve 6% to 7%. And when we have that, then we really celebrate. Gregor, the question regarding Stork. We have it from a little bit more than a month. Of course, we turn each stone.

It was a main competitor what we take over -- took over. So information were detailed, but of course, in some other areas than limited. We didn't see any real negative surprise. The profitability is as we see in line with that. As we communicated before, around 2.3% to 2.5% and the mood of the people when from day 1 on was unbelievable positive.

And of course, expectation that they have a strategy that they have a normal way to go on and not in and out and having all the negative news around them for years in the media that all comes with it and we will deliver that. They are part of our strategy. The integration will be latest done after 12 months. The colleagues, receiving the new colleagues in the new structure and the functional organization are very happy too. We actually created with that M&A not only a good business outlook for us and growth potential and more than 2,500 new good colleagues. It's actually quite a positive movement into the Bilfinger Group too because it's one of the largest acquisitions, if not the largest, for the last few years, and that is in itself positive.

Bettina Schneider

Thank you, Gregor. To remind you, please press star and 1 on your keypad to register question. You're also invited to write your question into the webcast and I would read it out loud. Last chance. I know it's early and a lot of you have parallel meetings.

So, now still time to register. Yes, there is another question from Gregor. The line is open, Gregor.

Gregor Kuglitsch

Well, it looks like I'm only person asking a question. So, I'll ask on the U.S. business. So, you kind of flagged it's doing a lot better. Can you give us a bit of a sense where we are in the turnaround or the sort of repositioning of that business kind of potential for that organization?

I don't really know how to size it, if I'm honest. Could you just remind us how big that business is? What you're doing with it? What do you think you can go to?

Thomas Schulz

Gregor, we will give, of course, on the Capital Markets Day, significant more detailed information. And we have quite a lot of few hours together. And then it is easier to explain the whole size and the potential there. Fact is, as you saw it yesterday with Mr. Biden undersigning, actually, the import duties raise 4x higher, not only for Chinese importers, actually for global importers.

At the same -- with that, he actually protects his investment. So, the North American market is in our industry, in the processing industry, a hell of a good growth area. It's a compliant market. It's one currency, one legal setup and a motivational political environment, what we have. No matter if you look to the Democrats or to the Republicans where we all have opinions about. Then when we look into our business, we, Matti and myself and the whole management team decided to make the brutal turnaround case, what we started in September 2022 for the U.S. business and we took roughly half of the business out in that what we call our core business and cutting off the critical project business there. That is all done. We are through with more or less all the activities there in that direction. From now on its organic growth and M&A growth. And that is what we started already last year and the result is that we are on a lower level of revenue already provided a significant better EBITA.

So, from a potential point of view, we don't see any other profitability level than you have in regular segment and regions within the Bilfinger Group in the future. That's our expectation. If it comes to growth, it has, of course, to grow more than the whole group because we have a long way to go to be big in that country and M&A is quite high on the list for North America. So, I hope that explains a little. Thank you.

Next question comes from Craig Abbott, Kepler Cheuvreux.

Craig Abbott

I have one question on E&M Europe and one on technology space. On E&M Europe, I mean, you made clear that, look, I mean, overall, the spending environment on the side of your customers is generally quite positive and supportive. You showed us some charts also with the prospective pipeline. And I just wanted to maybe get a little more granularity there. On E&M Europe, you also mentioned in your earlier comments in general, we all know your greenfield spend is not being -- or investment is not being made in Europe, but rather in North America and the Middle East and other areas. But you said, of course, that your -- for instance, your chemical customers are having to, of course, invest to increase productivity and so forth.

So, I just wondered if you could give us a little bit more color on the current spending environment by your customers in E&M Europe. And how that maybe compares to, say, as you're heading into the year? And then I'll ask my question on technologies.

Thomas Schulz

Yes. If you look into -- at first, quite a good question. The -- when you look into our main work is actually on existing assets of clients. That's our main work. And our main work is what a lot of media and politicians would call old technology.

But there, we see together with our clients by far the highest potential for improvement in efficiency and with that and sustainability. So if you take -- let's take the industry in Europe, which is the most under pressure versus our business, it's the chemical industry in Germany. There is a lot of activity and investments to outsource more of the noncore business, what they have in their portfolio. They focus on producing their products, everything around maintenance, service, education of people more and more they try to outsource. So, despite the fact that the industry actually has a significant lower production level from 84 down to 77, we have quite a good environment to go. And we have a lot of discussions with customers what to do more.

They are very open for innovation, very open for new ways of doing service together with them out of the fact that they are all under pressure. So from that point of view, we see Europe as a significant good engine and base business for us. Greenfield spend in Europe is, of course, lower than in North America, and North America is significantly lower than the Middle East. But you have to look to the installed base, what you have. And we clearly see the installed base in the Middle East is fairly small.

They have a long way to go to get close to U.S. and at all to Europe, but growth for especially new build greenfield is quite good there. But in U.S., too, because when they invest in sustainability, they do it big. They don't do like in Europe based on bureaucracy, 20 different small pilots because they are not getting the allowance to build a bigger one. In U.S., they immediately build a bigger one. In U.S., they actually reactivate nuclear power plants, what we have in our home country here, what politicians say it's not possible, of course, it's possible.

So you ask, when they do something, they go big and we want to participate in that. And that's predominantly then in the greenfield area. Regarding sustainability and going into aging assets in North America in the process industry, where we, as building up from Europe have a very, very good name because -- and then I'm done here. Sustainability, technical sustainability improvement is a big seller out of Europe worldwide. Thank you.

Craig Abbott

Yes, on technology side, just hear as well, I just wondered if you could maybe provide a little bit more color on how your project pipeline is developing there for the coming quarters?

Thomas Schulz

Actually, it looks good, but it looks more even out over the whole year and you will see more and more that the amount of what we called or what we had before as projects with quite a lot of unique elements in the contracts. We standardize more actually together with clients to have more kind of a product sale in that segment too. As an example, when we produce [SCITs] for the any processing industry, it doesn't matter which one. And we produce 15 or 20 of them. Then, of course, the 15th, the 16th, the 17th are exactly the same, exact the same.

Commercial conditions, risk conditions, financing conditions, the same people, and that kind of standardization is in technology, very much demanded from our clients and very much pushed from us too because it makes it faster, less risky for the clients and of course, with that more cost efficient. So, out of that pipeline looks good for technology. We are in quite positive mood regarding all the investments, what we see in the SMR, smaller nuclear power plants like in Romania or in Poland. We are quite positive in the bigger nuclear power plants like in France and other areas in Europe and North America and Middle East. We are positive in the big investments regarding life science because there's huge growth still in. You saw the figure plus 8% for the next few years, what we see as growth, and we are a big part of that, too.

So, technology is a good business to be in.

Bettina Schneider

In a recent study, a group of Turkish researchers have computed models suggesting that hydrogen storage can store renewable energy at large scales and relatively low costs.

For example, their model suggests that if Germany expanded its use of hydrogen storage at renewable energy plants nationwide, this would result in roughly 60 percent lower costs than the nation's current energy systems. The results were published earlier this year in IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management.

""We strongly believe the green hydrogen can be a game-changer once optimal scales are achieved."" -- Denizhan Guven, Instanbul Technical University, Turkey

Renewable energy sources like wind and solar are key to a sustainable future, yet supply from these sources can fluctuate depending on environmental conditions. As a result, there's a need to be able to efficiently store any excess energy while production is high, which could be used later on when wind or solar conditions are less favorable and production is low.

One viable option is through hydrogen storage, which involves compressing the element into tanks, cooling it to form a liquid, binding it with metals, storing it in chemical compounds, or adsorbing it onto materials like activated carbon.

""Each method has its pros and cons, with factors like safety, efficiency, and practicality influencing their use in various applications,"" explains, Zeynep Bektas, an Assistant Professor at Kadir Has University, in Turkey.

Bektas and her colleagues were interested to explore how well various forms of energy storage compare to one another at large scales. They had a panel of experts score six different energy storage methods -- including hydrogen storage, compressed air, and four different battery types (lithium ion, sodium sulfur, vanadium redox, lead acid) -- finding hydrogen storage to be the most suitable for grid-scale operations.

The researchers then created models to explore the impact of integrating hydrogen storage at large scales. For the first case study, they used data from one of the first power plants designed to combine renewable energy and on-site hydrogen storage, established in Germany by one of the country's renewable energy producers, Enertrag, in 2011. The researchers' simulations revealed that scaling up hydrogen tech across Germany could cut the nation's energy costs by nearly two thirds.

Bektas and her colleagues also modeled hydrogen storage in the Netherlands using data from one the nation's energy network operators, Gasunie, whose network includes renewable energy, natural gas, and hydrogen storage. Bektas's group's model suggested that hydrogen storage would lead to an estimated 58 percent reduction in energy costs for the country.

Denizhan Guven, a research assistant at Istanbul Technical University, in Turkey, one of the study's co-authors, says the environmental impact of hydrogen usage is notable, too. Total life-cycle emissions of green hydrogen, he says, represents about 1 kilogram of carbon dioxide per kg of H, while one kilogram of petroleum yields some 10.16 kg of CO.

""These numbers demonstrate a substantial difference in carbon emissions between green hydrogen and petrol, with green hydrogen being significantly cleaner,"" he says, adding, ""We strongly believe the green hydrogen can be a game-changer once optimal scales are achieved.""

On the other hand, the researchers note, hydrogen is of course highly flammable and must be stored under high pressure conditions. These limitations make it challenging and costly today to safely manage and store hydrogen.

However, Bektas says the price of hydrogen storage will go down as it is more widely adopted on large scales, and this is where the cost-savings identified in the study would come from. Notably, what they are proposing is a renewable energy system integrated with hydrogen storage, rather than a system that relies purely on hydrogen.

""Because green hydrogen is clean... versatile, and compatible with energy transition, it is one of the most promising energy storage technologies for the coming decades,"" she says.",spectrum.ieee.org,news,"IEEE Spectrum: Technology, Engineering, and Science News",,0.411764705882353,453564067,1,https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/green-and-white-cylinders-with-h2-written-on-them-with-large-white-windmills-in-background.jpg?id=52252344&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C312%2C0%2C313,eng-9573365

To enhance this ambition, President Nangolo Mbumba said Namibia is now developing an ammonia bunkering hub and a green hydrogen-powered train to decarbonise shipping and long-haul logistics routes.

This, the President noted, would ensure goods and commodities transported via the local port infrastructure minimise harmful emissions.

""Green hydrogen offers opportunities beyond just clean molecule production. It holds the potential to anchor new industries in emerging markets across the globe,"" said Mbumba while delivering his keynote address on Tuesday at the World Hydrogen 2024 Summit and Exhibition in Rotterdam, Netherlands.

The event is considered the largest and most high-profile global hydrogen event.

He continued that this development will not only increase the competitiveness of Walvis Bay and Lüderitz as harbours of choice for key exporters and importers, but also the competitiveness of Namibia's regional goods.

It will further augment the African Continental Free Trade Area, thereby boosting intra-African trade in the process.

""Namibia sees the 21st century as a transformative era for Africa, utilising greener technologies for industrialisation, economic transformation, job-creation, poverty

reduction and inclusive societies,"" he added.

Africa's first

Furthermore, Mbumba stated that Namibia penned agreements aimed at exploring the feasibility of building Africa's first cross-country green hydrogen pipeline. This pipeline would connect Namibia and South Africa, and

facilitate significant trade in new products between the two countries.

Namibia's vast renewable resources offer a unique opportunity to transition to net zero emissions, boost industrialisation, achieve energy security and contribute to the global climate challenge through affordable, clean energy. ""Green hydrogen promises to buttress our relations at the regional and international levels. The Namibian government, together with national and international stakeholders, is spearheading efforts to unlock the massive potential of green hydrogen,"" said the President.

The agreement was signed by the Namibia green hydrogen programme with the Western Cape Development Agency (Wesgro), their counterparts from the Northern Cape Economic Development, Trade and Investment

Promotion Agency (NCEDA), and Gasunie, the Netherlands' leading hydrogen backbone developer.

Mines and energy minister Tom Alweendo also told the global audience in the Netherlands that it is critical to work in concert with regional neighbours to deliver a new global gateway that creates modern trade and low-carbon industrial opportunities. ""These are to place the region at the centre of a rapidly-greening world. The Trans-Caprivi and Trans-Kalahari railway lines are good examples of cross-country infrastructure that require careful planning with our neighbours,"" he said.

He further stressed that large-scale green hydrogen projects will allow the production of low-carbon goods such as green iron and ammonia. Excess electrons from these projects, Alweendo said, can be exported to neighbours, alleviating regional energy insecurity. To do this, there is a need to prioritise transmission lines into the southern African power pool. Namibian officials estimate that the successful execution of the green industrialisation blueprint could unlock more than nine times the national stock of foreign direct investment between now and 2040. This holds the potential to create more than a quarter-million jobs, while abating more than 75 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide.",neweralive.na,news,New Era Live,,0.1764705882352942,453550711,1,https://neweralive.na/storage/images/2024/may-2024/hub-1.gif,eng-9572523

Comments from President and CEO Åsa Bergman:

""A positive start to the year

Sweco delivered a good first quarter. Net sales increased 8 per cent and EBITA improved 16 per cent, adjusted for the significant negative calendar effect from Easter.

The improvement was mainly driven by continued positive momentum in pricing as well as strong demand within the green transition in energy, transportation, industry and urban development. We are also seeing increasing demand in growth segments such as pharma, defence and data centres. Sweco's strong market position is reflected in a growing order backlog.

Overall, the demand for Sweco's services was favourable in most segments, although demand in residential and commercial buildings, as well as traditional industry, remained weaker.

A solid quarter with operational improvements

Net sales increased to SEK 7,720 million (7,140), with an organic growth of 4 per cent, adjusted for calendar. Nominally, EBITA decreased to SEK 793 million (849) and the margin to 10.3 per cent (11.9), both driven by the large negative calendar effect. Adjusted for calendar effects, EBITA increased 16 per cent or SEK 139 million.

The EBITA improvement was mainly driven by higher average fees, a growing number of employees and contribution from acquisitions, while higher personnel expenses and a lower billing ratio impacted negatively.

Six out of eight business areas reported positive organic growth and EBITA improvements. Sweco Belgium, Denmark and Sweden all reported good organic growth and EBITA improvements, with double-digit margins. Germany and Central Europe continued to improve operational performance with strong organic growth and an increasing EBITA and margin. Finland improved its margin in the quarter, partly driven by the previously communicated redundancy program, and is also taking further improvement actions. The Netherlands reported higher EBITA levels. The weaker performance in Norway is explained by the calendar effect from the early Easter holiday.

The repositioning of Sweco's UK business is progressing and the performance improved significantly compared to the previous quarter. As part of the turnaround, the UK is making further personnel reductions in the first half of 2024.

Projects and acquisitions

The projects won in the first quarter highlight Sweco's multi-disciplinary role in the green transition. In the Netherlands, Sweco won a SEK 1,100 million contract to support energy operator Gasunie in the development of new energy infrastructure for the transportation of hydrogen, carbon dioxide, renewable gas and heat. In Belgium, Sweco has been commissioned to design an open-access rail terminal in Zeebrugge's back port and in Germany, Sweco will support the City of Bremen in the expansion of its public transportation. In Norway, we will provide architectural design to support a sustainable uplift of an urban area in Oslo.

In early January we closed the first acquisition this year - Econsultancy. With their team of 200 environmental experts, we are strengthening Sweco's position and offering, both in the Netherlands and across Europe within ecological and environmental services.

Priorities going forward

Our focus ahead is clear: to capture growth opportunities in the market and deliver continued profitable growth, with improved margins. This requires investments in attractive segments in combination with firm measures to optimise our offering and efficiency. The actions we are taking in the UK, the adjustments of staffing in Finland, Norway and Sweden, and the ongoing organisational review to streamline our operations in all business areas are designed to drive efficiency. A lean, efficient and client-centric organisation has always been and will continue to be our recipe for success.""

PosHYdon aims to produce green hydrogen on an operational gas platform in the Dutch North Sea. It will be the first time that three offshore energy systems will be integrated and hydrogen is transported to land together with gas via an existing pipeline.

The pilot is essential for the development of large-scale production of green hydrogen at sea and, thus, for the energy transition in the Netherlands and Northwest Europe. After this testing period onshore, the electrolyser will be transferred offshore to the Q13a-A platform, 13 kilometres off the coast of Scheveningen (The Hague). First offshore hydrogen production is planned for Q4 this year.

René Peters, business director Gas Technologies TNO and initiator of the North Sea Energy Programme says: 'PosHYdon is a perfect example of system integration in the North Sea. In many studies, hydrogen is considered the missing link in the energy transition, with many talking about all the opportunities. But here, right off the coast of Scheveningen, it will actually take place later this year. PosHYdon is teaching us a lot about the next steps that need to be taken towards safe, large-scale green hydrogen production from wind at sea.'

'Offshore green hydrogen production will enable large-scale wind farms to be developed far out at sea. Wind energy is directly converted to green hydrogen from demineralised seawater and can be transported through the existing or new gas infrastructure,' adds Peters. 'As a result, offshore wind projects can be realised faster at significantly lower costs for society. I am therefore very happy that we can now test the complete installation onshore, in preparation for transferring it offshore for the final test: offshore green hydrogen production.'

In addition, PosHYdon will also participate in a pilot for Guarantees of Origin for green hydrogen and the upcoming migration towards European hydrogen certification. This pilot, also open to others, is being planned via HyXchange. Neptune Energy (Eni) participated before in the HyXchange certification pilot in 2022.

In the PosHYdon project, a significant number of lessons are being learned about the offshore production of green hydrogen. This makes the project essential for a smooth roll-out towards large-scale production, as envisaged with the Esbjerg ambitions for 2050.

PosHYdon seeks to validate the integration of three energy systems in the Dutch North Sea: offshore wind, offshore gas and offshore hydrogen and will involve the installation of hydrogen-producing plant on the Neptune Energy (Eni)-operated Q13a-A platform. This platform was the first fully green electrified platform in the Dutch North Sea.

The green hydrogen will be blended with the gas and transported to the coast via the existing gas pipeline. To this end, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy has increased the blending specifications from 0.02 per cent to 0.5 per cent hydrogen. The 1 MW electrolyser will follow the wind profile of the Luchterduinen wind farm.

The PosHYdon pilot kicked off the onshore test successfully at the premises of InVesta, one of the partenrs in the project, in Dutch city of Alkmaar.

In the PosHYdon project, three offshore energy systems - offshore wind, offshore gas and offshore hydrogen - will be integrated for the first time to transport hydrogen to land together with gas via an existing pipeline.

The pilot is essential for the development of large-scale production of green hydrogen at sea and thus for the energy transition in the Netherlands and Northwest Europe.

After the testing period onshore, the electrolyzer will be transferred offshore to Neptune Energy's Q13a-A platform, 13 kilometers off the coast of Scheveningen, in the Hague. The first offshore hydrogen production is planned for the fourth quarter this year.

To remind, Eni and its majority-owned Vår Energi have completed the acquisition of Neptune Energy back in February 2024. Eni is in charge of Neptune Energy's Dutch assets.

""PosHYdon is a perfect example of system integration in the North Sea. In many studies, hydrogen is considered the missing link in the energy transition, with many talking about all the opportunities. But here, right off the coast of Scheveningen, it will actually take place later this year.

""Offshore green hydrogen production will enable large-scale wind farms to be developed far out at sea.

""Wind energy is directly converted to green hydrogen from demineralized seawater and can be transported through the existing or new gas infrastructure. As a result, offshore wind projects can be realized faster at significantly lower costs for society,"" said René Peters, Business Director Gas Technologies TNO and initiator of the North Sea Energy Program.

In addition, PosHYdon will also participate in a pilot for Guarantees of Origin for green hydrogen and the upcoming migration towards European hydrogen certification. This pilot, also open to others, is being planned via HyXchange. Neptune Energy (Eni) participated before in the HyXchange certification pilot in 2022.
